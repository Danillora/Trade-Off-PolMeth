Abstract = {Why do autocratic regimes have sometimes a weak reaction to terrorism,
   and conversely why do democratic regimes sometimes react harshly? More
   generally, what are the determinants of governments' reaction to
   terrorism? And, what are the determinants of terrorism and of its
   dynamic? In the last years, there have been many empirical studies
   conducted on these questions. We believe, however, that a general
   theoretical model is missing, which would significantly help empirical
   research and its interpretation. This paper is a first attempt towards
   the construction of such a general model. In this model, individual
   human capital, government responsiveness and economic development are
   seen as potential factors influencing individual choice to use terrorism
   as a political strategy. In this paper, we elaborate a strategic model
   of terrorism with a specific focus on domestic terrorism, in which the
   individual choice of joining a terrorist organization is a way of
   pursing specific political aims. This decision is in turn influenced by
   the interaction between terrorist' activity, political engagement and
   government policies. We are able to prove that three different political
   regimes form the equilibrium outcomes, and that there is not a simple
   monotonic relationship between a regime accountability and terrorism'
   repression. It is then also perfectly possible for a democratic regime
   to harshly repress terrorism and for an autocratic polity to be tolerant
   on terrorism.},

Title = {Political Cycles in Military Deployment},
Journal = {PEACE ECONOMICS PEACE SCIENCE AND PUBLIC POLICY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {23},
Number = {4, SI},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The determinants of military deployment have been extensively discussed
   in the literature. Empirical studies indicate that, next to the
   international security arena, also domestic socio-economic variables
   play an important role. For example, wealth and size of the supplying
   nation tend to positively influence the number of military troops being
   deployed. The present study contributes to this literature by focusing
   on a set of political variables, i.e. the effect of upcoming elections
   as well as the composition of government. For a cross-sectional
   time-series of 34 democratic countries, covering the period from 1990
   until 2014, we run a linear (fixed effects) panel regression model
   correcting for a first order autoregressive disturbance term as well as
   linear dynamic models with diverse corrections. When studying deployment
   at country level, we find a negative and significant impact of elections
   on the number of troops deployed, meaning that a country deploys fewer
   troops close to elections. As for government composition, we observe
   that rather central administrations deploy substantially fewer troops
   than right-or left-wing governments.},

Volume = {47},
Number = {4},

Abstract = {Justice Jackson's concurring opinion in the Youngstown steel seizure
   case is seen as a rejection of unlimited presidential power and a
   suggestion that presidents should, when possible, act with Congress
   rather than unilaterally. However, his famous tripartite framework can
   be exploited. After 9/11, both the Bush and Obama administrations
   claimed statutory authorization when none existed in order to lend
   legitimacy to what were in fact unilateral actions and/or found ways
   around constitutional limits. In most cases, Congress and the courts
   failed to set meaningful limits on executive power. The result is that
   national security power has increasingly been concentrated in the hands
   of the president, cloaked by the dubious claim that presidents are
   acting pursuant to statutory authority. Congress and the courts can and
   should give meaning to Jackson's tripartite framework by rejecting
   implausible claims that executive branch action is supported by
   statutory authority and by applying constitutional limits to joint
   action by the elected branches. This would restore meaning to the
   tripartite framework as an effective tool to define and set limits on
   executive power.},

   in which social protection policies and programmes have taken shape.
   Both countries have adopted a universalist, rights-based vision in their
   approaches to social protection, with social pensions and child benefits
   at the forefront of social protection programming. At the same time,
   both countries are employing incremental strategies to overcome
   political, social, and administrative obstacles, while demonstrating
   that fiscal space is available. The politics of social protection policy
   making are obvious, and consistent engagement by progressive social
   policy advocates in these countries will be necessary to seize
   opportunities, and to ensure continued investment in building inclusive,
   effective, and accountable social protection systems.},

Abstract = {Drawing on the sizable literature on polarization in the American
   public, we consider the link between discussion network composition and
   perceptions of polarization. Participants in the 2008-2009 ANES panel
   study were asked to complete an innovative battery; they interactively
   moved histograms to rate other groups' positions on several prominent
   issues. These novel exercises provide data on individuals' projections
   of the average attitudes of others, but critically, they also provide
   data on the variability of such attitudes. Thus, we use these
   ``response-distributions{''} to thoroughly assess (1) the relationship
   between network characteristics and perceptions of the distance between
   party opinions, and (2) the relationship between network characteristics
   and perceptions of the homogeneity of opinions within parties. We find
   evidence that discussion networks track with individual perceptions of
   the parties in the electorate: exposure to interpersonal disagreement
   predicts the perception of less distance between (the mean opinions of)
   the parties, and the reporting of more heterogeneity of opinion within
   the parties. We conclude by discussing the implications of these
   findings for democratic functioning more generally.},

Abstract = {Economic conservatism in India today is associated with the BJP's
   embrace of markets and competition. This article argues that
   conservatism within the nationalist movement was founded on rejecting
   both the market and the planned economy, embracing instead moral
   economy' principles of economic life guided by social norms, and
   development founded on small-scale craft production. After independence,
   conservative nationalists, while acknowledging the need to enhance state
   power through industrial growth, protected the moral economies of
   craft-based and agrarian production. But as the Congress party
   fractured, farmers' movements asserted interests in market-based
   agricultural transformation and liberalization shifted the issue space
   of economic debate, new pro-business conservatives presented a new
   vision based on enhancing national wealth and strength through
   capitalist enterprise.},

Abstract = {In this paper I introduce the concept of political attachment as a
   fundamental problem for political foundings. Political attachments refer
   to the loyalty, identity, and commitment between an individual and their
   government. I argue that founders of democratic or republican regimes
   are often faced with the task of constructing political attachments to
   ensure that their citizenry will properly support and obey the new
   government once it is created. I utilize the example of the American
   founding to identify and describe three distinct theories of how
   attachments can be purposefully constructed. I then briefly identify how
   each of these theories was utilized by statesmen in the nineteenth
   century, and I conclude with analysis of the relative success and
   failure of each approach, both for the American example and for the
   construction of regimes more generally.},

Abstract = {Human dignity is making a comeback. The essay focuses on the story that
   this comeback of human dignity presupposes and recasts. In that story,
   the human family is portrayed in terms of aristocratic dignitas. The
   consequences are twofold: (1) human dignity is co-implicated with the
   de-animalization of the human being; (2) once de-animalization is
   introduced, the story of human dignity cultivates an aristocratic sense
   of elevation of the human over other species, or what I will call
   species aristocratism. The fact that a new kind of aristocratism based
   on species emerges from the story of human dignity should concern us, I
   suggest, because it not only confronts us with unintended consequences
   of relying on human dignity as the foundation of human rights but also
   invites us to rethink our contemporary egalitarian, democratic ethos,
   understood as aristocracy for all.},

Abstract = {Donald Trump owes his election to post-1972 changes in party
   institutions and economic developments that were largely the result of
   presidential policies supported by both parties. Political scientists
   and pundits who relied on survey data and assumptions about motives and
   character of Trump supporters failed to understand the deep causes of
   the 2016 election outcome, and to inform the public and party leaders
   about strategic and coalition options for the future. Focusing on
   expressive protest and labeling are probably antithetical to party
   reorganization leading to genuine reform and reduction in inequality.},

   political militant that integrates this collection. We will see how this
   phenomenon contributed to position the authors of cultural formation
   within the field of Argentine poetry as the ``Kirchnerist poets{''}, a
   definition that denies reductionist the trajectory and political
   conceptions of the majority of the members, although it is logical if Is
   taken into account that the editors propose to think a politics of the

Abstract = {Is making an explicit distinction between politically moderate devout
   Muslims and political radicals empirically valid? If yes, in what ways
   do political moderates differ from political radicals? By systematically
   examining cross-national Muslim attitudes, this article scrutinizes the
   distinctiveness of politically moderate and politically radical Islam
   against the weight of empirical evidence. By drawing from extant
   theoretical linkages, we conduct a confirmatory factor analysis of
   cross-national survey data from 13 Muslim-majority states to test the
   fit of two widely theorized factorsmoderate and radical Islamism. The
   findings suggest that support for politically moderate Islam is
   distinctively different from support for politically radical Islam. This
   article makes two key contributions. First, this study introduces a
   systematic empirical operationalization of Political Islam, and a more
   nuanced measurement thereof for empirical research. Second, the findings
   help advance our understanding of the variation in politically divergent
   religious attitudes in the Islamic world.},

Abstract = {Building on previous work on competition networks and governmental
   performance among British local governments, this article investigates
   the diffusion of government quality across subnational regions of Europe
   through strategic interaction with neighbouring regions or competitor
   regions more generally. The article demonstrates the presence of spatial
   interdependence using standard spatial regression models and controlling
   for common explanations of quality of government. In particular for
   regions with high levels of autonomy from the national government, there
   is clear adjustment in government quality to be seen in response to
   disparities with competitor regions. The article further investigates
   the intensity of this geographical effect separately in the north and
   south of Europe in order to estimate the potential for virtuous or
   vicious cycles of good governance in the two regions, respectively. It
   is found that while regions in the north develop relatively
   independently of each other but respond to competitive pressure across
   Europe, in the south regions demonstrate a higher level of local
   interdependence, increasing the possibility of virtuous cycles - but
   also of vicious ones.},

Abstract = {This article assesses the strategies that the Italian student activists
   adopted in order to influence the revision process of the governance
   structure of their universities in 2011. Which kind of strategy has
   enabled these activists to influence more successfully this process? I
   argue that the joint pressure of insiders and outsiders allows student
   activists to get their voice more effectively heard from the university
   leaders than when one of the two forms of pressure is absent. The `power
   of the streets' exerted by the `outsiders', combined with the
   institutional power of the `insiders', produces a significant amplifying
   effect in the governing bodies. University leaders fear this kind of
   alliance, as they perceive that insiders with a strong tie with other
   actors are the expression of a collective voice that is difficult to
   neutralize. On the other hand, the outsiders are also aware that their
   collective strength is more likely to be translated into institutional
   power and action from their allies and/or representatives. To
   empirically probe this proposition, I have singled out three Italian
   universities (University of Turin, Sapienza of Rome, and Federico II of
   Naples), which witnessed high levels of student mobilization in the past
   years (2008-13), and where student activists and their organizations
   adopted the most different array of strategies. More specifically, while
   at the University of Turin the student activists were able to deploy
   simultaneously both forms of pressure, at the Federico II of Naples and
   Sapienza of Rome one of the two forms was lacking.},

Abstract = {Issue salience and diversity direct a range of outcomes such as voting
   behavior and public policy. Studies, however, have yet to fully
   integrate theoretical or empirical expectations for the effect of issue
   salience on coalition stability. By focusing on the mechanism linking
   parties' preferences to policy-making, I propose that parties with more
   diverse platforms provide coalitions greater room to negotiate, whereas
   parties focusing on a small number of issues exacerbate ideological
   tensions. Issue diversity becomes important once parties exhaust
   opportunities to make the initial, easy policy compromises. Using
   evidence from 299 coalitions in 24 European countries, I find that issue
   diversity in parties' platforms moderates the effect of disagreement.
   Using a non-proportional hazard analysis, I find that the effect of
   issue diversity varies over the coalition's lifecycle. Governments with
   parties willing to negotiate over a larger range of issues decrease the
   risk that disagreements will result in coalition termination.},

Abstract = {A number of recent studies suggest that individuals who exhibit high
   levels of racial animosity strongly support Donald Trump, while racial
   liberals strongly oppose him. This paper provides a new experimental
   analysis of the extent to which supporters and opponents of Trump
   respond differently to race-related stimuli. Specifically, we examine
   whether attitudes toward Trump moderate the political impact of racial
   cues in the environment. We find that white Trump supporters randomly
   exposed to a black (versus a white) man in the context of soliciting
   their support for a housing-assistance policy were more opposed to the
   policy, angrier about the policy, and more likely to blame beneficiaries
   for their situation. The opposite pattern prevailed among whites with
   unfavorable opinions of Trump. Our results help provide new insight into
   how Trump supporters and opponents differ in their responses to the
   salience of race in American politics.},

Abstract = {This paper analyzes the role of Enrico Ferri's book, Socialism and
   Positive Science, in the process of programmatic definitions that shaped
   Argentine Socialism in the mid-1890s. In so doing, it addresses an
   aspect until now unexplored: the differences that emerged between the
   editors of La Vanguardia, openly favorable to Ferri's interpretations,
   and those of the Vorwarts, the German-language newspaper that had
   pioneered local socialism. The article reveals that the Argentine
   discussion largely replicated exchanges taking place in Europe, after a
   critical review of Ferri's book published by Karl Kautsky in Die Neue

Journal = {ELECTORAL STUDIES},

Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Understanding preferences over government spending is important for
   understanding electoral behavior and many other aspects of the
   political. world. Using data on relative preferences for more or less
   spending across different issue areas, we estimate the general spending
   preferences of individuals and congressional candidates along a
   left-right spending dimension. Our modeling approach also allows us to
   estimate the location of policies on this same dimension, permitting
   direct comparison of people's spending preferences with where they
   perceive policy to be. We find that public shows very low levels of
   polarization on spending preferences, even across characteristics like
   partisanship, ideology, or income level. The distribution of candidates'
   spending preferences shows much more sorting by party, but candidates
   are significantly less polarized than is contemporary voting in
   Congress. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {We study dynamic policymaking when today's policy agreement becomes
   tomorrow's status quo, agents account for the consequences of today's
   policies for future policy outcomes, and there is uncertainty about who
   will hold future political power to propose and veto future policy
   changes. Today's agenda setter holds back from fully exploiting present
   opportunities to move policy toward her ideal point whenever future
   proposer and veto players are likely to be aligned either in favor of
   reform or against it. Otherwise, agenda setters advance their short-run
   interests. Optimal proposals can vary discontinuously and
   nonmonotonically with political fundamentals.},

Abstract = {How much does it matter whether Democrats or Republicans control the
   government? Unless the two parties converge completely, election
   outcomes should have some impact on policy, but the existing evidence
   for policy effects of party control is surprisingly weak and
   inconsistent. We bring clarity to this question, using
   regression-discontinuity and dynamic panel analyses to estimate the
   effects of party control of state legislatures and governorships on a
   new annual measure of state policy liberalism. We find that throughout
   the 1936-2014 period, electing Democrats has led to more liberal
   policies, but that in recent decades the policy effects of party control
   have approximately doubled in magnitude. We present evidence that this
   increase is at least partially explained by the ideological divergence
   of the parties' office holders and electoral coalitions. At the same
   time, we also show that party effects remain substantively modest,
   paling relative to policy differences across states.},

Abstract = {This article explores the engagement of members of the Irish lower
   parliamentary chamber (TDs) with Web 2.0 technologies. While conducting
   the website-feature analysis, the authors looked at three dimensions of
   each TD's website: information content, interaction tools and
   politicians' activities on the web. They found that Irish
   parliamentarians' usage of the Internet is still largely based on the
   paradigm of Web 1.0. Perhaps more accurately, Irish politicians'
   Internet usage is in the mode of Web 1.5, in which some interactive and
   participatory space is generated with the idea that the cyberspace
   should encourage citizen participation. As conventional variables such
   as party affiliation and geographic variation still have an influence on
   TDs' website performance, one can conclude that information and
   communication technologies do not really change the way Irish politics
   are played. The Irish experience is in line with various other studies,
   such as in Italy and Finland.},

Abstract = {Methodological approaches that rely exclusively on medium-to large-N
   cross-sectional correlations among variables as the source of causal
   inference are generally not suitable for analyzing comparative research
   questions in which the main acting agents are collective actors, such as
   political parties, social movements or governments. Qualitative research
   has repeatedly documented that important political decisions are rarely
   taken in isolation and that collective actors are typically
   characterized by internal factions, personal and ideological rivalry,
   and charismatic leaders. Hence, the political behavior of such
   collectivities actors is highly context-dependent, volatile and subject
   to strategic considerations. As a result, methodological approaches that
   treat these collective actors as unitary actors are prone to create
   non-robust and assumptions-dependent findings. As the debate on
   electoral system choice in the period before 1939 shows, these
   methodological approaches are inadequate for the causal analysis of
   institutional change without complementary analyses of within-case
   variation.},

Abstract = {Recent studies of coalition-directed voting suggest that what political
   parties say during a campaign can influence voter perceptions of the
   likelihood of certain coalitions and that this, in turn, may foster
   strategic voting in multiparty systems. Here, we expand this argument
   and show that preelection coalition signals also have the potential to
   influence voter perceptions of the parties themselves. By revealing
   their coalition preferences, parties provide information on where they
   stand on the political continuum. We test our argument using a survey
   experiment run during a regional election campaign in Spain in which we
   manipulated the coalition signals emitted by two parties: one, a
   traditional social democratic party and, the second, a new liberal
   party. Results show how coalition signals can significantly influence
   the party's position and, ultimately, affect voters' stated probability
   of voting, especially in the case of the recently founded party.},

Abstract = {Faced with repression from a strong state, one might expect minority
   ethnic groups to attempt to assimilate into the dominant group to make
   themselves seem less threatening. However, this conceptualization of
   threat elides its tactical components. Oppressed minority groups, even
   under strong states, may engage in anti-state operations in order to
   reduce the repression they face, and these operations may succeed with
   greater likelihood the more they assimilate. Anticipating this,
   strategic states may be more likely to preemptively raise repression in
   the face of assimilation in order to reduce this threat. Our model
   formalizes this logic, illustrating that it can be optimal for the
   minority group to differentiate even when doing so is strictly
   detrimental to mobilization. Differentiation is more likely to obtain
   when increased repression is more costly to the group and when the
   group's anti-state operations are more capable of compelling the state
   to substantially reduce repression.},

Abstract = {In this article, I argue that contemporary theories of collective
   intentionality force us to think about anarchy in new and challenging
   ways. In the years since Wendt declared the state a person, the
   collective intentionality of groups has become the focus of important
   scholarship across the humanities and social sciences. But this
   literature will not sit easily with mainstream International Relations
   for two reasons. First, contemporary theories of collective
   intentionality are difficult to square with the idea that the
   personified state is an intentional agent, with first-person plural
   self-awareness and moral obligations. However, by contrast, the same
   theories make it eminently plausible for all sorts of other groups to be
   intentional, agential, moral persons and can tell us how states are
   constructed. In short, this set of theories radically pluralises and
   transforms standard political ontology while also accounting for common
   misperceptions. I push these insights further to argue that radical
   pluralisation suggests that anarchy may be the structural context for
   politics as such. What we know from mainstream International Relations
   theory is that politics without an orderer is well-ordered regardless.
   It may be time to recast these insights in order to demonstrate how
   complex pluralism is not chaos but anarchy.},

Title = {Competing loyalties in electoral reform: An analysis of the US electoral
   college},
Journal = {ELECTORAL STUDIES},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {49},
Pages = {38-48},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {A central tenet in the electoral systems subfield is that parties, when
   in power and motivated by partisan interest, seek desired outcomes via
   the strategic adoption of electoral rules. Such a focus, however, omits
   a key point: electoral rules also distribute power among geographic
   units. If, within a party, the partisan and geographic interests of some
   members conflict, then the canonical relationship between partisanship
   and rule choice may be conditional. The U.S. electoral college provides
   an opportunity to test for such intra-party variation, because it
   advantages some states over others and thus makes salient geographic
   allegiances. Using an original dataset on one reform proposal-the
   National Popular Vote Interstate Compact (NPVIC)-I find evidence of
   competing loyalties. Although NPVIC advances furthest when Democrats
   control state lawmaking, a state's status as a swing-but not as an
   over-represented-state weakens the relationship to the point where even
   Democrats are unlikely to aid NPVIC. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {Established wisdom is sceptical of direct linkages between economic
   hardship and contentious mobilization. Occupy protests seem to
   constitute an anomaly in this regard by their very existence, but
   factors associated with these events have not been investigated yet.
   This study of 398 self-designated Occupy protests across 180 countries
   finds that the country's level of inequality was associated with a
   higher rate of protest. Equally important were the severity of the
   downturn in GDP growth in 2007-11 and the level of democracy. The
   results offer some evidence for the inverse J-curve' hypothesis whereby
   an economic boom period followed by a downturn is conducive to protest.
   Few studies have previously investigated the influence of inequality and
   economic growth on political protest across a diverse set of countries
   going beyond OECD democracies. The applicability of these findings to
   protest events more generally needs to be corroborated and discussed in
   future work.},

Abstract = {With Australia and Russia increasingly seeing their future in the
   Asia-Pacific, neither can reach its full economic potential except under
   the guidance of Beijing's control of ports on its ``Maritime Silk
   Road.{''} Cold War cliches of the ``Yankee lapdog{''} and the big bad
   ``Russian bear{''} continue to dominate how Canberra and Moscow view
   each other. Yet when it comes to the future of Australia-Russia-China
   relations, one must look beyond Moscow, Beijing, and Canberra, but
   rather at Vladivostok and Darwin, symbols of an as-yet unrealized goal
   to shift emphasis onto each country's sparsely-populated regions
   bordering the Asia-Pacific. With the dawning of the ``Asian Century,{''}
   how does the United States change the geopolitical dynamics of the
   region, and how do China, Russia, and Australia react to ``America's
   Pacific Century{''}? Rather than a capitulation to America's aggressive
   posture in the Asia-Pacific, China and Russia have consolidated the
   integration of their economies and militaries to counter such
   penetration. This emerging rivalry creates a challenge for Australia to
   balance its military alliance with the United States and its economic
   reliance on China. The necessity of finetuning this balance should be
   Canberra's primary foreign policy issue.},

   More Progressive Taxation in Latin America?},

Abstract = {When do high-income earners get `on board' with the fiscal contract and
   accept paying a larger share of the tax burden? Progressive taxes
   perform particularly poorly in developing countries. We argue that the
   common opposition of the affluent to more progressive taxation is not
   merely connected to administrative limitations to coercively enforce
   compliance, but also to the uncertainty that high-income earners
   associate with the returns to taxes. Because coercion is not an option,
   there is a need to convince high-income earners to `invest' in the
   public system via taxes. Trust in institutions is decisive for the
   fiscal contract. Expecting that paid contributions will be used in a
   sensible manner, high-income earners will be more supportive of
   progressive income taxation. We study tax composition preferences of a
   cross-section of Latin American countries using public opinion data from
   LAPOP for 2012. Findings reveal that higher levels of trust in political
   institutions strongly mitigate the opposition of the affluent towards
   more progressive taxation.},

Abstract = {Did the terrorist attacks in Norway affect citizens' attitudes to
   security-related institutions and policies? To answer this question this
   study pools two cross-sectional surveys, collected shortly before and
   after the 2011 terrorist attacks, to determine the attacks' effects on
   people's attitudes. One important finding is that general support for
   the institutions responsible for security increased slightly, whereas
   specific support for government agencies capability to prevent and cope
   with crises decreased markedly. A second important finding concerns the
   potential for politicisation of crises: On issues of security, the
   distance between right-wing voters and other party voters increased
   after the attack. Irrespective of party attachment, Norwegians have
   become less satisfied with governmental policies on security-related
   issues, but dissatisfaction has increased significantly more among
   right-wing than among left-wing voters. Thus, even in a country where
   politicians responded to the crisis with an appeal to togetherness and
   common values, citizens' attitudes on security policies were
   politicised.},

Abstract = {The contribution aims to outline an elementary phenomenology and a
   minimal ontology of power, analyzing, in a realistic perspective in a
   broad sense, some elementary forms and some invariant features of power
   relations. The main thesis is that the power relations depend on
   subjective factors and, more particularly, on that constellation of
   beliefs, meanings, passions that defines the physiognomy of a certain
   form of subjectivity. To understand, also from the genealogical point of
   view, the relationship between subjectivity and forms of power it will
   be used, in the wake of Weber and Blumenberg, the notion of world view
   (Weltbild): that series of beliefs, more or less coherent, cognitive
   assumptions on ``how the world is made{''} (man, history, nature,
   society) which play a fundamental function of practical orientation,
   defining the framework within which individuals interpret themselves,
   structure their own desires and expectations, elaborate their
   representations of what is necessary and what is possible, form their
   ideas of justice, plan their strategies. The activation of power
   relations is therefore not linked to the quantitative inequality of
   powers, but to the diversity of desires and representations on the state
   of the world. Power relations have a subjective prerequisite that takes
   them away from the mere logic of quantity.},

Abstract = {Government purchase of services is considered to be a service delivery
   mechanism that can improve efficiency and economize costs. This
   mechanism has been popularized all over the world. However, at the same
   time, ``reverse marketization{''} has been a common occurrence in the
   past few years. According to some scholars, ``reverse marketization{''}
   is evidence of market failure, so they object to outsourcing contract in
   public services. This paper classifies market failure into four types
   and makes a case analysis of one of the four types. The case of reserve
   environmental sanitation service contracting testifies that in the model
   of low defect of supplier and low defect of demander, market failure
   will not inevitably give rise to ``reverse marketization{''}. The direct
   cause is deficiency in management of the government. With regard to the
   actual situation of government management, this paper also puts forward
   the viewpoint that the government should act as ``an open-minded
   purchaser{''}.},

Abstract = {Presently, discussions are taking place in Iceland on the development
   and maintenance of tourist sites and various services needed in order
   for tourism to develop in line with the great increase in the number of
   foreign tourists. Municipalities are one of the interested parties and
   they are responsible for many services: sewage, maintenance of parks and
   streets, to name a few. There are doubts that municipal income increases
   according to the increase in tourists, because it is most likely this
   will take place through municipal income tax, but much of the work
   related to tourism is carried out by migrant workers. This research
   attempts to assess if municipal income changes with increased number of
   tourists. It will also be attempted to estimate if costs of
   municipalities increase with increased number of tourists, and also
   which types of costs. Available data on financial affairs of
   municipalities from the Association of municipalities, real estate
   prices from the National registry and statistics on number of tourists,
   from diverse sources, are used to assess changes in costs and incomes
   and if this will have the impacts described above. Quantitative methods
   are applied in the analysis. Regression analysis for panel data (fixed
   and random effect models) was applied along with descriptive analysis.},

Title = {The End of the ANC Era: An Analysis of Corruption and Inequality in

Abstract = {The 2016 municipality election of South Africa was received as a
   shocking event. Despite a strong belief that the ANC would always rule
   in South Africa, the African National Congress (ANC), which has been
   governing the country since the end of apartheid in 1994, received the
   worst results ever recorded. The ANC with president Jacob Zuma received
   54 percent of the votes, which is a considerable decrease from 62
   percent in 2011. This election was a clear sign that the ANC is in
   trouble towards the 2019 elections. The party seriously needs to rethink
   its strategies and investigates why the votes are decreasing. Given
   South Africa being a key player in global governance and in particular a
   strong leader among the African countries, it is significant to
   understand this political turmoil, as it may influence the political
   directions of other countries in that area. With reviews of relevant
   literature, therefore, this paper analyzes the current political
   situation in South Africa, focusing on corruption and inequality. The
   paper suggests connections between corruption, Jacob Zuma, and the
   potential end of the ANC era. The issues of inequality describes more
   the difficult situation that South Africans are facing and can be
   connected to the desire for change. It would be interesting to further
   analyze whether South Africa would be ready for a multiparty democracy
   with a peaceful transition of power after the national elections in
   2019.},

Abstract = {Participatory constitution-building is a trend that appears to be here
   to stay; particularly when new constitutions are drafted in the
   aftermath of war or during transitions from authoritarian to democratic
   rule. Anticipations as to what the involvement of the public will
   achieve are several, and scholars are only recently starting to
   systematically investigate whether or not these expectations find
   empirical support. Previous research has shown that public participation
   in the making of the constitution can have certain positive effects at
   an individual level of analysis, but that the actions of political
   elites during constitutional negotiations might affect outcomes at a
   macro level of analysis more than what has hitherto be acknowledged in
   this strand of research. Nepal is one of the most recent cases of
   participatory constitution-building, and the country carried out not
   only one, but two, such processes within a time period of only seven
   years. The first resulted in failure as a draft constitution was never
   finalized; the other in success with the adoption of a constitution in
   2015. This article takes an interest in exploring and comparing these
   two separate processes as regards the extent of public participation
   vis-a-vis political elite negotiations and bargaining behind closed
   doors. The article finds that what primarily sets the two processes
   apart, is how broad based public participation and secluded elite
   negotiations were sequenced. In light of other empirical examples, the
   article also discusses if elite bargains ought to be struck before the
   general public are invited to participate.},

Abstract = {In this study, we explore the predictors of gender linked fate with a
   focus on marital status for different racial/ethnic groups. We argue
   that marriage alters women's perceptions of self-interest by
   institutionalizing their partnerships with men and consequently leading
   women to feel less connected to other women. We assess our hypothesis
   using the 2012 American National Election Study. While we find that
   married white women and Latinas have significantly lower levels of
   linked fate than unmarried women of the same race/ethnicity, we find no
   such relationship for black women. We then explore the implications of
   these findings by examining the role of gender linked fate in explaining
   political differences among married and unmarried women using mediation
   analysis. Ultimately, we find that differences in perceptions of linked
   fate explain a significant amount of the variation in political ideology
   and partisanship for white and Latina women.},

Abstract = {While much progress has been made in empirically mapping and analysing a
   variety of interest group activities in the last decade, less attention
   has been devoted to conceptual work that clearly defines and
   distinguishes different forms of policy engagement. This article
   contributes to this endeavour by developing a theoretical framework that
   explicitly links currently available measures of the policy engagement
   of groups to the distinct concepts of group involvement, access and
   prominence. It argues that greater conceptual clarity will lead to
   better accumulation of knowledge in the sub-field and a better
   understanding of the role of interest groups in political systems.},

Abstract = {This article describes the background to subgoal SDG 4.2. It suggests
   that as with the SDG process more generally, the goal is a compromise
   and does not address the critical issue of inequality, The
   implementation of the goal is dependent on charitable interventions, and
   likely to be undertaken, if at all, through the processes of tendering
   with private individuals and companies. Efficacy is measured through
   globally developed criteria, heavily reliant on USA sources, with little
   attention to context.},

Abstract = {Does the religious calendar promote or suppress political violence in
   Islamic societies? This study challenges the presumption that the
   predominant impact of the Islamic calendar is to increase violence,
   particularly during Ramadan. This study develops a new theory that
   predicts systematic suppression of violence on important Islamic
   holidays, those marked by public days off for dedicated celebration. We
   argue that militant actors anticipate societal disapproval of violence,
   predictably inducing restraint on these days. We assess our theory using
   innovative parallel analysis of multiple datasets and qualitative
   evidence from Islamic insurgencies in Iraq, Afghanistan, and Pakistan
   from 2004 to 2014. Consistent with our theory, we find that important
   Islamic holidays witness systematic declines in violenceas much as
   41\%and provide evidence that anticipation of societal disapproval is
   producing these results. Significantly, we find no systematic evidence
   for surges of violence associated with any Islamic holiday, including
   Ramadan.},

Abstract = {The territories in which the Tageiri, Taromenane and other isolated
   tribes in the Ecuadorian Amazon reside suffer from various pressures. As
   one will see later, these pressures respond to economic models
   implemented in the seventies by the different administrations and that
   have involved exploitation of natural resources, expansion of
   agricultural and livestock borders and the subordination of other
   socio-economic alternatives (even those of isolated communities) to the
   logics of capital. Apparently, these territorial pressures can be
   multiplied and diversified on an accelerated manner by actors interested
   in the resources of the Amazon region in general, and in the territory
   of the Tageiri, Taromenane and other isolated tribes, in particular.},

Abstract = {Why would an authoritarian regime allow citizens to voice opinions
   publicly if the exchange of information among citizens spurs social
   instability as has been often alleged? We show that an authoritarian
   regime can strengthen its rule by allowing citizens to communicate with
   one another publicly. From the government's perspective, such
   communication serves two interrelated functions. First, if public
   communication reveals a shared feeling of dissatisfaction toward the
   government among citizens, the government will detect the danger and
   improve policies accordingly. Second, public communication disorganizes
   citizens if they find themselves split over policies. We show that the
   government allows public communication if and only if it perceives
   sufficient preference heterogeneity among citizens. The model also
   illustrates that public communication can serve as a commitment device
   ensuring government responsiveness when it faces high dissatisfaction,
   which in turn makes the government better off than with private polling.},

   Trade Crowd Out Gifting, and Why Would It Matter?},
Journal = {POLITY},

Volume = {49},

Abstract = {In the absence of a threat of maldistribution, what reason could there
   be to bar trade of a genuine good that is otherwise owned? Market
   skeptics have asserted that, once permitted, trade tends to crowd out
   gifting. Why should we care, though, if needs are satisfied via sales?
   More importantly, why suppose that permitting trade will cause crowding
   out? In this paper, I address both questions with an emphasis on the
   second. Normatively, I claim that gifting has expressive value over and
   above its value in satisfying needs. Causally, I differentiate between
   possible cultural and psychological mechanisms, and I offer an original,
   institutional one. The cultural mechanism relies on the notion that
   pricing symbolizes a good as a mere commodity. The psychological
   mechanism draws on empirical evidence that introducing a monetary
   incentive can diminish a good's provision. And the institutional
   mechanism invokes an assumed division of moral labor that dictates that
   each of us sometimes eschews opportunities to gift so that, together, we
   enable the invisible hand. I further argue that the institutional
   mechanism is likely to be more widely applicable than the more familiar
   cultural and psychological mechanisms.},

Abstract = {In partnership with state Democratic parties and the Obama campaign, the
   authors surveyed staffers from nearly 200 electoral campaigns in 2012,
   asking about the expected vote share in their races. Political
   operatives' perceptions of closeness can affect how they campaign and
   represent citizens, but their perceptions may be wildly inaccurate:
   campaigns may irrationally fear close contests or be unrealistically
   optimistic. Findings indicate that political operatives are more
   optimistic than fearful, and that incumbent and higher-office campaigns
   are more accurate at assessing their chances. While the public may be
   better served by politicians fearing defeat, campaigns are typically
   staffed by workers who are over-confident, which may limit the purported
   benefits of electoral competition.},

Abstract = {Twenty years have passed since the publication of the foundational text
   of subaltern realism, ``The Third World Security Predicament{''} by
   Mohammed Ayoob. Since the end of the Cold War, we have witnessed a
   number of transformations, but also some important continuities in world
   politics. State-building processes and forms of insertion into the
   international system are subject to constant changes that have an
   influence on state behavior. This article provides a historical
   perspective on subaltern realist theory through the study of
   state-building and internal conflict in Yemen from 1990 to 2011 in form
   of an ``ideal case study{''}.},

Abstract = {We investigate the effects of territorial government fragmentation on
   the quality of public services. We argue that an increase in the number
   of regional governments has two effects: (1) it redistributes fiscal and
   administrative resources to underserved regions and (2) encourages
   yardstick competition. Extreme government fragmentation, however, limits
   efficiency gains by reducing administrative capacity, economies of
   scale, and enabling capture. We test this argument using original data
   on the number of regional governments in sub-Saharan Africa (1960-2012).
   Consistent with our theoretical expectations, we find robust evidence
   for an initial increase in the quality of services provision following
   regional government splits, which levels off at high levels of regional
   fragmentation. Three distinct difference-in-difference analyses of
   microlevel, georeferenced data on health outcomes in Malawi, Nigeria,
   and Uganda further support our theoretical argument.},

Abstract = {Nyhan and Reifler (2010, 2015) document a ``backfire effect,{''} wherein
   attempts to correct factual misperceptions increase the prevalence of
   false beliefs. These results are widely cited both in and outside of
   political science. In this research note, I report the results of a
   replication of Nyhan and Reifler's (2015) flu vaccine study that was
   embedded in a larger study about flu vaccines. The backfire effect was
   not replicated in my experiment. The main replication result suggests
   the need for additional studies to verify the backfire effect and
   identify conditions under which it occurs.},

Abstract = {Comparative studies report the rise of left- and right-wing Eurosceptic
   parties that have transformed national party competition in Europe
   toward an inverted U-shaped configuration: peripheral parties at the
   left and right of the party spectrum oppose while centrist parties
   support several features of European integration. To describe the tempo
   and timing of this transformation and the heterogeneity across
   countries, we construct a Bayesian finite mixture factor analysis that
   estimates the election-specific probability of a one-dimensional
   left/right versus a two-dimensional inverted U-shaped national party
   configuration. The results show a general trend toward U but with
   significant variation across countries and time, including cases with a
   reversal of this trend.},

Abstract = {This article presents a historical assessment in the longue duree of the
   material conditions that have supported Brazilian expansionism in Latin
   America. It assesses the possibilities of Michel Temer's administration
   of maintaining characteristics of the internationalized national
   economy, a type of economy which, we believe, has been a sui generis
   case in Latin America which characterized the sub-imperial period and
   the governments of Lula da Silva and Dilma Rousseff. To that end, we
   present a tangible analysis on the structural economic conditions that
   allow for the emergence of expansionist practices in Brazil. We connect
   the fluctuations in the internal balance of political forces during
   these periods. Lastly, after our analysis, we put forth that national
   development of the ``productive forces{''}, linked to the energy, is the
   economic force that has sustained Brazil's productive expansionism.},

Abstract = {After the last civil-military dictatorship, the Mothers of Plaza de Mayo
   began a new stage of struggle against impunity that placed them in
   confrontation with the governments that hegemonized Argentina until the
   first years of the 21st century. From a political analysis of the
   discourse, in this article we will stop in the analysis of the identity
   reconfigurations of the Mothers Association of Plaza de Mayo between the
   years 1983 and 2003. For this we will inquire into the radicality that
   reached its struggle in the mentioned period and in the new contents and
   referents that were inscribed during their resistance to neoliberalism.},

Abstract = {This article contains an analysis of the constitutional theory of Nobel
   Prize winning economist James M. Buchanan. It proceeds through an
   explanation of his main doctrinal inputs, breaking down those principles
   which are of interest for constitutional doctrine, and which can be used
   as a theoretical foundation for the ``constitutionalisation{''} of
   economic governance mechanisms in Europe. The paper shows that Buchanan
   developed a complete and sui generis theory of Constitution from the
   neo-contractualist paradigm of the 70s, and under the parameter of his
   methodological individualism, which led him to defend the new
   constitutional categories and normative proposals, which were also not
   exempt from contradictions and criticisms.},

Abstract = {In his first months as president, Donald Trump has demonstrated an
   unprecedented aversion to expert-oriented decision making. This essay
   examines how Trump's presidency exposes tensions in what Skowronek and
   Orren (2016) refer to as the ``policy state{''}, especially within
   institutions that produce expert analyses of presidential action. While
   an absence of policy expertise has hampered Trump's agenda, his
   administration has also taken steps to discredit unfavorable analyses,
   subvert rules requiring the use of objective analysis, and construct new
   institutions to promote `alternative facts'. By deepening public
   division and distrust, such activities may restructure the political
   environment in which the Trump presidency itself is judged.},

Abstract = {The rise of the academic and epistemological study of peace appears at
   the dawn of the twentieth century as an explosion of diverse, intense
   and profound reflections on the causes, forms and constructions of both
   violence and peace. The broad approach to peace has permeated spaces,
   environments and subjects that must be understood as agents of change.
   Under the methodology of the paradigm of mixed research, through this
   article it is intended to show the possibility, probability and
   potentiality that youth - as subjects spatially located and formed in a
   given context - have to build, from creativity and diversity, moments
   and scenarios of peace.},

Abstract = {The aim of this article is to analize the working-class and trade-union
   traditions that articulated in Rosario, Argentina, at the beginning of
   the sixties. In order to do so, we inquired into the different union
   branches that acted in the national and local scene, namely: traditional
   peronism, comunist activism and a new generation of trade-union
   activists who stood out in the conflict processes at the end of the
   fifties in the state sector, and who hegemonized the leadership of the
   Confederacion General del Trabajo from 1963. We explore the relations
   weaved between them, which oscillated among the efforts towards unity in
   the face of the trade-asociation and state assaults and the disputes,
   fights and frictions that divided them and made them confront.},

Abstract = {Contextual scholars have explored the impact of residing in racially and
   ethnically diverse environments on political attitudes and behavior.
   Traditionally, the literature has employed governmental administrative
   units such as counties as proxies for citizens' social contexts.
   Recently, these measures have come under attack by scholars desiring
   more personalized measures. This article evaluates the performance of
   two personalized measures of intergroup context and finds that
   census-based measures are more closely aligned with subjects'
   perceptions of local area demographics than measures that ``bring the
   person back in.{''} The implications of these findings on the contextual

Abstract = {The emergence of the Information Technologies and Communication have led
   to a profound structural change involved new ways to engage in peer
   conflict behaviors. This article presents a review of bullying and
   cyberbullying, and the relationship between them, from a
   psycho-socio-educational perspective. With the aim of studying the
   continuity of processes of cyberbullying, we present the first results
   from three descriptive studies. The first, analyzes the origin of the
   cyberbullying from primary education, providing comparative data on 2197
   students aged 10 to 18 years of primary education and secondary
   education. The second, studies the continuity of the cyberbullying from
   school to University, presenting the results of incidences in a sample
   of 243 students. The third study, analyzes the situation in college
   students in a sample of 154 future educators. The results suggest that
   cyberbullying behavior is occurring since primary education and can
   persist until the university. The consequences of the harassment and the
   measures of prevention and intervention being taken in various countries
   are presented.},

Abstract = {Citizen-elite congruence has long been considered an important yardstick
   for the quality of democracy. The literature on citizen satisfaction
   with democracy, however, has reduced congruence almost exclusively to
   one of its components, policy congruence. Just as citizens are
   considered to have positions on policy issues, there is growing
   scholarly interest in the preferences they have about the process of
   representation. Yet studies inquiring into the impact of the divergent
   preferences that citizens and elites have regarding the representational
   process thus far have been few and their results inconclusive. Combining
   new, unique data from the 2014 Belgian Election and Candidate Studies,
   we seek to address this lacuna. Our findings indicate that we cannot
   understand citizen satisfaction without also taking process into
   account-even as the policy gap has the greater effect. They should be of
   interest to scholars of democracy, those concerned about citizen
   disengagement from politics, and political practitioners.},

Abstract = {This article addresses the question of `the left' in contemporary South
   Africa in two senses: first, in terms of assessing the health of leftist
   politics; second, it asks to what extent are the self-identified left
   progressive in any meaningful sense. The first half of this article
   reflects on the current development situation in South Africa. Here, it
   is argued that within most sections of the South African left, there is
   broad agreement on the need to address the triple challenge of
   unemployment, rising inequality and poverty. The second half of this
   article identifies three broad sections to the contemporary left in
   South Africa (the Tripartite Alliance, the left outside the Alliance and
   the remnants of the revolutionary socialist left). It argues that the
   left within the Alliance, despite the launch of the New Growth Path, are
   failing to implement the sufficiently radical policy changes that are
   required to address the development challenges identified in the first
   half of this article. The left outside the Alliance, meanwhile, despite
   recent attempts at coordination, lacks influence and remains
   disconnected from the masses.},

Abstract = {In this article I examine public evaluations of quality of governance in
   East Asia and analyze the effects of perceived governance quality on
   regime support. I distinguish between two modes of governance,
   democratic and law-based, and examine which mode of governance matters.
   It was found that East Asian democracies suffered various governance
   deficits in the eyes of their publics. It was also revealed that a weak
   rule of law remained the most notable governance malaise across much of
   the region. The micro-level analysis shows that perceived quality of
   governance shaped regime allegiance and institutional confidence but not
   all aspects of governance mattered. It was shown that law-based
   governance served as the major source of regime support regardless of
   regime types. On the whole, public support for the prevailing system of
   government across much of the region depended on quality of law-based
   governance as well as national economic performance. Yet, evidence
   indicates that democratic governance encourages citizen skepticism of
   the ongoing political order, supporting the thesis of assertive
   citizenship. Overall, the findings suggest that establishing a strong
   rule of law constitutes one of the major challenges to regime
   consolidation across much of East Asia.},

Abstract = {The debates on the devolution of powers to the panchayats since the last
   two decades received enormous attention because of the increasing role
   played by these institutions in planning and implementation of the
   development programmes in rural India. But it is observed that
   devolution agenda including the agenda of fiscal devolution and tax
   decentralization has not been taken up sincerely in many states
   including the states of Andhra Pradesh and Odisha. Based on the review
   of secondary data, the present article critically examines the status of
   the fiscal devolution to the panchayats in the states of Andhra Pradesh
   and Odisha. This article argues that both the states need to strengthen
   the own revenue of panchayats based on the recommendations of the
   Finance Commissions of the respective states. In this context, the
   process of tax decentralization and principles of sharing the state
   taxes should receive paramount importance.},

Abstract = {This article analyzes the increasing use of state preemption law by
   conservative state leaders as a tool to rein in progressive local
   governments. The scope and special qualities of recent state preemption
   laws are explored by examining legislation preempting local fracking
   bans, preventing minimum wage ordinances, targeting sanctuary city
   policies, overturning LGBT rights ordinances, and enacting blanket
   preemption measures. Reasons for the recent surge of state preemption
   laws are suggested, and the overall effectiveness of these laws is
   discussed. I conclude that rising conservative dominance of state
   legislatures has provided the opportunity to thwart progressive local
   policies, and these efforts have been aided by various industry and
   conservative organized groups. State preemption laws are not always
   successful in their aims. In some cases, state supreme courts have sided
   with local officials' claims of state overreach. In others, local
   officials have simply refused to comply. In any case, the threat of
   preemption may have a chilling effect on local policy innovation.},

Abstract = {Strong institutions and accountable governments are imperative for any
   country's long-term prosperity. Yet the development of such institutions
   has presented a continuous challenge for many countries around the
   world. Using Russia as a case, this study brings attention to the
   unexpected negative impact of global interdependence and shows that
   institutional arbitrage opportunities have enabled economic actors to
   solve for institutional weaknesses and constraints in the domestic realm
   by using foreign institutions, thereby limiting the emergence of a
   domestic rule of law regime. We argue that such opportunities lower the
   propensity of asset-holders, normally interested in strong institutions
   at home, to organize collective action to lobby for better institutions.
   We demonstrate the main ways through which Russia's capital-owners make
   use of foreign legal and financial infrastructures such as capital
   flight, the use of foreign corporate structures, offshore financial
   centers, real estate markets, the round-tripping of foreign direct
   investment, and reliance on foreign law in contract-writing and foreign
   courts in dispute-resolution.},

Pages = {193-205},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {This article evaluates the use of audio feedback on assignments through
   the case study of a politics course and argues that audio feedback
   provides a more personal feel to feedback. Criticism, it appears, is
   easier to accept in the spoken word. In addition, the article highlights
   the chief practical benefit of audio feedback, namely that it reduces
   the overall time spent by lecturers in providing comments. But while the
   article is positive in favour of audio feedback, it also discusses some
   potential challenges that include anonymous marking and the fact that
   one size does not fit all, with different students preferring different
   types of feedback. Finally, the article identifies a number of practical
   tips that relate to the adoption of this method of feedback.},

Abstract = {The Parliamentary Powers Index (PPI) developed by Fish and Kroenig
   (2009) is the most important effort to date to measure legislative power
   in cross-national perspective, but it has been criticized on both
   theoretical and methodological grounds. We build on the 32-item PPI to
   develop an alternative indicator of legislative strength that is based
   on an expert survey of 296 political scientists in 2014. We reweight
   each of the powers by expert opinion, creating a new Weighted
   Legislative Powers Score (WLPS) for the 158 national legislatures in the
   Fish and Kroenig data set. In addition, the article reports the
   expert-assigned weight factors for the entire set of 32 powers contained
   in the original PPI, thus allowing researchers to innovate alternative,
   disaggregated indicators of legislative power.},

Abstract = {One feature of Nelson Mandela's legacy in South Africa is his concept of
   post-apartheid society as a cosmopolitan space. Sadly, recent
   developments in the country suggest a return to nativist and bigoted
   world views and cast a dark shadow over his legacy. There is an urgent
   necessity to review this aspect of Mandela's vision. In so doing, this
   paper highlights the ethical advantages of cosmopolitanism, and argues
   that what sets Mandela's cosmopolitanism apart from others is his
   emphasis on empathy. I therefore suggest that empathetic cosmopolitanism
   is a particularly South African worldview. In support of this idea of
   empathetic cosmopolitanism, I discuss such recent theories as
   `incompleteness', `multiple identity', and `entanglement', suggested by
   South African thinkers, as registers of Mandela's global citizenship.},

Title = {A New Time for Politics The Present and the Everyday as Temporal
   Dimensions of the Political},
Journal = {POLITICA \& SOCIETA},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {6},

Abstract = {The present and the everyday are temporal dimensions with a bizarre
   political status. Although present is often described as a
   well-recognizable juncture in the linear path of time, it also appears
   as a dimension that never fully offers itself. It always exhibits a kind
   of withdrawal, caught in a relentless movement between the past and the
   future. A similar form of duplicity marks the everyday: within it,
   countless rhythms, tempos, intervals merge, and yet it has been
   generally perceived as a flat domain, a sterile, monotone dimension,
   which lacks political interest. At a political level, such understanding
   of these temporalities (still the only dimensions in which our lives
   unfold and our actions take place) evoke the need to allocate the source
   of social change elsewhere, leaving little leeway for political action.
   In this article, I concern myself with the consequences of this
   rejection and make the case for a new conceptualization of ordinary time
   and its political import. After discussing the ways in which the present
   and the everyday have been dismissed as ``sites{''} of political action,
   I home in on the case of everyday utopias to unearth the re-politicizing
   force of a new understanding of these temporal dimensions.},

Abstract = {We explore whether the hijab affects politicians' views of citizens. To
   better isolate the effect of religious attire, we focus on a context in
   Europe where Muslims are not foreignersBosnia. We presented local
   politicians (N = 1,389) with a group photo of ordinary men and women in
   Bosnia. Respondents were randomized to view a photo where some
   (treatment) or none (control) of the women were wearing the hijab. We
   find that the hijab effect differs for Muslims and non-Muslims. For
   Muslim politicians, wearing the hijab does not affect their belief that
   they can represent their constituents well. However, for these
   politicians, the hijab appears to signal demand for more ethnicity-based
   representation. For non-Muslim politicians, however, religious attire
   creates social distance toward their hijab-wearing constituents. This
   effect does not emerge because local elites think Hijabis themselves
   feel social distance toward these elites.},

Abstract = {A number of states have empowered independent redistricting commissions
   (IRCs) to redraw legislative districts each decade following the US
   Census. Reformers see IRCs, which have binding authority and political
   independence, as a solution to the practice of gerrymandering and have
   proposed using them throughout the United States. With less incentive to
   protect incumbents, do IRCs adhere more closely to traditional
   redistricting principles, such as drawing compact districts, maintaining
   continuity, and respecting political subdivisions? We examine a large
   sample of congressional and state legislative districts and find that,
   relative to legislatures, IRCs tend to draw more compact districts,
   split fewer political subdivisions, and may also do a better job of
   preserving the population cores of prior districts.},

Abstract = {In this essay, we contribute to the growing national discussion about
   the future of minimum wage policy and its implications for working class
   Americans. First, we discuss the politics of the minimum wage in the
   United States, with special attention to the sizable and rich variation
   across the fifty American states and the importance of federalism.
   Second, we examine competing theoretical arguments (and, when available,
   empirical evidence) about the advantages and the disadvantages of
   increasing the minimum wage, particularly as it pertains to workers'
   well-being. Third, as a case study of the potential effects of raising
   the minimum wage, we present preliminary results from an original
   empirical analysis that assesses how state minimum wage increases impact
   the quality of life that working class citizens experience.},

Abstract = {This paper presents a specific dynamic extension to the model outlined
   by Jackson and Morelli (Political bias and war. The American Economic
   Review 97(4): 1353-1373). In particular, we focus on the implications of
   a long-lived leader who possesses bias towards or against war that
   potentially differs from the country (s)he represents. Bargaining and
   war outcomes are characterized in this environment. We emphasize three
   results: (1) war sometimes occurs only after substantial delay; (2) if
   it is possible to select a leader, a country will always select a leader
   who is biased towards war; (3) when the distribution of power is uneven,
   a country might select an aggressive leader who eventually leads the
   country into war. If applied in the context of a civil war model, the
   third result implies that particularly disadvantaged rebel groups might
   select aggressive leaders to bargain with the central government and,
   potentially, incite conflict.},

Abstract = {Organized crime, along with terrorism, drugs, corruption and cyber-crime
   remain among the most significant threats to security and co-operation
   in the OSCE region. What has been achieved over these years and what

   hinder sustainable economic and social development in the area from
   Vancouver to Vladivostok?
   To effectively defend the human rights of 1.2 billion people living in
   the region, the OSCE has to review its anti-crime toolbox from time to
   time, to strengthen its co-operation with other interested partners and
   to develop new mechanisms of cooperation among its 57 participating
   States. This article will focus on the ongoing efforts by the OSCE to
   combat organized crime through police co-operation.},

Journal = {ELECTORAL STUDIES},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {46},

Month = {APR},
Abstract = {This cohort-sequential longitudinal study among 1302 Dutch youths
   examined the dynamics of political identity (e.g., Democrat or Rightist)
   and issue attitudes between age 12 and 30. Some theories propose that
   voters form an identity early in life that subsequently determines
   attitudes. Other theories contrarily argue that attitudes are a cause of
   identity. However, research on this controversy has never focused on the
   crucial phase of adolescence. Results revealed that youths formed an
   identity consistent with prior attitudes more than vice versa. Highly
   educated youths most often adjusted their attitudes to their identity,
   which explained an emerging education gap in identity-attitude
   consistency. Finally, findings suggested that early cultural attitudes
   establish an identity that may subsequently determine economic
   attitudes. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Volume = {4},

Month = {APR-JUN},
Abstract = {The literature largely assumes that a candidate's religious affiliation
   sends signals about his or her ideological leanings and policy
   preferences. We contend that prior works have not sufficiently accounted
   for the effects of the party label. Using an original experimental
   design that manipulates both religion and party, we show that the
   effects of a religious cue are more limited than previously implied.
   Though Evangelical and Catholic cues do impact impressions of a
   candidate's stance on abortion, the partisan cue dominates perceptions
   of overall ideology. These findings further demonstrate the power of the
   party brand and are more consistent with research arguing for the
   non-policy value of the religion heuristic.},

Abstract = {Electoral pacts between British political parties have been mooted more
   often than folk memory or current academic literature would suggest.
   There has been little attempt to tackle them empirically, and
   comparative theory on pre-electoral coalitions is formative at best.
   This article uses a comparative framework to historically trace three
   cases where pre-electoral coalitions have been seriously discussed by
   British political parties - one that was eventually fully operational,
   and two that ultimately were not formed. It posits a strong role for
   party leaders and elite-level dynamics in explaining the success and
   failure of negotiations between parties, and finds them to be an
   enduring example of intra-party collective decision making. There also
   exists a clear divide between success and failure in negotiations
   dependent on whether pacts are perceived to be electorally expedient, or
   intrinsically damaging to short and long-term party goals. These are
   based on contrasting interpretive standpoints on the constraints of
   Westminster and voter perceptions of coalitions.},

Abstract = {The article analyzes how Administrative Burden Reduction has been
   implemented in Germany, France, Italy and Spain. Using an institutional
   processualist approach we show how this policy instrument has been
   implemented differently in these countries depending on the
   concatenation of mechanisms activated by the interplay between agency
   and structure. The article thus contributes both to the Europeanization
   literature and to the institutional processualist approach, which has so
   far only been applied to single country cases.},

Abstract = {With the end of the civil war and fading of military and ideological
   competitions of the superpowers and drastic changes in the international
   system, maintaining peace and security has been closely associated with
   the political, social economic and cultural structures of states and
   their behavior in observing the criteria of human rights. The Security
   Council as an organ, established for keeping Peace and Security has
   experienced great opposition to the sovereignty of states by using human
   rights rules as an alibi, and even has paved the way for military
   intervention. Normally, material breach of the human rights criteria and
   fundamental liberties can endanger the international peace and security.
   In this type of situations, the issue can be discussed in the Security
   Council with the request of the general assembly and the general
   secretary. IF the Security Council confirms a threat consequent to the
   material violation of human rights rules, it can enforce the required
   actions, regarding its obligations and authorities. The intervention of
   the Security Council as a representative of the international community
   with regard to taking decisions for humanitarian intervention in the
   context of the responsibility to protect and denying the absolute
   sovereignty of states on one hand and encouraging the states to
   guarantee the observance of civil rights of people and enabling them in
   the field of public welfare and even military intervention and
   protecting nations against tragedies such as genocide, crimes against
   humanity and war crimes, on the other hand are significant challenges.
   Although the responsibility to protect is practiced in the direction of
   legitimate intervention in the domestic affairs of sovereign nation -
   states with the objective of protecting humanitarian rules, actually
   after 2001, the chances for humanitarian measures have been decreased.
   In this article, we will examine this issue that from the beginning of
   the third millennium what effects, the concept of responsibility to
   protect has had by limiting the sovereignty of states and redefining it,
   aligned with the humanitarian intervention by the Security Council?},

Abstract = {In insurance, terms and conditions by insurers at the end of proposal
   forms or insurance contracts will be included in print that the insured
   has confirmed the authenticity of answer to questions and provided

   If an inaccuracy of those announcements proves later, insurer regardless
   of the importance of statements in acceptance of the risk or
   determination of the premium can disclaim based on this clause himself
   and avoid the contract. The basis of condition clause is emerged from
   common law and also used in insurance law of Iran. This condition in
   that system after decades that has been criticized faced with notable
   changes. In this article, the issue, nature and consequences of the
   basis of contract clause is studied, not to use such expressions and
   conditions in proposal forms but insurance contract is suggested since
   it leads to injustice against the insured.},

Abstract = {There are more than three million Syrians living in Turkey today. This
   demographic shift is quickly changing the economic and political
   landscape across the Turkey-Syria border. In the decades to come, Turkey
   will have to integrate a sizable, mostly urban, Arabic-speaking
   minority. This paper traces the nascent social, political, and economic
   dynamics of this process. We identify aspects of the Syrian experience
   in Turkey that resemble the waves of post-World War II immigration to
   Europe, most notably the ghettoization in major cities. We also see some
   aspects that are unique to this case, such as the role of Syrians in the
   Turkish economy, and conclude by reflecting on the implications of this
   demographic shift for Europe.},

Abstract = {Appearing of forcible events or other reasons which hinder the
   performance of contract or cause its frustration has special legal
   effects and destroy the casual link between the obligator and the loss
   resulting from its non-performance. In this situation, these reasons
   affect the structure of contract and possibly may cause the discharge or
   suspension of contract. Therefore, the effect of occurring this kind of
   excuse are twofold. One of the important consequences of occurring this
   event is the exemption of the obligator from contractual responsibility,
   because, the non-performance is not attributed to him. The other effect
   is that force majeure changes the structure of the contract. A contract
   that encounters to force majeure may be discharged forcibly or willingly
   or its performance suspended. Our purpose in this article is to review
   these effects.},

Journal = {REVISTA ESPANOLA DE CIENCIA POLITICA-RECP},
Year = {2017},
Number = {43},

Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {This article aims to understand the limits on the expansion of the
   public space that is occurring through democratic innovations, and to
   investigate strategies for overcoming these limits. With an approach
   rooted in standpoint epistemology, this article studies the
   participation experiences of sixteen women belonging to a feminist
   subaltern counterpublic in fifteen apparatuses in the Autonomous Region
   of the Basque Country. The study considers that this expansion of the
   public space has taken place with three limits, related to the
   de-legitimisation of the private, the undervaluation of relational
   aspects and the naturalization of a universal idea of participation.
   Opposing this, the article states that the practice of counterpublics
   facilitates greater inclusion in the designs of democratic innovations
   due to those parallel publics' subaltern position in the public space.},

Abstract = {Almost two decades since conflict broke out between the Republic of
   Azerbaijan and Armenia, two northern neighbors of Iran, in Nagorno -
   Karabakh region. Although military conflict in this region has minimized
   with the existing ceasefire, and reaching a sustainable agreement is
   likely to be happened by the two parties. Close regional and
   international cooperation seems necessary more than ever in order to
   reduce conflict in Nagorno Karabakh region. The main objective of this
   study is to give a thorough presentation of the regional and
   international cooperation in order to reduce Nagorno - Karabakh regional
   issues and hazards. Hereunder is the main question raised by the
   researcher: ``To what extent regional and international cooperation is
   effective in reducing Nagorno - Karabakh conflict?{''} The hypothesis of
   the present study is that the interrelated nature of security in the
   international system and Caucasus region causes convergence among
   neighboring countries to reduce conflict in Caucasus and Nagorno
   Karabakh regions. Taking advantage of the analytic - descriptive method
   and also benefiting from reliable and authentic sources, it can be
   concluded that the interdependence of threat will lead to the increased
   mutual costs in this study. This issue will cause formation of
   convergence in the Caucasus region, so that it will lead to the reduced
   conflict and tension in Nagorno - Karabakh region.},

Journal = {STATE CRIME},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {6},
Number = {1},

Abstract = {Afghanistan constitutes a good example of how the absence of
   transitional justice measures leads human rights violators of past
   regimes to remain in positions of power with impunity and to continue to
   engage in other forms of crimes. In particular, this article focuses on
   land grabbing as a form of economic-state crime in the country. Relying
   on data gathered from fieldwork in Kabul in 2013 and 2014, we illustrate
   that economic crime, which is instigated, supported and carried out by
   the state apparatus, is a form of state crime, which criminology needs
   to address more seriously. Criminological literature on socio-economic
   rights violations as a form of economic and thus state crime is very
   limited, particularly in conflict and post-conflict situations. By
   focusing on economic-state crime in the (post-) conflict situation of
   Afghanistan, we aim at bridging the classical divide between
   transitional justice studies on one hand and criminology on the other
   hand.},

Abstract = {I contend that the popular `mini-publics' approach to implementing
   deliberation in practice is unable to realize deliberative democracy in
   a way that fulfills the deliberative democratic standard of legitimacy.
   Deliberative democratic legitimacy requires citizens to actively claim
   their right to justification against government authorities, which the
   capacity of mini-public deliberation to serve authorities sidelines or
   even undermines. I propose an alternative account of deliberative
   democracy with an eye specifically to legitimacy: deliberative democracy
   as a political culture. On this view, it is cultural aspects (the ethos,
   social norms and self-understandings that shape and constrain political
   processes), not institutional specificities, that are decisive for
   deliberation fulfilling its legitimacy ambition. Deliberative democratic
   theory ought to conceptualize ways of opening up social and political
   space for widespread citizen-led engagement and critical scrutiny of
   authorities, rather than striving for the development of institutional
   short-cuts.},

Abstract = {Does an increase in naval power increase the likelihood of interstate
   disputes? While volumes have been written on the importance of naval
   power, we are left with little more than intuition and anecdotal
   evidence to provide potential answers to this question. Endogeneity
   issues in particular make it difficult to untangle the links between
   developing naval power and interstate conflict. Here I present a new
   instrument for naval power. Utilizing a new dataset of naval power and
   employing an instrumental variable analysis, I present one of the first
   large cross-national studies showing a significant link between naval
   power and a specific type of interstate conflict - non-contiguous
   disputes. The findings have implications for the future actions of
   states whose naval strength is growing.},

   gains from posturing. Findings provide new insights to how preferences
   and power distribution affect individuals' incentives to be informed

Abstract = {The literature on party system fragmentation emphasizes how political
   institutions and social cleavages shape the long-term development of the
   party system, but short-term swings in economic performance could change
   the level of electoral fragmentation by affecting the concentration of
   the vote in the executive. Time series data from presidential elections
   in 59 countries and from district-level legislative election contests in
   22 countries show that a growing economy is negatively associated with
   the effective number of parties winning votes: a strong economy leads to
   a slight reduction in fragmentation as the ruling party consolidates its
   rule while a weak economy tends to disperse votes among alternatives to
   it. But the effect of economic performance relative to political
   institutions and the incumbency advantage is at the margins. The modest
   size of this effect should remind scholars of the limits of the economy
   as an overall driver of voter choice. Keywords: Economic Voting, Party
   System Fragmentation, Duverger's Hypothesis. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {Current thinking on the origins and size of the welfare state often
   ignores household relations in which people may depend on others for
   income or have dependents themselves. The influence of ``dependency
   status{''} on individuals' political preferences is unknown. We report
   results from a laboratory experiment designed to estimate the effect of
   dependency on preferences for policies that insure against labor market
   risk. Results indicate that (1) willingness to vote in favor of a social
   insurance policy is highly responsive to unemployment risk, (2)
   symmetric, mutual dependence is unrelated to support for insurance, but
   (3) asymmetric dependence (being dependent on someone else) increases
   support for social insurance. We connect our lab results to
   observational survey data and find similar relationships.},

Title = {Dual Citizenship Allowance and Migration Flow: An Origin Story},
Journal = {COMPARATIVE POLITICAL STUDIES},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {50},
Number = {1, SI},
Pages = {133-167},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {What effect does variation in dual citizenship policies of both sending
   and receiving societies have on bilateral migration flow? Employing a
   modified gravity model, we use a new dual citizenship database to
   examine the effects of allowance within 14 Organisation for Economic
   Co-Operation and Development (OECD) receiving states and more than 100
   sending states between 1980 and 2006. We show that
   dual-citizenship-allowing sending states experience significantly more
   migration than dual-citizenship-forbidding sending states. We also find
   a significant increase in migration flow in receiving states that allow
   for dual citizenship, consistent with previous research. Finally,
   interaction effects reveal highest flow between sending and receiving
   states allowing dual citizenship and lowest flow between forbidding
   sending states and allowing receiving states. These findings emphasize

Year = {2017},
Volume = {10},
Number = {1},
Pages = {55-70},
Abstract = {Republicans define domination as subjection to arbitrary power. But what
   is arbitrary power? We consider three views. According to the first,
   championed recently by Frank Lovett, power is arbitrary insofar as it is
   unconstrained. According to the second, advanced most prominently by
   Philip Pettit in his recent work, power is arbitrary insofar as it is
   uncontrolled by those subject to it. According to the third, found
   (among other places) in Pettit's early work, power is arbitrary insofar
   as it is not forced to track the interests of those subject to it. We
   advance several objections against each of the first two views and offer
   support for the third. Pettit, we might say, got it right the first
   time.},

Pages = {185-199},
Abstract = {Textbook content is a powerful indicator of what is and is not
   considered important in a given discipline. Textbooks shape both
   curriculum and students' thinking about a subject. The extant literature
   indicates that gender is not well represented in American government
   textbooks, thus signaling to students that women and gender are not part
   of the mainstream in political science. I contribute to this literature
   by using quantitative and qualitative content analysis to examine gender
   mainstreaming in 10 introductory political science textbooks. I find
   that the quantity of gendered content is small, and the quality of that
   content varies considerably from text to text.},

Abstract = {When Vincenzo Bellini died in 1835, the sculptor Dantan took a mold of
   his face in order to preserve the features of the great Italian composer
   for future generations. The operation was carried out a second time in
   Catania forty-two years later, when the musician's corpse was moved from
   Paris to Sicily. In order to explain Bellini's musical genius with
   regards to the structure of the skull and his facial features, both
   molds were subject to various phrenological studies which highlighted
   the predominance of the faculties of tune and benevolence. By analyzing
   contemporary texts, we will frame ``the Bellini case{''} in the
   historical context of phrenological studies on Italian, and more widely
   European composers, that aimed to scientifically explain the origins of
   musical genius.},

Abstract = {The growing literature on diasporas'involvement in homeland conflicts
   shows that diasporas have the power to influence political, social and
   economic developments in their country of origin and residence. Although
   this is an emerging field of research, there is still much to discover
   about the roles that diasporas play in conflict resolution and
   transitional justice. This article intends to fill this gap by
   scrutinising the Kurdish Diaspora as a case study. It explores the
   intricacies of integrating diasporas into conflict resolution by
   analysing approaches of homeland actors and fragments within diaspora
   throughout the different stages of the peace processes.},

Abstract = {Sometimes governments choose to include ordinary people at some stage of
   the policy making process by setting up temporary and structured arenas
   where participants are put in a position whereby they can deliberate on
   public issues and make decisions or propose suggestions. Do such
   deliberative arenas depoliticize democracy, as a vast amount of
   literature suggests? This article is aimed at challenging this point of
   view, by giving a close look at two cases of democratic experimentation.
   An analysis of what actually happens in those venues shows that such
   arenas appear to display, at the same time, both unpolitical and
   political features. On one hand, they are nonmajoritarian bodies, just
   like other depoliticized venues, but on the other, they deal with
   conflicts and discuss goals, and thus perform typical political
   activities. It is possible to say that they are neither completely
   political nor completely unpolitical. They instead have a hybrid nature
   that can counteract the continuous fluctuations between (hyper)
   politicization and (hyper) depoliticization that are so typical of our
   times. This implies a revision of the standard theory of
   politicization/depoliticization that does not consider the possibility
   of gray areas. Overcoming the rigid opposition between the two terms of
   the dichotomy can lead to the discovery of some interesting
   possibilities that often tend to be overlooked.},

Abstract = {We introduce experimental research design to the study of policy
   diffusion in order to better understand how political ideology affects
   policymakers' willingness to learn from one another's experiences. Our
   two experiments-embedded in national surveys of U.S. municipal
   officials-expose local policymakers to vignettes describing the zoning
   and home foreclosure policies of other cities, offering opportunities to
   learn more. We find that: (1) policymakers who are ideologically
   predisposed against the described policy are relatively unwilling to
   learn from others, but (2) such ideological biases can be overcome with
   an emphasis on the policy's success or on its adoption by co-partisans
   in other communities. We also find a similar partisan-based bias among
   traditional ideological supporters, who are less willing to learn from
   those in the opposing party. The experimental approach offered here
   provides numerous new opportunities for scholars of policy diffusion.},

Abstract = {The existence of authoritarian elections raises a number of questions
   regarding the strategies of political opposition. What explains the
   choice of strategy among key opponents of a regime? What determines when
   opposition groups willingly participate in elections and when they
   engage in electoral boycott? To understand the opposition's strategic
   choices, we develop a formal model of government-opposition interaction
   under authoritarianism. We contribute to the literature on election
   boycotts in emphasizing the effect of uncertainty about the strength of
   the regime on strategic decisions. The model produces predictions for
   several key features of authoritarian elections, including the decision
   to participate, boycott, and mobilize against the regime. Importantly
   and uniquely, the model provides an explanation for variation in
   opposition strategies within a particular country. Using the case of
   Jordan, we illustrate how the results of the model can be used to
   explain variation in opposition strategy across parliamentary elections.},

   contemporary terrorism issues},
Journal = {BEHAVIORAL SCIENCES OF TERRORISM AND POLITICAL AGGRESSION},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {9},
Number = {2},
Pages = {78-105},
Abstract = {Terrorism is considered to be a very contemporary issue and it came
   under the limelight only after 9/11. Yet when looking at the history of
   studies on terrorism and political violence, it is possible to trace
   back documentations from the nineteenth century. This paper looks at how
   Lombroso researched and studied political violence and terror in the
   nineteenth century. Although Lombroso is mainly known for his claims
   concerning the origins of criminal behaviour, he was among the first to
   use social science to understand anarchist political violence. In his
   work on anarchists, he proposed that the reasons behind anarchist
   violence would be found in social conditions, psychological states and
   religious grievances. He developed techniques to study these links, such
   as combining information from maps and statistical data over time to
   examine the likelihood of revolts occurring in particular regions of the
   country and to develop specific countermeasures. This study compared
   Lombroso's work with perspectives of academics on studies of terrorism,
   as well as those of policy-makers and security professionals in the
   implementation of security policies and potentially counterterrorism
   measures. This paper also compares the perspective of a current
   extremist actor to underlying political violence factors identified in
   Lombroso's work.},

Journal = {AFRICAN JOURNAL ON CONFLICT RESOLUTION},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {17},
Number = {2},
Pages = {117-142},
Abstract = {Violent conflicts continue to be a major feature of much of Africa's
   political landscape. Not only are Africa's conflicts increasing, but
   they are also interpreted and theorised in varied ways, with irreducible
   discrepancies. In the dominant literature, ethnicity, religion,
   resources, territory, poor governance, and the struggle for power, among
   others, have been identified as the major causes of violent conflict on
   the continent. This paper, a broad brush that raises more questions than
   answers, argues that, underlying these apparent causes of violent
   conflict is the undying desire for happiness. It concludes by
   paraphrasing Von Clausewitz's dictum that war in Africa is a pursuit of
   happiness by other means and, therefore, to prevent it, policy should
   promote popular happiness.},

Journal = {CRITICAL STUDIES ON TERRORISM},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {10},
Number = {1},
Pages = {162-186},
Abstract = {The phenomenon of foreign fighters has become a central issue to the
   ongoing conflict in Syria. This article explores how members of the
   public answer the question `Why do British citizens join the conflict in
   Syria' on social media sites and in response to online news articles.
   Building upon research on everyday narratives of security and terrorism,
   we analyse 807 comments, and in doing so, we argue that online comments
   are important in producing the discursive environment for making sense
   of British foreign fighters and what should be done in response to them.
   We find that there is a tendency to view British foreign fighters as
   being purely motivated by religion, and there is also a belief that
   British foreign fighters should be responded to through exceptional
   measures. We discuss the implications of such perceptions, and we
   highlight how problematic misconceptions about Islam and Muslims are not
   just disseminated through elite and media discourse, but through
   everyday narratives published by members of the public online.},

   period},

Abstract = {The flourishing of nativist political sentiments during the recent
   United States presidential election has resulted in popular speculation
   about who is, and who is not, a `real' American. Foreign-born citizens'
   struggles to forge a sense of civic belonging amid fears of national
   disloyalty have significant precedent. This article examines one such
   historical episode, which centres on a claims commission established
   between the United States and Turkey during the interwar period. The
   American-Turkish Claims Commission was intended to aid the resumption of
   diplomatic relations between the two nations through the resolution of
   private claims. For the hundreds of Armenian-Americans who filed claims,
   the Commission provided an unparalleled opportunity to seek their new
   government's assistance in claiming compensation from the Republic of
   Turkey for losses incurred during the Armenian genocide. However, such
   faith was unwarranted, as the United States excluded from consideration
   all of the claims made by American citizens who were former Ottoman
   subjects. This article examines the reasons behind the exclusion of
   these claims and raises questions as to how immigrant communities can
   overcome the narrowing of what it means to be American both on the world
   stage and at home.},

Abstract = {Alexander Wendt's Quantum Mind and Social Science is an effort to
   establish foundations of social science based on the ontology of modern
   physics. The quantum revolution has deservedly had repercussions in many
   sciences, but it is unwise to ground social science on physical
   theories, which are subject to constant revision. Additionally, despite
   its empirical success, there is no agreed-upon interpretation of quantum
   theory. Finally, even if there were, the random indeterminacy intrinsic
   to the quantum world cannot account for the intentionality of human
   action. Intentional agents act for reasons, not at random; nor are the
   reasons chosen at random.},

Abstract = {The degree to which citizens perceive democratic political institutions
   as trustworthy indicates how well these institutions translate the
   citizenry's interests into public policy and how effective and
   accountable they are seen to be. Low levels of public confidence in
   political institutions are an indicator of various political problems
   and are likely to raise concerns over democratic governance. Recent
   findings that trust in major political institutions has fallen over the
   last quarter of a century in many democracies have led scholars to
   examine individual and institutional factors associated with political
   confidence. Aiming to contribute to this burgeoning literature, this
   study investigates the impact of semi-presidentialism on public
   confidence in two major political institutions: the government and
   parliament. Testing our arguments in 29 democracies through a multilevel
   analysis, we have found that, compared to presidential and parliamentary
   systems, semi-presidentialism often generates dual-legitimacy problems,
   thereby reducing confidence in both government and parliament.},

Abstract = {This article focuses on the formation of memory in relation to the mass
   violence of the years 1965/68 in Semarang. This port city offers a
   unique opportunity for studying both the violence of 1965/68 and its
   long-term effects from a local to a global level. Once nicknamed the
   ``red city{''} and famous for its Chinese community, the events of
   ``1965{''} deeply affected the city. Many (alleged) communists from
   Semarang were sent to prison camps in other parts of Indonesia, while
   many members of the Chinese community sought refuge abroad. As a result,
   the mass violence in Semarang continues to reverberate not only in the
   city, but also throughout and beyond Indonesia. The article is based on
   the results of two workshops in Semarang, during which a group of
   Indonesian students studied the memory landscapes of ``1965{''} by
   combining oral history with site observations. The central question is
   how the memory of violence, shaped primarily by everyday interaction and
   communication, relates on the one hand to the urban space in which the
   violence largely took place, and on the other hand to the official state
   narratives that deliberately created memory gaps regarding this
   violence. We focus on three sites representative of different aspects of
   the mass violence of the years 1965/68 in Semarang: the Sarekat Islam
   building, the Mangkang mass grave and the Chinese Karang Turi school.
   Scrutinizing these three sites has taught us that people in Semarang
   make sense of ``1965{''} through stories and activities that, while
   interacting with the official narratives, include the missing and the
   dead. Communism might have been ``crushed{''} with success, but the
   Indonesian state clearly failed to eradicate the memory of
   state-supported anti-communist violence.},

Abstract = {On 9 May 2015, millions of people in Russia marched through the streets
   carrying enlarged photos of former Red Army soldiers. The ``Immortal
   Regiment{''} march, which has now become an annual event, is more than
   just a new form of remembrance of the Great Patriotic War. It is a
   succinct reminder of several key issues facing Russian society today.
   The idea for the march came from within society, with the loosely
   coordinated initiatives aiming to offer relatives an opportunity to
   express their grief for those they had lost. However, the state
   recognised the potential of such an event and exploited it to its own
   benefit. Private remembrance is now used to oil the wheels of the
   regime. Trauma is converted into triumph, and grief into aggression.
   This social movement, the authenticity of which has now become a mere
   simulation, serves to legitimise the Putin regime and its policy of
   violence in the post-Soviet space.},

Abstract = {If the `move to the left' in the 2000s in Argentina and Brazil was the
   result of a longer process of contentious mobilization from below,
   enacted primarily during the latter part of the previous decade, what
   kind of social imaginaries have been enacted in the newest wave of
   discontent and what is its likely effect on the post-neoliberal form of
   governance? The argument put forward here is that the newest wave of
   social protest elicits the re-enactment of the liberal imaginary
   indirectly expressed under the notion of the republic. This operation
   tends to undermine the bases of post-neoliberalism, i.e. `the popular',
   `the national-popular' and `anti-neoliberalism: the imaginaries that
   defined the move to the left in the region. A new activated public,
   associated with middle-class sectors, raises new demands and does not
   identify with the `anti-neoliberal' camp. Inasmuch as this activation
   entails a dispute over the name of the people, it signals a slowdown in
   the efficacy existing populist formations possess to deepen the movement
   towards more radical reforms.},

Abstract = {This article presents two decades in the development of EU
   Counter-piracy policy. The development and its dynamics is explored
   through multiple streams approach as introduced by John W. Kingdon
   (1995) and adapted for application on the EU counter-terrorism policy by
   the Raphael Bossong (2013). For the purposes of analysis the article
   deals with the securitization of the piracy within the EU context (first
   stream), continues with policy development at the EU level (second
   stream) and adds complexity to the issue by analyzing the stream of
   politics (third stream). The main aim of this article is to present
   different dynamics in the development of EU counter-piracy policy which
   developed from fragmented preventive approach to very complex pro-active
   approach with the turning point in 2008. The article claims, that full
   securitization of piracy penetrated national politics within key EU
   member states and enabled policy changes on the EU level.},

Abstract = {Does modern mass consciousness actually exist? To answer this question
   L. Fishman draws attention to a paradox in social studies. On the one
   hand, mass consciousness is known to stem from everyday routine, on the
   other hand, the studies of real mass consciousness tend to focus on its
   superficial manifestations determined by political ideologies, ephemeral
   states of mind, manipulative influence of the mass media, etc. Moreover,
   most popular socio-philosophical concepts describe Modernity as devoid
   of its own constants of being. Hence, it becomes impossible to single
   out modern mass consciousness, which succumbs to the association with
   pre-modern heritage. Fishman offers an alternative approach to studying
   modern mass consciousness as determined by lifestyle in technogenic
   environment and uses Russian and foreign realities to analyze some
   elements of this consciousness.},

Abstract = {Over the past 20 years, the Defence Medical Services (DMS, the umbrella
   organisation for medical provision within the British armed forces) has
   been innovating consistently and at pace within the Ministry of Defence.
   The result of this sustained effort has led to progressive improvement
   in the outcomes of the critically injured. Separately, it has also led
   to global transformational innovation in support of the response to the
   Ebola epidemic in Sierra Leone. Through planned and orchestrated
   interventions across the entire organisation, from leadership to
   technology, medical practices to training and organisational design, the
   DMS can legitimately claim to have achieved a `Revolution in Military
   Medical Affairs'. Matthew Ford, Timothy Hodgetts and David Williams
   examine the innovation lifecycle within the DMS as it defines its
   response to the challenges of the changing character of conflict and
   consider the way defence medicine is an example to the wider military.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF ELECTIONS PUBLIC OPINION AND PARTIES},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {27},

Abstract = {Previous research has shown that voters' perception of electoral
   fairness has an impact on their attitudes and behaviors. However, less
   research has attempted to link objective measurements of electoral
   integrity on voters' attitudes about the democratic process. Drawing on
   data from the Comparative Study of Electoral Systems and the Quality of
   Elections Data, we investigate whether cross-national differences in
   electoral integrity have significant influences on citizens' level of
   satisfaction with democracy. We hypothesize that higher levels of
   observed electoral fraud will have a negative impact on evaluations of
   the democratic process, and that this effect will be mediated by a
   respondent's status as a winner or loser of an election. The article's
   main finding is that high levels of electoral fraud are indeed linked to
   less satisfaction with democracy. However, we show that winning only
   matters in elections that are conducted in an impartial way. The moment
   elections start to display the telltale signs of manipulation and
   malpractice, winning and losing no longer have different effects on
   voter's levels of satisfaction with democracy.},

Abstract = {Labour norms are increasingly considered in trade relations, but is the
   protection of labour standards a necessary condition for export to the
   EU? A Qualitative Comparative Analysis, based on countries that export
   pineapples to the EU, shows that labour standards protection matters in
   combination with distance, zero tariffs and institutional quality in a
   number of cases. However, for none of the cases was it a sufficient
   condition on its own for determining exports to the European market.
   Rather, we show that (1) having a zero tariff is necessary for a
   relatively large share of export to the EU, and (2) labour standards
   protection can make a difference when the institutional quality is weak
   in some African cases, in contrast to Latin American exporters.},

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL CRITICAL THOUGHT},

Volume = {7},

Abstract = {This article examines Althusser's rich analysis of the work of
   Machiavelli, looking particularly at his deployment of the term
   ``utopia{''} and ``utopianism{''} in his reading of the Florentine's
   work. More particularly the focus is on Althusser's use of the concept
   of the ``theoretical utopia{''} which in his text Machiavelli and Us he
   asserts is the definitive form of utopianism in Machiavelli's
   theoretical project. The issue is complicated by the fact that Althusser
   also says in Machiavelli and Us that there is nothing utopian in
   Machiavelli's work, and also because Machiavelli and Us is an unstable
   text published posthumously out of various drafts. A contrast is drawn
   between Althusser's negative use of the term utopian (drawn from a
   significant strand in the Marxist tradition) and his genuine admiration
   for the forward glance in the work of Machiavelli. A case is also made
   that the concept of the ``theoretical utopia{''} has genuine utility
   regardless of Althusser's actual intentions, and that Machiavelli's
   thoughts about the good society speak to important features of the
   modern world.},

Abstract = {The paper deals with the ideological position of a newly formed
   business-firm party called ANO in the contemporary political environment
   of the Czech Republic. Although the advent of the party was truly rapid
   and ANO is a fairly unique formation, it is possible to employ some
   conventional analytical tools to reveal the party's ideological
   position. Firstly, I show that ANO is a vote-seeking party and it is
   therefore possible to analyse it in accordance with a Downsian spatial
   modelling. Next, I describe a roll call analysis method that is able to
   objectively identify the party's ideological position based on
   legislators' parliamentary votes. After I form several hypotheses, a
   data set consisting of 8,559 roll calls of 215 members of the Chamber of
   Deputies is depicted. Finally, the results show that ANO is located in
   the ideological centre, closer to social democrats rather than to
   right-wing parties. Besides this, ANO covers a smaller ideological space
   compared to traditional political parties. Finally, the results do not
   anticipate a potential split of ANO in the near future since the party's
   legislators have acted cohesively in the parliament so far.},

Abstract = {This paper provides an empirical case through which to examine how
   debates about `birthright-based' national citizenship and
   residence-based local citizenship play out in the context of an
   indigenous emigrant population: Maori in Australia. Many Maori who are
   resident long-term or permanently in Australia are unable to participate
   in Australian federal or state elections because they are not Australian
   citizens. This disenfranchisement is only partially compensated by their
   ability to continue voting in New Zealand elections; data on the
   exercise by expatriate Maori of their external voting rights suggest
   that their levels of participation are even lower than those of other
   expatriate New Zealanders. This tension between territorial residence
   and formal membership as a basis for decision-making rights plays out in
   another way for expatriate Maori, in relation to tribal decision-making.
   Generally speaking, whakapapa (genealogical) descent from a common
   ancestor gives rise to a right to vote in tribal elections. However,
   some influential observers have cautioned against giving scattered
   tribal members too much say in tribal decision-making, especially
   vis-a-vis those who keep the home fires burning. This suggests that, as
   the scale of the Maori diaspora grows ever larger, there will be ongoing
   debates about the voting rights of tribal members overseas.},

Abstract = {This paper analyses under what conditions parties engage in
   parliamentary scrutiny of the European Union's Common Foreign and
   Security Policy. With insights from comparative literature on
   parliamentary oversight, two main incentives are identified. On the one
   hand, opposition parties initiate scrutiny to reduce their information
   asymmetry vis-a-vis the government; on the other hand, coalition parties
   use parliamentary scrutiny to control their partners. Empirically, the
   article uses information on scrutiny activities in six EU member states
   (Germany, France, Italy, Poland, Slovakia, United Kingdom) covering 13
   years and 21 governments. The findings suggest that opposition parties
   scrutinise the government if they have access to strong oversight
   instruments. In contrast, the strength of oversight instruments is not
   important for coalition partners. They resort to means of scrutiny if
   the leading minister is weak. Coalitions with a greater number of
   parties engage in scrutiny less often. Moreover, scrutiny is especially
   observed in questions with more direct distributional consequences
   ('intermestic' issues).},

Journal = {CRITICAL STUDIES ON TERRORISM},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {10},
Number = {1},
Pages = {1-21},
Abstract = {This article examines the first three literary reactions to Fenian
   terrorism: Robert Louis Stevenson and Fanny van de Grift Stevenson's
   co-written novel, The Dynamiter (1885); Tom Greer's A Modern Daedalus
   (1885) and Henry James' The Princess Casamassima (1886). Although these
   works approach terrorism from different angles, they set the pattern for
   subsequent treatments that will ``give primary voice to the perspective
   of the terrorist{''}. ``Zero{''}, the hapless bomb-makers in The
   Dynamiter, is a surprisingly urbane, sympathetic figure; Greer
   illustrates both the necessity and the moral quandaries of terrorism and
   James shows considerable sympathy for anarchism's causes, even though
   terrorism threatens high art and culture. I also hope to show that
   fiction can provide excellent source material for studying the cultural
   imaginary of terrorism and, by extension, make a bid for the inclusion
   of literature scholars under the umbrella of Critical Terrorism Studies.},

Volume = {40},

Abstract = {Research on legislative. executive relations in foreign affairs has
   generally assumed that parliaments are more active in `intermestic'
   affairs than in traditional foreign policy issues. This paper revisits
   this assumption by examining whether parliaments in European countries
   scrutinise crucial decisions on a typical intermestic domain: external
   energy policy and, more specifically, intergovernmental agreements
   (IGAs) on energy. Contrary to the expectation, the study finds high
   variation in the level of parliamentary scrutiny across and within
   countries. To account for this variation, the paper focuses on the role
   of issue framing, particularly the impact of securitising and/or
   depoliticising moves by members of parliament and government. The paper
   argues that, in contrast to traditional foreign policy matters,
   securitisation attempts in areas with a strong economic component are
   likely to increase politicisation and hence also parliamentary
   engagement. Conversely, parliamentary disengagement is likely to come
   from the opposite dynamics: successful depoliticisation of governmental
   responsibilities.},

Title = {IDEALISM AS AN INTEGRAL PART OF LIBERAL THEORY OF INTERNATIONAL
   RELATIONS},
Journal = {POLITICKE VEDY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {20},
Number = {3},
Pages = {70-94},
Abstract = {The liberal theory of international relations is one of the three
   paradigms that are considered to dominate the science on international
   relations. However, the critique of liberalism and discussions on its
   nature as an IRT are constantly reappearing in academic discourse. When
   criticized from a realist perspective, liberalism is dubbed to lack
   continuity and core features, to be considered as a full-fledged theory.
   Although this critique is based on a relatively narrow perception of the
   evolution of liberalism in international relations that started no late
   then 1950s.The dominate discourse in international relations almost
   completely ignores the important and formative face of the science on IR
   that could be dated to the beginning of 20th Century and it is called
   idealism.. The main aim of this article is therefore to look at this
   specific period, re-read books and studies of three selected authors
   published mainly in Great Britain and introduce arguments explaining the
   important position of idealism in liberal paradigm proving that concepts
   analysed by late 20th Century liberal scholars could be found and were
   analysed already before the WWI. Depending on the scope and aim, the
   article uses mainly critical analysis of existing rather biased
   evaluation of idealist period. In drawing the connections and
   conclusions deductive as well as inductive reasoning are applied. If the
   international relations paradigm is based on well elaborated concepts
   and features used to explain and understand processes that are
   happening, then we can conclude that idealism represents an important
   feature of liberal paradigm. Concepts dominating the current research in
   liberalism such as interdependency, democratic peace, cooperation in
   multiple areas, institutionalization of international relations, etc.
   they all have appeared and were elaborated into a certain extend in the
   books and studies published well before, throughout, and after the WWI.
   Therefore the idealist period could be seen as a stepping stone of
   liberal international relations theory, which has now over a hundred
   years long continuity.},

Abstract = {It is generally assumed that the October Revolution resulted from the
   misery suffered by the workers and peasants. In fact, however, it was
   not so much the social aspect but the national issue that made communism
   so attractive for hundreds of millions of people during the 20th
   century. Capitalism was regarded not only as the cause of inequality and
   exploitation, but also of devastating wars. Lenin had promised to build
   entirely new relationships between states and peoples. Yet the national
   federalism and internationalism of the Bolsheviks was nothing more than
   a tactical manoeuvre. The Stalinist terror, including against entire
   peoples, discredited communism. The yearning and the search for
   inner-state and international order, which permits peaceful relations
   between the peoples, is still alive today.},

Title = {Back to the populist future?: understanding nostalgia in contemporary
   ideological discourse},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF POLITICAL IDEOLOGIES},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {22},
Number = {3},
Pages = {256-273},
Abstract = {Nostalgia is regularly depicted as an indication of a flawed political
   argument or allegiance, and framed as a virus more likely to take hold
   in places that are `left behind'. Its prevalence has been linked to the
   rise of populism in Western politics, the vote for Brexit and the
   election of Donald Trump. This paper seeks to challenge the normative
   depiction of nostalgia as an alien presence within `normal' political
   discourse, and critically evaluates theoretical attempts to distinguish
   between positive and negative forms of it. Instead, it sets out to
   explore some of the different affective, sentimental and ideational
   roles that various kinds of nostalgia practice perform, and highlights
   the particular importance of forms of political argument that accuse
   opponents of nostalgia while simultaneously employing some of its
   prevalent modalities and motifs. The paper finishes by exploring these
   themes in relation to the career and ideas of the iconoclastic and
   populist British politician, Enoch Powell.},

Title = {How Asian countries understand policy experiment as policy pilots?},
Journal = {ASIAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {25},
Number = {3},
Pages = {253-265},
Abstract = {Policymaking based on the classical experimental design is regarded as a
   golden rule in the field of public policy. Despite the methodological
   superiority of randomized control experiment, the practices of policy
   experiment differ across countries, reflecting the different intentions
   of policymakers. This paper reviews how policy experiments are practised
   in Asian countries, especially Korea, China, and Singapore. As our
   review suggests, the term `policy pilot' is preferred to `experiment' as
   the former is considered as an exemplar proposed by the central
   government. At the same time, the selection of pilot sites depends on
   central government's political and practical (rather than
   methodological) consideration. Moreover, the utilization of policy
   pilots does not solely depend on the success of the pilot programme or
   the effect size per se. As the policymaking process is a complex
   endeavour involving multiple streams of actors, resources, and
   solutions, Asian countries use policy pilot results to get ideas on how
   different actors respond to policy, instead of a determinant of policy
   decision. Therefore, we conclude that Asian countries emphasize less the
   rigorousness of experimental design than the possibility of pragmatic
   utilization of policy pilots.},

Abstract = {C The October Revolution was intended to liberate Russia from Czarist
   rule, and led to the establishment of a totalitarian order. In her book
   about the American and French revolutions, Hannah Arendt presents a
   theory of the failure and success of revolutions. When the
   revolutionaries see themselves as executors of a legitimacy of progress,
   or when the revolution promises to fulfil basic human needs, then it
   will lead to tyranny rather than freedom. This applies to France in
   1789, to Russia in 1917, and to all states in which the alleged
   revolutionaries incite attacks on democratic institutions in the name of
   the people.},

Abstract = {Under the favorable institutional and sociocultural conditions, an
   individual who holds presidential office strives for authoritarian rule,
   trying to achieve permanent and almost unlimited powers. M.Krasnov
   proposes to view this process as ``monarchization{''} of president and
   turns to the analysis of the ideological legitimation of the regime of
   personal power. In his opinion, such legitimization is based on the
   representation of the ruler as ``the father of the nation{''}. Although
   authoritarian rulers are often called, both officially and unofficially,
   leaders and alike, ultimately ``the father of the nation{''} seems to be
   a more appropriate term. Contrary to the traditional explanations of the
   origins of this phenomenon based on either patriarchal family or
   biological and psychological features of a human, Krasnov states that
   the need for paternalism is embedded in the very social nature of a man
   and the roots of this need lie in the act of Divine creation.},

Abstract = {This essay examines two single-system approaches to the integration of
   demand, and develops a diachronic approach that integrates two meanings
   of Marx's ``socially necessary labor time.{''} A one-commodity model of
   simple reproduction, illustrating how a change in aggregate demand from
   one period to the next affects the determination of value and exchange
   value, is used to contrast the simultaneous single-system interpretation
   of the relationship between values and prices with the temporal
   single-system interpretation. The simultaneous approach is correct to
   claim that value and exchange value are determined in reference to
   production and exchange in the current period; the temporal approach is
   correct to argue that it is necessary to refer to value magnitudes from
   the previous period and to theorize value's temporal transference
   between periods. Using a diachronic approach suggested by Marx, the
   relationship between value and exchange value can be consistently
   modeled over time according to variations in the level of demand.},

Abstract = {A rich literature argues that electoral incentives lead candidates to
   take ambiguous positions on issues. Furthermore, empirical research
   suggests that ambiguity does not repel -and may actually attract
   -voters. This work, however, equates choosing a candidate with paying
   the costs of voting for that candidate. We reconsider the relationship
   between candidate ambiguity and candidate preference moving beyond
   candidate choice and considering turnout as well. Integrating political
   science with research on consumer decision-making and psychology, we
   argue that many who select an ambiguous candidate do not translate that
   choice into an actual vote for that candidate. We test this argument
   using three experiments which incorporate costly voting and other
   electoral conditions heretofore absent from research on ambiguity.},

   explores the complex trust and political dynamics that form the local

Journal = {WEST EUROPEAN POLITICS},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {40},
Number = {2},
Pages = {357-377},
Abstract = {The left-right self-placement scale is often used in political science
   as a proxy for the policy positions of voters and parties. Yet studies
   have suggested that, for voters, this relation is dependent on education
   level. These studies were, however, hampered by data limitations and
   restricted statistical analyses. In addition, the extent to which the
   relation between the left-right self-placement scale and policy
   positions differs for parties and voters has not been explored. This
   article looks at the differential relation between left-right
   self-placement and policy positions for voters with different education
   levels on an integrated dataset containing over 50 voter and party
   policy positions. It is found that the left-right self-placement scale
   is a much better predictor for the policy positions of parties than it
   is for the policy preferences of voters. Robustness checks show that
   neither the saliency of the policy positions nor their complexity
   moderates these findings.},

Abstract = {This research note uses two case studies of Argentine provinces to
   develop a typology of clientelistic brokers. I identify a dirigente-type
   broker, who acts as an advocate of voters, and a puntero-type broker,
   who acts as a delegate of the patron. The clear differences between
   these two broker types point to greater diversity among clientelistic
   practices (such as monitoring and enforcing clientelistic exchanges)
   than is commonly acknowledged. I provide original evidence from 34
   open-ended interviews with local- and provincial-level elected officials
   that accounts for patron-broker dynamics in small, poor, and peripheral
   Argentine communities.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this essay is to analyze the relationship between hate
   and autonomy from Cornelius Castoriadis. We start from the idea that
   hatred is founding of every culture is as vital energy that powers the
   institution of ``otherness{''}. Hatred is the source of any link with
   the other, either as itself, like other real individuals or other
   companies. The text is divided into two sections in the first radicality
   of hatred is reviewed as a basis for the institution of the other; It
   argues that hatred is radical because it emanates all creation and
   otherness is constitutive of all socialization process because it
   establishes the other as a social imaginary institution. In a second
   stage the notion of autonomy is seen as affirmation of radical hatred;
   two qualities of autonomy, one that refers to the voluntary restraint or
   give himself the law itself, and the other is thinking or criticism
   about the meanings themselves are identified.},

Abstract = {In multilevel systems, organised interests, including business firms,
   can pursue their political goals at different levels. At the same time,
   national systems of interest representation provide important incentive
   structures for corporate political behaviour. In this context, corporate
   political strategy is guided by firms' perceptions of their relationship
   with policy-makers. If this relationship is under strain in one venue,
   firms shift their lobbying effort to alternative venues, subject to
   constraints reflecting national institutional legacies. Using survey
   data on 56 large German and British firms, the article investigates
   empirically how perceptions of governmentbusiness relations and national
   systems of interest representation interact to shape the political
   behaviour of large firms in multilevel systems. The analysis shows that
   perceived conflict with public authorities at the national level leads
   to increased business lobbying at the EU level. Furthermore, national
   types of interest representation shape relative business engagement at
   the EU level as well as the readiness of firms to shift venue.},

Abstract = {Working towards the diagnosis of the obsolescence of sociology's
   classical concepts, this paper addresses the notion of ``ideology{''},
   and clarifies its meaning within the work of the two leading exponents

   both interpretations are compared looking for similarities and
   differences, so as to obtain a systematic view on this subject for this
   stream. Finally, it evaluates whether their respective
   conceptualizations shed light on the relevance of ``ideology{''} for the
   analysis of contemporary societies.},

Journal = {CRITICAL REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL SOCIAL AND POLITICAL PHILOSOPHY},

Volume = {20},
Number = {2},
Pages = {143-162},
Abstract = {Liberal neutrality is assumed to pertain to rival conceptions of the
   good. The nature of the rivalry between conceptions of the good is
   pivotal to the coherence, scope and realisation of liberal neutrality.
   Yet, liberal theorists have said very little about rivalry. This paper
   attempts to fill this gap by reviewing three conceptions of rivalry:
   incompatibility rivalry, intra-domain rivalry and state power rivalry. I
   argue that state power rivalry is the morally relevant conception of
   rivalry, and that it has significant implications for the scope and
   realisation of liberal neutrality. I conclude that in the light of state
   power rivalry, the only feasible liberal neutral state is a very minimal
   one.},

Abstract = {This article investigates how activists employ Information and
   Communication Technologies (ICTs) and engage with data-activism in
   grassroots struggles against corruption. Based on a comparative research
   design that triangulates three qualitative data sources - in-depth
   interviews, movements' documents and participatory platforms - the
   article analyses two campaigns: Riparte il Futuro in Italy and 15MpaRato
   in Spain. In so doing, the article casts light on how activists engage
   with digital data, revealing how their employment is connected to and
   consistent with the type of organizational structure and communication
   strategy of the campaign. Moreover, the article evaluates how activists
   engage with three specific digital data-related practices - digital data
   creation, data usage and data transformation. Finally, the article
   illustrates that grasping the features of digital data-related practices
   also reflects how activists perceive and enact distinct ideas of active
   citizenship and data transparency in their fight against corruption.},

Abstract = {In this work we study the relation between party politics and other
   power spaces by analyzing the sociological features of Mercosur
   countries' congressmen who occupied their seats between 2003 and 2015.
   We focus our study in those who built their careers outside political
   party's structures. That is to say, those called outsiders by literature
   on the subject. With that aim, we made charts using the PELA database
   from the University of Salamanca.
   By means of discussing with French political sociology and political
   science we are able to show, the weight of unionists and entrepreneur
   among these politicians. Even considering the differences between
   countries, we conclude that outsiders are a factor of renewal for
   political elites more than elites in general in the region. Thus, this
   work contributes to the debate on the configuration of contemporary
   ruling groups in the region.},

Title = {THE RIGHT TO LIE AS A TRAP FOR FREEDOM},
Journal = {POLIS-POLITICHESKIYE ISSLEDOVANIYA},
Year = {2017},
Number = {5},
Pages = {174-186},
Abstract = {The article deals with the urgent moral and legal problem of the right
   for a lie in a new world outlook context namely as a trap for human
   freedom. The presented author's interpretation of degrees of freedom as
   stages of development of independence of the person gives a social and
   ethical assessment of a practical phenomenon of the right for a lie. The
   author analyses various negative aspects of application of this
   phenomenon in modern public life and shows essential restrictions which
   people face with when they use the right for a lie. This analysis is
   based on theoretical model of the matrix of traditional consciousness
   assuming three-level structure of the public relations. It is under
   construction from the first - the ideological level of the highest
   (moral and religious) meanings, to the second level - political and
   legal rules and installations, and then to the third level - social and
   economic and psychological practices of behavior. The author revealed
   negative aspects of use of the right for a lie at the second and third
   levels of a matrix. At the second level subordinated to the principle
   ``the end justifies the means{''} negative consequences will be:
   paternalism, moral utopianism and legal nihilism. At the third level -
   mass falsity, mistrust, unsociability and social apathy will belong to
   the public risks connected with use of the right for a lie. Thus, the
   right for a lie keeps human freedom at the level of social and
   biological survival and interferes with transition of the person and
   society to higher degrees of freedom independence. For transition to new
   degrees of freedom it is necessary to establish, first, an origin and
   borders of use of the right for a lie, namely its need and efficiency
   only in extreme conditions of survival of the person and society
   (usually, in military conditions). Upon transition of society to
   peaceful, safe life ``the right for a lie{''} turns into a dangerous
   stereotype, into the real trap for practical mind which constrains
   development of human freedom. Secondly, in modern peace conditions it is
   necessary to limit by law use of the right for a lie by strict and
   specific conditions of public safety and a narrow circle of public
   officials. Under these conditions the possibility of further democratic
   development of all society, and bigger free self-realization of citizens
   remains.},

Pages = {202-221},
Abstract = {Water privatization battles and their aftermath in seven Latin American,
   African, and Asian countries feature diverse and often complementary
   forms of action by unions, popular movements, neighbourhood
   associations, and non-governmental organizations (NGOs). NGOs cooperate
   with popular movements for water rights more than the literature would
   suggest, and after mobilizations against privatization, activists have
   had some success maintaining pressure for better service to poor
   neighbourhoods through advocacy and local self-provision arrangements.
   Public employees' unions play important roles in water policy
   coalitions, often practising a distinctive form of social movement
   unionism. These experiences argue for a more flexible understanding of
   categories and organizational forms in civil society.},

Abstract = {In this article a new explanation for the emergence of democratic
   institutions is proposed: elites may extend the right to vote to the
   masses in order to attract migrant workers. It is argued that
   representative assemblies serve as a commitment device for any promises
   made to labourers by those in power, and the argument is tested on a new
   political and economic dataset from the thirteen British American
   colonies. The results suggest that colonies that relied on white migrant
   labour, rather than slaves, had better representative institutions.
   These findings are not driven by alternative factors identified in the
   literature, such as inequality or initial conditions, and survive a
   battery of validity checks.},

Journal = {DEMOCRATIZATION},

Volume = {24},

Pages = {1066-1084},
Abstract = {The Muslim Brothers' transition from religious movement to
   majority-seeking party in Egypt's post 2011 democratic experiment
   offered a key test of the inclusion-moderation hypothesis. While the
   MB's increasing religious and organizational conservatism at new
   electoral thresholds appears to challenge the hypothesis, I argue that
   it was the result of strategic adaptation based on functional
   alternative interpretations of political opportunity that did not
   require a trade-off between power-seeking and expressive goals,
   constrained by prior pathways of electoral adaptation, and shaped by the
   ambiguous political incentives of democratic transition. This article
   shows that the MB, like other religious parties, has alternated between
   strategies for electoral adaptation, challenging expectations of linear
   evolution; that majority-seeking sometimes encourages intra-movement
   dynamics that are radicalizing as well as moderating; and shows that
   expressive goals and identity remain important to religious parties even
   in office, and make some paths of adaptation more attractive while
   precluding others. While the case affirms the relevance of political
   learning mechanisms predicted by inclusion-moderation theory, the
   divergent outcomes of this learning suggest the need to focus on the
   contexts and motivations that set movements along one of multiple
   possible adaptive pathways.},

Title = {``PARTY ZERO{''}: RUSSIAN ELECTIONS THROUGH THE PRISM OF THE EFFECTIVE
   NUMBER OF PARTIES},
Journal = {POLIS-POLITICHESKIYE ISSLEDOVANIYA},
Year = {2017},
Number = {5},
Pages = {43-53},
Abstract = {The article focuses on the parliamentary election results at both
   federal and regional levels (2003-2016). The research is based upon the
   index of the effective number of parties (the Laakso-Taagepera index and
   Golosov index) and proposes that these indices demonstrate a certain
   extent of political and electoral competitiveness. For the period under
   review authors distinguish 4 consequent stages, which reflect trends in
   Russian electoral competition. After the adoption of amendments, which
   tightened Russia's electoral law, the electoral landscape transformed
   gradually from high levels of representativeness to limitation of
   inter-party competition through periods of ``forced partization{''} and
   liberalization of electoral law. At the current stage (2013-2017) the
   system seeks to follow a tendency towards controlled competition. Thus,
   a relatively large number of parties take part in election (for
   instance, eleven parties were registered to participate in the 2016
   election to the State Duma), but can't provide competition to the ruling
   party. Based on statistics for regional parliamentary elections, only
   the Republic of Karelia has demonstrated more or less competitive
   situation. It is also confirmed by the effective number of parties
   index, which at the last election (2016) amounted to 3,76. In general,
   despite the existing partial frauds in the election results, the
   analysis of electoral statistics allows to build a so-called ``electoral
   portrait{''} that takes into account the medium-and long-term tendencies
   of the electoral process and, above all, the consequences of reforms in
   the respective field of legislation.},

Abstract = {The struggle to occupy the ``zone to be defended{''} (ZAD) of
   Notre-Dame-des-Landes against the building of an airport has been
   ongoing since 2008 in a rural area in which the way of life adopted by
   the occupiers of the site intends to demonstrate, in situ, that another
   world is possible. Since this type of movement denounces a logocentric
   and pyramidal conception of politics (based on speeches in an assembly)
   or a spectacular conception (establishing an order of importance between
   events known as ``high{''} and ``low{''} intensity, major and minor
   events), we have therefore focused our attention on everyday life. While
   in the commercial world its foundations are not questioned, at the ZAD,
   on the contrary, life is based on the politicization of the slightest
   gesture made in the here and now. The critique of everyday life at the
   ZAD takes the form of direct action (practice takes precedence over
   theoretical discourses), simplicity (in informal exchanges, techniques
   in use), self-government in the distribution of tasks and free access to
   core resources. The ZAD, however, presents a variety of arrangements
   whose points of convergence and divergence are explored here.},

Title = {REGULATION OF ETHNOPOLITICAL RELATIONS IN THE FRAMEWORK OF LANGUAGE
   POLICY IN SCHOOL EDUCATION: EXPERIENCE OF EU MEMBER COUNTRIES},
Journal = {POLIS-POLITICHESKIYE ISSLEDOVANIYA},
Year = {2017},
Number = {5},
Pages = {91-105},
Abstract = {The article is devoted to the study of the experience of regulation of
   interethnic relations through educational policy. Such an approach seems
   very productive, taking into account the diversity and importance of
   functions performed by education. As an object of study, a policy in the
   field of education in the European Union was chosen, with focus on one
   aspect of this policy - language teaching. The authors consider the
   legal framework for the regulation of ethnopolitical relations within
   the educational policy, noting that the legislation was formed under the
   influence of the existing legal conflict, between the principle of
   self-determination and the principle of territorial integrity of state.
   The study analyzed the peculiarities of the legislation governing the
   teaching of the language, examined some interesting examples of law
   enforcement practices in countries such as France, Italy, Bulgaria,
   Hungary, Romania and Spain. In these countries, according to the
   authors, national features of the implementation of the policy of
   regulation of ethnopolitical relations in the field of language
   education are clearly manifested. The article concludes that within the
   framework of supranational structures of the EU, mechanisms for
   regulating interethnic relations through policy instruments in the
   sphere of education are poorly developed. The main level of regulation
   remains the level of individual states. The ``case studies{''} examined
   in the article allowed the authors to identify ``indicative{''} cases,
   classify them, identify fundamentally different approaches to
   formulating a policy towards ethnic minorities in the field of
   education. This is a very ``long-playing{''} choice, which, as a rule,
   does not depend on the layout of political forces within the country. It
   can be stated that in European countries in the field of education, two
   main strategies for the regulation of the rights of ethnic minorities
   are implemented: a policy of positive discrimination and an integrative
   policy. The analysis shows that the policy of positive discrimination of
   ethnic minorities, realized with some or other national peculiarities,
   was the most widespread in the EU countries in the field of educational
   policy. Particular attention is paid to the analysis of positive and
   negative aspects of applied practices. The authors emphasize the role of
   educational policy in the nation-building process. At the same time,
   they conclude that educational policy cannot be considered separately
   from the socio-economic and political context in which it is
   implemented. It is also not an independent mechanism for regulating
   interethnic relations, but rather an instrument for smoothing out
   ethno-cultural contradictions in the composition of the state's social,
   economic, and national policies.},

Pages = {549-572},
Abstract = {In 1993, the Swiss cantons established the conference of cantonal
   governments (KdK). While the literature on Swiss federalism generally
   acknowledges the important role of the KdK, little is known about its
   specific purpose, in particular compared to other, older
   intergovernmental councils operating in Switzerland. We therefore
   investigate the purpose of the KdK and contrast it with two other
   intercantonal conferences with nationwide scope, namely those on
   education and finance. To do so, we trace two of the most important
   federal reform processes of the last decade: the latest renewal of
   fiscal equalization and educational harmonization. We find a division of
   labour between the KdK and policy-specific councils. While the former
   aims at vertical political influence, the latter primarily engage in
   genuine horizontal policy coordination. This flexible and smooth
   interplay of the two types of councils has contributed to further
   strengthening the political role of the cantons in the Swiss federation.},

Abstract = {The provision of public goods and services may take the shape of hybrid
   arrangements of public administration, private business and civil
   society organizations. These arrangements imply specific leadership
   challenges in terms of coordination and pragmatic compromises precisely
   because they deviate from the established action patterns and
   problem-solving routines of classic bureaucratic administration. Hybrid
   arrangements are therefore a risk generating factor when it comes to
   reliable governance and administrative responsibility. The argument of
   the present paper is that the risks are nonetheless manageable under the
   condition that responsible staff members resist the inducements of
   transgressing the threshold that separates pragmatic from opportunistic
   decision making and to ignore the specificity of rule-of-law based
   public administration. That challenge, the paper argues, affects the
   ethic of responsibility rather than institutional choice issues.
   Moreover, it affects predominantly the limits of pragmatism as an
   otherwise indispensable decision style in public administration. The
   exemplary case analyzed in the paper is the failure of the municipal
   administration of the city of Duisburg, Germany, to handle a hybrid
   arrangement in charge of planning and organization of an open air techno
   music street parade, known as ``Loveparade{''}, in 2010 resulting in a
   panic that claimed the lives of 21 people and left 60052 people injured.},

Abstract = {Past studies have addressed the role of the university, student interns
   and, the faculty advisor; here, we attempt to fill in a missing piece of
   the experiential-learning process by examining the role and importance
   of the often overlooked internship supervisor. A survey was developed
   and distributed to 343 recent internship supervisors. Their responses
   show that many of these supervisors view internships as an important
   professional and educational experience. We argue here that the
   internship supervisor can maximize one's effectiveness when operating
   within a strong college or university educational infrastructure
   facilitated by an engaged and competent faculty advisor. Our
   recommendations were discussed and confirmed by a focus group of
   experienced faculty advisors.},

Abstract = {The aim of this paper is to study the judicial decision in Hans Kelsen's
   Pure Theory of Law and its framing in Cartesian tradition, searching for
   explanations to a scientific method that is adequate to the Sciences of
   Law. Its field of study is the legal epistemology, involving both the
   Theory and Philosophy of Law. The hypothesis is that Kelsen builds the
   idea of a framework that contains the meanings to rules based on
   analytical judgement, closing the field of the law sciences at the
   moment a rule is known, excluding the Cartesian tradition, yet accepting
   that the judicial decision in itself demands an act of will by the
   subject of knowledge, and it finds itself in the world of politics,
   which fits the Cartesian tradition. As a result, one understands that
   this hypothesis is valid, and allows maintaining the Pure Theory of Law
   immune to politics and metaphysics until a certain limit, since the
   impossibility to separate the validity of the rule and its effectiveness
   impairs such purity. As a conclusion, one finds that Kelsen's
   construction limits the frontiers of the Science of Law within the
   Theory of Knowledge, and the limitations of the Pure Theory of Law are
   the limitations inherent to the very Theory of Knowledge and the
   Cartesian tradition.},

Journal = {NEW POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {39},
Number = {1},
Pages = {67-75},
Abstract = {Because of its popularity, there is now a large literature examining how
   participatory budgeting (PB) deepens participation by the poor and
   redistributes resources. Closer examinations of recent cases of PB can
   help us to better understand the political configurations in which these
   new participatory democratic spaces are embedded, and articulate the
   conditions that might lead to more meaningful outcomes. Who
   participates? For whose benefit? The articles in this symposium, on
   participatory budgeting in New York City (PBNYC), highlight both
   strengths and challenges of the largest American PB process. They focus
   less on redistribution, more on the dimensions of the process itself and
   of PBNYC's successful social inclusion, new dynamics between
   participants and local politicians, and the subtleties of
   institutionalization. The symposium also reminds us, however, that
   contestations over meaningful participation are on-going, and that of
   all of PBNYC's multiple goals, equity has proven to be the most elusive.},

Abstract = {Several scholars have sought to elucidate voting strategies in
   proportional representation (PR) systems. The argument is that the
   existence of coalition governments forces voters to consider potential
   alliances and to vote in order to maximize their chances of influencing
   the outcome. In this paper, we argue that this vision is incomplete as
   PR, just as single-member district plurality, also creates incentives
   for voters to desert parties that have little chances of obtaining a
   seat in their district. We validate this theoretical claim using two
   different surveys conducted during the 2014 Belgian federal and regional
   elections. Our results show that both government and district viability
   have a substantial and distinct effect on vote choice.},

Abstract = {The Chinese economic model, which paved the way to ``Chinese economic
   miracle{''} is running out of its capabilities. The new generation of
   leadership led by Xi Jinping is facing an extremely complicated task
   that can be compared to the one Deng Xiaoping had solved at the turn of
   1980's - to elaborate a new model of development. Measures adopted by
   the new General secretary of the CPC Central Committee in order to
   concentrate powers and to strengthen personal power are justified by the
   need to change political course. However, as a result of these steps,
   the system of institutional authoritarianism that for the past 40 years
   was being created and provided economic success to China has been
   significantly demolished. Current challenges for China originate not
   only from the necessity to change the economic model, but also from the
   reaction of the authorities to this need. Amidst uncertainty of new
   reference points for the reforms, lack of obvious competitive
   advantages, strengthening of external challenges and deep changes in
   Chinese society, China has again appeared on the verge of serious
   challenges, the answer to which will help evaluate the effectiveness of
   the reforms not only from socio-economic but also from a historical
   perspective.},

Abstract = {Do female politicians serve as political role models? This paper is the
   first to employ panel data to examine whether the presence of
   non-presidential female candidates leads to an increased propensity for
   political engagement - specifically, discussion - among women. We
   hypothesize that younger people who are still learning and establishing
   political engagement habits will become more politically engaged when
   exposed to female role models. We do not find evidence of a role model
   effect overall or among copartisans. We do find that younger women
   become significantly more likely to discuss politics when they
   experience a viable and new female candidate. Importantly, we only find
   this effect when the female candidate is not a current office holder,
   suggesting the novelty of female candidates may be key. We do not find a
   similar effect among older women.},

Abstract = {Russia's application of a sophisticated hybrid strategy and the rise of
   Daesh (also known as the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, ISIS) have
   been drivers for change in the complex security environment of the
   twenty-first century. While the significance of these threats does not
   preclude the conventional aspect of national defence planning, it does
   complicate societal preparedness. Vlasta Zekulic, Christopher Godwin and
   Jennifer Cole examine the relevance of NATO resilience policies and
   propose a synchronised approach to crisis decision-making, civil
   preparedness planning and national and collective defence to ensure they
   are balanced, mutually supportive and incur manageable cost.},

Abstract = {Legislators might rely on their partisan base for electoral supportwhat
   scholars call their normal voteor they may cultivate support among
   nonpartisans through casework or constituency servicewhat scholars call
   a personal vote. Previous research frequently argues that legislators
   face a tradeoff between pursuing the normal vote and a personal vote as
   traditionally defined, often focusing on resources used by incumbents to
   build their personal vote. In contrast, we argue that securing the
   support of partisans and nonpartisans alike should be evaluated based on
   how a legislator performs in office, and that the so-called normal and
   personal vote need not be viewed as in conflict. We evaluate our claims
   using data from state legislative elections following redistricting,
   focusing on legislative professionalism to measure the resources
   available to incumbents that they might use to cultivate a personal
   note.},

Abstract = {In this article, we present and reflect on the role of the Armed Forces
   in the reparation of the victims of the Colombian conflict. The article
   recognizes that reparation is a very important part of a comprehensive
   process involving truth, justice, compensation, forgiveness,
   reconciliation and non-repetition. The development of this article is a
   theoretical-reflective component of the triad: Truth, Justice and
   Reparation; it further develops the concept of reparation, and presents
   some international experiences in order to examine the elements that
   constitute successful reparation processes. Then, it reflects on and
   analyzes reparation in Colombia, and envisions some scenarios in which
   the Military Forces of Colombia could help to strengthen this process.
   Finally, it provides a series of reflections on the contributions and
   responsibilities of the Armed Forces in regard to the victims of the
   armed conflict in Colombia.},

   this baseline but that committee members were biased toward witnesses in
   agreement with their position and against witnesses in opposition to it.
   In addition to our substantive findings, we contribute methodological
   insights, including a coding scheme, for this kind of qualitative text

Abstract = {This article outlines the conceptual foundation of India's free speech
   regime by focusing on the debates of the Constituent Assembly
   (1946-1949), and traces the development of the Article 19 of the
   constitution, which guarantees all citizens the right to free speech and
   expression, albeit certain reasonable restrictions'. While offering a
   synoptic account of the conservative side of its developmentas framers
   negotiated the discrepancies between their imagined ideal and the
   existing, often-conflicting realitythe idea here is not to uncover some
   grand master plan of Indian democracy from which it has faltered, but to
   explore ways in which it might lend a fissure to violent outbursts of
   hurt sentiments' in contemporary India, which impinges upon the idea and
   enjoyment of free speech in general, and freedom of artists in
   particular.},

Abstract = {This article examines the role of political leadership within the realm
   of global governance. Drawing upon relevant theories of political
   agency, particular attention is given to addressing the relationship
   between leadership and collective action. A two-level analysis of
   institution building in relation to maritime security and economic trade
   and investment reveals both strengths and weaknesses in practice. A
   review of the Law of the Sea Convention and the Multilateral Investment
   Agreement provides a salutary reminder that material power does not
   translate easily into dominating the rules of international conduct. The
   cases of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation Forum and the
   Trans-Pacific Partnership further highlight the importance of mixed

Abstract = {Only a few studies have measured the expansion of European Union
   competences and they have relied on information derived from consecutive
   treaties, producing measures that do not vary in between. But decisions
   on the allocation of authority to the European Union also occur
   regularly through secondary legislation. This article presents a new
   index of the Europeanisation of policy based on an expert survey. The
   index provides a valuable new resource, encompassing 1957 to 2014, on
   the distribution of authority between the European Union and member
   states across policy fields, and on the ideological content of primary
   and secondary legislation. The study discusses the contributions made to
   existing scholarship, presents key findings from experts' assessments,
   and demonstrates how the dataset can advance research on European
   integration.},

Abstract = {This is a preliminary application of McGhee and Stephanopoulos's
   efficiency gap measure to the state of Oregon for elections from
   2012-2016. This is one of the measures currently being considered by the
   U.S. Supreme Court in the Gill v. Whitford gerrymandering case. Our
   results suggest that the current configuration of U.S, House districts
   minimizes the impact of a sizeable statewide Republican vote (@41-42\%)
   that results in only 20\% of the seats being given to this party. This
   disparity is less apparent in state senate and house seats, although the
   Democratic Party was at a distinct disadvantage in 2016 state senate
   elections. We also note the growing number of uncontested elections
   since this redistricting plan was first adopted in 2012.},

Abstract = {Scholars of democratic peace theories argue that the causal mechanism of
   the democratic peace is founded on the internalized liberal norms of
   democratic societies, which are subsequently assumed to be lacking among
   citizens of societies of different regime types. I argue that the
   corroborating results of earlier empirical work are overextended and
   that the mechanism should be empirically tested using a comparative
   perspective that considers the variance of the independent variable.
   This article provides experimental evidence that compares the impact of
   liberal norms on a population residing and socialized within a democracy
   (the Netherlands) with a population residing and socialized within an
   autocracy (China) and their respective supports for war with another
   state. The comparison shows that the level of liberal norms in the
   democratic experimental group, although significantly higher than that
   in the autocratic experimental group, does not influence the support to
   go to war. Moreover, the threat of the conflict turns out to be the key
   indicator for the support for war among both groups. This finding
   provides a clearer understanding of the relationship between regime type
   and the use of force, and has important implications for democratic
   peace theories.},

Abstract = {This article reconsiders what Marx says about what has come to be known
   as the transformation problem in Chapter IX of Capital Volume III, in
   the light of Marx's claim, made in Capital Volume I, that the value of a
   commodity is determined by the socially necessary labour-time that goes
   into its production. I criticise the traditional way of thinking about
   the transformation problem, according to which what Marx is doing in
   Chapter IX is considering the transformation of values into prices
   ('prices of production'). I argue that Marx's prices of production may
   be thought of as modified values. The discussion in Chapter IX is
   usually seen as a supplement to the labour theory of value. On this
   view, its purpose is to explain how and why the prices of commodities
   sometimes deviate from their values. Against this view, this article
   argues that Marx's remarks in Chapter IX can be seen as an elaboration
   on or development of the labour theory of value. It is a refinement of
   the account offered in Capital Volume I, which takes into consideration
   what Marx had in mind there when he introduced the notion of socially
   necessary as opposed to actual labour-time. The article draws attention
   to the importance of Marx's distinction between the individual value of
   a commodity (determined by actual labour-time) and its social value
   (determined by socially necessary labour-time). It also draws attention
   to the methodological difficulties that are generated by any attempt to
   read Marx in this way.},

Abstract = {We develop a theory of agenda setting in a legislature. A proposer
   supports a platform comprising several policies. Policies are divisible
   and can be bundled-the proposer can slice each policy into parts, and
   she can aggregate the various policy parts into bills. The proposer
   chooses an agenda, which is a collection of bills. The legislature votes
   each bill up or down, and all the policy parts in each approved bill are
   implemented. We address the following questions: In equilibrium, which
   agenda is chosen? What are the consequences for voters? What are the
   implications for institutional design?},

Abstract = {We show that standard economic measures based on samples and richer
   newly available ones based on populations lead to different conclusions
   about democratic accountability. Previous research, which has primarily
   relied on sample-based measures, has mostly missed an important
   determinant of presidential election outcomes: the local economy. We
   detect the local economy's impact with two unique data sets, one of
   which includes data on all consumer loans made in California and the
   other a census of businesses. In contrast to measures subject to
   sampling error, these population-based measures indicate that economic
   conditions at the ZIP code and county level have an impact on
   presidential election outcomes. Presidents therefore face incentives to
   focus on electorally important geographic regions.},

Abstract = {Women remain under-represented in key political and administrative
   positions. What is striking is the gender gap in the appointment of
   cabinet ministers, which is why considerably more men head ministerial
   administrations. Research on women's representation includes very few
   comparative analyses of the factors that promote or prevent the
   appointment of female ministers, however. This article addresses this
   research gap by presenting the first systematic analysis of the factors
   that affect the share of female ministers in the cabinets of the German
   federal states between 1991 and 2017. The study considers three
   competing theoretical explanatory approaches: (1) Political institutions
   that influence the permeability of the political system for women, (2)
   socio-economic factors that have an impact on the status and role of
   women in society and the attitude towards gender equality, as well as
   (3) the representation of women in the political elite. The respective
   hypotheses are tested empirically based on an original dataset that
   includes the composition of all cabinets of the German federal states
   (1991-2017). Using fractional-logit models, the analysis shows that -
   contrary to previous findings - female Prime ministers have no positive
   effect on the appointment of female ministers. Left wing governments,
   coalition governments, the size of the government majority, the share of
   women in state parliament as well as the states in West Germany have a
   significant impact on the share of female ministers in the governments
   of the German federal states.},

Abstract = {In this paper, we examine the benefits of a more quantifiable way to
   make decisions that enable senior leaders to better manage disruption of
   and attacks on the critical infrastructure. Most of the decisions have
   been made using intuition and in some cases unrelated experiences and
   have not particularly worked to the benefit of the sectors' performance
   and stability. Much of this is due to the history of the logic control
   systems and networks that were fairly isolated and much better
   protected. Attempts to reduce costs and secure many of the benefits of
   IP-based environments have unfortunately now also introduced some of the
   vulnerabilities indicative of IP-based systems into the logic
   environments. Senior leaders have not been used to these new `hybrid'
   information technology/operational technology (IT/OT) environments which
   though creating new opportunities also introduce new challenges. The
   unique nature of the critical infrastructure in which it is over
   80\%-owned by the private sector, often regulated by the federal
   government, and serves the interests and demands of the public, creates
   a non-trivial challenge at many different levels. More trust and
   cooperation between the three elements of society is surely a desired
   interest by the key stakeholders, but there are many concerns in terms
   of over-regulation, costs, and loss of intellectual property that have
   consistently sustained a level of discomfort between the three
   communities in terms of the priorities and self-serving interests of
   each other. The challenges of the low asymmetry entry and attribution
   within the cyber domain have raised the profile of many actors who would
   not even have previously registered in the `noise' on a trouble or
   problem scale. Now, the ability to determine those responsible, as well
   as, almost any actor having the ability to present a challenge to the
   environment have changed many of the dynamics in terms of how senior
   leaders must now operate and manage the appropriate systems and
   networks. Hence, for obvious reasons, senior leaders are much more
   cautious in their approach to decision making because of the potential
   consequences. This is especially true because cyber assets, though so
   valuable can be also so vulnerable. In this study, we will discuss a
   method that moves decision from a less arbitrary to a more data-centric,
   quantifiable approach that drives leadership to better and quicker
   decisions.},

Abstract = {This article uses a political developmental approach to examine African
   American poll-tax registration and voting in Virginia from 1940 to 1954.
   Using the concept of multiple orders, the article traces how changes in
   the state's political system of managed race relations created an
   opening for African American political mobilization. The Virginia Voters
   League (VVL), in alliance with other African American political, civic,
   and social organizations, conducted voter education and poll-tax payment
   campaigns in order foster political efficacy among the state's
   disenfranchised black voters. The VVL met with mixed success, affected
   by past political mobilizations, the impact of NAACP mobilization, and
   local and statewide political competition between the state's main
   political machine and insurgents. The VVL campaign was successful in
   achieving short-term victories, including the election of a few African
   Americans to local office. By 1954, the VVL's internal weakness coupled
   with the emergence of massive resistance stymied further black electoral
   mobilization through politics and made protest a more viable option for
   achieving political and civil rights for black Virginians. By tracing
   the path from politics to protest, this article shows how a political
   developmental approach can be successfully used to develop a nuanced
   understanding of the emergence of the civil rights movement and Southern
   politics in the pre-Brown v. Board of Education era.},

Abstract = {Drawing on spatial models of political competition, this research
   investigates whether decision weights vary across groups of voters
   defined by their policy positioning in a two-dimensional space. Our
   analyses of electoral survey data from England, France, Germany, the
   Netherlands and Switzerland reveal that the economic and cultural
   dimensions of electoral competition are salient for the vote choice of
   most groups of voters. However, those voters who hold economically right
   and culturally libertarian preferences weigh their preferences on the
   economic dimension more and discount parties' position on cultural
   issues when no party represents their configuration of preferences.
   Consequently, left parties are less able to attain votes of economically
   right but culturally libertarian voters for cultural policy reasons,
   when electoral choices are scarce, while right parties are successful in
   attaining votes based on both dimensions. As a result, significant
   representation gaps can occur. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {The Board of Trustees of the Negro Rural School Fund convened in the
   office of the president of the United States on December 14, 1911. The
   mission of the fund was to assist Southern black schools, supplying
   black supervising teachers to rural areas. (1) President William Howard
   Taft presided over the meeting, which included members from banking,
   industry, philanthropy, higher education, and the clergy, demonstrating
   the importance of associated action in policy and political development
   in the early twentieth century. (2)education reform, and their work was
   just one part of a far-reaching agenda for education in the Jim Crow
   Sout These elite reformers hoped to guide policymaking in h, based on
   the premise that public schooling was important to a strong national
   state. (3) Yet, it was difficult for elite actors to implement national
   policy goals in state and local areas, particularly for education. Local
   control was an important characteristic of American schooling, and
   Southern education reform was a particularly complicated terrain,
   dominated by rural areas committed to states' rights, local control, and
   the racial state. (4) While the fund's trustees hoped to direct efforts
   from their lofty White House venue, foundation efficacy required
   extensive collaboration with organizations and actors across the South.
   This work, referred to here as interstitial collaboration, included a
   set of initiatives tailored to state and local regions, supported by
   cooperative relationships between governmental and nongovernmental
   organizational entities and with citizens across the political spectrum.},

Abstract = {Human rights, ethnic conflict, democratization, colonialism, and
   development-many upper-level political science courses contain content
   that is understood differently f across cultural contexts. Equipping
   students to appreciate diverse perspectives on these issues is a
   challenge that requires creative pedagogical strategies, regardless of
   whether all students come from the same region of the United States or
   the class has more than half international students. Professors in both
   environments have the complex task of guiding students to navigate
   disparate viewpoints. This article demonstrates the pedagogical
   potential of an integrated approach to student-led class modules based
   on a two-semester experiment using a Global Politics of Human Rights
   course at a small liberal arts college with a large population of
   international students. One section of the same course was taught in
   each semester with identical course material but with two different sets
   of student participants. After situating the challenges and the strategy
   within the growing literature on active learning, the article provides
   basic details of the pedagogical approach and three examples of the
   modules. It concludes with methods for assessing the effectiveness of
   student-led class modules.},

Year = {2017},
Volume = {49},
Number = {4},
Pages = {464-488},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {This article defends the meta-right to know your rights, asserting that
   the moral right to know legal rights should be enforced by the law. All
   too often, state agents and private actors deceive individuals or
   exploit their ignorance to prevent their exercise of rights. While this
   injustice is familiar, the right to know your rights has not received
   adequate analytical attention. Here, I show that this right can be
   defended by many moral theories, including deontology, consequentialism,
   and social contract theory. While the right to know is categorical, it
   imposes different duties (to inform and/or not deceive) on different
   parties, depending upon the situation; hence, redress should vary by
   situation. For instance, Miranda warnings may best convey Fourth
   Amendment knowledge, while public service announcements may best correct
   voter deception and mandated disclaimers may best prevent deceptive
   crisis pregnancy counseling.},

   Context of Crises},
Journal = {BALTIC JOURNAL OF EUROPEAN STUDIES},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {7},
Number = {2},
Pages = {148-167},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {The article aims to assess a change in the EU's soft power in the
   Western Balkan and Eastern Partnership states in the light of the crises
   the bloc has undergone in recent years. Generally agreeing with the
   common argument that the EU's attractiveness for those countries has
   decreased, the author challenges the popular wisdom that such a decrease
   is likely to reverse those states' pro-EU foreign policy orientations.
   To prove it, the author applies Joseph Nye's and Alexander Vuving's
   ``power currencies{''} approach to operationalize soft power,
   considering the bloc's attraction as a combination of ``brilliance{''}
   (the actor's relationship with its work), ``benignity{''} (the actor's
   relationship with other actors) and ``beauty{''} (the actor's
   relationship with values and ideas). Elaborating on the crises'
   influence on each of these currencies, the author shows that their
   lessening, first, has mainly taken place in absolute rather than
   relative terms, so the EU's attractiveness remains strong compared to
   that of its competitors, and second, it has primarily affected the
   bloc's soft power potential rather than its actual behavior towards the
   target countries.},

Abstract = {The possibility that citizens expose themselves to information in biased
   waysso-called selective exposurehas acquired new importance as the media
   environment has evolved to provide more choices concerning what to watch
   and read. But evidence for the most prominent idea in selective exposure
   researchthat citizens prefer attitude-consistent informationis notably
   mixed. Methodological challenges likely contribute to the inconclusive
   nature of findings, as researchers face trade-offs between the
   artificiality of lab environments and the difficult-to-disentangle
   confounds of observational analysis. We improve understanding of
   selective exposure in two ways. First, we consider how message aspects
   other than attitude-consistency affect exposure decisions. Second, we
   study selective exposure with an innovative field experiment conducted
   in the United States that addresses limitations of other approaches. Our
   results allow us to reach more confident conclusions about the
   prevalence of motivated selective exposure, and help to illuminate
   underpinnings of the oft-lamented tendency for campaign media to focus
   on candidate miscues rather than substantive policy differences.},

Abstract = {Socialization theory claims that the ability of education to reduce
   anti-foreigner sentiment varies crossnationally because state
   authorities are not equally committed to accepting ethnic minorities:
   higher educated persons harbor less anti-foreigner sentiment because
   they spend longer in educational institutions that impose official
   democratic values, which forbid negative reactions toward ethnic
   minorities. Consequently, higher educated persons ought to diverge from
   the lower educated as democratic institutions progress. Analyses support
   these claims: the impact of education on reducing anti-foreigner
   sentiment is strongest in the oldest democracies, moderate among the
   medium-aged (e.g., South European) democracies and weakest among the
   youngest (East European) democracies; and higher educated persons are
   disproportionately influenced by the maturation of democratic
   institutions. Analyses utilize data from the 28-country 2008 European
   Social Survey.},

Abstract = {Since 1958 and the beginning of the Fifth Republic, the French
   presidency has been constructed and consolidated as a masculine
   institution. Furthermore, all presidential elections can be considered
   as a key moment for politicising issues relating to sex and gender. The
   2017 presidential campaign is more specific. Since 2000, the mechanisms
   designed to ensure gender equality have been strengthened, such that
   they are now an unavoidable norm in political competition. In a context
   of dramatic political change, the hierarchy of political issues is
   affected. This article looks back over Francois Hollande's 5-year term
   from this perspective, before drawing on an analysis of campaign
   materials and press coverage. The small proportion of women candidates
   and the marginalisation of gender issues in the programmes testify to
   the fragile nature of `egalitarian good will.' Gender and sexuality did,
   however, offer a means for other power relations to be expressed, in
   relation to different conceptions of nationalism and both class and race
   relations.},

Abstract = {It's been over 70 years since the Nuremberg trials helped establish the
   primacy of legal mechanisms to deal with international human rights
   abuses, especially for genocide. Since then, we have seen a
   proliferation of courts and tribunals focused on bringing to justice
   perpetrators of genocide. In this paper, we critically examine the ways
   in which Nuremberg shaped and influenced these responses to genocide and
   to our understanding of the nature of justice in post-conflict
   societies. In an era when genocides and mass atrocity crimes continue to
   occur, it is important to understand the benefits and limitations of
   legal strategies for post-conflict societies and how they influence
   other transitional justice mechanisms. We bring to light the clear
   tension between the different goals of international criminal justice,
   namely punishment, prevention, and peace, and show that increased
   reliance on punishment does not necessarily brings about peace. To
   sustain peace and stability in post-conflict era, countries have also
   turned to truth and reconciliation commission, lustration, and
   reparation.},

Abstract = {Emmanuel Macron's election as President of the Republic and the
   formation of a government that includes a mix of politicians from
   parties on the left and right of the political spectrum, as well as a
   significant share of non-partisan ministers, has been hailed by numerous
   commentators as an unprecedented overhaul of France's political life.
   This article examines how the two cabinets formed under prime minister
   Edouard Philippe in the shadow of the 2017 presidential and
   parliamentary elections compare to previous governments in the Fifth
   Republic. The analysis reveals a less than revolutionary break with
   previous patterns of government size, channels of ministerial
   recruitment, portfolio allocation, gender balance, and ethnic diversity.},

Abstract = {Since 1989, the countries of Central and Eastern Europe (CEE) have
   experienced major institutional transformations. As part of that
   process, territorial contestations between states and ethnic minorities
   engendered three outcomes: negotiated territorial self-government (TSG)
   arrangements; the denial of such arrangements; and the emergence of
   de-facto states. Through a qualitative comparative analysis of
   twenty-four minority TSG claims in seventeen post-communist CEE states,
   we find that: (i) TSG arrangements emerged as externally facilitated
   instruments for managing or preventing violent conflict in predominantly
   low-capacity, only partially democratic states; (ii) peacefully pursued
   TSG claims were most likely to be denied in high-capacity consolidated
   democracies; and (iii) de-facto states emerged where patron-states
   intervened in violent conflicts in low-capacity states. These findings
   defy widely held expectations about the influence of Europeanization,
   coupled with democratic consolidation, on the accommodation of minority
   claims; and they offer new insights into the significance of external
   intervention for the institutional outcomes of ethnic minority TSG
   claims.},

Abstract = {While most Americans appear to acknowledge the large gap between the
   rich and the poor in the United States, it is not clear whether the
   public is aware of recent changes in income inequality. Even though
   economic inequality has grown substantially in recent decades, studies
   have shown that the public's perception of growing income disparities
   has remained mostly unchanged since the 1980s. This research offers an
   alternative approach to evaluating how public perceptions of inequality
   are developed. Centrally, it conceptualizes the public's response to
   growing economic disparities by applying theories of macro-political
   behavior and place-based contextual effects to the formation of
   aggregate perceptions about income inequality. It is argued that most of
   the public relies on basic information about the economy to form
   attitudes about inequality and that geographic contextin this case, the
   American statesplays a role in how views of income disparities are
   produced. A new measure of state perceptions of growing economic
   inequality over a 25-year period is used to examine whether the public
   is responsive to objective changes in economic inequality. Time-series
   cross-sectional analyses suggest that the public's perceptions of
   growing inequality are largely influenced by objective state economic
   indicators and state political ideology. This research has implications
   for how knowledgeable the public is of disparities between the rich and
   the poor, whether state context influences attitudes about inequality,
   and what role the public will have in determining how expanding income
   differences are addressed through government policy.},

Abstract = {Populism has become more salient in multiple regions in the world, in
   developed as well as developing countries. Today it is largely a
   reaction to social dislocations tied to processes of neoliberal
   globalisation. As a concept, populism has had a long and contentious
   history. We suggest that populism has been on the rise alongside new
   imaginings of what constitutes the people' and elites', as the meanings
   attached to these labels are continually reshaped in conjunction with
   new social conflicts. These conflicts are intensifying across the globe
   together with new kinds of social marginalisation, precarious existence
   and disenchantment with the broken promises of liberal modernity. The
   article introduces a special issue on Populism in World Politics that
   seeks to understand general processes involved in the emergence of
   populist politics along with specific circumstances that affect how it
   is expressed in terms of identity politics, political strategies and
   shifting social bases.},

Abstract = {Since China rejoined the global economy four decades ago, it has adopted
   a peaceful development strategy that is deeply rooted in the peaceful
   DNA of the Chinese civilization. Benefiting from comprehensive
   engagement with other countries, China has bolstered its contribution to
   globalization and the global governance system with its own robust
   economic growth, more active participation in such key mechanisms as the
   Group of Twenty (G20), and a ``China model{''} that provides valuable
   lessons for other nations on their social and economic development. Now
   that the global governance system is under serious challenge due to
   sudden withdrawal of many of the United States' global commitments by
   the Trump administration, China is in a good position to shoulder more
   responsibilities while fostering a new type of major-power relationship
   with the United States.},

Volume = {6},

Abstract = {The recent debate over republican conceptions of freedom as
   non-domination has reinvigorated philosophical discussions of freedom.
   However, neo-Roman republicanism, which has been characterized as
   republicanism that respects equality, has largely ignored the work of
   Alexis de Tocqueville, although he too took his task to be crafting a
   republicanism suited to equality. I therefore provide a philosophical
   treatment of the heart of Tocqueville's republicanism, including an
   analysis of his conception of freedom as freedom in combined action and
   a philosophical reconstruction of his primary argument for the
   importance of this kind of freedom. A comparison of Philip Pettit's and
   Tocqueville's republicanism exposes limitations in the neo-Roman
   conception of freedom as non-domination and its ideal of the free
   citizen and shows why neo-Roman republicanism, to live up to its
   motivating ideals, should accommodate elements of neo-Athenian
   republicanism and freedom in combined action.},

Abstract = {This study examines the implications of EU decision-making for national
   parties' support for European integration. We argue, first, that EU
   decision-making promotes the support of parties that were closely
   located to EU outcomes. Second, we expect higher support of parties with
   governmental experience due to their access to key offices in EU
   decision-making. For the period from 1979 to 2012, we measure and
   interact both variables with the political, parliamentary and
   decentralizing nature of EU acts. In addition to the expected effects of
   outcome distance and government participation, we find that
   non-bureaucratic legislation generally improves national parties'
   attitudes towards European integration. The involvement of the European
   Parliament increases the support of more distant parties, but
   discourages parties with high governmental experience. Finally,
   peripherally located (government) parties appreciate the decentral
   discretion of directives.},

Title = {State-induced Famine in Eritrea: Persecution and Crime against Humanity},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF POLITICS AND LAW},

Abstract = {Famine remains one of the major causes of deaths and displacements in
   the Sub-Saharan African countries where people have continuously been
   compelled to cross international borders in search of livelihood
   securities. There is no question that the continent has been exposed to
   erratic rainfalls, crop failures and droughts, but contemporary famine
   has less to do with natural-related crop failures and much to do with
   poor governance. The author argues that state's premeditated action,
   inaction and incompetency to respond to insecurity and threats are
   largely responsible for African famines. Due to historical misperception
   of African famine and oversimplification of refugees' motives from
   Africa, however, food-based persecution has not been a common subject of
   research. Besides, the absence of drought does not necessary mean the
   absence of famine either, because the aforementioned factors frequently
   cause it to happen even in the middle of plenty. Therefore, the purpose
   of this paper is to explore how government's action or inaction can lead
   to famine in the absence or presence of drought which in return forces
   people to escape from drastically deteriorating conditions of existence
   by flight. The goal of this paper is mainly to challenge the common
   perception that famine as being the drought-induced outcome of
   humanitarian crisis in Africa and refugees as being victims of the
   natural circumstance. Thus, this paper argues that a government that
   deprives its citizens of the basic necessity such as the right to food
   is as dangerous as the one that persecutes its citizens on the five
   Convention grounds. Hence, taking Eritrea as a case example, this
   article discusses chronic food insecurity and mass starvation as a
   state-induced disaster, which I believe should be considered a crime
   against humanity under the Rome Statute of the International Criminal
   Court.},

Abstract = {Asian Americans are in the unique position of participating in American
   politics as well as politics related to their nation of origin. However,
   there is a lack of consensus about the factors that are likely to make
   this group participate in homeland or US politics. We examine this
   question using data drawn from the 2008 National Asian American Survey
   (NAAS). Results suggest that Asian Americans' participation in homeland
   politics is positively related to their involvement in US politics.
   Specifically, we find that immigrants who have prior political
   experience in their nation of origin and high exposure to political
   discussion after migration are likely to engage in activities related to
   the politics of both America and their nation of origin. We also find
   that English-and ethnic-language media use affects Asian Americans'
   participation in US and homeland politics, suggesting the importance of
   including exposure to news media when studying immigrants' political
   behaviors.},

Abstract = {Interest group influence represents the Higgs boson of contemporary
   social research. Scholars have tried to define and measure influence for
   decades: tens of different definitions are used in the literature and as
   many methods to measure it can be found. The literature has recently
   converged towards an agreement on how to study interest group influence:
   preference attainment. The latter has monopolised the research in the
   literature in the last years. Yet, a discussion on what preference
   attainment is, what it does and what it does not is still missing in the
   literature. This works aims to fill this gap by providing a theoretical
   and methodological informed discussion on interest group influence and
   preference attainment. In so doing, I propose a novel method to apply
   preference attainment in an effective and efficient manner.},

Title = {The local roots of the participation gap: Inequality and voter turnout},
Journal = {ELECTORAL STUDIES},

Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {It is generally accepted that the rich are more likely to participate in
   politics than the poor. It is also generally accepted that the
   probability than an individual will participate in elections is
   influenced by the gap between the rich and the poor. There is little
   agreement, however, about whether inequality across time and space
   increases or decreases participation. In this paper we examine the
   impact of inequality across space. We suggest that the impact of
   inequality depends crucially on whether it is defined in terms of
   variations between geographical units ('segregation') or within
   geographical units ('heterogeneity'). Evidence to support this argument
   is drawn from multi-level British data. Heterogeneity has a mildly
   positive effect on participation but this effect seems to be outweighed
   by the negative impact of segregation. The effect of segregation,
   moreover, is most pronounced among the poorer sections of the
   population, indicating that geographical isolation among the poor
   ('ghettoization') leads to lower turnout among these groups. (C) 2017

Abstract = {The current state of race relations in the United States have brought to
   light the issue of the militarization of local police, where officers
   are being provided with unused equipment from the government's war chest
   through the 1033 Program. But, is this increase in militarization
   beneficial, or does it harm relations between citizens and police? Using
   data on purchases provided by the Defense Logistics Agency, this paper
   analyzes effects of military purchases on assaults on police officers.
   Fixed effects negative binomial regressions on state-month level data
   show that stockpiling of material militarization equipment (guns, armor,
   and clothing) exhibits a statistically significant decrease in assaults,
   with guns showing no significant relation on assaults. However,
   operational militarization purchases (surveillance, sonar, and radar)
   lead to an increase of assaults, suggesting that there may be unforeseen
   consequences of increased militarization due to a change of structure
   and information gathering.},

Journal = {ELECTORAL STUDIES},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {48},

Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {This brief study revisits the issue of Whether higher unemployment rates
   elicit an increase in the voter participation rate. Using a state-level
   panel dataset for all five of the Presidential election cycles of this
   century, it is hypothesized that, following Cebula (2008) and Burden and
   Wichowsky (2014), the higher the unemployment rate, the greater the
   degree to which eligible voters, whether unemployed or employed, show up
   at the polls, arguably because they are expressing the concerns and
   fears regarding prevailing economic policies and conditions and because
   by voting they are expressing the desire for changes to address those
   concerns and fears. The estimation implies that a one percentage point
   higher unemployment rate leads to a nearly 1.0\% higher voter
   participation rate. This result is in principle compatible with and
   supportive of the hypothesis that higher unemployment rates motivate
   voters and the empirical finding of a positive voter
   turnout/unemployment rate association obtained in the studies by Cebula
   (2008) and Burden and Wichowsky (2014). Moreover, this finding is
   potentially important because it implies that elected officials are, to
   at least some degree, held accountable by the electorate for a weakly
   performing economy. (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

Abstract = {Dualization explains analogous changes in South Korea and Japan like
   labor market segmentation and the expansion of social protection for
   nonstandard workers. This study argues, however, that their
   institutional structures and underlying dynamics of dualization are more
   different than they appear, where the subcontracting relations between
   big businesses and their suppliers come into play. The cooperative
   interfirm relations in Japan become a buffer with which firms
   incrementally adjust to a coupled dualization in the labor market and
   social welfare system. Thus, Japanese nonstandard workers excluded from
   the social insurance system exist because of the formally segmented
   structures of labor markets and social welfare programs. By contrast,
   the exploitative subcontracting relations in South Korea intensify labor
   market segmentation and undermine government regulation of labor and
   social welfare, leading to a decoupled dualization. Those in South Korea
   persist despite the formally inclusive and unified structures of social
   welfare programs.},

Abstract = {The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) began in 2016 with great hopes
   that they will promote social development, economic development, and
   environmentally sustainable development with the motto, ``Leave No One
   Behind{''} (UN 2016). In particular, SDGs' goal 5, ``Achieve Gender
   Equality and Empower All Women and Girls{''} (UN 2016). However,
   persistently high gender gap was found in many countries around the
   world whether they are developed or developing. The 2016 Global Gender
   Gap Index (GGGI), which examines gender inequality across four key areas
   of health, education, economy and politics, showed that the gender gap
   widened in many countries, and the gap in ``economic participation and
   opportunity{''} showed the largest gender gap compared to health,
   education and political participation (World Economic Forum 2016).
   Interestingly, the GGGI do not match the global ranking of countries
   based on their GDP size, GDP per capita, or even the level of poverty.
   Thus, in order to deal with the underlying causes of deep-rooted and
   persistent gender inequality we must develop more culturally nuanced and
   contextualized approaches in the SDGs to tackle gender inequality (Song
   \& Kim 2013). Gender inequality is simply not acceptable in the world
   where half of the world's citizens are not provided with the same rights
   as the other half. It is also economically less productive to rely on
   only half of the world's labor force to help eradicate poverty.
   Education, employment, and full empowerment of women and girls must be a
   priority for the SDGs.},

Abstract = {Scholars note that rebel atrocities against civilians often arise within
   rural areas in the developing world. This characterization is not
   far-fetched, and recent data show that rebel atrocities do predominately
   occur within rural agricultural regions. Yet the frequency of such
   incidents also varies substantially across different agricultural
   regions and years. What accounts for this observed variation in
   rebel-perpetrated atrocities against civilians within agricultural areas
   in developing countries? We develop a formal model to address this
   question, which contends that severe droughts can decrease food
   availability, prompting civilians to allocate food for immediate
   consumption and become increasingly willing to defend their diminishing
   supplies against rebels. This leads rebels to preempt the civilians'
   defensive efforts by committing atrocities, which forcibly separate
   civilians from their lands and food stockpiles. In empirically testing
   this hypothesis at the subnational level across the developing world, we
   find robust support for our game-theoretic model's predictions.},

Abstract = {A large literature has demonstrated that international action can
   promote the resolution of civil wars. However, international actors do
   not wait until violence starts to seek to manage conflicts. This article
   considers the ways in which the United Nations Security Council (UNSC)
   reduces the propensity for self-determination movements to escalate to
   civil war, through actions that directly pertain to the disputing actors
   or that indirectly shape actor incentives. It examines the relationship
   between the content of UNSC resolutions in all self-determination
   disputes from 1960 to 2005 and the onset of armed conflict in the
   disputes. The study finds that diplomatic actions that directly address
   disputes reduce the likelihood of armed conflict, and that military
   force and sanctions have more indirect preventive effects.},

Abstract = {To what extent do conventional explanations of women's rights, such as
   religion, culture, core rights, and advocacy, help to explain the status
   of women's rights in Muslim majority countries? Religion and patriarchal
   culture are commonly cited to explain the persistence of gender
   inequality. While often overlooked, the study of property rights offers
   leverage for differentiating between religious and cultural explanations
   of women's status given their different prescriptions regarding the
   acquisition and management of property. Examining developing and Muslim
   majority countries, we find that patriarchal norms, more so than
   religion, constitute the main barrier to gender equality. Further, we
   find that core rights like women's access to education and, to a lesser
   degree, norms-building by women's rights groups best explain where women
   enjoy effective property rights.},

Abstract = {Scholars and practitioners posit that election observers (EOs) affect
   local beliefs about the credibility of elections. Although these effects
   have important implications for democratization, they remain largely
   unexamined at the individual level. This article applies models of
   Bayesian opinion updating and motivated reasoning to illuminate the
   conditions under which EOs change beliefs about elections. Experimental
   evidence from a national survey fielded immediately following the first
   democratic parliamentary election in Tunisia tests the argument. Two
   important findings emerge. First, exposure to EOs' positive and negative
   statements produces a small but significant difference in individuals'
   perceptions of the election on average. Second, EOs' negative statements
   cause the election's main losing partisanswho may have had weak prior
   beliefs that the election was credible and were likely receptive to
   critical informationto believe the election was significantly less
   credible. These findings establish a baseline for future work on how
   third-party monitors shape local perceptions of political processes.},

Abstract = {In 2008, the economic downturn coincided with a major shift in the
   energy sector paradigm. This state of emergency forced the UK government
   to try to steer the objectives ofits major energy players. This crisis
   put the UK state's capacity to influence its mostly privately-owned
   energy sector to the test. Using the example of energy utilities, this
   article aims to explore whether the austerity agenda impacted the
   relationship between the UK state and its public services. The purpose
   is to determine whether current multiple crises have forced the UK state
   to adopt an exceptionally interventionist approach that doesn't tally
   with the austerity agenda, or whether these crises merely revealed
   dynamics which had been underlying in the management of its energy
   utilities since the beginning of the neo-liberal era.},

Abstract = {This article explores the political identity of Podemos which, along
   with other political forces, has transformed the party system in Spain.
   Podemos emerged as a party that rejected the left-right axis, defining
   itself in terms of a polarity between those ``from above{''} and those
   ``from below{''}. In contrast to other studies, it is here considered
   that political identity cannot be determined solely in relation to such
   a dichotomy, but it can be antagonistic, as conceptualized by Laclau, or
   agonistic, as seen by Mouffe's. Antagonism implies a relation of enmity
   with the political order and, therefore, a contestation of the latter,
   whereas agonism involves an adversarial relation with the political
   order and, hence, its regeneration. Taking this distinction as key to
   understanding Podemos's political identity, this article presents a
   discursive analysis of the ``purple party{''}, from its origins up to
   October 2016. The aim is to examine, using criteria based on form rather
   than contents, whether Podemos sees the existing political order as an
   insurmountable obstacle to the success of its demands or, rather, a
   fertile ground to achieve them. In the concluding remarks, it is argued
   that around January 2015 the initial antagonistic relationship became an
   agonistic one. The increasing adjustment of the Podemos discourse to the
   existing political order should not be seen as a moderation but, rather,
   as a process of negotiation with sedimented meaning. And this is not
   incompatible with the quest for a new hegemony.},

Title = {The Generalizability of Social Pressure Effects on Turnout Across
   High-Salience Electoral Contexts: Field Experimental Evidence From 1.96
   Million Citizens in 17 States},
Journal = {AMERICAN POLITICS RESEARCH},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {45},
Number = {4},
Pages = {533-559},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Prior experiments show that campaign communications revealing subjects'
   past turnout and applying social pressure to vote (the Self treatment)
   increase turnout. However, nearly all existing studies are conducted in
   low-salience elections, raising concerns that published findings are not
   generalizable and are an artifact of sample selection and publication
   bias. Addressing the need for further replication in high-salience
   elections, we analyze a field experiment involving 1.96 million subjects
   where a nonpartisan campaign randomly sent Self treatment mailers,
   containing a subject's vote history and a comparison of each subject's
   history with their state median registrant's turnout behavior, in
   high-salience elections across 17 states in 2014. Sending the Self
   mailer increases turnout by 0.7 points or 2.2\%. This effect is largely
   consistent across states, with somewhat larger effects observed in
   states with lower ex ante election salience. Our study provides precise
   evidence that social pressure effects on turnout are generalizable.},

Abstract = {The 2010-13 Icelandic constitutional process offers a unique opportunity
   to test the predictions of epistemic deliberative democrats (as well as
   some constitutional scholars) that more inclusive processes lead to
   better outcomes. After briefly retracing the religious history of
   Iceland and the steps of the recent constitutional process, the article
   thus compares three constitutional proposals drafted at about the same
   time to replace the 1944 Icelandic constitution. Two of these drafts
   were written by seven government experts; the third one was written by a
   group of 25 lay citizens, who further crowdsourced their successive
   drafts to the larger public. The article suggests that on the question
   of religious rights the crowdsourced constitutional proposal indeed led
   to a marginally better (more sophisticated and more liberal)
   constitutional document.},

Abstract = {The slow pace of administrative action is arguably a defining
   characteristic of modern bureaucracy. The reasons proffered for delay
   are numerous, often centering on procedural hurdles or bureaucrats'
   ineptitude. I offer a different perspective on delay in one important
   bureaucratic venue: the federal rulemaking process. I argue that
   agencies can speed up (fast-track) or slow down (slow-roll) the
   rulemaking process in order to undermine political oversight by
   Congress, the president, and the courts. That is, when the political
   climate is favorable, agencies rush to lock in a rule, but when it is
   less favorable, they wait on the chance that it will improve. I find
   empirical support for this proposition using an event history analysis
   of more than 11,000 agency rules from 150 bureaus. The results support
   the interpretation that agencies strategically delay, and that delay is
   not simply evidence of increased bureaucratic effort.},

Abstract = {Intercultural conflicts, when they explode, are not limited to the
   sphere of the economy or traditions, but affect retroactively on
   cultural, political and religious ones. It is therefore imperative to
   intervene with long-term educational strategies, based on a mutual
   exchange of cultural values, rather than just the enjoyment of welfare
   system goods and services. For this purpose, the article introduces the
   worth as the ``pull-factor{''} of the value, and from where it draws a
   new pattern of coexistence based on shared values addressed to both
   migrants and indigenous people. The model runs on a multidimensional
   approach: forming so that each person consciously seizes his own worth
   (Narrative Method); Identifying the rules of the social context that
   hamper or speed up the dialogue between holders of different worth
   (Ethno-methodological Method); Making each ones' worth ``speak to each
   other{''}, so that each individual comes into the viewpoint of the other
   while at the same time absorbs something from the other without losing
   his individuality (Dialogic Method); Moving up from the worthiness to
   the values of the other as a launching pad toward shared values
   (Ethno-methodological Method); Activating vertical bonds without
   frontiers (linking bonds) by developing competences to interact in
   divergent contexts (Conflict Management Method); and involving
   Educational Centers and local policy, which serve to provide ethical and
   participatory incentives in order to prevent dispersion of the outcome
   of other-ness and the axiological mind that is forming in the classroom
   (Discursive Method).},

   tensions that had characterised the day in the period since the Vietnam
   War. It argues that the restorative justice evident in the
   reincorporation of Vietnam veterans into national narratives of Anzac
   provided opportunities for political elites like Hawke to convincingly
   employ Anzac as an ideograph and inscribe the day with new meaning. This
   process had profound continuing effects for the marking of Anzac Day
   that demonstrate the politically limiting effects of restorative
   justice.},

Abstract = {As protectionism and isolationism rise against globalization, China's
   Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) provides strong momentum for advancing
   the transformation of global governance. First, the BRI strengthens the
   awareness of building a community of common destiny for mankind and
   promotes the evolution of epistemology in global governance. Second, it
   offers more sustainable global public goods, thus improving ethical
   standards for global governance. Third, the BRI combines the top-down
   and bottom-up approaches to encourage voluntary actions in global
   governance. Fourth, the BRI draws on China's own experience in
   integrating reform, development and stability, which helps balance the
   economic, social, ecological, and security dimensions of global
   governance, so as to foster common development among countries and
   regions along the routes and ultimately create a new equilibrium between
   South-South and North-South cooperation. Promoted through consultation
   to meet the interests of all, the BRI will make both tangible and
   intangible contributions to the transition of global governance by
   delivering public goods and enhancing the notion of compatible justice
   in a deglobalized world.},

Abstract = {Quebec's Bill 60 (or Charter of Values), legislation prohibiting public
   officials from wearing religious symbols and garb, provides a
   complicated case of a minority nation grappling with culture and gender,
   while also illustrating the more contingent condition of Canadian
   multiculturalism, equality and feminisms. Quebec has adopted
   interculturalism versus multiculturalism; moreover, its multilayered
   women's movement remains a legitimate force, unlike in the rest of
   Canada. Despite the intricacies of these distinctive developments, this
   article reveals how Charter of Values justifications asserted the Quebec
   nation's distinctiveness and alleged egalitarian pre-eminence over
   others, not only homogenizing and instrumentalizing multiple cultures,
   but also various feminisms. Yet, when culture, gender equality and
   feminisms become reified and essentialized through a strategic depiction
   of certain minority women's rights, Canada's already well-worn claims to
   diversity and equality are further frayed both subnationally and
   nationally.},

Abstract = {The often-used description in the American mainstream media and
   geopolitical literature of ``North Korea's nuclear aggression{''} is
   misleading. I argue in the first section that Pyongyang's nuclear
   strategy has been significantly shaped by the perceived U.S. nuclear
   existential threat since the early 1950s, portending a quest for a
   self-reliant nuclear deterrent for the DPRK. The shifting role and
   impact of U.S.-China competition in the course of the first and second
   U.S.-DPRK nuclear standoffs is explored as background for examining, in
   the second section, an intensified nuclear confrontation in the first
   half of 2017. The concluding section considers common-security
   engagement in charting an alternative pathway toward establishing a
   working peace system on the Korean peninsula.},

Title = {Yin and yank? Public opinion in Europe toward the US and China},
Journal = {COMPARATIVE EUROPEAN POLITICS},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {15},
Number = {4},
Pages = {577-603},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Perceptions of the United States in European public opinion greatly
   improved around 2008, while perceptions of China simultaneously
   deteriorated. The Transatlantic and Sino-European relationships stem
   from radically different historical contexts. Yet could the image of
   China and the image of the U.S. be related in the eyes of Europeans?
   This paper examines whether attitudes toward China have contributed to
   determining attitudes toward the U.S. in Europe by analyzing data from
   the Transatlantic Trends survey taken in 2010, a critical juncture in
   Europe's relations with both the U.S. and China. We investigate three
   hypotheses about this relation: the ``yin and yank'' or negative
   correlation (the more Europeans fear China, the more positive they
   become about the U. S.; the more favorably Europeans view China, the
   more negatively they see the U. S.); the ``open vs. closed'' or positive
   correlation (the more favorably Europeans see China, the more favorably
   they see the U. S.; the more negatively they see China, the more
   negatively they see the U. S.); and no relation (European attitudes
   toward China and the U. S. are independent). To the question of whether
   anti-Chinese sentiment has the potential for replacing anti-Americanism
   in Europe, our main conclusion is that positively correlated attitudes
   toward the U. S. and China reveal a deep cleavage in Europe between
   those who are ``in'' and those who are ``out'' of globalization.},

Abstract = {The distribution of income lies at the intersection of states and
   markets, both influencing and responding to government policy.
   Reflecting this reality, increasing research focuses on the political
   origins of inequality in the United States. However, the literature
   largely assumesrather than teststhe political mechanisms thought to
   affect the income gap. This study provides a timely reassessment of one
   such mechanism. Leveraging variation in labor laws between states and
   differences in the timing of adoption of right-to-work (RTW)
   legislation, I examine one political mechanism blamed by many for
   contributing to inequality. Using a variety of panel designs, I find
   little evidence that RTW laws have been a major cause of growing income
   inequality, pointing to the importance of grounding theoretical
   arguments about the interrelationships between states and markets in a
   sound empirical reality.},

Abstract = {During the war in former Yugoslavia, city of Dubrovnik was shelled in
   1991. Even though these experiences were traumatic for all those
   involved, the goal of this paper was to explore if these events resulted
   in a cultural trauma, i.e. a breakage of cultural patterns and of
   collective identity. We expected that the process of trauma-claiming,
   which is central to cultural trauma, was amplified because of the role,
   both physical and symbolic, that the Old Town played for the collective
   identity of Dubrovnik. In the paper, we give an outline of the war in
   Dubrovnik. To assess the way that the war in Dubrovnik affected the
   collective identity, as well as to find out the relation between
   personal and collective historical narratives, we conducted interviews
   with 13 informants. We observed that all the phases of trauma-claiming
   were successful, or in other words, that there indeed was a cultural
   trauma in Dubrovnik as a consequence of the shelling. Additionally, we
   were able not only to observe expressions of cultural trauma experienced
   by our informants, but also to trace further changes and developments
   spanning to the present day.},

   Paris Agreement, in which states pledged to curb carbon emissions and
   take action for climate change adaptation. Applauded for its speedy
   ratification, the accord also identified both developing and developed
   countries as equally responsible in combating climate change. However,
   despite international praise the author argues that the Paris climate
   accord's shortcomings include its lack of compliance mechanisms and
   effective adoption measures. In this article, the author also emphasizes
   the importance of combating climate change at the urban level, and that
   non-state actors - in particular local governments and NGOs - are vital
   for monitoring and implementing the Paris Agreement.},

Title = {Constitution-Building Bodies and the Sequencing of Public Participation
   A Comparison of Seven Empirical Cases},

Abstract = {Constitution-building is one of the most salient aspects of transitional
   processes, from war to peace or from authoritarian rule, in terms of
   establishing and strengthening democracy. This paper is part of a
   research project that aims to identify the circumstances under which
   constitution-building can strengthen democracy after violent conflict
   and during transitions from authoritarian rule. Previous research has
   indicated that the actions and relations of political elites from
   opposing political parties when making the constitution has bearing on
   the state of democracy post promulgation, but that the careful
   sequencing of public participation in the process can be of relevance as
   well. This paper conducts a systematic analysis of seven empirical cases
   and focuses the investigation to the type of constitution-building body
   that has been employed and to during what stage of the process the
   general public have been invited to participate. It concludes that
   popularly elected constitution-building bodies tend to include a broad
   range of political parties and that they, additionally, tend to have
   rules of procedure that encourage compromise and negotiation, whereas
   appointed bodies are dominated by one single party or one single person
   and do not have rules of procedure that necessitate compromise. The
   paper also discusses the potential need for political elites to have
   negotiated a number of baseline constitutional principles prior to
   inviting the general public to get involved in the constitution-building
   process, and concludes that this is an area of research in need of
   further in-depth empirical case-studies.},

Abstract = {After signing a bilateral free trade agreement with China and joining in
   the China-led Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB), Switzerland
   has become one of China's best partners in Europe. The bilateral
   relationship has been upgraded from ``strategic partnership{''} to ``
   innovative strategic partnership,{''} and is regarded by the Chinese as
   `` a model relationship for China-European countries.{''} Two
   fundamental reasons explain why Switzerland has achieved such harmonious
   relations with the world's second largest economy: first, there is no
   historical conflict between the two countries; second, Switzerland is
   more pragmatic than other European countries in strengthening bilateral
   cooperation with China. So far, the two countries have institutionalized
   dialogues and other exchanges involving both elites and the public;
   sensitive issues have been properly handled without obstructing the
   development of their bilateral relations. As ever closer ties are being
   built between China and Europe as a whole, the Beijing-Bern relationship
   can serve as a model for other European countries.},

Abstract = {The inclusion of subnational parliaments into the early warning system
   (EWS) for subsidiarity control generates transforming dynamics in
   parliamentary modus operandi in European Union (EU) decentralized
   states. Empirical findings reveal considerable variations in the pace
   and scope of subnational parliamentary activity in EU policy control
   challenging the existing theories of territorial mobilization. Drawing
   from a comparative institutional analysis, this article offers a
   theoretical framework that permits accounting for cross-country
   variations in subnational parliamentary mobilization in EU affairs,
   under the EWS. By placing an increased focus on the domestic
   environment, it suggests that the two important factors which might
   affect the scope of parliamentary activity are (1) the relationship
   between the executive and legislature at the subnational level, and (2)
   the position of the regional executive in domestic governance
   arrangements.},

Abstract = {The study of power is one of the defining features of International
   Relations. Thus, every generation of IR scholars undertakes a
   reconsideration of the concept of power in an attempt to place its own
   definitive stamp on one of the oldest conversations in world affairs.
   What distinguishes current engagements with the consideration of power
   is that they are happening in the context of a power transition. It is
   in this setting that the three books included in this review both
   reFLect and address the different puzzles attendant in the current
   re-articulations of the notion and practices of power in IR. Jiang Qing
   addresses the what' of power through a novel assessment of previously
   overlooked Confucian insights. Marjo Koivisto engages the when' of power
   by drawing attention to the strategic impact of normative state action
   in world affairs. Alexander Cooley explores the how' of power through a
   parallel assessment of the strategic competition for inFLuence between
   the US, Russia and China in Central Asia.},

Abstract = {The contribution focuses on the dictatorship of the proletariat which
   Lenin exploited as a legitimacy resource, in particular on the concept
   of the ``avant-garde{''}-party, the aspect of minority dictatorship and
   the specific role of violence. Lenin's attempt to integrate the
   ``peasant factor{''} into his concept of a dictatorship is also
   discussed in detail. Soon it was clear that Lenin wanted to establish
   this dictatorship by help of the Party, the Councils and, most of all,
   the executive, and that he was out for radical change. Already in the
   course of the first year after having established his rule (1917/18) it
   became obvious that this new dictatorship leaned primarily onto the
   Party, the executive and special state institutions, however hardly onto
   the Councils which served only as a facade. All promises of a new state
   with reduced bureaucracy proved to be empty promises.},

Abstract = {Despite major interest in issue ownership, what shapes it remains a
   puzzle. In his pioneering work on issue ownership, John Petrocik
   emphasises the importance of a party's performance. Recent research
   acknowledges this by pointing to the role of real-world problems and
   incumbency for issue ownership. However, if performance truly matters,
   it should be difficult to understand the impact of such problems without
   taking into account the government's response to it. Based on novel data
   on issue ownership, policy development and government attention across
   five issues in nine countries over time, the analysis shows that the
   government's issue-handling reputation is associated with the policy
   development, and the government's attention to the problem is important
   for this association. This is especially true for parties with no
   history of issue ownership on the issue and if the government is a
   coalition or in minority.},

Abstract = {Do electoral systems and intra-party candidate selection procedures
   influence the degree to which parties act in unison? Whereas the
   theoretical literature is quite clear about the hypothetical effect of
   these institutions, empirical evidence is mixed. In this article, I
   solve the puzzle and theorize about the interactive effects of elections
   and selections on parties' behavior. I argue that the effect of
   candidate selections depends on the electoral environment within which
   they operate. Specifically, in an electoral environment that creates
   incentives for candidate-centeredness, the less restrictive the
   selection method a party uses, the less unified its record; whereas in
   an electoral environment that emphasizes party-centeredness, the effect
   of selections on unity is more muted. Using the electoral reform and
   divergent selection mechanisms characterizing Israel during the last
   three decades and utilizing Rice Scores, I provide support for the
   conditional effect of electoral systems and selection procedures on
   party behavior.},

Abstract = {Who is responsible for protest mobilization? Models of disease and
   information diffusion suggest that those central to a social network
   (the core) should have a greater ability to mobilize others than those
   who are less well-connected. To the contrary, this article argues that
   those not central to a network (the periphery) can generate collective
   action, especially in the context of large-scale protests in
   authoritarian regimes. To show that those in the core of a social
   network have no effect on levels of protest, this article develops a
   dataset of daily protests across 16 countries in the Middle East and
   North Africa over 14 months from 2010 through 2011. It combines that
   dataset with geocoded, individual-level communication from the same
   period and measures the number of connections of each person. Those on
   the periphery are shown to be responsible for changing levels of
   protest, with some evidence suggesting that the core's mobilization
   efforts lead to fewer protests. These results have implications for a
   wide range of social choices that rely on interdependent decision
   making.},

Abstract = {When ordinary people are asked how they feel about politics, negative
   terms enter into the conversation. In this work we analyse how people
   build their relationship with politics, to explore to what extent
   political representation is challenged by either participatory trends or
   by expert-based governance in citizens' mind. To do this, we use focus
   groups in Spain, where popular distrust of political institutions rose
   dramatically in the period 1980-2012. We analyse the meanings associated
   with expert-based, representative, and participatory governance models.
   In this way, the tensions and contradictions in political preferences
   for one type of institutional design or another are unveiled.},

Abstract = {Policy implementation is usually studied at the micro level by testing
   the short-term effects of a specific policy on the behavior of
   government actors and policy outcomes. This study adopts an alternative
   approach by examining macro implementationthe cumulative effect of
   aggregate public policies over time. I employ a variety of
   methodological techniques to test the influence of macro criminal
   justice policy on new admissions to federal prison via three mediators:
   case filings by federal prosecutors, conviction rates in federal
   district courts, and plea bargaining behavior. I find that cumulative
   Supreme Court rulings influence the incarceration rate by altering
   conviction rates in district courts; however, I find only mixed evidence
   of congressional and presidential influence. The results suggest that
   U.S. macro policy influences bureaucratic outputs by altering the
   behavior of subordinate policy implementers; however, the Supreme Court
   may enjoy an advantage in shaping criminal justice policy.},

Abstract = {For autocrats facing elections, officers in the internal security
   apparatus play a crucial role by engaging in coercion on behalf of the
   incumbent. Yet reliance on these officers introduces a principal-agent
   problem: Officers can shirk from the autocrat's demands. To solve this
   problem, autocrats strategically post officers to different areas based
   on an area's importance to the election and the expected loyalty of an
   individual officer, which is a function of the officer's expected
   benefits from the president winning reelection. Using a data set of
   8,000 local security appointments within Kenya in the 1990s, one of the
   first of its kind for any autocracy, I find that the president's
   coethnic officers were sent to, and the opposition's coethnic officers
   were kept away from, swing areas. This article demonstrates how state
   institutions from a country's previous authoritarian regime can persist
   despite the introduction of multi-party elections and thus prevent full
   democratization.},

Abstract = {Political economy theory expects politicians to use budget deficits to
   engineer an election-timed boom, known as the political business cycle.
   We challenge and contextualize this view by incorporating the financial
   constraints faced by governments into an electoral framework. We argue
   theoretically that the extent of ownership dispersion among creditors
   has important effects for governments' policy autonomy. Specifically, we
   contend that when highly indebted governments become more reliant on
   international bond marketsas opposed to traditional bank
   lendingpoliticians alter the way they respond to domestic constituents.
   In an econometric test of 16 Latin American countries, from 1961 to
   2011, we show that financial decentralization breeds austerity. More
   specifically, we find that politicians exhibit more fiscal discipline
   when they fund a greater share of their spending through decentralized
   bond markets. Furthermore, we find this disciplining effect to be
   particularly strong during election periods.},

Abstract = {In 1939, Jacques Maritain, catholic philosopher and theologian of
   politics, and Raymond Aron, secular philosopher and political
   sociologist, initiated a dispute regarding Machiavellianism that
   continued until the 1980s. The dispute constituted a highly significant
   episode in the so-called ``French Machiavellian Moment{''}. This article
   proposes an original reading of this controversy in the context of World
   War II. Our conclusion is that, despite appearances and widespread
   opinion, Maritain was not a mere anti-Machiavellist or hyper-moralist
   political thinker, but rather a covert Machiavellist political writer in
   keeping with the archetype of Catholic political writers of the
   Counter-Reformation. Similarly, Aron is not a neo-republican liberal,
   much less a neoliberal, but a political realist thinker who advocates a
   moderate Machiavellism.},

Abstract = {The selectorate theory introduces a framework to examine varying
   political structures, behavior, and systems with a fresh perspective.
   The theory proclaims that the political survival of a leader relies on a
   supportive coalition that continuously receives public and/or private
   payoffs. One revised revision of the selectorate theory elaborates on
   the classical selectorate model by investigating factors of political
   survival and regime stability in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA)
   and scrutinizing the elements of the recent MENA revolutions, such as
   the leaders' religious preferences. This study demonstrates that the
   classical selectorate approach can perfectly satisfy the analysis of
   MENA transitions. We validated the revised model by showcasing the
   dynamics of political transition and confirming that selectorate
   expansion triggered a shift from private to public distribution of
   goods. Overall, our results were in support of the classical selectorate
   model and proclaimed religion as a public good, rather than a hindrance.},

Abstract = {Originally developed to explain cultural variation in moral judgments,
   moral foundations theory (MFT) has become widely adopted as a theory of
   political ideology. MFT posits that political attitudes are rooted in
   instinctual evaluations generated by innate psychological modules
   evolved to solve social dilemmas. If this is correct, moral foundations
   must be relatively stable dispositional traits, changes in moral
   foundations should systematically predict consequent changes in
   political orientations, and, at least in part, moral foundations must be
   heritable. We test these hypotheses and find substantial variability in
   individual-level moral foundations across time, and little evidence that
   these changes account for changes in political attitudes. We also find
   little evidence that moral foundations are heritable. These findings
   raise questions about the future of MFT as a theory of ideology.},

Abstract = {War-winning coalitions face a unique problem of ensuring multilaterally
   credible commitments to the distribution and defense of a new postwar
   status quo. Some sustain cooperation for years or decades, yet others
   collapse into intramural violence. Why do some victorious coalitions
   collapse into war, while others do not? I analyze data on war-winning
   coalitions from 1816 to 2007, using an event history framework to model
   the duration of postwar peace between their members. Increasing
   coalition size is associated with less durable postwar peace, while more
   extensive prewar alliance commitments are associated with less durable
   peace and great power participation is associated with more durable
   peace. These results have implications for the survival of postwar
   settlements, for the role of alliances and great powers in preserving
   world order, and for assessing the implications of modern theories of
   war.},

Abstract = {This research note presents the results of a research project focused on
   Political Science undergraduate programs in twelve Ibero-American
   countries (Argentine, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Spain,
   Mexico, Peru, Paraguay, Uruguay and Venezuela). The analysis takes into
   account five main dimensions: the objectives of the curricula, the
   profile of political scientists, the academic or professional
   orientation of the careers, the disciplinary or interdisciplinary
   approach, and the set of skills they aim to develop. At the
   methodological level, the units of analysis are all Political Science
   undergraduate programs (154), including programs in which Political
   Science is taught in association with neighboring disciplines.
   Furthermore, the study worked with a sub-sample of 28 programs chosen
   according to their prestige and representativeness and, in order to
   carry out an in-depth analysis of aspects such as the relative weight of
   the different thematic axes, the length of the programs, the number of
   courses and the flexibility in curriculum planning. Information has been
   obtained from the official curricula, the websites that host them and,
   in some cases, through email with faculty members. The results of this
   investigation provide the first broad and systematic overview of the
   main characteristics of undergraduate degrees in Political Science in
   Ibero-America.},

Abstract = {James Madison's midcareer shift from nationalist to
   Democratic-Republican launched a debate about his political behavior and
   the consistency of his political thought. This paper evaluates Madison's
   political behavior by comparing his voting record with the voting record
   of other legislators of his time. Using roll call votes from the
   Congress of the Confederation and the first four federal congresses, we
   show that Madison's politics changed but the change was not atypical. We
   also provide some evidence for and against various explanations for his
   midcareer shift. Our study compliments numerous works that use Madison's
   political behavior as a backdrop for studying the consistency of his
   political thought.},

Abstract = {The spread of Internet and mobile phone access around the world has
   implications for both the processes of contentious politics and
   subsequent reporting of protest, terrorism, and war. In this paper, we
   explore whether political violent events that occur close to modern
   communication networks are systematically better reported than others.
   Our analysis approximates information availability by the level of
   detail provided about the date of each political violent event in Africa
   from 2008 to 2010 and finds that although access to communication
   technology improves reporting, the size of the effect is very small.
   Additional investigation finds that the effect can be attributed to the
   ability of journalists to access more diverse primary sources in remote
   areas due to increased local access to modern communication technology.},

Abstract = {The aim of the article is to examine whether there is a difference in
   the utilization of education among university educated employees in
   private companies on the one hand and public institutions on the other.
   The target population of the research was based on a random sample drawn
   from the National Population Register by the National Survey of the
   Social Science Research Institute of the University of Iceland from 9
   March to 9 April 2016. The survey included 2,001 individuals, aged 18 or
   above, from all over the country. A total of 1,210 persons responded to
   the survey. This research only involved those participants in the sample
   who had completed a university education and were salaried employees in
   Iceland. After data cleansing, 374 participants remained, 178 males and
   196 females. The initial results of the research indicated that 20.3\%
   of participants were over-educated for their jobs. The majority of
   females work in public companies, while the majority of males work in
   private companies. Individuals with under-education are most likely to
   be found within public companies, at the same time as over-educated
   individuals are most likely to be found in private companies (the
   difference lies in the under- and over-education of females). Those
   working in public companies come primarily from educational and health
   sicences, while engineers and natural sicentists work primarily at
   private companies. Incomes are higher in private companies.},

Abstract = {This research note presents an innovative dataset of Swiss MPs' interest
   ties between 2000-2011. The longitudinal analysis shows that the average
   number of interest ties per MP has more than doubled: from 3.5 in 2000
   to 7.6 in 2011. Since the mid-2000s, public interest groups have
   accounted for approximately one out of two ties between MPs and interest
   groups, showing the strongest increase during the period. However, when
   looking at the most present individual groups, important business groups
   dominate and appear well connected with the governmental parties of the
   political right. Finally, interest groups are also able to forge
   themselves a strategic presence within the parliamentary committees that
   are the most relevant for their policy issues. Next research steps
   include the assessment of the (un)biased access of interest groups to
   the parliamentary venue and their policy influence.},

Abstract = {Among the rapid and rampant costal developments of Persian Gulf region,
   creating artificial islands is one of new-emerging and developing
   phenomena in this area. Extensive activities initiated by The United
   Arab Emirates and other countries of the southern coast of Persian Gulf
   to create such islands, have had widespread environmental consequences
   and have led to the criticism of environmentalists. International
   environmental law has complied comprehensive rules and regulations in
   order to protect the environment, in particular, protecting the marine
   environment. Numerous conventions have focused on the issue of marine
   environment protection, and have mentioned the obligations and
   responsibilities of states regarding the damages and pollutions to the
   environment caused by their developmental activities. Persian Gulf
   coastal states, which are mostly a member of these conventions, are
   obliged to observe the environmental obligations and regulations related
   to their widespread activities in the coasts of Persian Gulf, which
   often leads to drying the sea and land reclamation.},

Abstract = {Does electoral integrity affect turnout? And if so, how? We analysed
   some variables that are closely related to electoral integrity -
   government actions, opposition actions, and the context in which the
   election is held - and find significant impact on turnout. We argue that
   higher turnout is often found in elections with higher electoral
   integrity. We tested our claims using data for over 700 elections
   covering 85 democracies for the 1950-2008 period. Results reveal that
   both boycott and election-related violence decrease turnout, but the
   effect of the former is substantially higher. We also find that,
   contrary to initial expectations, governments' harassment of the
   opposition and the occasional banning of parties actually increases
   turnout.},

Abstract = {This article analyses the ideational footprint of the euro in regional
   monetary integration. Upon the basis of over 70 financial elite
   interviews in China, Brazil and the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC)
   countries we find empirical evidence to suggest that EMU triggered
   considerable symbolic effects in stimulating regional monetary
   cooperation up to the recent Eurozone crisis. Nonetheless, our analysis
   coincides with Cohen's in being sceptical about the possibility of
   monetary unions in Latin America, the GCC and East Asia. This is partly
   explained by a lack of sense of community in these regions. However,
   where we revise Cohen's work is in the notion that monetary unions
   require a regional leader. EMU stands out because it is primarily based
   on the Franco-German partnership (which remains crucial for its
   survival) and not on Germany's leadership. This joint leadership is
   absent in our three case study regions and thus might explain why
   progress towards monetary union has been limited.},

Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {In this article we address two important and related questions. First,
   do economic hard times make defeat inevitable for any incumbent? And,
   second, do voters sanction incumbents for a poor economy whatever the
   economic policy pursued? To answer these questions, we propose a new
   theory about the ways in which taxation policies, clarity of
   responsibility, government ideology, and economic conditions come
   together to shape election outcomes. We address these questions with a
   new set of data collected on elections, government policies, and
   economic measures before and during the current economic crisis. Our
   findings indicate that taxation policies have effects on incumbent
   electoral patterns net of economic performance measures, but that these
   effects differ in theoretically-expected fashions depending on clarity
   of responsibility, government ideology, and whether or not there has
   been a recession in the year before an election is held. (C) 2016

Abstract = {Several fashionable fallacies affect current assessments of the
   character of conflict. It is always difficult to discern what changes
   will affect the strategic level, especially when attention is focused on
   particular wars and technological novelties. In this article, Rob
   Johnson argues that an honest appraisal of what is unchanging offers one
   route to that evaluation. Strategically, revisionist geopolitics, an
   electronic arms race between encryption and access, and a greater focus
   on protecting populations and national wealth are anticipated. After a
   period when the West could intervene across the globe at will, it
   appears that escalatory, existential threats are back, demanding a
   strategic solution.},

Journal = {IZQUIERDAS},

Abstract = {The ongoing colombian armed conflict is one of the longest wars in the
   contemporary world, and paradoxically it is taking place in a country
   with a large experience in the development and implementation of peace
   agreements. Colombia has been a pioneer in Latin America in conducting
   negotiation processes with guerrilla groups and in seeking peace
   agreements since the nineties; however, it still remains the only state
   in the region which shows a large-scale armed confrontation as a result
   of manifestations of political violence.
   Transitional justice has become therefore an absolutely central issue
   facing the purpose of finding judicial and extrajudicial means to
   achieve a negotiated solution to the conflict. The first transitional
   experience in Colombia was developed through Law 975 of 2005, which
   implemented a transitional model with the Autodefensas Unidas de
   Colombia (AUC). This transitional model has been very controversial,
   creating a sense of distrust and rejection in several social groups in
   the country about the implementation of a new transitional model agreed
   with the Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia (FARCEP). In this
   sense it is necessary to analyze which are the main differences between
   the transitional models designed for the AUC and the FARC-EP?},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL THEORY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {13},
Number = {1},
Pages = {81-99},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Recent re-readings of classical realism in International Relations have
   demonstrated that in their critique of modernity, mid-twentieth century
   realists put their focus on the development of a (self)critical and
   sceptical epistemology, a focus that often has been of little concern to
   other International Relations theories. So far, however, this debate on
   classical realism has not further elaborated realist methodologies,
   although this has the potential to make the current theoretical debate
   more accessible for empirical investigations. To this end, this article
   argues that mid-twentieth century realists pursued a method of
   unlearning. Unlearning is being understood as the critique and moving
   beyond the modern imaginary which preconditions everyday knowledge and
   intellectual thought in a dehumanizing way through a learning process
   based upon the study of classical texts. Examining the work of Hans
   Morgenthau, and the evocative if generally under-appreciated writings of

Abstract = {How ambitious are MPs in European parliaments and how does progressive
   ambition affect their strategies? We argue that progressively ambitious
   members of parliament try to generate individual visibility and seek the
   support of party leaders who decide on promotion while at the same time
   ensuring reelection by adjusting to electoral system incentives. Using
   novel data from a 15-country MP survey we show that progressive ambition
   is widespread in Europe and Israel. As hypothesized, progressively
   ambitious MPs are more likely to favor personal rather than
   party-centered electoral campaigns and to address the national or
   regional party leadership instead of their local party. Electoral system
   features and party ideology also have the theoretically expected
   effects.},

Abstract = {2017 as the year in which the Revolution is commemorated is of no
   interest to Georgia. In 2018, the country will celebrate the 100th
   anniversary of the founding of the first Georgian nation state, and in
   2021 it will commemorate the destruction of that state by the
   Bolsheviks. This purely national perspective just like that of the
   devotees of Stalin, who are still to be found ignores the significance
   of Georgian social democracy, its social and national reformist ideas
   and their implementation from 1918-1921. In order for them to be
   rediscovered, the national Bolshevist myth must be questioned as well as
   the image of history that focuses solely on the nation state.},

Abstract = {Historically, there are two types of legislative structure: the
   unicameral system and the bicameral system. The latter is composed by
   two chambers that, in varied levels and by its own institutional ways,
   exercises control over the other. Bearing in mind the relevance of the
   bicameral systems in the current discussion (and in the functioning) of
   the democracies, this paper aims to reveal the state of the art of the
   debate, exploring the historical origins of the bicameralism, the
   factors related to its dispersion, its theorical foundations and its
   elementary institutional traces, and its political consequences. Thus,
   the paper consists in a methodological and theorical starting point for
   studies and researches about bicameral democracies.},

Title = {Factors influencing the electoral participation of Asian immigrants in

Journal = {POLITICAL SCIENCE},

Volume = {69},

Pages = {139-160},
Abstract = {New Zealand electoral data show that those identifying with an Asian
   ethnicity have the lowest electoral turnout of any of the broad `ethnic'
   categories used by government statisticians. What accounts for this
   finding? Given a paucity of quantitative data with which to answer this
   question, we employ a qualitative, focus group-based research design to
   examine the electoral participation of first-generation Asian
   immigrants. 1 We ask, first, what are the main factors that lead Asian
   immigrants in New Zealand to participate or not participate in
   parliamentary elections and, second, do these reasons vary among
   immigrants from different national backgrounds? Our findings suggest
   that the low electoral turnout recorded among New Zealand Asians is
   likely to be at least in part an artefact of the recentness of much
   immigration from non-English-speaking countries such as South Korea and
   China. The paper also identifies the role government agencies, political
   parties and the ethnic media could play in communicating information
   about New Zealand's electoral politics, with potentially significant
   dividends for future voting rates among Asian immigrants in New Zealand.},

   does my need for clarity. The combination drove me into the
   professoriate. My research in Africa convinced me that modernization
   theory was wrong: The people I came to know in the field were
   sophisticated in their politics. Additional research convinced me that
   market-oriented approaches to political economy were wrong and that
   government intervention could lead to increases in productivity and
   welfare. Because neoclassical approaches are flexible, I continue to
   think in terms of strategy and choice and to apply them to the study of
   development.},

Abstract = {The article contributes to the literature on diffusion by focusing on
   two recent cases of social movements in Spain and in Portugal,
   identifying different stages of cooperation and diffusion. Our specific
   contribution to the diffusion literature is the temporal perspective:
   Processes were observed over several years. This allows for an in-depth
   analysis of factors of success and failures of diffusion and how
   activists deal with such processes over time. We further ask how
   activists deal with a lack of success in some processes of diffusion and
   why this was no obstacle of further diffusion processes.},

   Military Interventions},
Journal = {DEMOCRACY \& SECURITY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {13},
Number = {3},
Pages = {196-219},
Abstract = {This article investigates how members of US Congress legitimized their
   votes in four cases of military interventions after the Cold War (Iraq
   1991, 2002-2009; Somalia 1993; Libya 2011). Using an original dataset on
   congressional rhetoric, the qualitative content analysis highlights that
   the domestic legitimization of military interventions hinges on members
   of Congress's perception of external threats and national interests. So
   far, international relations research focused on the executive and the
   war powers literature offered mainly quantitative accounts on voting
   patterns within the legislative branch-especially for the US case. The
   relevance of national interest arguments within congressional debates
   confirms the expectations of neoclassical realism while contradicting
   previous studies about a dominant discourse in US society, which
   legitimizes interventions with universal values, such as democracy
   promotion or human rights.},

Abstract = {The article explores how the programs of state service reform are
   embedded into the Russian political discourse and to what extent the
   content of these programs depends on political changes in the society.
   On the basis of the content analysis of the Russian state leaders'
   statements on the problems of state service for the 1926-2016 time
   period, G.Borshchevsky comes to the conclusion that the political
   situation exerts a relatively weak impact upon the general vector of
   such reforms and the proposed set of measures. Political leaders seem to
   care about bureaucracy problems mainly in the context of power struggle.
   Their statements about the faults of bureaucracy serve mainly for
   exposing the previous team of leaders, and their promises to reduce
   state apparatus, make it less costly and bring it closer to the people
   are an important instrument to increase their popularity in the society.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF CIVIL SOCIETY},

Volume = {13},
Number = {3},
Pages = {231-246},
Abstract = {This article presents a theoretical framework for the empirical study of
   social movements as agents in the transnational transformation of public
   spheres. It draws on the existing literature on transnationalization of
   public spheres, which predominantly focuses on the broadcast media as
   carriers of the public sphere, to conceptualize transnational public
   spheres and mechanisms of public sphere transformation and to identify
   indicators for measuring the degree of that transformation. It then
   turns to argue that conceptualization of transnational public spaces as
   complex, multilayered, and overlapping permits analysis of social
   movements as agents of public sphere transformation in the form of
   actors or arenas, either within transnational spaces or through more
   routine forms of contestation within the nation state. I then adapt
   indicators developed to measure the degree of transnationalization of
   public spheres and illustrate their applicability for the study of
   social movements using contemporary examples of movement practices and
   discourses.},

Abstract = {Do events irrelevant to politics affect citizens' political opinions? A
   growing literature suggests that such events (e.g., athletic
   competitions, shark attacks) do in fact shape political preferences. We
   present an experiment that largely replicates a widely noted irrelevant
   event effect. Specifically, we find that the outcome of a sporting event
   (i.e., a football game) affects presidential approval and likely does so
   by affecting individuals' moods. We also show that the effect is
   short-lived.},

Year = {2017},
Volume = {9},

Abstract = {Over the last 10 years, the concept of cumulative extremism (CE) has
   gained currency amongst both academics and policy-makers. Despite this,
   there is a dearth of empirical research into the idea. Furthermore, the
   extant literature -which has focused primarily on conflicts between
   social movements and groups in England has not drawn firm conclusions
   into how and why processes of CE might develop. This paper will address
   this gap in the literature by examining the Troubles in Northern Ireland
   from its onset in the 1960s through to its peak as a lethal M/CM contest
   in 1972. In so doing, it aims to both improve the understanding of CE as
   well suggesting policy measures which might be employed to interrupt the
   escalation of movement-countermovement conflicts.},

   HYBRID PARTY},
Journal = {PARTECIPAZIONE E CONFLITTO},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {10},
Number = {1, SI},
Pages = {275-305},
Abstract = {In recent years, the restructuring of the party systems in several
   European countries was accompanied or preceded by massive waves of
   anti-austerity protests. Although the causal relation between these
   mobilizations and the rise of new parties has already been assessed, the
   organizational features remain understudied. To fill this gap, here we
   analyse the impact of the cycle of anti-austerity and pro-real democracy
   protests which emerged in 2011 with the birth and organizational
   development of the Spanish party Podemos. Bridging two subfields of
   social and political sciences-movement studies and party studies-we pay
   particular attention to the dichotomy between horizontality and
   verticality within Podemos' organization. In particular, we address the
   issues of social movement effects as well as party foundation and
   organizational development. Our main findings suggest that movement
   mobilization played a large role in shaping Podemos' foundational
   choices, particularly with reference to the fundamental principles of
   the party and its strategic positioning. Podemos is also experimenting
   new democratic methods internally. Nonetheless, empirical analysis shows
   that, overall, the influence of movements' organizational models on the
   organizational structure of the party has been limited. Yet, the result
   is a ``hybrid{''} party that finds a balance between the horizontalism

Abstract = {In this article, Edward Hunter Christie sheds light on the extent to
   which Russia's economic trajectory may enable or constrain its military
   modernisation goals. It adds to existing research by using quantitative
   scenarios and counterfactual analyses of the state's fiscal conditions
   under different assumed levels of ambition for defence procurement
   spending. This approach leads to a more evidence-based assessment of the
   policy preferences of the Russian leadership. It also provides an
   objective basis for evaluating Russia's fiscal capacity to fulfil its
   ambitions in a mid-term perspective.},

   Union Politics},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE EDUCATION},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {13},
Number = {2},
Pages = {152-170},
Abstract = {While the effects of simulation-based courses on the knowledge of
   participating students may be marginal in relation to standard lecture
   and discussion-based courses, this article argues that the greatest
   leverage is gained by increasing participating students' level of
   interest in the subject of study and in politics more broadly.
   Participants tend to become increasingly absorbed in their roles and in
   the politics of the institutions at the center of the simulation. To
   better consider this possibility, we conducted a survey of students
   participating in the 2015 Mid-Atlantic European Union Simulation and of
   appropriate control populations. The survey results indeed suggest that,
   much more than simply acquiring knowledge about the EU, the simulation
   experience serves to generate more robust interest in the subject of
   study.},

   the Study of Public Policies},
Journal = {POLITICA Y SOCIEDAD},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {54},
Number = {2},
Pages = {341-363},
Abstract = {The paper proposes a conceptual model for the study of public policies
   as suggested by feminist theory. I present a theoretical reflection
   about notions of social inclusion and exclusion, inspired in feminist
   criticisms of the ethical universalism, feminist theory of
   intersectionality, coloniality of gender, a concept developed by
   decolonial feminism, and contributions about social justice of Nancy
   Fraser and Iris Marion Young. The purpose is to generate conceptual
   inputs to conceive public policies that respond satisfactorily to social
   contexts, in which a diversity of subjects and groups demanding
   recognition emerges. Beginning with this discussion, I expose a
   conceptual model which proposes to observe three elements that are
   interesting to the analysis of normativity that guide the
   representations of problems and solutions in policy making: the
   normative referent or moral principles that guide/s public policies; the
   vision of society and the notion of social change that underlies
   political discourse; and the conception of subject alleged by policies.},

Abstract = {In the last decade, states around the world have begun to pass and
   enforce laws that restrict fundamental rights and freedoms and
   effectively close off political space. Faced with the challenge of
   closing political space, there is an urgent need to deepen the linkage
   between election observation assessments and reporting, and the United
   Nations' human rights mechanisms and system. In this article, the
   authors argue that the election assistance and human rights communities
   must work together to promote a cohesive framework for accountability on
   all human rights, including electoral rights. Stronger links and
   reporting from election observation missions into the Universal Periodic
   Review and treaty body system can function as part of a strengthened
   international human rights accountability mechanism, using UN mechanisms
   and related obligations accepted by states.},

Abstract = {This paper discusses the topic of institutional change in public
   policies based on John Kingdon's Multiple Flows Model under the
   perspective of Roberto Mangabeira Unger's Institutional Experimentalism.
   The hypothesis presented here inform that hegemonic political science,
   which Kingdon is an exponent, uses the notion of crisis and periods of
   instability to explain moments of institutional change. Unger, in
   considering the deepening of democracy and the continuous revision of
   institutions, disagrees with the previous approach and proposes another
   way: he invites to transform institutions in direction of a warmed
   politics. We conclude that Kingdon's approach, by masking power
   struggles present in society through low-energy democracy, not only
   provides theoretical difficulties, but also blurts the vision for the
   interpretation and overcoming practical problems in unequal societies
   such as the Brazilian. The method used focused on the reading and
   critical analysis of the main works of both authors, as well as
   commentators.},

Abstract = {In the early 1980s Argentina, Brazil, and Mexico had commercial banking
   sectors that were dominated by local banks. The largest countries in
   Latin America were subjected to common international economic pressures
   during both the neoliberal 1980s and 1990s - including the expansion of
   capital markets in the periphery and integration into the regional trade
   agreements NAFTA and Mercosur - and the post-1998 financial turmoil. By
   2015, however, the three countries had consolidated alternative
   commercial banking systems: domestic private group dominated (Brazil),
   mixed (i.e., ownership more evenly divided among public, private
   domestic, and foreign banks (Argentina), and foreign bank dominated
   (Mexico). The article traces these alternative outcomes to the power of
   prereform private financial groups, the virulence of ``twin crises{''}
   in the transition from fixed to floating exchange rates, and the
   (contingent) role played by government ideology.},

   feminist political ideologies},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF POLITICAL IDEOLOGIES},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {22},
Number = {3},
Pages = {221-235},
Abstract = {The emerging literature on neoliberal feminism appears to signal the
   revitalization of the study of feminist ideologies, suspended since the
   mid-1980s. However, it is argued here that scholars tend to
   conceptualize neoliberal feminism in a way that inhibits ideological
   analysis, as exemplified in Nancy Fraser's Fortunes of Feminism. They
   take classifications of feminist political ideologies from the 1980s as
   representative of the only true feminisms, and thus view neoliberal
   feminism as a perversion, rather than an outgrowth, of earlier
   feminisms. This account of the emergence of neoliberal feminism is both
   historically inaccurate and politically problematic: it positions
   feminists as passive in the face of an overpowering neoliberal agency,
   and limits feminists' capacity to imagine themselves as agents of
   political and ideological change. Building on Michael Freeden's work on
   political ideologies, an alternative account of neoliberal feminism is
   offered, one that locates feminist agency in the production of new
   feminist ideologies.},

Abstract = {This essay reconstructs the main lines of Ferdinand Tonnies' (1855-1936)
   critical approach to the thought of Hobbes and Spinoza. Specifically it
   shows the role played by the two philosophers in developing the
   categories of community (Spinoza) and society (Hobbes). From the stand
   point of political thought, the essay reveals how Tonnies' on going
   interpretation of Hobbes focuses more and more on the constitutive
   moment of the modern form of State. In this area it draws on Spinoza's
   reflections on democracy as an absolutum omnino imperium. Tonnies is
   thus able to distinguish conceptually between the Hobbesian State, as a
   ``society{''} that absorbs all natural law, and its natural law origin
   (the ``original assembly{''}), where we find a ``common{''} element that
   can never be entirely neutralized by the State.},

Abstract = {The political consequences of economic globalization has lately been
   fiercely debated across Europe and the United States, including the role
   of labor immigration. In this paper we study the party choices of voters
   facing labor market competition from immigration. To identify the effect
   of labor market competition we introduce the national skill cell
   approach, which is designed to isolate a direct partial effect of
   immigrant competition. By access to detailed, population-wide,
   administrative data, we get precise measures of Norwegian voters'
   exposure to competition, and we relate this measure to voting behavior
   in five national elections. We find a polarizing effect of immigration
   among voters experiencing negative wage effects of immigration. The
   polarization points to the existence of a protectionist and a
   compensatory response, and we propose that predetermined ideological
   convictions determine the response.},

Pages = {55-70},
Abstract = {The article investigates the phenomenon of contemporary populism. The
   author draws attention to the contradictions accompanying the attempts
   of its conceptualization. He describes populism as a phenomenon that is
   completely ineradicable, though marginal and fading when the situation
   normalizes. At the same time, the description of the modernity in
   categories of post-policy, a postmodern, post-democracy, post-ideology,
   etc. leads us to the fact that populism begins to remind a systemically
   important phenomenon of modern political field. In order to achieve less
   contradictory conceptualization of the phenomenon of populism, the
   author proposes to study it in the context of the second and third Great
   Transformation of capitalism. Many experts claim populism to be the
   quintessence of consensus regarding the need for state regulation,
   characteristic for all the major ideologies of an era of the second
   Great Transformation. It remains considerably the same in the period of
   the third Great Transformation we are witnessing now. Since current
   problems cannot be solved ``in natural way,{''} there are objective
   prerequisites for the approach of a new era of social reformation.
   Traditional left-wing as well as traditional right-wing forces are in
   crisis, yielding initiative to the regulatory policy of neoliberals.
   However, the right-and left-wing populists are substituting them.
   Therefore, during the ongoing Great Transformation, the influence of
   populism will grow, as it is actually already happening now. People will
   place high expectations on populism, such as the usual expectations of
   the regulation and the expectations of social experiments aimed to make
   social organization of modern societies more appropriate and enrich it.
   These expectations will be satisfied to the extent that populism would
   be able to implement the underlying in its nature democratic desire of
   the ``nation{''} to gain control over their own destiny. Otherwise, both
   right and left populist political activities will reduce to contest for
   a rent, characteristic of an era of `` cognitive capitalism,{''} when,
   for example, the very existence of permanent job is already a privilege,
   providing a rent in the form of wages.},

Abstract = {In June 2013, Russia's first national cemetery was opened on the edge of
   Moscow. The draft plans from 2003 envisaged a park-like landscape
   cemetery which adopted elements of the Arlington National Cemetery in
   the United States. However, the results of the competition were quietly
   overturned. Instead of the space designed by the architects for quiet
   mourning and funerals for all ranks, sculptors created a cemetery in the
   Soviet monumental style for heroes and generals. The Ministry of
   Defence, which played a decisive role in the process, had no interest in
   breaking with tradition. The new cemetery pays homage to a
   pan-historical militarism in which the history of Russia is portrayed as
   a series of heroic victories.},

Abstract = {In this article, we explore the relationship between Americans'
   attitudes toward immigrants and immigration and their attitudes toward
   welfare. Using data from the Cumulative American National Election Study
   from 1992 to 2012, we find ample evidence of the influence of
   immigration attitudes on both individuals' attitudes toward welfare
   recipients and their attitudes toward increased welfare spending. These
   immigration effects persist even in the face of statistical controls for
   attitudes toward African Americans and attitudes toward the poor;
   indeed, in our models, the magnitude of the effects of immigration
   attitudes surpasses the magnitude of effects of attitudes toward blacks.
   Further, our findings of immigration effects withstand a range of
   robustness tests. Our results point to the possible immigrationalization
   of Americans' welfare attitudes and provide strong evidence that how
   Americans think about immigration and immigrants is a major factor in

Journal = {CRITICAL REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL SOCIAL AND POLITICAL PHILOSOPHY},

Volume = {20},

Pages = {211-221},
Abstract = {In his Democratic justice and the social contract, Weale presents a
   distinctive contingent practice-dependent model of `democratic justice'
   that relies heavily on a condition of just social and political
   relations among equals. Several issues arise from this account. Under
   which conditions might such just social and political relations be
   realised? What ideal of equality is required for `democratic justice'?
   What are its implications for the political ideal of citizenship? This
   paper focuses on these questions as a way to critically reconsider
   Weale's model. After presenting Weale's procedural constructivism, I
   distinguish his model from an institutional practice-dependent model,
   one salient example of which is Rawls's political constructivism. This
   distinction allows for a formulation of the social and political
   equality required for justice in each case. The contingent model assumes
   that an equality of `status' will generate just social practices, yet it
   fails to recognise that an equality of `role' is also important to
   ensure citizens' compliance. The paper ultimately seeks to show that the
   contingent model is insufficient to ensure that just social practices
   will become stable.},

Year = {2017},
Volume = {24},
Number = {6},
Pages = {906-928},
Abstract = {Political distrust is often widespread in African countries, but the
   prospects for increasing trust are uncertain given the lack of research
   on the origins of political trust in the region. Using the 2013 NSS
   Survey in Ghana and employing hierarchical regression analyses, we
   develop a model of institutional trust based on insights from both
   cultural and institutional performance theories. The results clearly
   support the superiority of institutional performance theories while at
   the same time providing limited support for cultural explanations.
   National pride, however, does also substantially encourage institutional
   trust. This asks for future, cultural-specific studies on trust-building
   in developing countries trying to establish working institutions using
   more representative, cross-national, and longitudinal data.},

Abstract = {Today protecting their own as well as planet's security is the most
   important geopolitical function of key actors operating in the
   international arena. Is the West capable of assuming this function? To
   answer this question, A.Goltsov analyzes the geopolitical role that the
   West is playing today. The author highlights the three most important
   geopolitical roles - the leader, the hegemon and the empire - and
   analyzes their content in detail. He shows that the modern geopolitical
   role of the West has several components and includes joint global
   leadership, transregional hegemony and local imperial governance. At the
   same time, according to his conclusion, when performing this role, the
   West faces a lot of various challenges, and preserving the unity is
   obviously one of them.},

Abstract = {This essay aims to introduce the general framework of this special issue
   as well as the contributions here gathered. A comparative reading of
   these contributions allows us to emphasize the relationship between
   citizenship and freedom and the importance of anchoring any sort of
   understanding in historical processes. In brief, in contemporary African
   realities, citizenship cannot be thought of without its implications in
   terms of belonging and recognition and freedom. Active citizenship a
   quite popular policy motto - is not one that arises from within power or
   formal political systems; it is one that currently challenges them from
   the outside. Thus, citizenship, as a belonging and recognition regime,
   is not to be dissociated from freedom. The right to be still stands.},

Abstract = {The First World War was a special ``moment of glory{''} in racial
   anthropology. Overflowing prisoner of war camps offered ample
   opportunity for anthropological research. German and Austrian scientists
   used the chance to measure the members of various nationalities in large
   numbers, particularly those from the Tsarist Empire and Southeast
   Europe. But anthropologists from East Central Europe also actively
   participated in these investigations. In the states that were newly
   founded after the First World War, racial anthropology gained
   considerably in importance. It was precisely in Europe's East that this
   research tradition initially experienced its strongest development in
   the interwar era.},

Title = {NATIONAL IDENTITIES AND INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS REDUX, OR IS IT
   NECESSARY TO `REINVENT' CONSTRUCTIVISM?},
Journal = {POLIS-POLITICHESKIYE ISSLEDOVANIYA},
Year = {2017},
Number = {4},
Pages = {165-174},
Abstract = {Identity is a prime subject of inquiry for constructivism in
   international relations theory; it has attracted the longstanding
   attention of other approaches. The monograph National Identities and
   International Relations (2016) by Richard Ned Lebow, a prominent
   international relations scholar, has been one of the most important
   recent attempts to introduce fundamental innovations in constructivism.
   This article is aimed at further theoretical reflection on identity
   through analyzing some controversial aspects in Lebow's approach and
   relating them with existing academic viewpoints. Lebow's ideas are
   criticized in this article primarily from within the constructivist
   methodology itself. Four series of problems are considered successively.
   The first relates to the general understanding of identity. It is shown
   that the plurality and changeability of identities stressed by Lebow
   have long been acknowledged in constructivism. The second emerges from
   the comparison between the identities of states and individuals. Lebow
   ignores the arguments supporting the possible existence at the state
   level of such group phenomena as emotions, cognition and consciousness
   not reducible to the level of their citizens. The article also suggests
   paying more attention than Lebow does to the gender dimension of states
   and to the fact that individual and state identities may in principle be
   equally plural. The third is connected to the sources of identity and to
   the relation between actors and society. Lebow oscillates between
   individualist and holistic views. His emphasis on the dialectic nature
   of identity formation is not novel. At the same time, Lebow obscures the
   sociality of some aspects of identity. The fourth concerns the mutual
   influence of identities, interests and practice. On the whole, Lebow
   underestimates the influence of identities on practice and interests. It
   is concluded that some of the solutions suggested by Lebow are
   controversial or not sufficiently novel, though his approach draws
   attention to important problems of constructivism which require detailed
   elaboration.},

   INTERPRETATION},
Journal = {POLIS-POLITICHESKIYE ISSLEDOVANIYA},
Year = {2017},
Number = {3},
Pages = {30-54},
Abstract = {The article analyzes the main interpretations in modern political
   science and political philosophy of the phenomenon of terrorism. In the
   public opinion, terrorism as the most important factor of contemporary
   politics is often perceived in a very superficial way. Many modern
   interpretations of terrorism, despite their apparent objectivity have
   consistently produced a stencil historical logic, based on purely
   external perception of terrorism as a subversive activity of individuals
   and small groups, guided by very different political motives. The media
   constantly reproduce this trend, creating conventional images of
   terrorists in political memory and thereby false perception of the true
   objectives they pursue and the real corporate structures that finance
   and direct their activities. The article proves the thesis that despite
   the stable liberal stereotypes, state terrorism should be viewed as a
   universal matrix while all other forms of individual and group
   terrorism, regardless of their social, class or ideological orientation,
   derive from this basic source. The paper considers the specific features
   of revolutionary terrorism in frames of a comparison of the historical
   experience of the French and Russian October Revolutions. In the course
   of a comparative analysis, the article critically assesses the results
   of the interpretation of this experience in the general sociological
   theories of Michael Mann, Barrington Moore and Immanuel Wallerstein and
   political philosophy of Neo-Marxism (Terry Eagleton, Fredric Jameson).
   The paper proves that the adequate scientific definitions of terrorism
   contribute to the destruction of some historiosophical concepts, which
   in recent decades have transformed into stable political myths. One of
   the most famous of these concepts is the theory of the `clash of
   civilizations.'},

Abstract = {The military plays a crucial role in furthering or hindering
   democratization in Africa. Beyond direct intervention through coups,
   armies more subtly and perniciously condition the political trajectory
   of states through their loyalty. Leaders who can rely on unwavering
   military support for protection against internal unrest face fewer risks
   and greater chances of success in rolling back liberalization and
   entrenching authoritarian practices. Constructing ethnic armies, which
   tie the fate of soldiers to the regime, is a profoundly powerful way to
   affect such loyalty. Through a mixed methods analysis of presidential
   bids to challenge term limits, including a paired comparison of Senegal
   and Cameroon, I demonstrate that ethnic armies triple the chances of
   success and, in so doing, encourage defiance in the first place: 82\% of
   presidents backed by ethnic armies attempt to defy their constitutions
   and extend their hold on power, as opposed to 31\% of other leaders.
   Conversely, ethnically diverse armies are far more likely to defend
   constitutional politics and constrain leaders to abide by term limits.
   The ethnic composition of the military thus critically shapes the
   prospects for African liberalization.},

Abstract = {Given enforceable rules and regulations that govern the relations of
   individuals in society, two kinds of rights can be derived: private and
   public. When we speak about the citizen and his/her rights, we mean a
   set of private and public law that governs social relationships. In
   fact, expression of citizenship rights means that every person enjoys as
   being a citizen of a country. The importance of the citizenship rights
   is to the extent that is closely related to place the rule of finds and
   even some experts believe that a society in which the rights of citizens
   and the relationship between people and government falters cannot be
   established. Guarantee of the fundamental rights of citizens, primarily
   implies by inserting these rights in the constitution of every country
   act. In other words, it takes an effective step in the process of
   constitution rule of law, freedom and enjoyment of facilities and take
   citizenship. But we must consider the fact that the protection and
   safeguarding of the rights of individual citizens is on the shoulders of
   all powers and government agencies that have the necessary measures to
   protect the rights of citizens. Besides, their executive units operate
   in all administrative formalities the rights of citizens and legal and
   in the case of not conforming citizens' rights are not overwhelm the
   device government should have a competent judicial authorities that the
   rights of individuals against the government defend the principles of a
   fair trial. So the fundamental rights of citizens included in the
   constitution and other laws, required to comply with these rights by the
   state, there is a competent judicial body that complaints about
   violation of their people by governmental agencies and monitor
   governmental bodies are responsible in this regard. All of them are
   standards implementation and guarantee of the rights of citizenship in a
   democratic society. Comparative analysis of compliance standards in the
   legal system of Iran and Tajikistan is a major point of discussion at
   the end, to recognizing the strengths and weaknesses of both countries
   and richer the implementation and monitoring of the implementation of
   the rights to use the experiences of the countries.},

Abstract = {The Engagement of China and the European Union (EU) in the WTO global
   trade governance is an important part of the China-EU Comprehensive
   Strategic Partnership. Since China's accession to the WTO in 2001, China
   and the EU have promoted the rapid growth of bilateral trade and the
   healthy development of bilateral trade relations; moreover, they have
   made contributions to the good functioning of the multilateral trading
   system by participating in the Doha Round negotiations, using the WTO
   dispute settlement mechanism, and reviewing respective trade policies
   and practices. The interaction between China and the EU was obviously
   asymmetric before 2008, the EU being offensive and China defensive.
   After that, the overall relations have been aimed towards a more
   reciprocal status. However, the interaction is far from being mature and
   China's capacity needs to be improved. In the present and near future,
   the interaction between China and the EU in the WTO will face some
   challenges.},

Abstract = {The article develops a simple model of contested responsibility
   attribution for extraterritorial human rights violations which is based
   on mechanisms of responsibility attribution and corresponding defense
   mechanisms. The article applies the model to the conflict on two
   extraterritorial rights violations that have occurred in the context of
   the US campaign against terrorism, namely torture and mass surveillance
   of foreigners abroad. The article shows that the model can both explain
   why states gradually take on responsibility in a new issue area (right
   to privacy) and why states anew take on responsibility for the
   protection of a human right that they have temporarily de facto
   denounced (right to freedom from torture).},

Abstract = {Is there more sincere voting in multi-member districts than in
   single-member districts? Existing research on this question is
   inconclusive, at least in part because it is difficult with
   observational data to isolate the effect of district magnitude on voting
   behavior independently from voters' preferences or the number of
   parties. Hence, we investigate this issue in a laboratory experiment,
   where we vary district magnitude while keeping the distribution of
   voters' preferences and the number of parties constant. We find that
   voting for the preferred party (sincere voting) increases with district
   magnitude. This is consistent with existing findings from observational
   data. We also discover a surprising result: a high incidence of
   ``frontrunner{''} voting, which cannot be easily explained by existing
   research.},

   prevention policies against money laundering on growth in the gulf
   countries (Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Qatar, Bahrain, UAE and Oman) from 1980
   to 2014. Thus, the logistic regression (logit model) had given three
   fundamental results. The first had shown that the main policies in
   matter of fight against money laundering (anti money laundering law
   AMLL, suspicious transaction reporting STR, the criminalizing of
   terrorist financing CTF) have had positive effects on the increasing of
   probabilities to realize more growth. The second is that the said
   policies have had positive effects on the increasing of the degree of
   openness of the whole sample. The third is that the variable (proximity)
   had a positive and significant effect on anti-money laundering policies.},

   populism tell us?},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF POLITICAL IDEOLOGIES},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {22},
Number = {1},
Pages = {74-91},
Abstract = {It might seem that Herbert Marcuse was right: leftist politics can no
   longer avoid the challenge of devising its own positive normative
   grounds. The neoliberal political rationality that is now hegemonic must
   be taken on by a new imaginary: radical, leftist and democratic. This
   article explores what major theories about new populism have to offer to
   a radical leftist attempt to reinvent itself. The regeneration of
   populist movements across the globe appears to offer signposts to guide
   a new radical politics. Yet I argue that populism is no ideologically
   empty mobilizing strategy able to be harnessed to all manner of
   political purposes. Embedded in its demagogic form are key presumptions
   about the character of democratic justification that collude with a
   neoliberal political project. Theories of new populism help us to shed
   light, instead, on the challenges that face the Left in its own self-
   reconstitution amidst liberal democratic crisis. Circumspection
   concerning the ideological load that is carried by a populist rendering
   of democratic politics needs to be united with an insight into how the
   rise of populism itself issues a warning about aspects of a social
   democratic past that cannot be reclaimed unchanged.},

Abstract = {The Eurasianists of the 1920s regarded Eurasia as a political, cultural
   and spiritual antipode to the western world. Following the dissolution
   of the Soviet Union, this concept enjoyed a renaissance. Once again, it
   took on imperialist, anti-western features. However, for several years,
   some intellectuals have been redefining the term. The ethno-nationalist
   mobilisation in Russia has meant that in the humanities, ``Eurasia{''}
   has become a counter concept to the ``Russian World{''}. The intention
   is to replace the hegemonial claim in favour of all things Russian with
   the notion of a post-imperialist space for different cultures.},

Title = {`Germanje': Dutch empire-building in Nazi-occupied Europe},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF GENOCIDE RESEARCH},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {19},
Number = {2, SI},
Pages = {240-257},
Abstract = {Recent historiography on Nazism has taken what has been coined `the
   imperial turn'. The key issue at stake is to what extent Germany's
   expansionist policy between 1939 and 1945 could be considered a variant
   of the more general historical phenomenon of (modern) imperialism. Over
   the course of the last two decades, all sorts of continuities and
   parallels between traditional European colonialism and Nazi imperialism
   have been analysed. In these studies, a top-down approach is prevalent,
   concentrating on `Berlin', Nazi politics and leaders. This article
   chooses a different perspective, bringing actors of a lower level to the
   fore. The focus is on the Dutch contribution to the Nazi policy of
   `Germanization' of the occupied East. Between the summers of 1941 and
   1944, over five thousand Dutch civilians voluntarily left their homeland
   to be employed in the so-called German occupied eastern territories.
   Although their contracts were often temporary, they were seen (and saw
   themselves) as the first group of `pioneers' of a giant colonizing
   project. This article investigates the Dutch organizations coordinating
   their recruitment and employment, and zooms in on the expectations and
   experiences of individual recruits. With the Dutch case as an example,
   the article points at the broader historical context of the Dutch
   efforts. At the same time, it shows that this junior partner of the
   German had his own colonial agenda. The incompatibility of both agendas
   inevitably led to false expectations, caused a general sense of
   disillusionment on both sides and led to many frictions `on the spot'.},

Abstract = {Kenwick, Vasquez, and Powers question whether empirical evidence
   supports the claim that defense pacts deter conflict as our prior
   research has concluded. We review the theoretical argument for why
   defense pacts should deter conflict and consider the challenges inherent
   in evaluating deterrence using observational data. We then consider
   whether the research design choices of Kenwick et al. improve upon our
   research design. We demonstrate that claims that defense pacts deter
   conflict are robust to many of these changes in research design, and we
   argue that the consequential difference, while perhaps appropriate for
   testing the Steps-to-War argument, is not appropriate for testing the
   deterrent effect of defense pacts. We conclude by noting that a
   deterrence effect of defense pacts is not necessarily incompatible with
   aspects of the Steps-to-War argument, and we suggest profitable new
   directions for testing the Steps-to-War approach.},

Abstract = {In recent years, the territorial problem, present in the history of
   Spain from the S. XIX, has been accentuated, at the mercy of the
   institutional and economic crisis in our country. This study focuses on
   the case of Catalonia, where there have been two phenomena
   simultaneously: an unprecedented increase participation and expansion of
   independence phenomenon, which until recently was relatively dormant few
   dates. Throughout the following pages both phenomena thereby
   establishing an analysis of participation relate the period 2006-2015.
   The aim is to conclude whether or not the independence phenomenon has
   sought increased participation (and analyze what ideological bloc is
   benefited), test the hypothesis linking large populations and little
   sense of belonging to the community and analyze if identity explained in
   greater as the mobilization in 2006 than in 2015.},

Title = {Political enthusiasm for social pensions and its eventual decline in
   Taiwan: an institutional account of pension dynamics in a new democracy},
Journal = {ASIAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {25},
Number = {1},
Pages = {68-88},
Abstract = {Over the last two decades, there has been a remarkable transformation of
   the demography and political economy of East and Southeast Asia, thus
   raising pensions as an important policy issue. In addressing the pension
   needs of those outside formal sector employment, Taiwan was the regional
   forerunner regarding social pension provision. However, the immense
   political popularity of these schemes waned and from the mid-2000s
   onwards the government began to substitute them with a contributory
   system for the socially disadvantaged. This paper analyses the political
   dynamics of social pensions in Taiwan, from expansion of coverage
   through to gradual dismantlement. The politics surrounding these
   benefits has received scant attention in international scholarship, with
   the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank Institute, in particular,
   having focused most of their attention on policy design issues. The
   contention here is that a specific configuration of political factors
   featured prominently in Taiwan, thus providing an explanation for the
   evolution of its pension policy. Also, these political dimensions can
   shed light on how this type of pension could evolve in other East and
   Southeast Asian countries, which is pertinent given that many have
   increasingly ageing populations.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF POLITICAL POWER},

Pages = {200-218},
Abstract = {The purpose of this article is to study emotion management by focusing
   on emotion labour in relation to organisational resistance in
   psychiatry. Drawing on focus group interviews and individual interviews
   with 11 therapists in psychiatry, and on theories of emotion management
   and harbouring work (i.e. managing emotion work and renewing energy in a
   team), we argue that individual workers in psychiatry have to create
   strategies on their own. The main findings show that emotions are
   harboured alone and resistance strategies created in solitude can be
   characterised as everyday resistance and organisational misbehaviour,
   performed in deep backstage spaces such as the bathroom.},

Abstract = {The political order of Modernity has undergone a number of significant
   transformations due to the dynamics of the structure of the modern
   society, which changes its perception of a majority as an ontological
   basis of this political project. Majority has never been statistical.
   Rather, it has always been constructed on purpose by the leading
   political figures within the collective imagination of a society, being
   the subject of a dynamic consensus. The article discusses several
   historical constellations of a majority within the changing structure of
   the society of the Modernity, analyzes their strengthening and weakening
   factors. According to V.Martianov's conclusion, the global political
   order is gradually losing the need to rely upon once-sacred concept of
   the will of the majority in order to be legitimate, which creates
   conditions for the establishment of non-democratic ways of legitimation.},

   on Labour Migration},
Journal = {GERMAN POLITICS},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {26},
Number = {2},
Pages = {255-272},
Abstract = {As a macrostructure, this article uses a bureaucratic politics framework
   to understand the preference formation of the German federal government
   on liberalising economic migration policies. This allows unpacking the
   process of preference formation and linking it to a number of causal
   factors, which, by influencing the costs and benefits distribution of
   the relevant actors, shape the position of the government. The article
   argues that the misfit between the existing national regulations for
   economic migration and European-level policies has to be zero -
   otherwise the economic and political adaptation costs for the actors
   involved are too high. A heated national debate on immigration is
   negatively related to governmental support for such measures, as the
   political costs of support skyrocket. Conversely, if the decision-making
   process happens bureaucratically, this helps to attain governmental
   support, as the political costs of doing so are kept minimal.},

Abstract = {Despite its centrality to organizing life sciences and identity
   politics, the body tends to disappear even when it is under scholarly
   consideration. The disappearing act of the body is supported by
   theoretical and methodological approaches that implicitly or explicitly
   see the body as an object that is acted upon and/or is the medium
   through which other concepts operate. A methodological approach that
   begins with bodywork allows us to understand the body not only as a site
   of action but also constitutive of the possibilities and limits of
   interacting with fields of power and ideology. Beginning with a
   consideration of the phenomenon of identity passing, the ethnography
   produced by bodies in action becomes apparent both to scholars and to
   those engaged in identity production and reaction.},

Abstract = {The commentators in this Special Issue raise questions about a number of
   aspects of the book. One group of critics questions the book's overall
   normative strategy, asking whether too much weight is placed on the idea
   of neutrality. A second group raises doubts about the account of
   neutrality itself. A third zeroes in on the book's discussion of
   language rights. And a fourth group is critical of the book's
   assumptions about democracy, and about its relevance to public policy
   disputes. In this reply, I seek to address each of these clusters of
   concerns. In some places, I suggest, my commentators have misunderstood
   my position. In other places, I argue, they have not sufficiently
   thought through the implications of their alternatives to that position.},

   relation to the eternal law and positive law, as well as its
   relationship with the human soul and the inclinations it shelters, in
   order to show how, according to St. Thomas, the community to which we

   our flourishment as human beings, is a community composed of not

Year = {2017},
Volume = {33},

Abstract = {The article analyzes the political action of the Landless Rural Workers'
   Movement (MST) in Brazil from 1989 to 2002. The objective is to reveal
   analytically the particularities of the MST's nonviolent struggles for
   the democratic and equitable access of peasants to ownership of land
   since 1989; a stage characterized using violent mechanisms by the
   Government, at the boom of neoliberalism. It is carried out from a
   qualitative methodological perspective, using as techniques of data
   collection the Bibliographic-Documentary Review and the Content
   Analysis. The results allow to conclude that the MST and its leaders
   were criminalized and faced the violence of the police, the army and the
   gunmen at the service of the corporations and the large landowners.
   However, it was verified how the struggle of the MST is carried out
   through nonviolent political action and using peaceful methods,
   including land occupations, camps, walks, letters to politicians, public
   statements, mass protests, demands to the national executive,
   demonstrations in large cities, publications and political manifests in
   the media and in the Jornal dos Trabalhadores Rurais Sem Terra, its own
   press organ.},

Abstract = {Punishing the criminals is one of the criminal justice mechanisms to
   compensation and reparation for victims and society. In this regards
   some of the punishments are determined by criminal justice systems in
   every society. Imprisonment is one of these penalties which specified in
   this regard and through this punishment the convicted persons are
   detained in prison. However, the guilty is sentenced to prison and
   restriction of his or her liberties, but she or he has fundamental
   rights and freedoms that must be protected even if in prison and has the
   right to how to be punished. All of these rights and freedoms are
   protected by the rule of law. This issue means that how to be punished
   is restricted under the definite principles which have to be exercised
   when the retribution and punishment is ongoing. This matter of criminal
   law and criminal justice is considered as right on how to be punished.
   The area of this right and authority of prison's heads and its personnel
   is determined by law. In order to do that and protection of prisoner's
   human rights and regulating manner with them and also for prison
   management, the rule of law provided a set of guidelines. According to
   these guidelines prison is managed in the legal framework as well as in
   this context the prisoner's rights are protected effectively. These
   guidelines are provided in some of international legal instruments. This
   article investigates these guidelines and in respect of their human
   rights aspects which related to the environmental, educational,
   management, health care, personnel and humanistic dimensions of
   imprisonment these guidelines and instructions are studied and analyzed.},

Abstract = {Our society is characterized by more and more significant changes which
   present a particularly strong impact on education. In such a historical
   context, making predictions about the future of education is an
   extremely delicate mission for policy-makers, researchers, parents and
   learners. In the current paper, we formulated the hypothesis that
   prospects in education are influenced by economic, social, geopolitical
   and pedagogical factors. In order to explore our working hypothesis, we
   carried out more than sixty semi-structured interviews with national,
   European, international officials of international organizations,
   European Union and Romanian educational organizations. Political
   discourse analysis highlights that the future of education worldwide is
   mainly interdependent on financial funding for education, ``ageing{''}
   challenges, real outputs after a training period, as well as the
   ``Lifelong Leaning{''} approach.},

Abstract = {Focusing on Japan, this paper explores whether powers and competences in
   the political system are likely to be recalibrated in favour of the
   executive when the environment is perceived as increasingly threatening.
   It shows that the executive has been significantly strengthened during
   the past two decades of political reforms, though a closer look reveals
   that only the most recent efforts are motivated by security concerns.
   Case studies on military deployments and arms exports do not expose any
   clear trend towards curbing parliament's formal control powers, but they
   indicate two related mechanisms that affect executive. legislative
   relations. Firstly, the executive has sought to ensure faster
   decision-making in security policy, which may limit the Diet's ability
   to scrutinise policies in depth. Secondly, the level of contestation
   over security policy issues has been decreasing, especially given the
   securitisation of North Korea and China. This provides the executive
   with more leeway in devising policies.},

Abstract = {This article explores to which extent the involvement in European
   transnational projects has contributed to the professionalization of the
   intercultural occupation in the social area. Through the
   transnationality principle, the European Commission supports
   economically transnational communities of practice and joint projects
   managed by voluntary associations and for-profit groups and sub-national
   authorities based in different European Union (EU) member states. This
   article shows that in the absence of set of clear-cut standards,
   practices and routines in the social area, the EU has not contributed to
   the professionalization of the intercultural profession. The analysis of
   basic intercultural skills such as intercultural communication and
   intercultural awareness, shows that intercultural project management has
   been characterized by a certain amateurism, taking different forms
   depending on the national and local contexts. In this qualitative
   comparative study, empirical evidence is drawn from document analysis
   and in-depth semi-structured interviews with project managers involved
   in transnational cooperation in France and in the Netherlands.},

Title = {Policing a riot-torn city: Kolkata, 16-18 August 1946},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF GENOCIDE RESEARCH},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {19},
Number = {1},
Pages = {39-60},
Abstract = {Calcutta is now known as Kolkata, but for the purposes of this article,
   Calcutta is retained throughout. Historical accounts of the Great
   Calcutta Riots (1946) emphasize their role in making Indian Partition an
   inevitable outcome of nationalist-religious politics in colonial India.
   It is seen as a critical event in the religious wars, conventionally
   known as the Partition riots or communal riots, in the Indian
   sub-continent in 1945-47. This article, while basing itself on previous
   historical understanding, views the Great Calcutta Killings as a
   remarkable event in the mutually constitutive relations between the
   police and the crowd. The police apparatus built by the colonial state
   was based fundamentally on the obedience of individuals and individual
   subjection to the institution of law and order when the feudal form of
   allegiance was no longer required. Their conduct was now required to
   demonstrate total and exhaustive obedience to whatever the imperatives
   of the colonial state were in relation to protection of the economy,
   commerce, trade, education, health, territory and security of life. The
   success of the apparatus depended on a smooth interrelation of these
   imperatives and thus between different functions of the police. The
   Calcutta Riots showed that there may be moments when the smooth
   relations break down, when all bounds of obedience are broken, and
   populations imagine their conduct not in juridical terms, but in other
   possible frames. In other words, politics will no longer be conducted in
   a civilian frame, but in the frame of war-one more reason to think of
   the riots as a moment in a war. In those moments, the link between the
   reason of state and that of the government may collapse. In this
   context, the Calcutta Riots further tell us (a) how borders within a
   city emerge in situations of violence and how an event like the Calcutta
   Riots dispels the myth that the city is an organic unity unaffected by
   borders and boundary-making exercises; and (b) how the failure of the
   Calcutta Riot Enquiry Commission to conclude its findings demonstrated
   the closure of legal logic.},

Abstract = {Support of human rights and the appearance of ``human security{''} issue
   in the new system of international law as a newfangled concept, has led
   to a change in traditional outlook towards security. In the present
   paper beside taking into consideration the concept of security in
   Realist and Liberal Perspectives, the developmental performance of the
   state regarding enforcement of rules (as the first serious addressee of
   providing and guaranteeing human rights in international rights system)
   from national security with a focus on human security in the context of
   good governance was considered as well. The primary objective of the
   study was to understand the effect of good governance on human security
   realization. In such a way that states would be able to increase the
   coefficient of human security provision and guaranty by changing the
   method of governance in their territory. Also, reforming the governance
   structure besides taking steps to strengthen individuals in the face of
   human insecurity is also a coherent approach to providing a helpful
   background for civil society.},

Abstract = {This article presents a novel analytical account of the relationship
   between deliberation and representation by reconstructing the specific
   institutional logics that guide deliberative action in parliaments. In
   contrast to the dominant generalised paradigm in empirical deliberation
   research it develops a contextualised-systemic approach. The article
   argues that the parliamentary context is characterised by a tension
   between two equally legitimate institutional logics: a discursive one,
   institutionalised through parliamentary procedures, and a positional
   one, constituted by relations of representation. The resulting
   theoretical model links the specific institutional and situational
   conditions to different forms and functions of deliberation. Depending
   on the specific balance between both logics deliberation fulfils
   functions of either integration or contestation. The model is applied to
   a comparative analysis of different cases of parliaments demonstrating
   how this account can advance both the comparative analysis of
   deliberation in representative institutions and the development of
   deliberative democracy after the systemic turn.},

Abstract = {Marx's formulation of alienation theory creates a clear rupture from the
   work of German idealistic philosophers, unveiling the possibility of new
   theoretical investigations-the critique of political economy. This essay
   discusses the potential relationship between alienation and ideology in
   order to reveal their possibly tight and deep bonds. It reveals that
   alienation and ideology can either feed each other or work in opposite
   directions. In other words, ideology reinforces alienation in certain
   moments but in others it can counter the effects of alienation.
   Therefore, alienation and ideology are two different yet related
   concepts. The differences between the two concepts are exposed by
   questioning some interpretations of Marx's work. As a result, this essay
   argues that there is no epistemological rupture in Marx's texts and that
   considering the importance of humanism is one correct approach to
   understanding his work.},

Volume = {13},
Number = {1},
Pages = {35-53},
Abstract = {As a contribution to the growing literature on transnational advocacy
   networks (TANs) in the global production networks, this article examines
   how civil society organizations (CSOs), which have adopted the TAN
   approach, influence the sugar industry in Cambodia. Due to ineffective
   domestic influencing strategies, the CSOs adopted the TAN approach and
   escalated to an international supply chain movement approach (ISCMA)
   aiming to influence international stakeholders at each stage of the
   sugar supply chain in order to leverage boomerang pressure on the sugar
   producing companies and the Government of Cambodia. Despite its
   resourceful networking strategies, the ISCMA failed to leverage
   significant influence on the sugar companies and the government to
   achieve its demands. The failure was not due to weak networks, but was
   in part due to the political nexus between the government and the sugar
   companies. This article suggests that to ensure the effectiveness of
   CSOs' actions within the TAN framework in the global production
   networks, one should take into account the power of the government in
   relation to local politico-commercial elites.},

   economic, cultural and political areas. One of the largest and most
   relevant issues are the so called ``fragile states{''}. The lack of
   stability on the territories of those countries determines numerous
   local and global threats. One of the most relevant ones of those is the
   terrorism. Terrorists, aware of fragile states weakness, use the chaos
   and overall lack of the control of the state apparatus; they organize
   easily and train new members so that they can operate on the given

Title = {Can Liberal Democracy Survive Capitalism?},
Journal = {CRITICAL REVIEW},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {29},
Number = {4},
Pages = {530-544},
Abstract = {Joseph Schumpeter's Capitalism, Socialism and Democracy captures the
   unique blend of politics and economics, along with a particular culture
   and civil society, that are characteristic of liberal democracy.
   Commercial and economic activity have been so crucial to liberal
   democracy that it has often been characterized as commercial
   republicanism, and Schumpeter referred to it with justification as
   bourgeois democracy. Schumpeter's view, which is too often characterized
   as simply elitist, can be situated in the realist tradition, offering a
   helpful corrective to simplistic understandings of democracy, such as
   populist understandings, that are at odds with the promise of liberal
   democracy. Yet while Schumpeter thought that capitalism would collapse
   under its own contradictions, and wondered if democracy could survive
   without it, today global capitalism looks unstoppable. It is bourgeois
   democracy that looks fragile, not because of the collapse of capitalism,
   as Schumpeter predicted, but because of its success. Can liberal
   democracy surive if global capitalism undermines the middle class on
   which it depends?},

Journal = {POLITICS GROUPS AND IDENTITIES},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {5},
Number = {1},
Pages = {172-181},
Abstract = {This note characterizes queer methods developed in the humanities in
   ways that may be useful in social science and law. Since it is
   antithetical to queer theory's resistance to fixity to concretize queer
   methods into a metatheory, this note characterizes these methods as
   queer sensibilities. Queer sensibilities are useful for analyzing queer
   bodies in public spaces - physical spaces and democratic spaces -
   especially in research programs concerned with sexual citizenship. This
   note connects queer sensibilities to sculptures of Charles Ray. His work
   serves as both a metaphor for and substantive example of methods that
   replicate heteronormativity by erasing pubic queerness. Queer
   sensibilities leverage insights for how law and culture construct norms
   of sexual citizenship. At the heart of this note is a queer perspective
   on the extent to which men's naked and queer bodies enter the dialogic
   of sexual citizenship, when heteronormativity censors such bodies and
   silences sexual expression.},

   Citizenship, Outspeech, and Queer Narrative},
Journal = {NEW POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {39},
Number = {4, SI},
Pages = {568-587},
Abstract = {Queer theory is nearly absent from political science, including public
   law. This article advances constructivism as a paradigm shift in the
   context of sexual citizenship. The project, informed by queer theory,
   argues that political and legal systems (and related academic
   disciplines) regulating sexual citizenship should consider the
   political, legal, and cultural technologies that construct mutable
   sexualities, rather than viewing sexualities as innate and fixed.
   Despite significant political and legal advances under the
   sexual-essentialist paradigm, this paradigm gets in the way of
   manifesting a number of ``possibilities{''} to which queer theory
   alludes, and besides, sexual essentialism is not true. Having political
   science and public law consider sexual constructivism particularly and
   queer theory generally is critical to understanding sexual citizenship
   politics. Doing so involves claiming queer theory as a decidedly
   political theory and, therefore, a province of political science. This
   article discusses reasons for a paradigm shift toward sexual
   constructivism and why political science and law are notably late to
   embracing queer theory. I offer ``outspeech{''} as one possibility for a
   queer legal theory that reshapes sexual citizenship. I end with a call
   for more queer narratives and autoethnographies.},

Abstract = {Religion and ethnicity are inextricably linked in discourse within and
   about Central Asia. One common narrative suggests that as a result of
   differences between historically sedentary and nomadic populations,
   ethnic Tajiks and Uzbeks are naturally more religious and more likely to
   radicalize than their Kazakh and Kyrgyz neighbors. Using extensive data
   available from the Pew Research Center's 2012 The World's Muslims
   survey, this study examines whether such claims stand up to empirical
   scrutiny. The data cast doubt on simplified versions of this discourse
   and suggest that future analyses should focus attention on
   individual-level explanations rather than potentially essentializing
   group-based narratives.},

Journal = {POLIS-POLITICHESKIYE ISSLEDOVANIYA},

Pages = {90-105},
Abstract = {The article offers an analytical picture of the ethno-cultural shifts
   taking place in the developed regions of the world, socio-political
   impact of those shifts, prospects and framework for the realization of
   integration potential of diversity. These topics are analyzed from the
   standpoint of the identity approach in the context of theories of
   conflict and contact and using microdata of the European Social Survey.
   It is shown that global migration increases ethnic and cultural
   heterogeneity of host societies which is becoming more and more a
   powerful factor of the decline of trust, cohesion and stability of these
   societies. The migration crisis in the EU has increased the threat of
   translating the ethno-cultural contradictions into a destructive
   conflict of identities. Meanwhile following the logic of migration
   processes and their effects development, the transient nature of the
   escalation of intercultural confrontation may be assumed. The factors
   facilitating positive interethnic interaction are identified. The
   article provides examples of diversity contributing to the alleviation
   of intercultural tensions and transformation of the divided communities
   into social organisms operating as ``E Pluribus Unum{''}. The
   realization of the positive potential of diversity requires an efficient
   model of intercultural relations based on the recognition of the
   existence of ethnic and other differences within society and focused on
   finding the foundations for the rapprochement of cultures which is
   different from multiculturalism and assimilation. Given that as
   omniculturalism, emphasizing the commonality of human nature, and
   polyculturalism, representing cultures and nations as a product of
   overlapping histories of different ethnic and racial groups and their
   relationships, could generate contradictory effects, interculturalism
   seems to be more promising. This approach is focused on searching common
   interests of people and stimulating an intercultural dialog from below.
   Though intercultural initiatives are not numerous, they have already
   given a good account, requiring the search of instruments of practical
   implementation of such practices at the subnational and especially
   national levels.},

Abstract = {The article studies the influence of economic factors on the electoral
   behavior of Russians during the federal parliamentary elections in
   2003-2016. The conducted research proved the existence of the so-called
   ``Putin contract{''}, but also revealed a number of patterns that
   partially contradict initial assumptions. According to their statistical
   model, in dynamics economic voting in Russia manifests itself as an
   exchange of population's loyalty for medium-term economic growth and
   lower poverty levels. However, this is different from ``voting with your
   wallet{''} and seeking immediate benefits, which, according to R.
   Turovsky and Yu. Gaivoronsky, partly explains the absence of the
   negative trend in the performance of the ``United Russia{''} in 2016
   elections: two years of crisis were not enough for the electorate to
   lose trust in current power that earned a certain level of credibility.},

Title = {Transforming (but not transcending) the state system? On statist
   cosmopolitanism},
Journal = {CRITICAL REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL SOCIAL AND POLITICAL PHILOSOPHY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {20},
Number = {6},
Pages = {657-676},
Abstract = {Can states become committed and competent agents of cosmopolitan
   justice? The theory of `statist cosmopolitanism' argues that they can:
   their citizens can be turned towards a commitment to cosmopolitan
   principles and actions by moral entrepreneurs constituting a
   `cosmopolitan avant-garde', and can be sustained in their commitment to
   those principles by their pre-existing attachment to the state as a
   political community. Taking cosmopolitan principles as axiomatic, this
   paper subjects statist cosmopolitanism to critique. First, I question
   the scale of the transformation that a cosmopolitan avant-garde can
   engender given the complexity of the causal chains the avant-garde seek
   to elucidate, as well as the countervailing potency of the state itself
   which reinforces particularistic attitudes in its citizens. Second, I
   argue that even if, contra my preceding argument, the cosmopolitan
   avant-garde were to be successful, states would find it desirable to
   federally integrate in order to be better able to realise their
   cosmopolitan commitments. Such integration is compatible with statist
   cosmopolitanism's motivational theory, even if not its institutional
   vision. Finally, I re-characterise the cosmopolitan avant-garde as
   agitators for the transcendence, rather than just transformation, of the
   state system.},

Abstract = {Since the onset of the crisis the EU has introduced new instruments of
   economic governance, at the heart of which is the European Semester.
   Scholars largely disagree on which institutional actor has come out as
   the winner from these reforms. This article attempts to contribute to
   this debate by examining how the European Semester has been enforced by
   the Commission since 2011. The main argument is that although the
   decision-making process during the crisis has been broadly dominated by
   member states, the Commission enjoys considerable discretion over the
   enforcement of the European Semester. This is explained by the
   incomplete nature of the contracts of delegation between member states
   and the Commission. As a case study, the article focusses on the
   Commission's discretion in enforcing the Macroeconomic Imbalance
   Procedure and the reinforced Stability and Growth Pact, as well as in
   shaping the procedures of the Semester itself. At the same time, it is
   shown that the Commission uses its discretion very carefully,
   alternating between flexibility and rigidity.},

Abstract = {A staple of policymaking in any federation is intergovernmental
   cooperation, which can take the form of vertical initiatives between the
   central and substate governments or as horizontal initiatives among the
   substate governments themselves. Most research has focused the former
   whereby the central government often deploys powerful levers to
   encourage the constituent members to cooperate. Such accounts, however,
   cannot be applied to cases occurring without the influence of the
   proverbial Leviathan. This article sets out to identify conditions that
   may be conducive to horizontal cooperation, developing a set of
   propositions focusing on economic, institutional, and ideational
   factors. These propositions are then considered on three cases of
   cooperation with varying results in Canadian education. While no single
   factor can be identified as necessary and sufficient for horizontal
   cooperation, institutional and ideational conditions interacted in
   dynamic ways and appeared to play the leading roles in the outcomes
   presented here.},

Abstract = {When are citizens most likely to hold politicians to account for
   wrongdoing? In a crowded information environment, political
   accountability requires that credible information about politician
   behavior is available and that citizens are able to identify credible
   information as such. Focusing on this second requirement, we argue that
   the ability to discern more credible from less credible information is
   increasing in citizens' cognitive and political sophistication. Using
   data from an original survey experiment in Brazil, we show that all
   citizens react negatively to corruption allegations but that more
   politically sophisticated respondents are themost likely to discern
   between sources of information that differ in their credibility. In
   particular, they are more skeptical of low-credibility sources than
   their less sophisticated counterparts. Our findings suggest a novel
   mechanism that may link increasing education with control of political
   corruption: educated citizens are better able to discern, and therefore
   act on, credible corruption accusations.},

Abstract = {This chapter discusses ways in which discourses and fear serve to
   establish a sense of community, while simultaneously erecting barriers
   to outsiders. Two discourses are discerned that reinforce the difference
   between ``us{''} and ``them{''}: (1) a discourse of deprivation,
   deployed by the middle-class social workers, to distinguish themselves
   from the working class residents; and (2) a discourse of ethnic and
   racial otherness used by both the restaurant management and the
   visitors, who evoked collective fear and barriers for non-whites and
   Muslims. As the chapter shows, a mechanism of ``ethnic leveraging{''}
   was brought into being, through which the white working class residents
   attempted to elevate themselves as a group by passing on the stigma of
   ``being particularly problematic{''} to ethnic and racial others.},

   Political Science Summer Bridge Program},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE EDUCATION},

Pages = {447-463},
Abstract = {Summer bridge programs are supposed to connect a graduating high school
   senior's summer to their first semester in college, easing the
   transition away from home and into a university setting. Although
   research is plentiful on the programs, assessments regarding the overall
   effectiveness of such programs have been mixed (e.g., Cabrera, Miner,
   and Milem 2013; Douglas and Attewell 2014; Grayson 2003). As Cabrera,
   Miner, and Milem (2013) note, many of the studies collect data from
   participants in a one-time satisfaction survey and/or do not have an
   equivalent group of students who did not participate in the program from
   which to compare effectiveness. Our proposed study mitigates these flaws
   by employing a nonequivalent-groups quasi-experiment (NEG). Our bridge
   program-called Early Start (ES)-tapped into social, emotional, and
   academic engagement, as we sought to integrate the students into the
   university and school communities while holding high expectations and
   actively involving them in their own learning (Tinto 2004). Results
   suggest that not only were students enrolled in our program better
   socially and emotionally integrated into the university during their
   first year but they also scored better on content-based political
   science questions at the end of the fall semester, compared to their
   non-Early Start peers. Finally, aggregated data indicate an increase in
   retention for Early Start participants.},

Abstract = {By comparing four mobilizations of ``without{''} (unemployed persons and
   undocumented people) in France, we investigate the interactions between
   the feminism and the processes of deepening democratization in the years
   1990-2000. Through an immersion based on participating observations and
   interviews since 1998 until 2016, this article shows that the experience
   of democratic deepening which establish the ``progressive{''} social
   movements are not exempt to reproduce and to produce -through the
   militating division of labour-relations of domination between agents and
   dynamics of resistance of the latter. First, we identify the extent to
   which the male domination structures every studied mixed struggle.
   Second, we explain how, thanks to the organization of the militant work,
   some men impose themselves and lock the other participants into
   dominated modes -active or passive-of participation. Third, if the
   feminism as a political movement seems relegated, even rejected, it does
   not mean that feminist practices do not succeed in spreading. It is
   about a ``practical feminism{''} which alternates between the direct
   denunciation of the male domination and the more indirect confrontation
   with the latter through the organization of the militant labour.},

Abstract = {Analysis of vice presidential favorability and job approval polling data
   for the past four vice presidents suggests that there is a mismatch
   between how scholars and the public perceive the vice presidency.
   Specifically, data illustrate that vice presidential favorability and
   job approval ratings are overwhelmingly influenced by presidential
   favorability and job approval ratings. While vice presidents advise and
   help their presidents carry out any number of important tasks, most
   citizens do not seem to form independent opinions about them. The
   analysis adds to our understanding of the institution and has normative
   implications, inasmuch as it suggests that there may be a lack of
   democratic accountability associated with one of the only two nationally
   elected officials in the United States.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this article is to test the contact hypothesis among
   self-identifying Bosniak, Croat, Serb, and Bosnian high school seniors
   in Bosnia and Herzegovina, using the Other-Group Orientation Scale
   (Roberts et al., 1999). This article finds that attending a
   `non-appropriate' ethnic school statistically increases tolerance of
   out-group members, which conforms to the predictions of the contact
   hypothesis, originally put forth by Allport (1958). This field research
   also found that secondary schools are largely homogenous in the country,
   thus preventing high levels of cross-ethnic contact in schools, which
   was expected. This article represents the first post-war, countrywide
   quantitative testing of the contact hypothesis.},

Title = {How voter mobilization from short text messages travels within
   households and families: Evidence from two nationwide field experiments},
Journal = {ELECTORAL STUDIES},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {50},
Pages = {39-49},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Through two large GOTV field experiments in two different elections, we
   investigate the spillover effect to other household members and family
   members outside the household. We mobilized young voters with cell phone
   text messages, a campaign tactic unlikely to be observed by other
   persons than the treated. The direct effect varied but approximately 30
   percent spilled over to other persons in the household, even parents.
   The effects are subtle and we cannot with certainty establish that a
   spillover effect exists. However, we demonstrate, using Bayesian
   updating, that even an initial skeptic becomes close to convinced that
   the effect spills over. Our study provides evidence by suggesting that
   young individuals' decision to vote affect other household members,
   including their parents, to do the same. When young voters live without
   their parents, we find no evidence of spillovers to parents, suggesting
   that households are more important than families ties for turnout
   contagion. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Journal = {POLITICAL RESEARCH QUARTERLY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {70},
Number = {4},
Pages = {778-789},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Hannah Arendt claims that Thomas Hobbes was responsible for constituting
   modern people as apolitical subjects who can no longer make independent
   moral judgments. The refusal to think that Hobbes allegedly engendered
   was a major factor in twentieth-century totalitarianism's worst crimes.
   In her view, Hobbes's Leviathan established the architecture of the
   totalitarian state and initiated the cultivation of people so incapable
   of exercising moral judgment that they stood idly by and let such a
   state commit horrors in their name. I argue that Hobbes rejected the
   proto-totalitarian form of domination Arendt attributes to him and
   expressed hope about the human capacities for practical judgment and
   moral improvement. Instead of creating thoughtless subjects which
   authorize any crime the state might commit, he suggests that the
   Leviathan should cultivate the public's capacity for reason and judgment
   to make violence unnecessary. Considering Hobbes's accounts of reason
   and science in light of his materialism shows that the Leviathan
   requires the exercise of individual moral thought and judgment to
   function properly. I suggest that the primary duty of the Hobbesian
   sovereign might be understood primarily in terms of the cultivation of
   individual judgment and reason rather than its suppression.},

   its recent State Intelligence System, established and regulated from the
   year 2004 by Law 19.974. Also, it is intended to make explicit some
   deficiencies in the intelligence model, in general, and in military

Title = {Irrationalizing the rational choice model of voting: The moderating
   effects of partisanship on turnout decisions in Western and
   postcommunist democracies},
Journal = {ELECTORAL STUDIES},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {50},
Pages = {26-38},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The rational choice model of voting has been criticized for the fact
   that citizens expecting greater costs than the benefits associated with
   voting still turn out. This article focuses on the function of
   partisanship by which the effect of the rational calculation on voting
   is moderated. Previous studies have only tested the effect of
   partisanship on turnout additively failing to explore its interactions
   with the costs and benefits of voting. My multilevel analyses using the
   CSES data show that partisanship significantly moderates the effects of
   the information costs and intrinsic benefits of voting on turnout. These
   results, however, are not found in the postcommunist new democracies
   with unstable party systems hindering partisanship from serving as a
   political cue and from providing an expressive satisfaction of voting.

Abstract = {In 2016, the government of Myanmar began the implementation of the
   National Social Protection Strategy Plan (NSPSP). This is a significant
   step since it addresses social assistance for the majority of the
   population outside the formal sector for the first time in a systematic
   manner, moving beyond the few fragmented social transfers in place
   earlier. The adoption of the strategic plan was propelled by a
   combination of political factors. Technically, it builds on the life
   cycle approach of the International Labour Organization's (ILO) Social
   Protection Floor Initiative (SPFI). It follows a universal, basic income
   security approach. This article offers cost calculations based on three
   different social protection transfer options: a social pension, an
   education grant and a combined mother and child benefit. The
   calculations conclude that such transfers can easily be covered from the
   government's fiscal budget, and the fiscal and gross domestic product
   (GDP) shares would actually decrease over time, given population growth
   dynamics. This reinforces the political and social case for universal
   social protection in Myanmar.},

Abstract = {Popular accounts of populist movements often point to negative emotions
   as a key motivating factor underlying their support. However, little
   systematic research has been devoted to examining differences in how
   distinct negative emotions affect levels of populism among voters. This
   paper attempts to fill this gap by focusing on the influence of the two
   emotions most frequently connected to populism in political commentary:
   fear and anger. Informed by appraisal theories of emotions, we
   hypothesize that populist attitudes are driven by feelings of anger,
   rather than fear. Using a three-wave online panel survey of Spanish
   citizens between 2014 and 2016, we find that anger expressed over the
   economic crisis is consistently associated with variations in support
   for populism both between individuals and over time, whereas no
   significant effects emerge for expressions of fear. We discuss the
   implications of these findings for understanding the nature of populist
   support.},

Abstract = {A prominent hypothesis to explain the durability of authoritarian
   regimes focuses on the official adoption of law and legal institutions.
   The present study offers a novel empirical approach to test the
   relationship between legal construction and regime legitimation, drawing
   on a quasi-experiment and original panel survey in rural China. Using
   difference-in-difference, subgroup, and two-stage least squares
   analyses, it finds that the Chinese state's project of legal
   construction powerfully shapes the legal consciousness of ordinary rural
   citizens and that state-constructed legal consciousness enhances regime
   legitimacy. The study also presents qualitative evidence to identify the
   causal mechanism linking state-constructed legal consciousness and
   regime legitimacy: the expansion of local institutions like state-run
   legal-aid centers in rural communities. The study contributes to the
   institutional focus in debates about authoritarian durability by
   providing evidence at the intersection of state and society.},

Abstract = {In today's world where the process of development and the industry is
   evolving more rapidly than expected, the legal notions are going forward
   on their compliance in line with these developments. The increasing
   development of intellectual property rights and their samples is an
   example of this change. One of the most important issues and instances
   of this tendency in legal rights is associated with fashion productions
   and creations. France, as one of the greatest leading country in fashion
   industry since long time ago, has legally protected the dress and
   beautiful creations in the intellectual property rules and in the
   different time periods, under the various titles, including the drawings
   and models rights, industrial property rights, literary and artistic
   property rights. French jurisprudence has broadly interpreted the
   concept of the fashion industry and consequently, the dress and beauty
   creations that have evolved not only the goods, but all parties involved
   in the production of the fashion industry. In Iranian law also, although
   there is no progress in this field compared to French law, with an
   optimistic interpretation of the rules of its intellectual property, it
   can be associated with Droit d'-auteur rules in addition to the
   industrial property rights under different titles such as design and
   drawings, Applied artwork, folklore etc.},

Title = {Hans Morgenthau, Realist Theory of International Leadership, and the
   Future of Global Order},
Journal = {CHINESE POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {2},
Number = {4, SI},
Pages = {512-530},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {This article argues that IR scholars can use Hans Morgenthau's work as a
   resource for developing a `classical realist theory of international
   leadership', helping them understand the nature and impact of
   international leadership, especially the future of world order in which
   the US is believed to be abandoning its global leadership under the
   Trump presidency. This article first introduces the political and
   intellectual context in which Morgenthau develops his realist thoughts
   on international leadership. Then, it elaborates Morgenthau's account of
   how international leadership is depended on the qualities of political
   leadership, namely, that international leadership requires political
   leaders to display intellectual, moral, and practical virtues. These
   include wisdom, foresight, judgment, prudence, willingness,
   determination, courage, restraint, skill, leadership, governance, and
   persuasion. Finally, it argues that the dean of classical realism
   provides a theoretical tool that enables a more `realistic' analysis of
   the future of world order, showing the deficiencies of the liberal
   vision that US withdrawal from the international arena under the Donald
   Trump presidency will necessarily create chaos and a leaderless world.
   This article concludes that the liberal bias against Trump has made it
   almost impossible to undertake a realistic assessment, and Morgenthau's
   writing can provide considerable insight into the problem of
   international leadership.},

Abstract = {The link between turnout and election outcome remains somewhat of a
   mystery as many scholars try to estimate whether and what kind of effect
   different levels of turnout have on election results. Numerous studies,
   showing that participation is in decline, fostered the debate around
   this link. Researchers are trying to measure whether the ever-growing
   number of non-voters would, if they decided to vote, produce some
   changes or whether voters politically well represent the whole
   population. We would expect turnout to matter to election results when
   the party of non-voters is homogenous. This is why we are looking again
   at this question in the Montenegrin context, where one party, nowadays
   often perceived as pro-Montenegrin, has dominated the country's politics
   and been the incumbent party since the introduction of pluralism. Voters
   of the opposition parties, from the main social cleavage in the country,
   are rather homogenous. But even though they are voting for the
   opposition, they lack the belief that change might happen in elections.
   Using the first post-electoral study and the first exit poll survey in
   Montenegro, we run a series of logistic regressions, testing the most
   prominent theories about voting abstention. Afterwards, we create a
   simulation for election results under universal turnout. We find
   evidence that Serbians have a lower probability of turning out than
   Montenegrins. The effect is not strong enough to produce a different
   outcome in the case of 100\% turnout.},

Abstract = {In this article, we analyse the mechanisms of agenda setting by focusing
   on the determinants of individual attitudes towards crime and
   investigating the role played by the media. After a brief literature
   review supporting the relevance of the selected topic of inquiry and the
   presentation of our analytical framework, we study the persuasion
   effects of mass media. More specifically, we investigate how TV exposure
   can shape individual perceptions of specific issues such as crime, and
   then focus on the effects of exposure to crime news on voting decisions.
   Using the Italian 2001 general election as an important case study of TV
   power concentration, we provide evidence that media-induced agenda
   setting enhanced the salience of the crime issue in voters' minds during
   the 2001 Italian general election and contributed to the victory of the
   coalition led by Silvio Berlusconi. Interestingly, our results are
   partially driven by the switch of previous left-wing voters to voting
   for the centre right because of exposure to crime news.},

Abstract = {It has become a commonplace in neo-republican thinking to claim that if
   the notion of rights can be allowed a place in republican political
   theory, it can never achieve the prominence that liberalism allegedly
   grants it. Philip Pettit's book, Republicanism, provides several
   arguments to buttress this thesis. This article aims at examining these
   arguments in order to show that once properly stated, they must on the
   contrary be considered as powerful arguments to the effect that
   republicans take rights very seriously.},

Abstract = {In 2012 Graeme Dey, MSP for Angus South, told the Scottish Parliament: `
   The signing of the Declaration of Arbroath at the {[}Arbroath] Abbey and
   the American Declaration of Independence might be separated by more than
   450 years, but the connection between those documents and therefore our
   two nations is beyond challenge.' In order to promote American tourism
   in Scotland, Dey was calling to emphasise a popular notion that the idea
   of the sovereignty of the people, enshrined in the Declaration of
   Arbroath, heavily influenced the writing of the American Declaration of
   Independence. There is a significant amount of scholarship denying any
   link between these documents, yet this association is constantly
   referenced on both sides of the Atlantic. This article is not concerned
   with once again proving this association incorrect, but rather
   considering where it may have come from and why it continues to be
   propagated despite being categorically untrue. By examining the naming
   practices of the Declaration of Arbroath in the nineteenth and twentieth
   centuries, this article will show that the connection between the
   documents likely stems from an issue of terminology.},

Abstract = {This article starts with the Hegelian consideration of common sense. It
   shows the ``commonplace{''} of many interpreters of Hegel concerning the
   articulation of necessity and contingency in the system. It begins with
   the logical consideration of contingency in The Science of Logic,
   continues with the contingent course of consciousness and the ex-post
   necessity in the Phenomenology of the Spirit, and culminates with the
   analysis of contingency in the market society. This article sustains
   that the Hegelian readings of contingency in his fundamental writings
   offer a closer hermeneutics to the thought of the present time.},

Abstract = {How do voters attribute responsibility for government outcomes when they
   are the result of a collective decision taken by multiple parties within
   a coalition government? In this article we test the argument that in a
   multiparty coalition system, responsibility attribution should vary
   according to the quantity and quality of portfolios that the coalition
   partner controls. The article uses data from the Italian National
   Election Study in Italy, a country usually characterized by governments
   formed by more than two parties. We find no consistent empirical
   evidence that coalition parties collectively suffer from perceived
   negative performance. While the prime minister party is held responsible
   on average more than the other coalition partners, responsibility
   attribution decreases by party size in the parliament rather than by the
   quantity of ministerial portfolios the incumbent party controls. Issue
   saliency, however, plays an important role in the retrospective voting
   mechanism. These results have important implications for our
   understanding of electoral behaviour and democratic accountability.},

Abstract = {Following a tumultuous period in the Australia-India bilateral
   relationship, the Australian Government undertook the largest cultural
   diplomacy initiative ever staged in India. Bold and ambitious, Oz Fest
   aimed to introduce contemporary Australia to contemporary India. Key to
   its success was the focus on contemporary culture and careful program
   curation that presented highest quality work with an eye to Indian
   tastes. Rather than rely on more traditional government-to-government
   partnerships, Oz Fest sought dynamic nongovernment players in the
   creative industry landscape to build partnerships that spoke directly to
   the target audience. Relationship building and artistic collaboration
   was prioritized to ensure the cultural conversation continued long after
   the big event was over. Then there was Australia?s public diplomacy
   secret weaponMasterchef Australia. By sharing reflections from the
   perspective of the arts practitioner engaged to co-curate and produce Oz
   Fest, this practitioner essay offers insights into creating effective
   cultural diplomacy for the twenty-first century.},

Abstract = {Which parties benefit from open-list (as opposed to closed-list)
   proportional representation elections? This article shows that a move
   from closed-list to open-list competition is likely to be more favorable
   to parties with more internal disagreement on salient issues; this is
   because voters who might have voted for a unified party under closed
   lists may be drawn to specific candidates within internally divided
   parties under open lists. The study provides experimental evidence of
   this phenomenon in a hypothetical European Parliament election in the
   UK, in which using an open-list ballot would shift support from UKIP
   (the Eurosceptic party) to Eurosceptic candidates of the Conservative
   Party. The findings suggest that open-list ballots could restrict
   support for parties that primarily mobilize on a single issue.},

Abstract = {This essay explores the relationship of local governments to their state
   and considers the design of local government systems in metropolitan
   areas. The nature of the state-local government relationship varies from
   one state to another, but even so, the general trend is toward increased
   centralization of power and authority at the state level. Across
   metropolitan areas, which tend to be highly fragmented into numerous,
   sometimes layered local jurisdictions, one persistent concern involves
   the functionality of these governments. Both topics are ripe for
   research by political scientists.},

Abstract = {Recent studies indicate that youth's increased exposure to political
   content on social media platforms does not correlate positively with an
   increased interest in politics. This seemingly contradictory high
   exposure versus low interest indicates a certain level of apathy towards
   political participation. This article proposes that in order for youth
   to experience a stronger engagement in participatory politics, they need
   to feel challenged and skilled enough to be able to make an impact. This
   article draws on Csikszentmihalyi's flow theory premise that a state of
   total absorption, or ``flow,{''} can be attained in a game-like
   environment in which the actors are highly skilled and the challenges
   match their skills. The author proposes a framework that relies on
   combining memes' viral properties-their ability to transmit political
   content-and the strength of engagement in a game-like environment to
   create politically provocative memes able to improve youth participation
   in politics.},

Abstract = {Donald Trump entered office with aspirations for transformational policy
   change, much of which would have to be approved by Congress. So far, he
   and his supporters have been disappointed. Despite the president's many
   unique characteristics, we can employ the framework of the president's
   strategic position to explain the president's lack of success. The
   president's opportunity structure was mixed. Lacking a mandate but
   fortunate to serve in a unified government, Trump overestimated his
   public support, which was low, and Republican cohesion, which was
   imperfect. He also underestimated the impact of partisan polarization
   and Democratic opposition, which was strong. Moreover, the president
   lacked a strategic plan of his own, had few substantive proposals, and
   demonstrated little skill in garnering support.},

Abstract = {My article offers a sustained critique of the idea of critical social
   theory presented by Axel Honneth in Freedom's Right: The Social
   Foundations of Democratic Life. My article articulates three specific
   criticisms: (1) the focus on normative relations of recognition obscures
   the class-based forms of power that pervade contemporary advanced
   democracies, (2) the method of normative reconstruction cannot make
   sense of the open-ended nature of class struggle that drives social
   change in capitalist societies, and (3) Honneth's political and social
   prescriptions ignore the consequences of the failure of traditional
   progressive politics. My article makes an important and original
   contribution to the literature on Honneth's recent work in two major
   respects. First, I argue that Honneth's descriptions of the fate of the
   family and the market today betray a failure to understand the
   configuration of class power in contemporary neoliberal societies.
   Second, I make the case that the basis for a more successful theory of
   class power, identity formation, and social change can be found in the
   `first-generation' critical social theory of Erich Fromm.},

Abstract = {The triangular relations among three states-the Philippines, the United
   States, and the People's Republic of China-are governed by structural
   balance of power factors, pragmatic opportunism on the part of the
   superpowers, and the threat and opportunity perceptions of individual
   Philippine administrations. Recent years have seen Manila dramatically
   oscillating between the extremes of engagement and deterrence toward
   China, and dependence on, and independence from, the United States. In
   particular, while the Benigno Aquino III administration (2010-2016)
   adopted soft counterbalancing against China and heavily relied on
   American military support, the succeeding Rodrigo Duterte
   administration, in contrast, distanced itself from America in favor of
   deeper engagement with China. The seemingly erratic swings in the
   pendulum of Manila's foreign policy is a telltale sign of the dilemma of
   small power politics as well as the tempestuous nature of Philippine
   domestic politics.},

Abstract = {This article investigates the role of `anarchy' in state securitisation.
   First, we discuss state hierarchies' struggle with active and reactive
   anarchic networks, theorising a state in existential crisis, which
   exploits anti-anarchist discourses to respond to network threats. In the
   second part, we illustrate with examples the use of fear of anarchy in
   hierarchical productive structures of securitisation. As an
   `antiproduction assemblage', the state treats logics stemming from the
   `social principle' as a repressed Real, the exclusion of which underpins
   its own functioning. The scarcity and fear resulting from state terror
   ensure responses to this structural violence by reactive networks, while
   paradoxically also exacerbating reactive tendencies within social
   movements. In the concluding part, we discuss visions of desecuritising
   society, breaking away from majoritarian logics of control and the
   coming of other worlds counterposed to the hierarchies producing and
   reproducing an eternal loop of state and network terror.},

Volume = {49},

Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {We offer a theory of strategic party disloyalty to explain roll call
   voting in the US House. Our theory suggests that ideologically extreme
   legislators become markedly less loyal to their party when it controls
   the majority. They stake out positions that align with the views of
   their extreme constituents when policy is likely to move in their
   direction. In contrast, ideological moderates become noticeably more
   loyal when they transition to the majority. Examining 35 years of ideal
   point estimates and measures of party unity on roll calls, we find clear
   evidence that member strategy, ideology, and legislative agenda setting
   interact to structure the frequency of defections. Further, we find
   evidence that defection and ideology interact to influence subsequent
   electoral outcomes. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Measuring Emotional Response: Comparing Alternative Approaches to
   Measurement},
Journal = {POLITICAL SCIENCE RESEARCH AND METHODS},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {5},
Number = {4},
Pages = {733-754},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Scholarly interest in the role of emotion in accounting for how people
   react to political figures, events, and messages has escalated over the
   past two plus decades in political science and psychology. However,
   research on the validity of the measurement of subjective self-report of
   emotional responses is rather limited. We introduce here a new
   measurement approach, a ``slider{''} format and compare it with the long
   used ``radio button{''} item format. We assess the reliability and
   validity of these two approaches to the measurement of affect. The study
   examines self-report measures of emotion to three generated news stories
   about terrorist threats. We report that both measurement formats are
   able to extract the expected threefold affect structure from a ten
   affect word battery. The slider format is, however, modestly more
   reliable, and more efficient in time to complete, has the ability to
   limit missing data, and generates continuous data that is less truncated
   than data derived from the radio button format. Finally, we report on
   three tests of construct validity. Both approaches exhibit equivalent
   results on two of those tests. However, the radio button format does
   poorly on one test of construct validity, that on the anticipated
   relationship between anxiety and interest in novel information. We
   present an assessment of two methods for measuring emotional reactions
   to stimuli such as political issues, political figures, or events. Both
   methods are suitable for use in online surveys or computer-driven
   experiments. The traditional method utilizes labeled ``radio buttons{''}
   that enable a participant in a study to select by clicking on one of an
   array of typically five response options, ranging from lower to higher
   of some identified affect term (e.g., how angry one might feel). Second,
   the slider method offers a participant the ability to move an
   ``arrow{''} up or down to indicate how much (up) or little (down) they
   feel. The goal of both measures is to ascertain the level of a targeted
   emotion, i.e., how little or how much, say anger. The slider method has
   been specifically developed to be used with participants using a
   computer. The slider approach falls within the category of visual analog
   scales. This method for measuring affective responses to stimuli of
   whatever sort has not hitherto been examined to determine its
   reliability and validity. The literature on the reliability and validity
   of these measurement strategies is thin and we found no studies
   including an explicit comparison.},

Abstract = {This article extends the empirical evidence for the use of e-newsletters
   in parliamentary communication in between elections. It assesses the
   effect of electoral incentives and parliamentary institutions on members
   (MPs(1)) from all four legislatures in the UK. I find that electoral
   incentives to cultivate a personal vote increase the e-newsletter usage
   by MPs. However, being an MP in subnational parliaments or smaller
   parties decreases it. These findings throw a fresh light on why only
   some parliamentarians are happy to adopt new and seemingly
   resource-efficient ways to reach out to voters.},

Abstract = {Presidency scholars, like political scientists in general, have
   increasingly used experiments in their research. This article argues
   that, to differentiate itself from other experimental political science,
   presidency scholars should bring to bear their knowledge of the
   institution when using experiments and focus on issues of governance.
   Doing so, however, raises a host of issues and complications in
   designing experiments to study presidential governance. This article
   discusses some of these concerns and offers suggestions to improve and
   stimulate experimental research on the presidency.},

Abstract = {While scholars of African American political thought have done a
   remarkable job centering focus on black thinkers, they still largely
   frame their endeavor in reference to the geo-political boundaries of the
   U.S. nation-state, thereby ignoring the transnational and diasporic
   dynamics of black politics. The consequence is that alternative
   traditions of thought in the Americas-e.g., Caribbean traditions-are
   cast as irrelevant to questions of racial exclusion in U.S. political
   thinking. I seek to correct nation-centric perspectives on U.S.
   political thought and development by demonstrating the utility of the
   transnational turn. Drawing on the framework developed in C.L.R. James's
   The Black Jacobins, I trace how an influential cohort of abolitionists
   in the antebellum United States looked to the Haitian Revolution as a
   model for the overthrow of slavery. Engaging the writings and speeches
   of David Walker, James Theodore Holly, and Frederick Douglass, I then
   argue that radical abolitionists operated in the same ideological
   problem-space as Haitian revolutionaries and adopted a specific model of
   revolution as much indebted to Haitian political thought as
   Anglo-American models of anti-colonial revolt. By implication, racially
   egalitarian movements and moments in U.S. political development cannot
   be adequately understood with exclusive reference to national traditions
   of thought.},

   professionalism of the judge and the evidences, received in the process
   of investigation, put in jeopardy the fairness and objectivity of the
   court's decision. As a result, the court, based on the avesty of

Abstract = {The literature on male imprisonment consistently reveals a particular
   form of hegemonic masculinity based on competition, dominance and
   violence, actual or threatened. This article seeks to examine this
   standard view via the experience of republican politically motivated
   prisoners in Northern Ireland. It finds evidence of elements of
   hegemonic masculinity as in other prisons, but alongside this there was
   an alternative form of hegemonic masculinity, one based on the ability
   to endure rather than inflict violence. The article also examines the
   way in which homosociality - male fraternity without homosexual desire -
   was an integral part of the prison experience and was enhanced by the
   solidarity among the prisoners; this solidarity was based on both
   initial political ideology and the collective resistance against the
   prison system's attempts to break their solidarity. Finally, it also
   examines the space for emotions and emotional support in the difficult
   circumstances of violence inflicted by prison officers, an extended
   ``blanket protest{''} and a harrowing hunger strike.},

Abstract = {Political interest is one of the strongest predictors of individual
   political engagement, but little is known about the origins of this
   political orientation. The goal of this paper is to clarify the role
   that biological and psychological factors play in the formation of
   political interest. A series of recent studies in genetics have
   illustrated that political interest is heritable, and a series of recent
   studies in political science and psychology have demonstrated that
   personality traits, many of which are heritable, are related to
   political interest. In this paper, we make a number of contributions to
   the literature: (1) we replicate previous analyses showing that
   political interest and personality traits are heritable, (2) we
   demonstrate that personality traits are related to interest, and (3) we
   estimate the extent to which genetic factors account for the correlation
   between personality traits and political interest. Using two datasets on
   twins, we find evidence that genetic factors account for a large amount
   of the correlation between political interest and personality traits.
   This study provides a more nuanced picture of the biological and
   psychological bases of political orientations.},

Volume = {56},

Abstract = {This article addresses an issue previously neglected in the research on
   support for populist parties: How do perceptions of the local quality of
   government (QoG) and local service delivery affect voters' propensity to
   vote for a populist party? It argues that personal experience with poor
   QoG makes voters more likely to support populist parties. The argument
   highlights the interplay between supply and demand factors in explaining
   populist support and discusses why populist parties have been
   particularly successful in certain regions in Europe. A unique dataset
   from the Quality of Government Institute that surveys citizens'
   perception of QoG in their area is used to estimate both individual- and
   regional-level models of the link between perceived local QoG and
   populist support in Europe. The empirical results show a strong and
   robust association between within-country variation in QoG and support
   for populist parties.},

Abstract = {The intensifying speed-up of contemporary economic, social and political
   life troubles democratic theorists because they assume that democracy
   depends on patience. This article turns to Martin Luther King, Jr. to
   challenge democratic theory's temporal bias. I argue that King
   demonstrates that impatience, too, is a democratic virtue. Building on
   impatient knowledge, democratic impatience aides in overcoming
   undemocratic legacies, fosters democratic subjectivity and agency,
   ensures political accountability, and creates a more inclusive practice
   of democratic belonging. I furthermore show that King reveals the
   temporal sophistication of democratic impatience, thereby contradicting
   the prevailing interpretation of self-defeating instantaneousness. In
   particular, democratic impatience's temporal origins of centuries of
   injustice, human mortality, and the context of social acceleration
   provide a mature impetus for democratic action. Moreover, democratic
   impatience persists over time. On the one hand, it does so because
   injustice persists. On the other hand, democratic impatience contains
   within itself a subordinate operational patience. In other words,
   democratic impatience is always already somewhat `patient.' King's
   democratic impatience therefore not only redresses democratic theory's
   shortcomings, but it also generates a renewed sense of democratic
   possibility in our age, as democratic impatience is well suited to help
   us in redressing the crises and injustices deepened or generated by
   social acceleration.},

Abstract = {The article examines the approaches to poverty of the UN development
   decades, with a focus on the current 2030 Agenda for Sustainable
   Development. Using the ``5 R{''} criteria of global social policy
   discourse, the article's main point is that a coherent analysis of
   poverty is absent from the agenda. While the agenda does address
   redistribution, social rights, and resource consciousness, and makes
   important contributions to social protection and care policy, it makes
   only superficial reference to the need for regulating of the economy.
   The main lacuna of the agenda, however, is that it does not address the
   issue of relationality - the systemic asymmetries in economic, social
   and political power. As a result, it is weak on policy, and there is the
   risk that poverty eradication will remain an elusive goal, even beyond
   2030, despite the agenda's transformative remit.},

Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) represent global policy goals in
   contrast to Millenium Development Goals (MDGs), which had developmental
   focus. This is the global potential of SDGs for global health policy.
   However, the large number of goals bear the risk of prioritisation
   between different goals and broad global frameworks and specific targets
   may not be useful in shaping policy guidance and global approaches in
   policy areas, where we already have a global institutional and normative
   presence. In contrast to some other global social policy areas, global
   health policy has also something to lose. SDGs are thus likely to be
   better for global health in other policies, than for global health
   policy priorities, institutions and practice. This is a particular
   concern for the global health policy role of the World Health
   Organisation, global health policies seeking normative action as well as
   for such health policy priorities, which contrast or conflict with other
   policy areas or strong corporate interests. This has particular
   relevance to multistakeholder partnerships and the role of private
   sector in implementation of SDGs.},

   unfolding and stalemate of an incipient diaspora engagement policy to
   explain the limits to effective political inclusion of Argentine
   citizens living abroad today. Thus, it contributes to our understanding
   of the politics and institutional dynamics of the process of reforming
   the franchise and citizenship in one of the least explored examples

Year = {2017},
Volume = {15},
Number = {5, SI},
Pages = {729-750},

Abstract = {Cost-benefit analysis (CBA) has become a quintessential tool in
   administrative law informing a variety of modes of regulatory
   governance. It provides a justification for the regulation of markets
   based on a quasi-scientific and seemly neutral logic to assess the
   impact of secondary legislation by government agencies. A new frontier
   for CBA is the promotion of trade liberalization. It features
   prominently in the regulatory chapter of the Transatlantic Trade and
   Investment Partnership (TTIP). During the TTIP negotiations, scholars
   deployed CBA as a ``neutral'' tool to achieve greater convergence or
   reassert divergence and experimentalism in regulatory governance across
   the Atlantic. A genealogical examination reveals the existence of at
   least two strains of cost-benefit analyses in Western legal thought. The
   first one goes back to social orientations in private law translating
   into social-scientific expertise for regulators and proportionality for
   judges. The second one goes back to neoclassical economics in private
   law translating into economic-scientific expertise for regulators and
   balancing for judges. Today, scholars in their convergentist,
   divergentist, or experimentalist approaches to governance deploy CBA and
   regulatory science as a neutral and quasi-scientific method to
   legitimize the subjection of national regulation to more demanding
   standards. Instead, the genealogical approach reveals that CBA is a
   contingent and open-ended regulatory tool that justifies Contentious
   political decisions about regulatory strategies while allowing lawyers
   who apply CBA to remain agnostic on its distributive impact.},

Title = {Ballot design and invalid votes: Evidence from Colombia},
Journal = {ELECTORAL STUDIES},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {48},
Pages = {98-110},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {We examine the tendency for complex ballots to undermine the ability of
   voters to cast valid votes. Specifically, we investigate the role of
   ballot design in explaining the high rate of invalid votes in Colombia
   observed in 2007. We address this question first by looking at data from
   a study observing the use of alternate ballot designs in a controlled
   environment, varying the information voters have when attempting to cast
   the ballot. Our results show that there is an effect of the ballot
   design on the amount of invalid votes and that this effect varies with
   education level. We then examine the observed pattern of invalid votes
   in Colombia before and after the implementation of the ballot redesign.
   Our results suggest that the introduction of a ballot with improved
   usability was associated with a significant decline in the number of
   invalid votes and that a rural-urban difference observed before the new
   ballot was no longer present. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {The general objective consists to establish and examine meanings of the
   concept of collective intellectual property of indigenous peoples and
   communities, with the help of national and international legislation and
   doctrine. The used methodology is descriptive and documental
   investigation, sustained in analytic method and the technique of the
   content analysis. The sources for the gathering of information assist to
   two areas, that is: normative area, based on Declaration of the United
   Nations on the Rights of the Indigenous Towns of 2007, Agreement 169 of
   the International Organization of the Work has more than enough
   Indigenous and Tribal Towns in Independent Countries of 1991, Agreement
   about the Biological Diversity of 1992, Constitution of the Republic
   Bolivariana of Venezuela 1999, Organic Law of Towns and Indigenous
   Communities of 2005, Law of Cultural Patrimony of the Towns and
   Indigenous Communities of 2009 and Law of Biological Diversity of 2000;
   and, doctrinal area, based on concepts and principles of Constitutional
   Right and Right of the Indigenous Towns. It is concluded that the
   classification juridical Venezuelan establishes the protection of the
   right of collective intellectual property of the towns and indigenous
   communities in the constitutional, legal and international areas.},

Abstract = {In this article, I argue that the profound growth of the current
   social-economic inequalities must be faced by a reaffirmation and a
   recovery of a political praxis that confronts conservative systemic
   comprehension of social evolution and institutional structuration, which
   leads to strong institutionalism, that is, to the centralization and
   monopolization of both social evolution and institutional dynamics
   within the social systems or institutions themselves and from a
   self-referential, self-subsisting and autonomous logic of functioning
   which is absolutely internal, technical, non-political and
   non-normative. This is the basic conservative argument, which
   depoliticizes the social-economic evolution and the projects of
   development, removing an inclusive democratic social participation of
   the economy and the political institutions. The central argument is that
   the politicization of institutional systemic logic leads to an inclusive
   political praxis which embraces all social systems and their
   constitution from a direct refusal of the laissez-faire, of minimal
   politics and of the technocracy concerning institutional dynamics.},

Abstract = {Political scientists frequently use qualitative evidence to support or
   evaluate the empirical applicability of formal models. Despite this
   widespread practice, neither the qualitative methods literature nor
   research on empirically evaluating formal models systematically address
   the topic. This article makes three contributions to bridge this gap.
   First, it demonstrates that formal models and qualitative evidence are
   indeed frequently combined in current research. Second, it shows how
   process tracing can be as important a tool for empirically assessing
   models as statistical testing, because models and process tracing share
   a common focus on understanding causal mechanisms. Last, it provides new
   guidelines for using process tracing that focus on issues specific to
   the modeling enterprise, illustrated with examples from recent research.},

Abstract = {We analyze the great conflict that splits current societies between the
   ``victors{''} and the ``victims{''} of globalization and the many
   phenomena of economic, political, cultural integration, etc. Certainly,
   the ``beneficiaries{''} are attracted by recent radical changes and are
   optimistically in favor of deepening them. On the other hand, the
   ``victims{''} suffer constant creative destruction as a dispossession
   and, therefore, show their repulsion, which is key to understanding many
   current debates. We will synthesize that conflict from the metaphorical
   dilemma between riding the ``enraged tiger{''} of the turboglobalization
   without knowing exactly where it takes us, or dismounting it at full
   speed with serious danger of accident or delay with respect to competing
   countries. We will treat as concrete examples the Jiyadism in Europe
   that -not so paradoxically- is usually carried out by European citizens
   of third generation. We will also explain the surprising results of the
   referendums in Scotland and the Brexit ... , as well as the complex
   Eurosceptic evolution in many EU countries. In the same vein, we will
   argue that those affected groups have been key to the presidential
   election of Donald Trump, who significantly shared many supporters and
   voters with Bernie Sanders. We will even point out the relevance of this
   distinction in the Brazilian demonstrations of 2013 and the impeachment
   of the already ex-president Russeff, and the evolution of the most
   recent trade treaties (TTIP and TPP) and the main inter-constitutional
   processes.},

Abstract = {Much has been written about the function of narrative in virtual reality
   (VR) productions (Aylett \& Louchart, 2003; Aylett et al, 2005; Ryan,
   2001; 2005; 2008; 2009), but the role of the audience, and the relative
   degree of control that they have over the content, has led some scholars
   to believe that there is an ontological problem with describing VR in
   narrative terms. This article investigates some of these assumptions,
   via an analysis of an undertheorised aspect of VR that has emerged in
   recent years - the 360 degrees film. It argues that 360 degrees film
   represents a much more important aspect of VR than has been previously
   recognised. In so doing, the article establishes this medium as an
   important field of study, and argues that ultimately, it will be the
   commercial infrastructure for this content which will define the
   parameters of immersive storytelling.},

Title = {Congressional lettermarks, ideology, and member receipt of stimulus
   awards from the US Department of Labor},
Journal = {RESEARCH \& POLITICS},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {4},
Number = {3},
Month = {JUL-SEP},
Abstract = {Recent years have witnessed an increase in members' use of
   lettermarks-letters written to the bureaucracy in an effort to secure
   federal funding for their districts. In spite of the vitriol that has
   been directed toward the practice, it is unclear whether lettermarks are
   even effective in aiding legislators' attempts at funneling dollars
   toward their districts. In an effort to determine whether lettermarks
   ``work,{''} we combined content analysis of letters sent by members to
   the Department of Labor with data on monies awarded to particular
   districts through the Department of Labor from the stimulus to
   investigate the relationship between letter writing and awards to
   members' districts. We find that, conditional on ideology, lettermarking
   can have an effect on the likelihood that a district received stimulus
   money through the Department of Labor. For most legislators, though,
   lettermarking does not appear to be an effective device for securing
   federal dollars for their districts. This nuanced set of findings
   suggests that the bureaucracy may be sensitive to member ideology when
   deciding whether to fund certain projects. Given the limited time frame
   and scope of our data, though, we urge researchers to continue to pursue
   this important line of inquiry.},

Abstract = {The widespread availability of voter files has improved the study of
   participation in American politics, but the lack of comprehensive data
   on nonregistrants creates difficult inferential issues. Most notably,
   observational studies that examine turnout rates among registrants often
   implicitly condition on registration, a posttreatment variable that can
   induce bias if the treatment of interest also affects the likelihood of
   registration. We introduce a sensitivity analysis to assess the
   potential bias induced by this problem, which we call differential
   registration bias. Our approach is most helpful for studies that
   estimate turnout among registrants using posttreatment registration
   data, but it is also valuable for studies that estimate turnout among
   the voting-eligible population using secondary sources. We illustrate
   our approach with two studies of voting eligibility effects on
   subsequent turnout among young voters. In both cases, eligibility
   appears to decrease turnout, but these effects are found to be highly
   sensitive to differential registration bias.},

Abstract = {Politicians in many countries campaign among citizens residing abroad,
   even though migrants have extremely low rates of participation or, in
   some cases, no right to vote at all. What benefit, then, does a
   foreign-residing, non-voting electorate provide parties? Politicians
   interviewed in Mexico, El Salvador, and the Dominican Republic express
   belief that migrants influence the votes of relatives in their home
   countries by sending remittances. Using a series of hierarchical models,
   I test whether this is true, by estimating the effect of having
   U.S.-residing relatives on a set of seven political activities of Latin
   American voters. I find migrants do influence their relatives; however,
   this influence does not affect basic level voter participation, but
   rather reinforces existing partisan sympathies and motivates activities
   typical of party militants.},

   communicative net between these theories policentrically. The method
   used to talk about the subject will be the autopoietic systems theory
   brought to the world by Niklas Luhmann, because it allows observing the
   phenomena of complex constitutionalism in post-modernity, what
   constitutes the essence of the constitutional thought, provoking an
   interpretation around the possibility of answering the classical
   theories about the complexity of nowadays societies, aiming through the
   constitutional theory of interconstitutionality, to get new proposes up

Abstract = {In the present era, providing human rights represents the governance
   quality of a government and human rights treaties are criteria for its
   assessment. Also the UN human rights conventions, because of their
   international nature in the past seven decades, have been the main
   representative to reflect man's fundamental demands. Now the main
   question is that to what extent these conventions are remarkable and
   effective in order to explain and guarantee human rights in the
   international arena? The author believes that the conventions are the
   most important international mechanisms to identify human rights which
   compared to the past history of mankind have offered the most
   comprehensive international regulations in order to reflect the
   fundamental human rights. But then, two main factors undermined the
   effectiveness of the conventions. The first factor is intratextual
   drawbacks of the conventions which are divided into three drawbacks:
   reservation, withdrawal and arbitrary essence of accepting the
   committees' competence. The second and more important factor is the
   reasons out of the conventions which are divided into two categories:
   the doctrine of privity of contract and disobedience by some governments
   under the ideological or moral reasons. The first factor can be
   addressed by the secondary amendments. However, the big challenge is the
   second factor which mechanism to settle it are to inform the
   international community about the importance of the UN human rights
   conventions, creating intersubjective understanding and eventually
   accepting the supremacy of international human rights over internal law.},

Abstract = {No established liberal democracy has achieved sex balance in its
   national legislature. Scholars agree skewed candidate pools put forward
   by parties during elections cause sex-disproportionate seat
   distribution, but disagree as to whether disproportionality is caused by
   too few women aspirant candidates coming forward (supply) or party
   selectors preferring men (demand). This paper uses a multistage method
   to explore supply and demand during the British Labour party's candidate
   selection process. Rare data from three elections and 4622 aspirants
   allow for an unobstructed look inside the secret garden of politics and
   reveal the party is not fully feminized insofar that women aspirants are
   disproportionally filtered out of its selection process and are
   disproportionally underrepresented in its candidate pool. Testing
   reveals a lack of selector demand for women aspirants has a greater
   impact on women's underrepresentation than an undersupply of women
   aspirants, a finding which supports using sex quotas to level imbalanced
   candidate slates. ResumeAucune democratie liberale etablie n'a acheve
   une representation egale des hommes et des femmes au sein de son
   assemblee legislative nationale. Les chercheurs conviennent que les
   bassins de candidats inegalitaires presentes par les partis politiques
   lors des elections entrainent une repartition disproportionnee des
   sieges, mais sont en desaccord quant a savoir si la disproportion est
   due au nombre trop faible de candidates qui aspirent a se presenter
   (offre) ou bien aux selectionneurs des partis qui donnent une preference
   aux candidatures masculines (demande). Cet article utilise une methode a
   degres multiples pour examiner l'offre et la demande durant le processus
   de selection des candidatures du Parti travailliste britannique. Les
   rares donnees disponibles dans le contexte de trois elections et 4622
   candidats offrent une vue penetrante dans le jardin secret de la
   politique et revelent que le parti n'est pas vraiment feminise tant que
   les candidatures feminines sont filtrees de facon disproportionnee a
   l'issue du processus de selection et sont sous-representees en
   consequence dans son bassin de candidats. Les tests revelent qu'une
   demande insuffisante des candidates feminines de la part des
   selectionneurs a un impact plus significatif sur la sous-representation
   des femmes qu'une offre trop faible de femmes qui se portent candidates
   : une constatation a l'appui de l'introduction de quotas visant a
   retablir l'equilibre sur les listes electorales.},

Abstract = {With the normative demand to attend to social difference and an absence
   of universal evaluative terms with which to do so, recent theory has
   increasingly turned to the study of the affective rather than
   epistemological conditions of ethical encounter. This I call a
   dispositional ethics that construes responsibility as responsiveness.
   Recent articulations of such an ethics, notably in the most current work
   of Judith Butler, James Tully, Jade Larissa Schiff, and Ella Myers,
   highlight its connection to situated practices of concrete
   bodies-in-relation, but often stop short of developing an account of
   what such embodied practices might be. Based on interviews with thirteen
   experts who take the body as their primary vocational and intellectual
   field and characterize their practice as an art of listening, I
   distinguish three dimensions of a dispositional ethics in practice and
   some of the specific strategies available to cultivate the conditions
   for responsiveness in political life.},

Abstract = {Utilizing Gramsci's conceptualization of hegemonic struggles through
   both coercive means of the state and also the production of consent in
   civil society, the article conducts a comparative textual analysis of
   the writings and speeches of Mustafa Kemal Ataturk and Fetullah Gulen.
   In so doing, the article focuses on four main themes: (1) sacralization
   of modern knowledge, science, and education; (2) militarism and
   centrism; (3) statism and corporatism; and, (4) ethnic nationalism and
   Turkism. It argues that the ideology of the Gulen's ``service
   movement{''} shares the principles of Kemalism in the above-mentioned
   domains, while couching them within a religious discursive framework.
   Since Gulenism uses Quranic terminology out of context and for secular
   ends, the term ``religionist{''} is used instead of ``religious{''} to
   describe this ideology.},

Abstract = {One of the biggest puzzles of China's reform era is how the government
   was able to implement a stunning enterprise restructuring program amid
   widespread worker protests. While most existing explanations focus on
   government repression, concessions, and other policies to reduce
   workers' incentives to protest, this article argues that the
   government's mastery in undermining the trust and solidarity among
   workers played an essential role in the success of the restructuring. In
   particular, the state helped to promote exclusionary power structures
   and elitist attitudes among workers. Consequently, labor protests during
   restructuring were typically insider-dominated, and rank-and-file
   workers were often believed to lack the capacity or qualities to play an
   important role in collective actions. Exclusionary elitism discouraged
   ordinary workers' participation and alienated protest activists from the
   communities. The article examines the conditions and mechanisms for
   exclusionary elitism to develop among state workers.},

Abstract = {Nowadays, cultural globalization is one of the most important aspects of
   expansion and deepening of capitalistic relations. This process exerts a
   great influence on all communities, especially non-Western societies, so
   that it has prompted them to adopt different approaches towards it.
   Thus, understanding the phenomenon of globalization for countries such
   as Iran that insists on their specificity (especially on their
   indigenous cultural values), to identify threats and crises which this
   phenomenon will be looking for them is of high importance. So, the main
   purpose of this research is to analyze how the seventh and the ninth
   governments of Islamic Republic of Iran dealt with the issue of
   globalization, particularly, its cultural aspect. Indeed, with
   realization of the differences between post-revolutionary Iranian state
   and most of existing ideologies in the world and also its geopolitics
   and strategic sensitive location in the region; all Iranian post-
   revolutionary governments adopted logical and rational policies in
   dealing with this worldwide wave. However, as regards the specific
   national, regional and international conditions, the seventh and the
   ninth governments were much more exposed to globalization and taking a
   clear stance. Research findings, according to the theory of `James N.
   Rosenau ``Fragmegration{''} show that the seventh government, based on
   adopting political culturalism, sought for interaction and `convergence'
   in the form of ``dialogue between civilizations{''} as well as pacifism
   in addition to criticizing world's dominant relations. Whereas, the
   ninth government adopting justice-oriented approach and political
   spirituality in the form of public participation and management in
   managing the world led to ``divergence{''} of the existing global order
   considering realistic and power-based relations of international order.},

Abstract = {In this paper we discuss cultural trauma with regard to the Hungarian
   Roma. While the concept of cultural trauma is typically understood as
   connected to a discrete event and achieves recognition as cultural
   trauma through a process of broader social recognition, we argue that in
   the case of the Roma, cultural trauma is characterized not by a
   particular event but rather by a long history of exclusion,
   marginalization and persecution. Secondly, the cultural and discursive
   framing of Roma citizenship as ``second-class{''} (and therefore as not
   ``truly{''} Hungarian) operates as: 1) a causal factor in the historical
   trauma of the Roma; 2) a constitutive part of the trauma itself (the
   trauma as being ``othered{''} while simultaneously having one's
   traumatic experience denied); and 3) a barrier to the broader
   recognition and acknowledgment of that traumatic history and experience.
   We discuss data from recent fieldwork with Romani self-government
   leaders to discuss how these phenomena manifest themselves as Romani
   leaders attempt to achieve political agency in the face of contemporary
   far-right political movements.},

Abstract = {RILE estimates based on party manifesto data suggest that political
   parties leapfrog on the left-right scale over time. This implausible
   finding has raised questions about the efficacy not only of RILE for
   estimating left-right positions but of coded party manifestos for
   political science research in general. The recently developed Manifesto
   Common Space Scores (MCSS), which reduce leapfrogging by accounting for
   the election-specific character of party manifestos, provide alternative
   estimates for parties left/right-positions, but little is known about
   their validity. This study shows that MCSS estimates exhibit greater
   convergent validity relative to RILE estimates when compared to other
   measures of parties left/right-positions. It also finds that MCSS has
   greater construct validity relative to RILE estimates in two prominent
   cases (Greece and Italy). Overall, the findings underscore the
   election-specific character of party manifestos and demonstrate that
   MCSS is a useful alternative measure of parties' left-right positions.

Abstract = {While much research focuses on the causes and consequences of direct
   democracy and regime legitimacy, little attention has been paid to the
   potential relationship between them. In an attempt to fill this void,
   this paper focuses on the legal provisions for direct democracy and its
   use. The key argument is that possibilities for the public's direct
   involvement reflect high importance given to citizens, openness of the
   regime towards different modes of decision-making, and ways to avoid
   unpopular institutions. Consequently, citizens are likely to accept and
   support the regime, improving or maintaining its legitimacy. The
   cross-national analysis includes 38 European countries ranging from
   transition countries to established democracies. It uses bivariate
   statistical analysis and country-level data collected from legislation,
   secondary sources, and aggregate surveys.},

Abstract = {In Iranian law, only entities that can be said is similar to physical
   subtraction, iddah entity after revocable divorce. During the iddah,
   couples living together have some obligations, but not forced to lay in
   between. And in another, though, for fear the loss of his wife, is
   allowed to subtract the location of the shared residence. It must be
   said that this system is rational and human relations based on the
   wisdom of civilization is permissible insofar as it does not conflict
   with Islamic law. If intellectuals of today's society conclude that
   stipulated in the divorce decree was not rational and not in the
   interest of society must predict good strategies to restore them to life
   and as far as possible be required. Basically, physical subtraction is
   expected to act before divorce to assess at this time to prevent the
   occurrence of problems after divorce and couples come to life with
   stability.},

Abstract = {Who controls the content of the majority opinion on the U.S. Supreme
   Court? Previous research offers conflicting views; however, these
   studies assume that a single justice exerts primary influence over the
   entire opinion. In contrast, we argue that different justices control
   holding (the legal determination that sets binding precedent) and dicta
   (unnecessary comments that lack precedential value). We argue that the
   bargaining process enables the median justice in the majority coalition
   to control holding, while the opinion author controls dicta. We test the
   empirical expectations of our theory on the concurrence behavior of
   Supreme Court justices: special concurrences reflect disagreement with
   holding, whereas general concurrences often reflect disagreement with
   dicta. The results support our theory that the bargaining process
   divides control over holding and dicta, which can produce ambiguity and
   confusion in the law.},

Abstract = {Party system nationalization is often viewed as critical to national
   unity, the production of public goods, and may have implications for
   democratic success. This paper assesses the impact of ethnic diversity
   and electoral rules in 74 economically developing democracies. Contrary
   to past studies, majoritarian electoral systems heighten the tendency of
   ethnic diversity to reduce nationalization while proportional
   representation greatly reduces its impact. Presidential systems produce
   higher levels of nationalization than parliamentary systems but the
   effect reverses as the number of presidential candidates increases.
   Though ethnic party bans may increase nationalization, ballot access
   requirements, the level of freedom, and relative prosperity have no
   effect (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Volume = {18},

Pages = {323-336},

Abstract = {Why do legislators choose to vote Abstain' instead of Yea' or Nay'? Is
   it because they shy away from taking sides when facing competing
   demands? We address this question by studying roll-call vote data on the
   sixth European Parliament. In line with our principal-agent approach, we
   find that Members of the European Parliament are prone to strategically
   abstain when torn between different positions of their national party,
   their transnational party group, and their country's minister.
   Abstentions are thus not random but strategic and ignoring them may bias
   the findings of legislative studies.},

Abstract = {Using frameworks for the analysis of policy devised by Colebatch and
   Bacchi, three accounts are developed of the emergence of an Australian
   government program for Indigenous employment and community participation
   in remote areas. Timeframes increase and types of actors change moving
   from an authoritative choice account to structured interaction and then
   problematisation. Individual agents in authoritative choice are replaced
   in structured interaction by government departments as distinctive
   organisational actors. In the problematisation account, concepts become
   the dominant actors, changing over longer timeframes. In remote
   Indigenous employment a change in problematisation is discerned in the
   1970s, from inclusion in award wages and social security to concerns
   about welfare dependence. A later problematisation change reframes a
   1970s program from employment to welfare.},

Abstract = {When programs are grants to states, federal funds will be used to meet
   both the national objectives and the local priorities of the state or
   local government recipients. This article examines the decision to
   design new federal programs as either a grant to states or as
   administered by federal agencies. We predict that Congress will choose
   either the states or the federal bureaucracy based on which agent is
   more likely to manage the program consistent with the preferences of the
   Congressional majority. We examine the political and economic conditions
   present in the year before Congress created a program. We find that
   Congress's perception of a government agency's partisan orientation
   matters: A perceived divergence in partisan orientation between the
   Congress and federal agency increases the likelihood of a grant design.
   In addition, we see evidence that a grant design is preferred when the
   president is not a co-partisan of Congress.},

Abstract = {During the period of silent Argentine cinema, the anarchism mouvement
   did not have cinematographic production. Althought the anarchist social
   protest was approached by a series of national films of the time. The
   documentary films called ``actualities{''} gave account of the ``Semana
   Roja{''} of January of 1909 and of the funeral of the person in charge
   of the repression, the colonel Falcon, executed by an anarchist
   militant. Although the national cinematography reached between 1915 and
   1916 an unusual development, it was in 1919 when some films started to
   deal with the anarchism and labor movement, now from the fiction.
   Indeed, between 1919 and 1922, anarchism was represented in several
   films from an adverse perspective in the heat of the great amount of
   labor conflicts that occurred during these years. Through a thorough
   search in newspapers and magazines of the time, this research retrieves
   the reviews and publicity of these sadly lost films. In this way, this
   article allows to know the arguments of these films and who made them.
   But mainly this article tries to glimpse how the representation of
   social conflict and anarchism was built in the initial stage of our
   cinema.},

Abstract = {This paper examines the electoral and ideological contest that has taken
   place between Welsh Labour and Plaid Cymru in the five National Assembly
   elections that have been held between 1999 and 2016. Both parties have
   found success when they have managed to combine effective leadership
   with a coherent programme and a strong sense of Welsh identity. However,
   the Welsh vote to leave the EU in the June 2016 referendum has dealt
   both parties a poor hand in speaking up for Welsh interests. Can they
   find a common cause in working together and also with Scotland to take
   Wales forward in a progressive constitutional direction?},

Volume = {45},

Pages = {253-284},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Although the vast majority of Africans are peaceful moderates, radical
   Islamic ideology that fuels pan-Islamic terrorism is on the rise in the
   continent because of factors that can be categorized under push and pull
   forces. The push forces are conditions that drive people to embrace the
   ideology of violent jihad. These involve: local backlash against
   Americanization/globalization; authoritarian/oppressive political
   systems; lack of basic human rights; youth bulge/high unemployment;
   corruption/lack of meritocracy, state collapse; and porous borders. The
   pull factors are the advantages terrorist/jihadi movements have that
   attract people to their cause. These include: radical Islamic ideology;
   humanitarian networks; media propaganda; provision of a purpose and
   mission; the lure of martyrdom and influences of Madrassas. I argue
   these factors create global security challenges: an existential threat
   to the Westphalian state system; the creation of terror-safe havens;
   displacement and mass global migration; massive global civilian
   casualties; and a conflict resolution conundrum.},

Abstract = {Academic and popular accounts hold that celebrity activists command the
   attention of political elites. One manifestation of this idea is that
   celebrities garner greater congressional attention at committee hearings
   than the substantive experts who typically serve as witnesses. This
   implies that Members of Congress do not value interaction with experts
   and are willing to forego those interactions to allocate time to
   activities with low opportunity costs-activities unimportant enough that
   they can be passed up for a celebrity encounter. To evaluate these
   claims, we examined hearing attendance during a 20-year period. We found
   that celebrity witnesses have little effect on member attendance rates,
   which suggests that celebrities are a less efficacious route to
   congressional attention than is commonly believed.},

Abstract = {Despite the prevalence of anti-government rumors in authoritarian
   countries, little is currently known about their effects on citizens'
   attitudes toward the government, and whether the authorities can
   effectively combat rumors. With an experimental procedure embedded in
   two surveys about Chinese internet users' information exposure, this
   study finds that rumors decrease citizens' trust in the government and
   support of the regime. Moreover, individuals from diverse socio-economic
   and political backgrounds are similarly susceptible to thinly evidenced
   rumors. Rebuttals generally reduce people's belief in the specific
   content of rumors, but often do not recover political trust unless the
   government brings forth solid and vivid evidence to back its refutation
   or win the endorsement of public figures broadly perceived to be
   independent. But because such high-quality and strong rebuttals are hard
   to come by, rumors will erode political support in an authoritarian
   state. These findings have rich implications for studies of rumors and
   misinformation in general, and authoritarian information politics in
   particular.},

Abstract = {As part of a general inquiry into mental mechanisms that operate outside
   conscious awareness, experimental psychology has recently established
   the presence and importance of ``implicit attitudes.{''} The purpose of
   our paper is to compare the roles played by implicit and explicit
   prejudice in politics. Relying on two national surveys of the American
   electorate that included standard measures of implicit and explicit
   prejudice, we provide a systematic comparison of prejudice's political
   effects: for the candidates Americans choose, the policies they favor,
   the assessments they make of government performance, and the racialized
   information they absorb. We find that implicit and explicit prejudice
   provide radically different pictures of racial politics in America.},

Abstract = {We investigate whether mining affects local corruption in Africa.
   Several cross-country analyses report that natural resources have
   adverse effects on political institutions by increasing corruption,
   whereas other country-level studies show no evidence of such political
   resource curses. These studies face well-known endogeneity and other
   methodological issues, and employing micro-level data would allow for
   drawing stronger inferences. Hence, we connect 92,762 Afrobarometer
   survey respondents to spatial data on 496 industrial mines. Using a
   difference-in-differences strategy, we find that mining increases bribe
   payments, and this result is robust to using alternative models. Mines
   are initially located in less corrupt areas, but mining areas turn more
   corrupt after mines open. When exploring mechanisms, we find that local
   economic activity relates differently to corruption in mining and
   non-mining areas, suggesting that mining income incentivizes and enables
   local officials already present to require more bribes.},

Abstract = {Over the past decades, Mexican politics evolved from a closed,
   corporative and hegemonic-party authoritarianism, towards a more plural
   and competitive multi-party system. In the nineties, three relevant
   parties structured electoral politics. But this system soon fragmented
   and reached an average of 5.6 effective parties in 2015. What causes and
   drives political and partisan fragmentation in Mexico? Which have been
   the main temporal and territorial dynamics? How did they reshape
   Mexico's electoral geography?},

Abstract = {Voting is a complex dynamic driven by the sociopolitical attributes of
   individuals and how they are spatially located in proximity to similar
   or different populations. In this research note we examine how
   presidential vote choice is influenced by the interaction between the
   population density and racial composition of the ZIP code of respondents
   in the 2008 and 2012 Cooperative Congressional Election Studies. Our
   findings reveal interesting patterns with respect to a respondent's
   racial background. For whites in racially diverse settings, as density
   increases, so does support for Obama. By contrast, for blacks the
   spatial and racial context has almost no effect, providing evidence in
   support of the claim that this is a group strongly attached to the
   Democratic Party and its co-racial standard-bearer.},

Abstract = {The article analyses the system of public governance in Russia,
   including two main sub-divisions of reforms, namely, civil service
   reform, and administrative reform. The authors examine the principal
   historical stages of both reforms as the parts of the Russian system of
   public governance evolution. The configuration of main actors of Russian
   governance reforms and of government-market relations are presented. The
   paper focuses on generalising some major characteristics of the
   administrative mechanisms of governance in Russia as the complex and
   interlinked entities. Some key elements of Russian governance reforms
   are described, including organisational aspects of civil service,
   optimisation of the functions and structure of the executive bodies,
   implementation of results-based management mechanisms and improvement of
   the regulatory system, public services delivery, one stop shop
   procedures, E-government.},

Abstract = {The article makes three contributions to our knowledge of the Canadian
   political science literature. First, it offers a historical survey of
   the methodologies and techniques used in the discipline. Second, the
   findings of this paper constitute a reference for future work interested
   in commenting the methods and techniques used in CJPS and provide
   scholars with data they can use to better situate their work within the
   broader literature. Finally, the paper answers three questions that
   permeate discussions of the Canadian political science literature. It
   investigates whether the proportion of qualitative works has declined
   over time, whether Canadian scholarship is more qualitative than
   quantitative today and whether there are important differences in the
   methodologies and techniques used in Canada and in the United States.
   The article concludes with a discussion of the future of political
   science methodology based on the findings.
   Resume Cet article apporte trois contributions a notre connaissance de
   la litterature canadienne en science politique. Premierement, il offre
   une enquete historique des methodologies et des techniques utilisees
   dans la discipline. Deuxiemement, ses conclusions constituent une
   reference pour le travail a venir qui vise a commenter les methodes et
   techniques employees dans la CJPS/RCSP et fournissent aux chercheurs des
   donnees pouvant servir a mieux situer leur travail dans le contexte plus
   vaste de la litterature specialisee. Enfin, l'article repond a trois
   questions qui impregnent les debats de la litterature canadienne en
   science politique. Il examine si la proportion du travail qualitatif a
   diminue au fil du temps, si la recherche au Canada est aujourd'hui plus
   qualitative que quantitative et s'il subsiste d'importantes differences
   dans les methodologies et les techniques utilisees au Canada et aux
   Etats-Unis. L'article se conclut par une discussion de l'avenir de la
   methodologie employee en science politique en fonction de ces
   constatations.},

Abstract = {I examine why contemporary social scientists on the political left are
   relatively pessimistic about the public arena and its trajectory. To
   develop an answer, I explore subsidiary questions: What is the evidence
   of social scientists' left pessimism? Why is left pessimism not the only
   plausible stance? Why is left pessimism problematic, and surprising? Why
   does it nonetheless occur? How can social scientists counter left
   pessimism?
   My evidence comes mainly from research on American racial and ethnic
   politics, and on the societal use of genomic science. I explain left
   pessimism as a result largely of the trajectory of social science
   research since the 1960s, and of the loss of faith in revolutionary
   inspiration after the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989. I call on social
   scientists to reinvigorate optimistic visions, perhaps especially in a
   political era fraught with dangers to liberal democracy.},

Abstract = {Theories of economic voting and electoral accountability suggest that
   voters punish incumbent governments for poor economic conditions.
   Incumbents are thus expected to suffer substantially during significant
   economic crisis but their successor in office will face the difficult
   task of reviving the economy. The economic crisis may, therefore,
   negatively affect government parties in subsequent elections even though
   the economic conditions may, to a large degree, have been inherited from
   the previous government. It is argued in this article that economic
   conditions play an important role in such circumstances as they place
   specific issues on the agenda, which structure the strategies available
   to the parties. Therefore, the article studies the 2013 Icelandic
   parliamentary election in which the incumbent government parties
   suffered a big loss despite having steered the country through an
   economic recovery. While perceptions of competence and past performance
   influenced party support, three specific issues thrust on the agenda by
   the economic crisis - mortgage relief, Icesave and European Union
   accession/negotiations - help explain why the centre-right parties were
   successful in returning to the cabinet.},

Abstract = {Conventional wisdom holds that Democrats have abandoned the language of
   class populism. Using a quantitative and qualitative content analysis of
   hundreds of Democratic presidential campaign speeches over the 1932-2012
   period, we revisit the received view. We provide evidence that
   Democratic presidential candidates have made increasingly frequent
   references to the wealthy; have employed a consistently adversarial tone
   in statements referring to the affluent; have made increasingly frequent
   criticisms of Republicans' alleged favoritism toward the rich; and have
   increasingly linked references to the wealthy to promises to assist less
   fortunate Americans through programmatic reforms. Our findings indicate
   that class populism is alive and well in Democratic presidential
   campaign rhetoric.},

Abstract = {This research note presents the results of a research on how Chilean
   university students participating in different forms of social
   organization re-signify politics and democracy in their discourses of. A
   qualitative design was implemented using group discussion to yield data
   and discourse analysis as the main analytic approach. Participants were
   young political party members, non-political activists, volunteers of a
   variety of social organizations and members of cultural-artistic groups
   from the cities of Valparaiso, Santiago and Concepcion. The results show
   three different discourses on politics and democracy: (1) a
   ``politicization discourse{''} among non-political activists; an
   ``experiential discourse on politics{''} among volunteers and
   cultural-artistic groups; and (3) a ``discourse of political realism{''}
   among young political party members. The article concludes that the
   three discourses converge in rejecting institutions, although they
   differ in their understandings of politics and democracy, according to
   different ways they relate to power and participation.},

Abstract = {Judicial elections have two opposing effects on legitimacy perceptions
   for state supreme courts. Elections not only provide a boost to
   legitimacy through the chance to hold officials accountable but also
   involve campaign activity that decreases legitimacy perceptions. This
   article examines these two opposing effects using a nationally
   representative survey that includes items assessing diffuse support for
   state supreme courts. It uses multiple indicators to differentiate
   between states with highly active election systems involving large
   amounts of campaign activity and states with less active elections
   systems that involve little campaign activity. The results from the
   survey show that the legitimacy of elected courts is higher than
   appointed courts but only in states with little election activity. In
   states with high amounts of election activity, the legitimacy of elected
   courts is lower than appointed courts.},

Title = {It's not easy being green: Why voters punish parties for environmental
   policies during economic downturns},
Journal = {ELECTORAL STUDIES},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {45},
Pages = {201-207},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Recent scholarship asserts the existence of ``luxury goods voting{''}
   arguing that voters penalize parties associated with post-material
   issues or those with long-run payoffs during economic downturns. We test
   this arguments here using data from four election studies in Denmark and
   Germany that explicitly ask respondents to rate parties on one
   particular luxury goods issue: protection of the environment. Voters who
   perceive the economy as weak indeed punish governing parties more
   severely when they associate them with environmental policies;
   conversely, a green reputation when the economy is expanding garners
   left-wing parties higher vote probabilities. Right-wing governing
   parties fare similarly, benefitting from those who perceive them as
   green when the economy is hale, albeit only converging to the vote
   probabilities awarded from voters who see them as less green when the
   economy sours. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {This article focuses on the link between alienation, commodity fetishism
   and human development. Alienation and commodity fetishism appear in
   different ways, very abstract and invisibly. People engage innocently
   with these phenomena without awareness of how their well-beings are
   related to. Empirically, this research reveals the alienation and
   commodity fetishism expressed in the adaptation of workers, managers and
   owners in factories during economically troubled times. What must be
   considered, however, is the consequences of all this for human
   development. After some criticism of human development based on the
   capability approach, Marxist implications are drawn for understanding of
   this process.},
