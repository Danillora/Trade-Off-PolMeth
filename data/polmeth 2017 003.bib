Abstract = {In contemporary Confucian political theory, there is surprisingly little
   effort among the theorists to illuminate the value of democracy. When
   they do on rare occasions, their focus is largely on democracy's
   instrumental contribution to Confucian goods. In this paper, I argue
   that, given democracy's dual aspects as a political system and as a way
   of life, it has both instrumental and intrinsic values, and insomuch as
   it is a kind of democracy, Confucian democracy, too, ought to possess
   both values. Central to my argument is that, once introduced and
   justified instrumentally as a political system, democracy in a Confucian
   society attains its noninstrumental value as it becomes consolidated as
   a democratic-Confucian way of life in which democratic institutions,
   rights, and practices are socially mediated by and negotiated with
   Confucian values, civilities, and moral sentiments. I present my
   overarching normative framework in terms of pragmatic Confucian
   democracy.},

Abstract = {Political representation is at the core of liberal democracy. In modern
   society major agents of representation are political parties. The
   responsible party model describes the dominant way of how representative
   democracy works. In this model delegation runs from voters to parties
   and from parties to representatives in parliament and government.
   How does a match come about between what parties' off er and what voters
   are interested in to get? This is the question which we have tried to
   answer. We rely on a unique dataset that includes information about
   Left-Right policy positions of political parties and their voters in ten
   central and east European countries for the period from 1990 to 2012,
   covering 65 elections and more than 250 parties.
   The two dimensions of supply and demand explain the most of ideological
   congruence between parties and voters. Voters have to make an adequate
   choice and parties have to present a related programmatic profile. On
   the one hand, our empirical results show that the differentiation of
   political supply, the possibility to properly recognize a political
   party, and the clarity of the parties' policy positions contribute
   positively to political policy representation. On the other hand,
   whenever parties try to attract as many voters as possible by blurring
   their programmatic identity, this office-seeking strategy runs counter
   enabling ideological congruence between political parties and party
   supporters.},

Abstract = {The substantive representation of minority groups in national
   legislatures is a topic of significant normative, theoretical and
   empirical importance. Addressing this question, this article focuses on
   what drives Members of the UK House of Commons to raise issues on
   concern for Jewish and Muslim minority groups in relatively low-cost
   parliamentary activity, i.e. Parliamentary Questions for written answers
   (WPQs). Drawing on the suggested positive relationship between
   descriptive and substantive minority representation (e.g. Hansard
   (2009), Speaker's Conference (on Parliamentary Representation): Final
   Report, London, The Stationery Office Limited), it uses content and
   statistical analysis to examine if having a Jewish or Muslim background
   impacts on the frequency and the probability of MPs' engagement with
   minority issues, and how this effect compares to that from institutional
   predictors, namely the party parliamentary status and the minority
   presence in a constituency. The findings demonstrate that a religious
   minority background has a limited impact on MPs' engagement with
   minority issues in WPQs, being inferior to that of institutional
   predictors. Being in Opposition, in particular, has a consistent,
   positive influence on the content of WPQs, whereby Opposition MPs table
   more WPQs on the issues of minority concern than Members from the party
   of Government.},

Title = {THE GLOBAL SOCIO-POLITICAL DESTABILIZATION WAVE OF 2011 AND THE
   FOLLOWING YEARS: A QUANTITATIVE ANALYSIS},
Journal = {POLIS-POLITICHESKIYE ISSLEDOVANIYA},
Year = {2017},

Pages = {150-168},
Abstract = {This article analyzes global dynamics of all the major indicators of
   sociopolitical destabilization in 2011-2015. The authors come to the
   conclusion that after the beginning of the Arab Spring, explosive global
   growth was observed for the overwhelming majority of indicators of
   socio-political destabilization for anti-government demonstrations,
   riots, general strikes, terrorist acts / guerrilla warfare and purges.
   It was also observed for the global integral index of socio-political
   destabilization. On the other hand, no statistically significant growth
   was observed for assassinations and political crises. On the other hand,
   for such an important indicator of global socio-political
   destabilization, as a global number of coups and coup attempts, there
   was a statistically significant decrease. In 2011, the number of major
   anti-government demonstrations in the world increased in a particularly
   dramatic way (11.5 times, that is, more than by an order of magnitude).
   At the same time, there was a noticeably less intensive (approximately
   6-fold) increase in the global number of riots, while the number of
   major terrorist attacks in this year only doubled. The global number of
   major anti-government demonstrations in 2012-2013 slightly decreased,
   while the global intensity of riots continued to grow, coming close to
   the intensity of anti-government demonstrations. The global number of
   major terrorist attacks in 2011-2014 grew exponentially, exceeding in
   2014 the number of both major anti-government demonstrations and riots.
   In general, it can be said that the growth of the global number of riots
   followed the growth of the number of anti-government demonstrations with
   a certain lag, and the increase in the number of terrorist acts was
   somewhat lagging relative to both of them.},

Journal = {POLITICKE VEDY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {20},
Number = {4},
Pages = {113-133},
Abstract = {Members of Islamist terrorist organisations share a common worldview
   stemming from the radical Islamist ideology, which is a pillar of their
   identity. Islamist identity emerged in response to specific events in
   Muslim countries; however, today it has an unprecedented ability to
   attract also Muslims living in the West. Radicalisation in a sense of
   ideological socialisation represents the process by which original
   Muslim identity may shift towards Islamist one. Theory of radicalisation
   thus will be used to explain the nexus between identity and terrorism.
   The aim of the article is to outline a trajectory between identity and
   terrorism and hence to identify possible reasons and patterns of Muslim
   radicalisation in two different settings: Muslim countries and Muslim
   diaspora in the West (Europe, in particular). This article points out
   that a perceived threat to identity is a driving force of Muslim
   radicalisation in Muslim countries, while a crisis of identity is
   crucial within Muslim community in the West. Potential catalysts and
   paths of radicalisation outlined in the article are important in order
   to understand the roots of Muslim rage and the emergence of terrorist
   threat, and consequently, they need to be considered in the
   counter-terrorist measures.},

Volume = {24},
Number = {6},
Pages = {1159-1177},
Abstract = {Does the uncertainty associated with post-authoritarian transitions
   cause political and social polarization? Does ubiquitous social media
   exacerbate these problems and thus make successful democratic
   transitions less likely? This article examines these questions in the
   case of Egypt between the 11 February 2011 fall of President Hosni
   Mubarak and the 3 July 2013 military coup, which overthrew President
   Mohamed el-Morsi. The analysis is based on a Twitter dataset including
   62 million tweets by 7 million unique users. Using a mix of quantitative
   and qualitative methods, we demonstrate how clusters of users form and
   evolve over time, the density of interactions between them, and the flow
   of particular types of information through the clustered network
   structure. We show that the Egyptian Twitter public developed into
   increasingly isolated clusters of the like-minded which shared
   information unevenly. We argue that the growing distance between these
   clusters encouraged political conflict and facilitated the spread of
   fear and hatred, which ultimately undermined the democratic transition
   and won popular support for the military coup.},

Abstract = {Interpersonal influence - the process by which people change their idea
   according to the ideas of others - is a crucial mechanism that forges
   political agreement among citizens. By using data from the 2009 German
   Longitudinal Election Study short-term campaign panel, it will be tested
   how this strategy contributes to changing citizens' ideas in the
   proximity of the 2009 Bundestag elections in Germany. Results of
   fixed-effect logistic regression models confirm the findings in previous
   literature, showing evidences consistent with influence effects. It is
   also suggested that the social circle of discussants alters the way in
   which people are influenced. Propensities to change vote choice, in
   fact, are boosted by the exposure to disagreeing strong ties, such as
   relatives and spouse/partner.},

   Killings as Genocide},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF GENOCIDE RESEARCH},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {19},
Number = {4},
Pages = {487-511},
Abstract = {This article presents an overview of new evidence recovered from the
   former Indonesian Intelligence Agency's archives in Banda Aceh that is
   able to prove, for the first time, military agency behind the 1965-66
   killings in Indonesia. The military leadership, these documents show,
   initiated and implemented the killings as part of a coordinated national
   campaign. This campaign was described by the military leadership as an
   ``annihilation operation{''} and was implemented with the stated
   intention to ``annihilate to the roots{''} the military's major
   political rival, the Indonesian Communist Party (PKI). This new evidence
   fundamentally changes what it is now possible to know about the 1965-66
   killings, specifically as regards the question of military intent.
   Likewise, the process by which the military's target group was
   identified and targeted for destruction can now be understood using the
   military's own accounts of how this process occurred. This article
   argues that this new evidence strengthens the argument, advanced by
   genocide scholars since the early 1980s, that the 1965-66 killings
   should be understood as a case of genocide.},

Journal = {POLITICS GROUPS AND IDENTITIES},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {5},

Pages = {4-24},
Abstract = {Transgender identity inherently involves body politics, specifically how
   transgender people may physically represent gender in ways that do not
   match their assigned sex at birth and how some may alter their bodies.
   Yet, political behavior research on transgender rights attitudes leaves
   unaddressed the role of transgender bodies in shaping those attitudes.
   Using an original, representative national survey of American adults, we
   analyze how authoritarianism and disgust sensitivity affect transgender
   rights attitudes. These two predispositions often reflect social norms
   and morality about bodies, especially those of stigmatized minority
   groups. First, we show that attitudes about transgender rights are
   multidimensional, forming civil rights and body-centric dimensions.
   Second, we demonstrate that disgust sensitivity and authoritarianism
   both positively predict opposition to transgender rights, and that they
   moderate each other's effects such that the greatest opposition is among
   those jointly scoring higher on both predictors. Finally, we show that
   disgust sensitivity and authoritarianism predict greater than average
   opposition to body-centric transgender rights policies.},

   population. For this reason much attention has been directed to those
   kinds of settlements in many urban centers. This paper is a case study
   which analyses the political, economic, and social aspects of
   rural-urban migrants.},

Abstract = {A classical question of political science is to what extent electoral
   systems influence voting behaviour. Yet, many of these studies examine
   how different electoral systems affect the election results in terms of
   vote distribution across parties. Instead, we investigate how electoral
   rules affect intra party preference voting. Given the importance of the
   debate on the personalization of politics, insight into how electoral
   rules shape intra-party choice is a valuable contribution to the
   literature. In our study, we focus on the effect of two specific rules:
   the option to cast a list vote and on a single versus multiple
   preference votes. The results of experiments conducted in Belgium and
   the Netherlands show that electoral rules indeed influence voting
   behaviour with regard to intra party preference voting, although
   differences exist between the Netherlands and Belgium. Moreover, we find
   that the option to cast a list vote equally affects votes for the first
   candidate on the list, as well as lower positioned candidates. This
   suggests that preference votes might be less preferential than has often
   been assumed.},

Abstract = {Andrew Carnegie's legacy rests on his philanthropic giving in a wide
   variety of areas, including peace advocacy. But Carnegie gave not only
   his money, but his personal energy and time to the pursuit of peace.
   Believing that the twentieth century would be, should be, the century in
   which war was abolished and disputes between nations settled by
   peaceable arbitration, he personally lobbied presidents of the United
   States and the crowned heads and government leaders of Europe to enter
   into agreements to submit future disputes to an international court at
   The Hague, in the Peace Palace which he built there. He traveled through
   Europe, wrote several widely distributed articles in newspapers and
   journals, gave dozens of speeches, hosted conferences, and used all the
   personal power he possessed to change the course of world history.
   ``A Fool for Peace{''} is a story of the last years of his life and his
   almost full-time pursuit of international peace. That he failed is no
   indictment of the sincerity or importance of his efforts.},

   Machiavelli's appeal to the figure of the one-man ordinatore and,
   second, a republican interpretation of il Principe. Its particular focus
   is on the pivotal role played in Machiavelli's text-act by `love of
   worldly glory'. It is argued, first, that it is through love of glory
   that Machiavelli can coherently aim to produce an effective one-man
   ordinatore and, second, that the political education that il Principe
   provides to this figure leads them ineluctably to the conclusion that
   lasting glory can only be achieved through the foundation of a republic.},

Abstract = {This paper sets out to explain the increasing competition among the
   different economic actors of the international system - and its
   corresponding geoeconomic effects-brought about by globalization
   processes. The expansion of global commerce fostered a grueling race
   where actors competed for gaining greater shares in the global market.
   The paper argues that as the market was booming, there was room for
   anyone wishing to participate. But in the wake of economic crises,
   opportunities narrowed down and the competition for keeping market
   shares rocketed. Simultaneously, opportunities for accessing raw
   materials diminished. In short, the increasing competition promoted by
   globalizing trends engendered pressures that, in turn, led to strained
   relations among the different actors competing for a share in the global
   market.},

Journal = {REGIONAL AND FEDERAL STUDIES},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {27},
Number = {5, SI},
Pages = {597-621},
Abstract = {This paper explores how a high level of vertical intergovernmentalism
   and a low level of horizontal intergovernmentalism reflect as well as
   contribute to a high degree of centralization in Australian federalism
   and in the role and activity of intergovernmental councils (IGCs).
   Pre-eminent among the latter is the Council of Australian Governments
   (COAG), which sits at the apex of a system of ministerial councils and
   attendant agencies. Policy coordination is the principal motivation
   behind the Commonwealth's use of COAG. The States established their own
   horizontal body in 2006 but that faded quickly in an experience that
   confirmed the underlying realities of Australian federalism.},

Abstract = {This paper analyzes the dynamic imposed on the civil-military relations
   in Venezuela after the failed coup attempt of Abril 2002. Using the
   principal-agent theory, we argued that the chavistas administration
   managed to minimize the risks of evasion of the armed forces through a
   combination of strategies that, together, shaped a political control
   model. Despite the differences, this model has similar instrumental
   features with the civilian control system established under the previous
   Punto Fijo's regime (1958-1998).},

Abstract = {This article explores how women who have participated in armed groups
   experience obstacles, contradictions and pleasures. This participation
   is crossed by variables which influence and even further polarize gender
   relationships (illegality, clandestine situation, violence). For that
   purpose, this research use as methodology twenty five women and six men
   life stories, who have participated in ETA (Euskadi ta Askatasuna).
   Through their testimonies, this article focus on why these women are
   motivated to join ETA and what factors help or hinder that involvement.
   On the other hand, it deals with how these women combatants experience
   pleasures, risks and contradictions when they are part of ETA's
   structure. Regarding the main conclusions we see that during the process
   of integration there are preclusive factors, as familiar and territorial
   neutralization but also enabling ones, as advantage and tacit position
   of their genre. Moreover, they develop strategies in order to neutralize
   the difficulties, such as territorial movements, bridging contacts. Once
   inside, they have to face obstacles that are the result, among others,
   of the rules of clandestine life and the sexual division of work. That
   is how the exile and the militancy abroad become at the same time the
   source of risks and pleasures.},

Abstract = {Previous studies show that direct democracy would enhance satisfaction
   with democracy. Deeper investigations of this relationship are rare,
   though. Especially questions regarding the individual participation, or
   the winning and losing of a referendum, as well as the local concern of
   its result and questions with respect to long-term stability of these
   effects remain unanswered. In this paper, I close this research gap.
   Doing so, I analyze pooled cross sectional data from 2011 to 2014 which
   was gathered in the context of a referendum in the German city
   Stuttgart. The results show a positive impact on satisfaction with
   democracy of both, the attendance and the winning of the referendum.
   These effects are reinforced by a rising local concern. None of the
   effects show long-term stability.},

Abstract = {Oscar Larsson's (2015) essay condemns discursive institutionalism for
   the sin of subjectivism. In reality, however, discursive
   institutionalism emphasizes the intersubjective nature of ideas through
   its theorization of agents' background ideational abilities and
   foreground discursive abilities. It also avoids relativism by means of
   Wittgenstein's distinction between experiences of everyday life and
   pictures of the world. Contrary to Larsson, what truly separates
   post-structuralism from discursive institutionalism is the respective
   approaches' theorization of the relationship of power to ideas, with
   discursive institutionalists mainly focused on persuasive power through
   ideas, while post-structuralists focus on the structural power in ideas
   or on coercive power over ideas.},

Pages = {373-398},
Abstract = {Women increasingly have been elected to executive office - both at the
   national and subnational level - in countries throughout the world. Yet,
   we know little about the effects that the election of a woman to
   executive office has on citizen attitudes, political engagement, or
   political participation. In this paper, we argue that the election of a
   woman to an executive could have effects through the presence of a woman
   in the executive, the novelty of a woman assuming executive office, or
   both. We test these hypotheses with a survey experiment conducted in
   Brazil that focuses on the election of a hypothetical female governor.
   This project sheds light on how citizens respond to female executives
   with a causal analysis in an important region for gender and executive
   politics.},

Abstract = {The article attempts to explain V.Putin's continuously high approval
   rating under the conditions of economic recession. On the basis of the
   existing studies of factors of political support, S.Shevchuk elaborates
   a number of hypotheses that explain this phenomenon and provides
   empirical tests. His research shows that the contradiction between the
   poor economic conditions and high level of political support for the
   Russian president can be largely explained by the ``rally `round the
   flag{''} effect. A number of important domestic and foreign political
   events contributed to the rise of patriotic sentiments, not least due to
   the appropriate coverage by the media. Just when the effect from one
   event was about to disappear, the effect from the subsequent event
   stepped in. According to the author, this is the trick that explains the
   ``Teflon{''} rating of Putin, which remains consistently high despite
   the mounting socio-economic problems.},

Journal = {NEW PERSPECTIVES},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {25},
Number = {1},
Pages = {141-156},
Abstract = {This article addresses Richard Westra, Ian Bruff and Matthias Ebenau's
   responses to my prior review essay on their edited volumes. In my
   initial survey, I concluded that both volumes reinvigorate the radical
   potential of contemporary Comparative Capitalisms (CC) literatures, but
   warned against the tendency in critical research to trace capitalism
   solely at its worst. I posited that this pessimism undermines the
   volumes' pedagogical potential and threatens to bring us to intellectual
   cul-de-sacs. The authors respond in different ways to this critical
   engagement: Westra provides a guideline to trace such an intellectual
   pessimism in the (neo-)Marxist political economy and points to the
   so-called `Uno approach' as an alternative direction that opens our
   intellectual horizons to social change in (post-)capitalism. In
   contrast, Bruff and Ebenau regard my review as less monochromatic than
   other discussions of their research project but nevertheless assertively
   retort to my critique. This reply seeks to engage the aforementioned
   scholars in a discussion, while reconsidering the alleged pessimism of
   critical CC research as informed optimism. Such informed optimism must
   be found in a critical research that (i) is based on a deeper reflexive
   theoretical discussion rather than a one-sided deconstruction of
   mainstream scholarship; and (ii) derives from a holistic approach
   broadened by a human-centred perspective, which also exposes us to
   actually existing alternatives within as well as to (post-)capitalism.
   Given that such approaches are currently only implicit, the many ongoing
   crises of contemporary capitalism represent a critical juncture not only
   for mainstream, but also for critical CC research.},

Abstract = {This essay on the visual representation of landscapes in the German
   Democratic Republic (GDR) suggests the historical and aesthetic
   significance of romantic traditions of the nineteenth century for the
   Socialist cultural practice of the GDR as well as for theoretical
   reflections on the importance of landscape and nature for the
   development of a Socialist society. With such a comparative approach, we
   can not only interpret philosophical work by Lothar Kuhne as a Marxist
   reflection on romantic notions of the importance of landscape but we can
   also trace the stylistic influence of romantic artists like Caspar David
   Friedrich on the GDR's Socialist landscape painting. More specifically,
   the essay shows how Wolfgang Mattheuer became the foremost GDR landscape
   painter by adapting, transforming, and reevaluating Friedrich's art.
   Relying on the tradition of German romanticism, Mattheuer developed a
   new genre of Socialist landscape representation comprising both
   important artworks and tools of critique.},

Abstract = {Why does ethnicity become politically salient and the basis of
   mobilization for some members of a disadvantaged group but not for
   others? This article suggests that members of a disadvantaged ethnic
   group are unlikely to support ethnic mobilization as long as they
   perceive the channels of personal mobility in the political system open.
   It builds upon an original dataset of biographical information of 2,952
   governors, ministers, and judges in Turkey. The results show that
   support for Kurdish ethno-mobilization and recruitment into the Kurdish
   insurgency remain low in Kurdish localities with greater representation
   in the echelons of political power. This finding supports institutional
   approach to the study of ethnicity and demonstrates the importance of
   state recruitment patterns in shaping the political saliency of ethnic
   identity.},

Abstract = {The restructurings and mass redundancies have made the headlines of the
   national and regional press, where both have, at the very least,
   occupied a special place in the economic and/or legal sections over the
   past years. However, researchers have dealt insufficiently with the
   judicial and legal dispute led by elected staff representatives and on
   the relations maintained with their lawyer. Starting from the
   professional archives of the lawyer Tiennot Grumbach, the article
   relates the legal episode of five company restructurings. At first, it
   tries to understand the use of the labor union from the bottom up by
   labor union elected representatives, in concerning itself with their
   mobilization of the law and the linkage between this and other modes of
   actions. Secondly, the article questions the motives behind the appeal
   to the law and to T. Grumbach by staff representatives. The initiating
   of proceedings by the elected representatives to dispute the
   restructuring allows them to save time, to supervise the mobilization
   and the employees, and to weigh up the negotiations with the management
   of their company.},

Abstract = {The research agenda of state transformations in Latin America in the
   last decade cannot ignore the analysis of the way in which the social
   role of the state is developing, that is, of those interventions related
   to the production of social welfare and care. To this end two
   theoretical exercises that help enrich this work are performed: 1) The
   description of the appropriation by Latin America scholars of the
   seminal texts on welfare regimes produced for and from developed
   countries highlighting the contribution made by Esping-Andersen; as well
   as the feminist critique of such contributions. 2) Presenting
   innovations to construct theoretical and methodological proposals that
   can capture the transformations in the region in the post-Washington
   consensus period.},

Abstract = {This article refers to the analysis of the construction of international
   jurisprudence on the urban environment in the jurisprudence of the
   Inter-American human rights system and the possibility of international
   action against a country like Brazil, for denial of quality of urban
   living environment. Whereas the theory and the courts and international,
   in particular the European Court of Human Rights has recognized the need
   to protect the urban environment as a human right, this study will
   evaluate the content of this right in international law of the
   environment and the possible contribution to the development of
   inter-American and Brazilian jurisprudence on urban environment. Seeks,
   with this research, analyze the regulatory limits of the current
   jurisprudence of the IACHR on the intersection between human rights and
   environmental bases and the possible expansion of the regulatory scope
   of the environmental decisions, which is still limited to indigenous
   issues. The construction of the concept of environmental protection in
   the Inter-American Human Rights System and the main legal issues argued
   in cases submitted to the IACHR and the possible effectiveness and
   expansion of the normative scope of the IACHR jurisprudence on urban

Series = {Europe in Transition-The NYU European Studies Series},
Year = {2017},
Pages = {9-18},
Abstract = {This chapter focuses on theories and contemporary scholarly debates on
   community building as a means to improve livability and social cohesion
   in disadvantaged and heterogeneous urban settings. It shows how the
   necessity of creating social networks for people to be able to feel safe
   and at home in the city is stressed by many policy-makers, as well as
   anthropologists and sociologists. Seen from a political perspective,
   community building, feelings of belonging and social engagement are seen
   as prerequisites for urban neighborhoods and their dwellers to function
   well. The implementation of a community restaurant in a working class
   area in Amsterdam must be seen in light of decades of Dutch social
   interventions. As is shown, the exclusiveness of communities brings
   about contradictory outcomes.},

Abstract = {Political socialisation plays a crucial but complex role in determining
   how immigrants adjust to the political environment of their host
   country. This study examines the effects of initial political
   socialisation and resocialisation on immigrants' electoral participation
   in Canada. It addresses three questions: To what extent does the
   outlooks that develop from earlier political experiences in the country
   of origin shape immigrants' subsequent electoral participation in
   Canada? To what extent, and how, does subsequent experience with
   politics in Canada affect electoral participation? And finally, how does
   initial socialisation in the country of origin condition resocialisation
   in Canada? The results indicate that not only does resocialisation leave
   a unique and lasting imprint on immigrant electoral participation in the
   host country, but also that the nature of resocialisation process in the
   host country is conditioned by the distinctive political outlooks
   immigrants acquire under different political regimes in their respective
   countries of origin.},

   Europe},
Journal = {ELECTORAL STUDIES},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {50},
Pages = {103-115},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {This article compares far right voters in Western Europe with citizens
   who abstain from electoral participation. Political dissatisfaction is
   thought to motivate both forms of political behavior. Low levels of
   formal education are also significantly predictive of both abstention
   and far right support. This study implements a multilevel multinomial
   logistic regression comparing nonvoters, far right voters, and voters
   for other parties from 2002 to 2012. The results suggest that common
   predictors distinguishing far right voters, such as education and
   political distrust, do not distinguish far right voters from abstainers.
   However, measures of social integration, including union membership,
   self-reported social activity, and trust in other people, are positively
   predictive of far right over abstention. Conversely, far right party
   voters and voters for other parties display similar levels of political
   interest and social integration. Other issues, such as Euroskepticism
   and anti-immigrant attitudes are more common among far right voters, and
   distinguish them from both other voters and those who just stay home.

Abstract = {Several reports have highlighted that, within Britain, allegations of
   electoral fraud tend to be more common in areas with large Pakistani and
   Bangladeshi communities. However, the extent of this association has not
   yet been quantified. Using data at the local authority level, this paper
   shows that percentage Pakistani and Bangladeshi (logged) is a robust
   predictor of two measures of electoral fraud allegations: one based on
   designations by the Electoral Commission, and one based on police
   enquiries. Indeed, the association persists after controlling for other
   minority shares, demographic characteristics, socio-economic
   deprivation, and anti-immigration attitudes. I interpret this finding
   with reference to the growing literature on consanguinity (cousin
   marriage) and corruption. Rates of cousin marriage tend to be high in
   countries such as Pakistan and Bangladesh, which may have fostered norms
   of nepotism and in-group favoritism that persist over time. To bolster
   my interpretation, I use individual level survey data to show that,
   within Europe, migrants from countries with high rates of cousin
   marriage are more likely to say that family should be one's main
   priority in life, and are less likely to say it is wrong for a public
   official to request a bribe. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Looking at scientific research in terms of `schools' marks an
   established way of evaluating larger research areas. In this paper, we
   deliberately use a soft concept of `school', designed to capture
   possible peculiarities of the discipline of Comparative Politics in
   Germany, and its impact at the international level of political
   research. The focus of our inquiry is on three major sub-areas of
   comparative political studies-comparative executive politics,
   comparative legislative research, and comparative federalism
   research-which can be meaningfully subsumed under the label of
   institution-centred comparative political research. Moreover, we focus
   basically on the developments of the past decade. We find that the size
   of the German, or German-language, community of comparative politics has
   long worked to keep the pressure for German or Germany-based scholars to
   publish their research in English low, though the language of
   publication alone cannot be considered a valid indicator of either
   scientific excellence or parochialism. Data collected for the past
   decade, measuring the share of contributions by German or Germany-based
   scholars in the internationally leading specialist journals of the
   sub-areas examined, suggest that the discipline has `opened up' and
   `reached out' more recently. That said, for the time being, the German
   comparative politics community in the three sub-areas studied continues
   to be considerably stronger at the receiving end, in terms of paying
   reasonable attention to the theoretical and empirical developments at
   the international level, than at actively shaping the international
   debate. As in other areas, exceptions prove the rule.},

Abstract = {This article offers a new reading of Lord Durham's recommendations
   concerning municipal institutions, included in the last section of his
   famous report. By placing the document in the context of the debates
   raised by the constitutional and administrative reforms conducted in
   Britain during the 1830s, it shows that its author understood autonomous
   municipalities as essential components of a modern mixed government.
   Such language was then employed by reformist Whigs in order to justify
   the policies which they thought were necessary to strengthen the
   country's political institutions by adapting them to changing social
   circumstances. The analysis presented here challenges the interpretation
   provided by most contemporary commentators on the report. Many of them
   have concluded that Lord Durham's understanding of local institutions is
   based on a liberal conception of political life, found in the writings
   of Jeremy Bentham and John Stuart Mill. These studies tend to reduce
   early British liberalism to philosophical radicalism. They seek to
   demonstrate that liberals wish to deprive local communities of their
   political autonomy by integrating their institutions into the juridical
   structure of a highly centralized State. By focusing on the rhetoric
   used by Lord Durham to write his report, this article allows us to
   appreciate the heterogeneity of the definition of the municipality
   developed by liberalism.},

Abstract = {Michael Oakeshott provides the best articulation of the widespread view
   that the moral foundations of the modern state limit it to the defense
   and maintenance of a system of formal rules governing individuals and
   non-state enterprises. While this understanding of the proper relation
   between individual and state has been challenged by liberals of a more
   Rawlsian persuasion, these criticisms have persuaded few to change their
   minds, as they rest upon assumptions that are plainly incompatible with
   the view under consideration. I argue that, rightly understood, central
   and attractive features of Oakeshott's own conception of understanding,
   philosophy, individuality, and education lead to significantly different
   conclusions than those embraced by Oakeshott himself. The morality of
   individuality upon which Oakeshott rests his strict restrictions on the
   use of state power requires that we be open to the use of that power to
   guarantee that all receive the education postulated by individuality.},

Abstract = {In his seminal work on Southern politics, V.O. Key observed that voters
   disproportionately support local candidates at the ballot box. While
   empirical analyses have confirmed ``friends-and-neighbors{''} voting
   across numerous electoral contexts, no one has directly examined voter
   turnout as the mechanism linking place of residence to vote choice. We
   argue that place of residence is a social identity that incentivizes
   citizens to turn out to vote on behalf of the local candidate. We test
   this mobilization mechanism using a randomized field experiment
   conducted during a 2014 state legislative primary election. Our results
   show that county ties between candidates and voters likely boost
   turnout. Our findings contribute to our understanding of the importance
   of place identity for turnout decisions in low-information elections.},

Abstract = {The differentiation between monarchies and republics is hardly relevant
   anymore - both systems of government may be democratic or autocratic.
   Nevertheless, the institution of the monarchy - independent of the type
   of system shows some particularities and a number of common features:
   being a consensus-based institution, the monarchy creates social
   integration and supports political compromise - this way it contributes
   to settling conflicts by way of mutual agreement. However, cause and
   effect may not be confused. The longevity of many monarchies is not a
   result of the system of government. On the contrary, the institution of
   the monarchy has been able to survive until today because it has shown
   stability for a number of reasons (sufficient resources, low degree of
   social conflicts).},

Abstract = {In the new millennium, the growing economic interdependency across the
   Taiwan Strait has stretched politico-economic ``ambiguity{''} to the
   limit. To many observers, the recent bilateral trade pact, the
   ``Economic Cooperation Framework Agreement{''}, was thought to be the
   preliminary stage for further political integration. If the integration
   assumptions were correct, closer economic and social relations would
   have led to closer political integration between Taiwan and Mainland
   China (Kahler and Kastner, 2006; Kastner 2006a, 2006b). However, this
   evidently has not happened. This article examines the questions provoked
   by cross-strait interactions by analyzing the relationship between
   perceived economic cooperation and political attitudes. Using national
   security survey data, the article contends that, due to generational
   difference and lack of spillover effects, economic integration does not
   lead to a positive attitude toward political integration, but that
   period and cohort effects may gradually drive change in the future.},

Abstract = {We examine the social antecedents of contributing to campaigns, with a
   particular focus on the role of population density and social networking
   opportunities. Using 10 years of US campaign contribution data from the
   Federal Election Commission and a national survey of party leaders, we
   find that recruiting contributors is easier in a densely populated
   region, where the daily opportunity of individuals being exposed to the
   same information via their social networks is high. Furthermore, the
   effect of population density is heterogeneous with respect to mobility:
   if a region has substantial commuting outflow, the chance of being
   mobilized from the place of residence decreases, but the chance of
   mobilization in their place of work increases. This analysis also
   reveals differences between political parties. Democrats are more
   dependent on social networking in population dense areas. This
   difference in the importance of social networking opportunities present
   in geographical space helps explain macro-level patterns in party
   fundraising.},

Journal = {PARTY POLITICS},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {23},
Number = {6},

Abstract = {Based on agenda-setting, priming and issue ownership theory, we know
   that issue ownership and party visibility in the news can be used as
   strategies to affect electoral support. Thus far, it is, however,
   unclear whether these effects are independent or work interactively.
   This study aims to fill this gap. We focus on the Partij voor de
   Vrijheid, the prominent Dutch right-wing populist party, and draw upon
   an experimental design in which we exposed a sample of Dutch voters (N =
   600) to media coverage on one of four issues - an owned issue, an
   unowned issue, an issue owned by another party and a contested issue -
   featuring either a party cue or not. The results indicate that the
   impact of issue coverage is moderated by party cues: attention to owned
   issues and unowned issues increases support only when party cues are
   present. Attention to contested and trespassing issues does not increase
   support.},

Abstract = {Do political parties' shifts on sociocultural issues, which signify the
   withdrawal of ideological commitment and disturb their supporters, cause
   vote loss? We argue that the negative electoral impact of positional
   shifts is constrained by party supporters' opinion as well as parties'
   ideological strength on sociocultural issues. Using data on party
   positions and ideologies in Western Europe from 1990 to 2008, we find
   that only parties holding strong ideologies on sociocultural issues lose
   votes by shifting their positions on these issues. Even these parties,
   however, do not lose votes when their position shifts in the same
   direction as that of their supporters. The results indicate that niche
   parties are straightforwardly affected by position shifts regarding
   sociocultural issues; they should adopt different strategies between
   values they endorse and those they reject; and political parties should
   not be worried about vote loss from position shifts as long as they
   follow their supporters' opinions.},

Abstract = {Political knowledge is central to the success of representative
   democracy. However, public policy has been shown to follow public
   opinion even despite low levels of political information in the
   electorate. Does this mean that political knowledge is irrelevant to
   policy representation? We consider whether knowledgeable electorates are
   better able to achieve representative policy outcomes. Using the
   heterogeneity in the responsiveness of government across the states, we
   consider how state political knowledge moderates the connection between
   citizen ideology and the policy outcomes of state government. Using
   national surveys and multilevel logit with post-stratification, we
   develop measures of collective political knowledge in the states. We
   test whether knowledgeable electorates are more likely to secure
   representative political outcomes than less politically informed
   constituencies. We find that as state political knowledge increases, so
   does the correspondence between the preferences of the public and the
   ideological tenor of state policy outcomes.},

Abstract = {The rise in mass incarceration provides a growing impetus to understand
   the effect that interactions with the criminal justice system have on
   political participation. While a substantial body of prior research
   studies the political consequences of criminal disenfranchisement, less
   work examines why eligible ex-felons vote at very low rates. We use
   administrative data on voting and interactions with the criminal justice
   system from Pennsylvania to assess whether the association between
   incarceration and reduced voting is causal. Using administrative records
   that reduce the possibility of measurement error, we employ several
   different research designs to investigate the possibility that the
   observed negative correlation between incarceration and voting might
   result from differences across individuals that lead both to
   incarceration and to low participation. As this selection bias issue is
   addressed, we find that the estimated effect of serving time in prison
   on voting falls dramatically and for some research designs vanishes
   entirely.},

Abstract = {Policy makers around the world are increasingly concerned with the
   challenge of cultivating and capitalizing on soft power. Yet government
   efforts to increase others' feelings of attraction toward their
   countries face conceptual and practical challenges. This article
   examines Australia's attempt to operationalize soft power in Asia
   through its international education strategy. Drawing on interviews with
   key officials, we show how the design of Australia's international
   education policy was consciously informed by multiple dimensions of soft
   power. Yet the nature of soft power means that whether the policy will
   achieve its soft power objectives is up to Asia, not Australia.},

Abstract = {Leaders have an important role in initiating and shaping the
   democratization process. Formal and informal structures within the
   political system constrain possible options requiring leaders to
   exercise agency to manage expectations and facilitate change. This
   article examines the actions of F.W. de Klerk (South Africa) and Roh Tae
   Woo (South Korea) in initiating processes that eventually led to the
   consolidation of democratic political systems. The aims of the article
   are: (1) to identify the array of opportunities and threats faced by the
   two leaders; and (2) to determine the effect of regime form in shaping
   these structural factors. Drawing on previous work on the role of
   leadership in democratization, the analysis focuses on four factors:
   authority, institutions, opposition and continuity. To assess decisions
   made in the distinct political contexts the article examines how the
   respective structural configuration (one-party and military) was
   managed.},

Abstract = {This article argues that Mexico has a thin public diplomacy approach to
   the Indo-Pacific. The reasons are twofold: first, the great weight of
   the United States poses limits on Mexico's foreign policy outside North
   America; and second, the scarce resources have been channeled to soft
   power strategies elsewhere, particularly toward the Indo-Pacific.
   However, China, Japan, South Korea, India, and Australia have better
   chances to engage productively in public diplomacy, and the MIKTA
   groupMexico, Indonesia, the Republic of Korea, Turkey, and
   Australiaoffers certain venues to expand common interests. To develop a
   better appreciation of Mexico's public diplomacy, a brief summary of its
   main features is offered as well as some comparative analysis of
   Mexico's image abroad.},

Abstract = {After the death of president Hugo Rafael Chavez Frias, Venezuela
   represents a very interesting and unique case of institutionalized
   populist system. In this article, I will attempt to explain some
   analytical elements by which we may speak of an institutionalized
   post-populist condition. It is interesting to understand why the
   populist Chavist system continues to endure, even if with difficulty, in
   spite of many unfavourable factors like: the death of a charismatic
   leader and the presence of a weak leadership; and unfavourable and
   adverse geopolitical and geoeconomical conditions, especially when
   compared with those of the initial phase of ascent and prosperity. The
   objective of this article is to study in its complexity the typicality
   of the post charismatic phase of Venezuela's system and present a case
   study of the post-populist condition to be able to compare it in a
   global and comparative perspective.},

   disputes through labour Law jurisdiction or by alternative methods of
   conflict resolution (ADR).
   Access to justice is evolving dramatically, having shown the capacity of
   ICT and ADR to meet social demand of justice.
   Mediation has conquered collective labour relations sector and is now
   starting to play a crucial role in the resolution of individual labour
   conflicts, as the parties right to resolve their disputes through
   suitable and informal means.},

Month = {SEP-DEC},
Abstract = {When the institutional forms of politics are in crisis, the question of
   power, or better, of powers arises. The system has such a degree of
   complexity and incoherence that the classical logic and paradigms of
   modernity - while persisting and producing effects - change deeply and
   do not exhaust the understanding of a politics that always exceeds its
   canonical places. Therefore, power itself requires rethinking. A change
   of perspective is possible by using the Foucauldian genealogical
   approach that is able to see the real relationships of power that
   organize truth and discursive practices. In the modern age a
   governmental turn of power emerges that has a relational, transitive and
   productive nature, irreducible to the paradigm of sovereignty. The pivot
   of power/governmentality is the ambivalence of the subjectivation it
   produces. An ambivalence that increases in the current neoliberal
   political rationality, as it takes an organizational and fully
   biopolitical form. The unstable field of relationships, over-conditioned
   by the market device - if not forced to a rationalization of
   governmentality itself - opens up spaces of potential resistance and
   fissures that the genealogical approach makes visible.},

Abstract = {The term populism' has gained renewed prominence in Greece during the
   Eurozone crisis, in both public and academic debates. In this article I
   conceptualize populism as a discourse of territorial and temporal
   particularism, which challenges the way a state has been incorporated
   into the international political and economic system. Based on this
   definition, I question whether oppositional discourses employed by
   partisan actors or official power are wholesale and genuine expressions
   of populism. Thus, I contest the notion that Greece failed due to
   populism. Instead I draw attention to a failure in the official
   legitimation of modernization by state elites that long preceded the
   crisis.},

Abstract = {Ever since the launch of the multilateral framework at the end of the
   1980s, EU-GCC relations have experienced many ups and downs, although a
   marked downward trend has most recently kicked in. Within the context of
   new regional circumstances following the outbreak of the Arab uprisings,
   EU-GCC relations run the risk of becoming totally irrelevant. This is
   due to growing polarization within the GCC itself and the emergence of
   (so far competing) EU-Iran relations, despite still existing obstacles.
   Taking stock of what has been achieved and of the strategic motivations
   to work together on a number of dossiers is of utmost importance to be
   able to re-lanuch EU-GCC relations on more solid grounds.},

Abstract = {M.K. Gandhi was the undisputed leader of India's struggle for
   independence. Yet his vision for postcolonial India was completely
   marginalized at the moment of decolonization. The article takes this
   seemingly paradoxical juncture as the vantage point from which to offer
   a critique of Gandhi's political thought and more broadly an analysis of
   the shift from anticolonial movements to postcolonial rule. Through the
   voices of Gandhi's two most significant contemporary critics-B.R.
   Ambedkar and Jawaharlal Nehru-the article shows how his ideas failed to
   either inspire the struggle of the ruled (Ambedkar), or address the
   anxieties of the would-be rulers (Nehru). Gandhi's vision for a
   postcolonial India persisted within the conceptual constellation of
   negating colonial modernity, rather than the historical possibilities of
   postcolonial futures. These predicaments provide an opportunity to
   analyze the persistence of modern western political imaginaries in the
   decolonized world. Not through mere assertions of continuity or mimicry,
   but rather through the concrete struggles, aspirations, and anxieties
   that constituted the strands of those transitional moments.},

   Conflict from a Survey of Mayors},

Abstract = {Previous scholarship on American federalism has largely focused on the
   national government's increasingly conflictual relationship with the
   states. While some studies have explored the rise of mandates at the
   state level, there has been comparatively less attention on state-local
   relationships. Using a new survey of mayors, we explore variations in
   local government attitudes towards their state governments. We find some
   evidence that, regardless of partisanship, mayors in more conservative
   states are unhappy about state funding and-especially-regulations. More
   strikingly, we also uncover a partisan mismatch in which Democratic
   mayors provide especially negative ratings of their state's funding
   and-even more strongly-regulations. These findings have important
   implications for state-local relations as cities continue to become more
   Democratic and Republicans increasingly dominate state-level contests.},

Abstract = {Is party ``ownership{''} of issues and traits manifest in the minds of
   voters in ways that could generate the oft-hypothesized implications for
   mass and elite electoral behavior? We specify two ways in which it may
   be: party reputations refer to the association of a trait or issue with
   a party; candidate stereotyping requires that party labels prompt
   differential assignment of attributes or competencies to candidates. We
   develop a quantitative measure of both ownership types, and apply it to
   issues and traits. New national survey data provide the first evidence
   that party reputation ownership exists for issues and traits. New
   experimental tests reveal evidence of candidate stereotyping for issues,
   but not traits. Voters associate some traits more with one party, but
   may not assign them to candidates based upon party label, demonstrating
   a key difference in the nature and likely implications of issue and
   trait ownership.},

Abstract = {This article addresses the characteristic styles and modes of
   self-presentation used by such Victorian public moralists and
   intellectuals as William Morris, John Ruskin and Matthew Arnold in both
   their writing and in their appearances as public lecturers: these were
   all interventions that were aimed at provoking an audience into
   intellectual consideration and self-reflection. The article examines how
   questions about the style of these figures have shaped the response to
   their work both at the time and in the years since their deaths;
   thinking about why, in Raymond Williams's words, they have produced
   `mixed feelings of respect and suspicion'. It considers how their
   versions of the combination of intellectual and public life could be
   thought about in our post-financial crisis present, at a moment when
   late nineteenth century debates about `the elites and the masses' are
   re-emerging, but where also the figure of the intellectual is taking on
   a renewed interest as one possible point of encounter between these
   forces.},

Abstract = {I informally examine how the idea of public sociology has been affected
   by the rise of social media. New social media platforms disintermediate
   communication, make people more visible, and encourage public life to be
   measured. They tend to move the discipline from a situation where some
   people self-consciously do ``public sociology{''} to one where more
   sociologists unselfconsciously do sociology in public. I discuss the
   character of such ``latently public{''} work, the opportunities and
   difficulties it creates for individuals, and its tendency to be
   associated with academic fields that believe in what they are doing.},

Volume = {23},

Abstract = {Content analyses of televised debates indicate that candidates often
   attack each other. Unfortunately, we know very little about when
   candidates go negative. Furthermore, most research is focusing on the
   United States. This paper contributes in several ways to our
   understanding of when candidates choose negative messages. First, we
   identify some previously unnoticed factors and assign them to three
   broad categories: a candidate's (personal and political) profile, the
   debate format, and the strategic context of a debate. Second, we use a
   unique data set based on all German televised debates. Third, we run
   multivariate models to investigate which variables are responsible for
   the use of attacks. Our results indicate that attacks are very popular.
   Candidates attack if they belong to the opposition, if they compete at
   the national level, and if they are behind in the polls. In addition,
   personality can affect the use of attacks.},

Abstract = {Scholars of distributive politics in Japan have shifted from large items
   in the general account budget to more geographically targeted spending
   known as intergovernmental transfers. However, a portion of the funds
   sent to prefectural governments are ostensibly determined by the
   apolitical `financial index'. However, even though the financial index
   is included in most studies of intergovernmental transfers, only slight
   attention focuses on the financial index and its determination. Using
   prefectural level data on intergovernmental transfers, economic
   indicators and electoral support for the LDP, this research shows that
   the LDP possesses strong incentives to manipulate the index and that
   politics is a significant determinant of the financial index.},

Abstract = {One Nation made a remarkable comeback in Australian politics in 2016,
   securing four senate seats in the 2016 federal elections. This comeback
   was immediately attributed to growing hardship among ordinary
   hard-working Australian ``battlers{''} or ``losers of globalization{''},
   who, so the argument typically goes, are doing it tough financially
   since the Global Financial Crisis. What such accounts overlook is
   growing evidence showing personal income is a poor predictor for
   populist voting. A recent survey revealed that this also applies to One
   Nation voting. More specifically, what is being overlooked is a growing
   body of research showing that both, hardship (relative deprivation) and
   affluence (relative gratification) can increase the appeal of
   anti-immigration messages. In this paper we review the literature
   examining the link between affluence and populist voting, and urge
   researchers examining the appeal of populist parties to account for
   both, relative deprivation and relative gratification processes.},

Title = {From May's Laws to May's legacy: On the opinion structure within
   political parties},
Journal = {PARTY POLITICS},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {23},
Number = {5},
Pages = {471-486},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {For over 40 years now, the debate on the hierarchical opinion structure
   within political parties has been colored by May's laws of General and
   Special curvilinear disparity. Their essence is that, compared to
   non-leaders and top leaders, the mid-level of sub-leaders of parties
   consists of radicals as regards their ideological, substantive
   positions. Persistent as this vision is, however, there have been few
   comprehensive empirical tests. In this paper such a test is employed for
   Dutch parties, consisting of: a) a comparison of average positions on
   issues and in terms of left and right of voters, members and MPs; b) a
   comparison of the full opinion distributions on particular political
   issues for these groups; and c) an exploration of perceptions among top
   leaders and sub-leaders of the opinion structure within their party. We
   conclude that there is not enough support to uphold May's laws any
   longer. His laws should be dismissed, but May's legacy should consist of
   a more open study of the opinion structures of parties, which are still
   crucial actors in Western representative democracies.},

   frequency of cyber attacks across the world The core of the discussion
   focused on the cyber defense capabilities and resilience of the NATO
   Alliance, after which important perspectives from Estonia, Israel, and
   Turkey were provided The speakers emphasized that the ambiguity of the
   risks posed by cyberspace and the lack of a body of international laws
   in the cyber context renders it all the more difficult to address
   challenges in a cohesive way. The speakers also stressed the importance
   of greater cooperation between the public and private sectors in
   confronting cyber attacks. Lastly, strengthening cyber literacy across
   all sectors is becoming an unavoidable necessity.},

Abstract = {How do electoral institutions affect legislative behavior? Though a
   large body of theoretical scholarship posits a negative relationship
   between multimember districting and the provision of particularistic
   goods, empirical scholarship has found little evidence in support of
   this expectation. Using data on the provision of US post offices from
   1876 to 1896, a period during which many states elected congressional
   representatives from at-large districts, and a
   differences-in-differences approach, I find that counties represented by
   at-large representatives received approximately 8\% fewer post offices.
   The results have important implications for studying how electoral
   institutions affect incentives for legislative behavior.},

Abstract = {Women know stuff. Yet, all too often, they are underrepresented in
   political science meetings, syllabi, and editorial boards. To counter
   the implicit bias that leads to women's underrepresentation, to ensure
   that women's expertise is included and shared, and to improve the
   visibility of women in political science, in February 2016 we launched
   the ``Women Also Know Stuff{''} initiative, which features a
   crowd-sourced website and an active Twitter feed. In this article, we
   share the origins of our project, the effect we are already having on
   media utilization of women experts, and plans for how to expand that
   success within the discipline of political science. We also share our
   personal reflections on the project.},

Abstract = {Whether there has been a central sation of power towards the first
   minister and her entourage of courtiers during the 20th century is a
   contentious issue among scholars of parliamentary systems. A principle
   reason for the endurance of this debate is the absence of empirical
   indicators that can be compared over time. This article contributes to
   this research by examining a primary means the centre is believed to
   have increased its control: the appointment of administrative elites.
   Using an original data set of deputy minister turnover in Canada's
   provincial bureaucracies from 1920 to 2013, this article tests whether
   the relationship between a change in the first minister and bureaucratic
   mobility has shifted over time. Consistent with the centralisation of
   power thesis, the results show that the level of mobility following a
   transition in the first minister and party has increased since 1980.
   Moreover, whereas before 1980 only a change in first minister alongside
   a transition in party leads to increased mobility, since then, mobility
   increases alongside all newly elected first ministers, regardless of
   party change. This relationship is riot found among unelected first
   ministers, who are believed to have a different relationship with
   cabinet and party members than elected first ministers.},

Abstract = {This note illustrates a new method for making causal inferences with
   ecological data. We show how to combine aggregate outcomes with
   individual demographics from separate data sources to make causal
   inferences about individual behavior. In addressing such problems, even
   under the selection on observables assumption often made in the
   treatment effects literature, it is not possible to identify causal
   effects of interest. However, recent results from the partial
   identification literature provide sharp bounds on these causal effects.
   We apply these bounds to data from Chilean mayoral elections that
   straddle a 2012 change in Chilean electoral law from compulsory to
   voluntary voting. Aggregate voting outcomes are combined with individual
   demographic information from separate data sources to determine the
   causal effect of the change in the law on voter turnout. The bounds
   analysis reveals that voluntary voting decreased expected voter turnout,
   and that other causal effects are overstated if the bounds analysis is
   ignored.},

Volume = {32},

Month = {JUL-DEC},
Abstract = {University education policy implemented by the Venezuelan State since
   1999 has given the citizens in general perception is mostly prepared to
   intervene in its next decision-making, which influences their sense of
   political self-efficacy or beliefs that determine its future development
   in civic life, in this sense, the purpose of this paper is to describe
   the way education policy deployed from 1999-2013 at the university level
   has been subverting the political construct of self-efficacy in people.
   The methodology used for the realization of it is descriptive
   documentary following for this purpose the analysis scheme proposed by
   Oszlak and O'Donnell (1981), who report that the approach of government
   policy has to focus its emergence from, development and outcome or
   possible consequences. Among its most significant approaches noted that
   there are some decisions of the university education sector where
   citizens come to see that their action will have an effect on what
   happens or could happen, so you get to increase their involvement, so it
   is concluded that such experiences enhance self-efficacy of Venezuelan
   politics..},

Abstract = {Studies on participation in voluntary civic associations show a positive
   relationship with political participation. This work examines whether
   the type of participation (voluntary or not) is related to the level of
   interest in socio-political issues in the same way. To that aim, it uses
   evidences from the case of Japan. The results suggest that the
   distinction between voluntary and non-voluntary participation is
   especially relevant for men. Likewise, the results indicate that the
   resource variables of the civic voluntarism model seem to be the most
   strongly related to the interest in politics; but the same pattern is
   not followed in the case of women.},

Abstract = {This study aims to provide theoretical and empirical clarity on whether
   people in ``new'' and precarious self-employment support the same
   political parties as those in traditional forms. Theoretical clarity is
   needed as the voting literature predominantly perceives self-employment
   in terms of class-based theories or insider/outsider theories, i.e., as
   a privileged grouping with shared interests as (potential) employers.
   Alternative perspectives, looking into the heterogeneity and
   precarization of self-employment have received less attention.
   Empirically, quantitative data are needed: Previous voting studies have
   not been able to differentiate the self-employed, either due to the lack
   of relevant indicators or because of low-N problems. Focusing on the
   Netherlands, this study addresses these shortcomings by analyzing data
   among over 800 self-employed without employees, using the Solo
   Self-Employment Panel. This study finds that the simple association
   between self-employment and rightist orientations is largely an
   oversimplification, and for growing segments of self-employment even a
   misrepresentation.},

Abstract = {This research examines the partisan inclinations of American Indians, a
   minority population with a complicated history with the U.S. government
   and American society. The empirical analyses identify Native Americans
   as preferring the Democratic Party over the Republican Party. The impact
   of being Native American on identification with the Democratic Party is
   sizable, equivalent to the effect for being Hispanic, Asian, or female.
   In addition, American Indians demonstrate a pronounced tendency to not
   affiliate with a major American political party. The higher incidence of
   non-identification among Native Americans likely results from the
   importance of their claims for sovereignty and, relatedly, living
   separate from much of American society. Unlike other broad-based social
   groups in American politics, Native Americans disseminate cues that
   reduce the tendency of their members to affiliate with a major political
   party.},

Abstract = {The government of Thailand attempts to alleviate rice farmers' poverty
   through several public programs. One of the government's assistance
   programs is support for rice production. The 1,000 baht per rai program
   aims to redistribute public money to help poor rice farmers reduce their
   production and cultivation costs. In implementation, however, this
   program suffers from inequality in granting access to the government's
   assistance program. This paper aims to explain the pattern of inequality
   in this government assistance program for rice farmers in rural
   Thailand. Conducting field research in the northern, southern, and
   central regions, the study found that rich rice farmers and landlords
   had more opportunity to access the government's assistance program than
   poor rice farmers and tenants. This has contributed to the state of
   inequality among rice farmers. The government should revise how the
   program is implemented and should limit this inequality among the
   beneficiaries.},

Abstract = {We develop a model of leadership in which an informed leader has some
   degree of coercive influence over her followers(agents). Agents benefit
   from coordination but face two distinct challenges: dispersed
   information and heterogeneous preferences. The leader's coercive power
   facilitates coordination by weakening the effect presented by both of
   these challenges through binding agents to a strategically chosen
   policy. The leader's policy choice becomes more informative to the
   agents about the leader's privately held information as her coercive
   capacity increases. By adjusting her policy choice in response to
   available private and public information, the coercive leader achieves
   her preferred average of agents' actions, and in so doing, neutralizes
   the possibly deleterious coordinating influence of public information.
   We develop implications of our analysis for understanding autocratic
   leadership in different political and organizational contexts.},

Abstract = {Spontaneous urban occupations or organized in housing for struggle are
   usually seen as a part of the underground city. On its residents weigh
   the prejudice of being opportunistic, contrary to the order of the city
   and what is worse, to bring into the public safety risk. However,
   looking closely at the social and legal facts which we discover is that
   cities have become a commodity, so there is no room for the dispossessed
   of the land. The best urban spaces have been for those who can pay for
   it or those who benefit from legislation designed to exactly match your
   interests. Public resources should be allocated to urban policies in
   order to minimize social ills, they are appropriated by the owners of
   capital by spurious means, although supported by law.},

Abstract = {Why do some declining industries receive more compensation through
   protectionist policies than others, even without actively engaging in
   lobbying? How does the political representation of industries affect
   their chances for protectionist relief? This paper argues that political
   parties seek to optimize electoral returns through the strategic
   allocation of distributive benefits generated by trade barriers. The
   inter-industry structure of protection is thus explained by the
   interaction between industries' trade preferences and political
   characteristics. Using data on protection and subnational employment for
   US industries and district-level election outcomes in the 1990s, this
   paper finds that the concentration of industries in competitive
   constituencies not only increases their chances of receiving higher
   tariffs, but also magnifies the marginal effect of comparative
   disadvantage on tariff and nontariff protection.},

Abstract = {From the beginnings of our history women and peace have been closely
   linked. This union has been especially important in the case of the
   peace movement, which have ever counted with a huge presence of women.
   Due to this special connection between women and peace, even there has
   been formed many women peace movements. In these women movements
   nonviolence has been the best way to achieve their goals and to announce
   their purposes in a very original and creative way. Nonviolent
   methodologies are, therefore, one of the most interesting and unknown
   aspects of these movement. This is why we decided to focus our research
   in the nonviolent methodologies of four peace movements from different
   countries (Serbia, Colombia, United States and Liberia). Our aim was to
   identify, analyze, describe and systematize their nonviolent
   methodologies, as well as compare them and inquire into their results.},

Abstract = {A method for predicting conflict zones in civil wars based on point
   process models is presented in this paper. Instead of testing the
   validity of specific theoretical conjectures about the determinants of
   violence in a causal framework, this paper builds on classic literature
   and a wide body of recent studies to predict conflict zones based on a
   series of geographic conditions. Using an innovative cross-validation
   design, the study shows that the quantitative research program on the
   micro-foundations of violence in civil conflict has crafted
   generalizable insights permitting out-of-sample predictions of conflict
   zones. The study region is delimited to ten countries in Sub-Saharan
   Africa that experienced full-blown insurgencies in the post-Cold War
   era.},

Abstract = {Theories of voting rights differ quite sharply with regard to whether or
   not they support (rapid) enfranchisement of irregular immigrants. In
   this paper, we first outline these theories and their implications. We
   then assess a number of reasons against rapidly enfranchising irregular
   immigrants. We find, on reflection, that none of these reasons are
   persuasive. While this result is not in itself sufficient to draw strong
   conclusions, it does offer some support to the more inclusive theories
   of voting rights, and poses a challenge to the less inclusive ones.},

Abstract = {While a large body of research exists regarding the role of industry
   money on roll-call voting in the U.S. Congress, there is surprisingly
   little scholarship pertaining to industry influence on state politics.
   This study fills this void in an analysis of campaign donations and
   voting during passage of Act 13 in Pennsylvania during 2011 and 2012.
   After collecting information about natural gas production in state
   legislative districts, we estimate a series of multivariate models aimed
   at uncovering whether campaign donations contributed to a more favorable
   policy outcome for industry. Our findings indicate that campaign
   donations played a small but systematic role in consideration of the
   controversial legislation, which represented one of the first and most
   important state-level regulatory reforms for the hydraulic fracturing
   industry.},

Abstract = {This article argues that neo-authoritarian regimes - meaning those
   autocratic regimes that emerged after the end of the Cold War and during
   the fourth wave of democratisation - do not recur to ideology for
   legitimising their regime as totalitarian regimes in the 20(th) century
   did. Three objectives will be pursued on a conceptual level: firstly, to
   make a case for a narrow notion of ideology that includes the
   theoretical findings of classic 20th century totalitarianism research
   and is linked to the totalitarian subtype. Secondly, to argue that
   Linz's feature of mentality is lacking discriminatory power for being an
   analytical category covering the legitimation basis of authoritarian
   regimes. And finally, thirdly, to introduce `mission' as a concept that
   is defined as analytically different from ideology and characterises the
   legitimation efforts of authoritarian regimes in order to secure their
   persistence. An explorative analysis looks at the construction of such
   missions in three cases: Venezuela, Russia and China.},

Abstract = {Drawing on vignettes from fieldwork in Andhra Pradesh, the article
   explores how political pressures shape bureaucratic practices around the
   government's flagship Janmabhoomi programme. It argues that competitive
   state politics manifests in clientelist-populist voter mobilization
   leading to two-level political pressures-state politicians pressure
   higher bureaucracy which in turn pressures the lower bureaucracy tasked
   with implementation, and local politicians allied with the governing
   party put direct pressures on lower bureaucracy for favouritism. Lower
   level bureaucrats cope with these impossible pressures by subverting
   official procedures, so that actual practices hardly match the rational
   Weberian construction in official documents. The article's contribution
   lies in linking the `political game' and the `bureaucratic game' in a
   grounded empirical context.},

Title = {Crossing Borders: Mexican State Practices, Managing Migration, and the
   Construction of ``Unsafe{''} Travelers},
Journal = {LATIN AMERICAN POLICY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {8},
Number = {1},
Pages = {5-26},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {This article focuses on Mexican state practices dealing with
   immigration. It analyzes how the Mexican state has generated new
   governmentalities toward border crossings, thereby creating new
   (securitized) subjectivities, and to what extent such governmentalities
   have been the result of unequal relations with its northern neighbors
   versus a response to more locally driven needs. It focuses particularly
   on the changes since 9/11 and the Calderon Government's War on Organized
   Crime, both of which have engendered new dynamics in North American
   relations, bringing out the tensions and contradictions about security
   concerns; mobility of goods, services and people; and free-trade-driven
   regionalism. The ensuing regional focus on security and regulating the
   mobility of travelers, categorizing them into safe and potentially
   ``unsafe{''} subjects, and migrants who are being ``managed{''} through
   temporary worker programs have turned Mexico into a buffer state
   protecting regional North American interests. Despite its role as a
   buffer, the Mexican state is also ``performing{''} its own sovereignty
   and following its priorities and needs, which do not necessarily
   coincide with those of its northern neighbor. This article analyzes
   these tensions in Mexico between being a buffer state and articulating
   its own priorities, particularly against the background of the War on
   Terror initiated by the United States, the War on Organized Crime, and
   the continuing economic crisis of 2009. The Mexican state has undergone
   significant modernization in terms of its border-control capacities,
   thus enhancing its capacity as a buffer state while enhancing its
   performative sovereignty. Second, the paper analyzes how these
   transformations have affected the mobility of ``ordinary{''} travelers
   and migrants.},

Title = {Between regional community and global society: Europe in the shadow of

Abstract = {While celebrated for bringing peace and prosperity to the region,
   European integration has been recently challenged by various internal
   and external crises that call the progressivist narrative of ever
   closerand largerunion into question. Torn between regional community and
   global society, particularism and cosmopolitanism, and politics and
   technocracy, the European Union appears beset by fundamental tensions.
   In search of a different theoretical perspective on the crisis, some
   commentators have drawn on Carl Schmitt's political theory to emphasize
   key issues concerning political decisions, identities, and boundaries in
   Europe. Yet, Schmitt comes with his own blind spots. For the purpose of
   a critical engagement with Schmitt's potential insights and their
   limits, this article contrasts his approach with that of his
   contemporary Alexandre Kojeve, who envisioned the integration of world
   society through economy, law, technology, and administration, a
   perspective not unfamiliar to the original story of European
   integration. In reconsidering the dialectic between Schmitt's and
   Kojeve's positions, this article goes beyond their apparent
   contradictions and discusses attempts by both authors to reconcile the
   opposition, from Kojeve's move to Empires to Schmitt's theory of the
   union, thereby illuminating deep-seated dilemmas of contemporary
   European politics which fundamentally condition its trajectory between
   contestation and re-constitution.},

Abstract = {Recent literature on income distribution in Mexico has found evidence of
   underestimation in inequality. There is a growing consensus that
   household surveys in Mexico do not capture total household income, but
   there is no consensus on a methodological proposal to estimate a
   more-realistic distribution. This article offers a proposal for
   adjusting household income, crossing information from household surveys,
   national accounts, economic censuses, and tax incidence from the Tax
   Administration System. It shows evidence of a high, persistent
   income-distribution inequality, with emphasis on factorial and
   intracompany inequality. The usual adjustment implies that entire
   average income increases, but this article identifies the main cause of
   underestimation in distribution, focusing on noncaptured capital income
   in the wealthiest households surveyed.},

Abstract = {This piece analyzes the subject Time of Vote Choice in India, a hitherto
   under-researched aspect of voting behaviour in the country. Using
   longitudinal data from National Election Studies conducted by Lokniti
   between 1996 and 2014, it shows that voting intentions of India's voters
   are increasingly crystallizing before the start of the campaign period
   of an election. On the other hand, the proportion of voters postponing
   their vote choice to after the start of a campaign has declined over the
   last two decades. This declining trend is unique to India as most
   Western democracies have registered an overtime increase in
   campaign-period decision-making. While Indian voters who are less
   political, less partisan and less exposed to media are more likely to be
   late deciders than early ones, nevertheless, we also find that late
   deciders-both campaign-period and last-minute-have gradually become more
   politically sophisticated and attentive over the years. In this respect,
   our findings validate both the traditional floating voter theory of the
   Columbia School and some of the newer studies that have countered it.},

Abstract = {A growing number of political scientists have recently advocated the
   theses that democracy has emerged as a universal value and that it is
   also becoming the universally preferred system of government. Do most
   people in East Asia prefer democracy to nondemocratic systems, as
   advocates of these Western theses claim? Do they embrace liberal
   democracy as the most preferred system as they become socioeconomically
   modernized and culturally liberalized? To address these questions, we
   first propose a typology of privately concealed political system
   preferences as a new conceptual tool in order to ascertain their types
   and subtypes without using the word ``democracy''. By means of this
   typology, we analyze the third wave of the Asian Barometer Survey
   conducted in 12 democratic and nondemocratic countries. The analysis
   reveals that a hybrid system, not liberal democracy, is the most
   preferred system even among the culturally liberalized and
   socioeconomically modernized segments of the East Asian population. Our
   results show that the increasingly popular theses of universal and
   liberal democratization serve merely in East Asia as prodemocracy
   rhetoric, not as theoretically meaningful propositions.},

Abstract = {Since the 1980s, Western Europe has experienced the surge of populist
   radical right parties. In an attempt to ward off these electoral
   newcomers, established parties have pursued strategies of disengagement,
   such as exclusion and de-legitimisation. This study examines the
   electoral effects of an excessive form of de-legitimisation, which we
   label `demonisation'. We estimate the effects of demonisation on
   electoral support for the Dutch Freedom Party (PVV) and its predecessor
   Groep Wilders. Time series analyses show that demonisation has a
   negative effect on electoral support, but only for Groep Wilders. Once
   the populist radical right party has made a successful entry into the
   party system, demonisation does not have its intended consequences. (C)

Abstract = {This paper brings theoretical and empirical contributions to the
   scholarship on dimensions of politics in Europe. On the theoretical side
   it emphasizes the differences between Western and Eastern countries; we
   argue that while in Western Europe the main dimension of political
   conflict is the economic left-right, in Eastern Europe the main
   dimension is more likely to encompass cultural issues associated
   primarily with what in the Western literature is known as the secondary,
   social left-right. We trace the origin of the difference to the 1990s
   when parties in Eastern Europe chose to emphasize cultural issues to
   appeal to an electorate unfamiliar with capitalist economics and
   dissatisfied with the economic left associated with Communism and the
   economic right associated with painful reforms. To test this assertion
   we apply the Optimal Classification vote scaling method to an original
   dataset of over 24,000 votes from 22 European parliaments; the
   statistical tests support the hypothesis.},

Abstract = {Since 1965, Britain's major political parties have radically, and
   repeatedly, changed the ways in which they choose their leaders.
   Building on Cross and Blais' (Party Politics 18(2): 127-150, 2012a)
   recent comparative study of party leadership selection in the five
   principal Anglophone ('Westminster') parliamentary democracies, this
   article first outlines a theoretical framework that purports to explain
   why the major parties in three of those countries, including Britain,
   have adopted such reform. It then examines why five major British
   parties have done so since 1965. It argues that, while Cross and Blais'
   study makes a significant contribution to our knowledge and
   understanding of processes of party leadership selection reform in
   Anglophone parliamentary democracies, it has limited explanatory power
   when applied to changes enacted by the major parties in modem and
   contemporary Britain. Instead, the adoption of such reform in the
   British context is ultimately best understood and explained by examining
   both the internal politics and external circumstances of individual
   parties.},

Abstract = {Is policy representation in contemporary Westminster systems solely a
   function of programmatic national parties, or does the election of
   legislators via single-member districts result in MPs whose policy
   positions are individually responsive to public opinion in their
   constituencies? We generate new measures of constituency opinion in
   Britain and show that, in three different policy domains and controlling
   for MP party, the observed legislative behavior of MPs is indeed
   responsive to constituency opinion. The level of responsiveness is
   moderate, but our results do suggest a constituency-MP policy bond that
   operates in addition to the well-known bond between voters and parties.},

Abstract = {Some institutional arrangements may be undesirable for democracy by
   obscuring which political actors are to be held responsible for failed
   or successful policies and bad or good macroeconomic performances. Much
   of the work in the area has focused on whether institutions affect the
   clarity of political responsibility' and the ability of voters to punish
   or reward, in turn, governments and elected officials. Not much has been
   said, however, about the assignment of responsibility outside the
   electoral context, for a broad range of policy areas. This paper
   explores these questions in the context of French semi-presidentialism.
   It demonstrates that the French public is surprisingly quite responsive
   to the demands imposed by their political system by adjusting reasonably
   well their evaluations of both actors of the executive in light of major
   political events and changes in the economic conditions when the
   circumstances clearly indicate which of the two is in charge'. At other
   times, however, this particular institutional arrangement obscures
   instead political responsibility.},

Abstract = {Every year at the United Nations (UN), member states deliver statements
   during the General Debate (GD) discussing major issues in world
   politics. These speeches provide invaluable information on governments'
   perspectives and preferences on a wide range of issues, but have largely
   been overlooked in the study of international politics. This paper
   introduces a new dataset consisting of over 7300 country statements from
   1970-2014. We demonstrate how the UN GD corpus (UNGDC) can be used as a
   resource from which country positions on different policy dimensions can
   be derived using text analytic methods. The article provides
   applications of these estimates, demonstrating the contribution the
   UNGDC can make to the study of international politics.},

Journal = {ACTA POLITICA},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {52},
Number = {2},
Pages = {198-217},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {In this study, we examine the role of social trust as an individual and
   a neighborhood-level determinant for radical right-wing populist party
   preferences. We argue that high social trust decreases radical
   right-wing populist party preferences and that this relationship is
   essentially mediated by negative attitudes toward immigrants. Using data
   from the Netherlands' Life Course Study, we employ multilevel structural
   equation modeling to test our argument on support for the Party for
   Freedom (PVV). The results reveal that individual social trust decreases
   radical right-wing populist party preferences. Beyond the micro-level
   relationship, we find that neighborhood social trust decreases radical
   right-wing populist party preferences. In either case, the effects are
   mediated by anti-immigrant sentiments. Our findings provide evidence for
   the importance of social trust as a multilevel construct in explanations
   for radical right-wing populist party preferences.},

Abstract = {We model a procedural reform aimed at restoring a proper role for the
   minority in the confirmation process of judicial nominations in the US
   Senate. We propose that nominations to the same level court be collected
   in periodic lists and voted upon individually with storable votes,
   allowing each senator to allocate freely across the list a fixed number
   of total votes. Although each nomination is decided by simple majority,
   storable votes make it possible for the minority to win occasionally,
   but only when the relative importance its members assign to a nomination
   is higher than the relative importance assigned by the majority.
   Numerical simulations approximate the composition of the 113th and 114th
   Senates. Under plausible assumptions motivated by a game theoretic
   model, we find that a minority of 45 senators would be able to win about
   20 percent of confirmation battles when the majority party controls the
   presidency, and between 40 and 60 percent when the president identifies
   with the minority party. For most parameter values, the possibility of
   minority victories increases aggregate welfare.},

Abstract = {This article explains failures of politics and government through the
   incompetence of voters and their perception biases. It illustrates this
   argument using the French case. If voters lack knowledge and develop
   irrational beliefs, then voting is probably not effective as a mechanism
   for sanctioning public policy. The incompetence of French voters and
   their anti-capitalist bias is well documented. This incompetence can be
   partly explained by the low cost of holding irrational beliefs in
   politics. Voters' anti-capitalist attitudes are explained by the utility
   they obtain from expressing themselves in favour of state intervention,
   and by France's prohibitive level of justification costs of holding
   pro-capitalist views. The resulting biases contribute to the failure of
   public choice.},

   free trade agreements},
Journal = {GLOBAL SOCIAL POLICY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {17},
Number = {1},
Pages = {38-61},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Whereas a number of studies have been conducted to investigate causal
   relations between individual conditions (e.g. trade relations and labour
   standards), there is a lack of consensus among practitioners and
   scholars about the conditions that favour or cause labour standards
   improvements and, specifically, it is still unclear whether the
   increasing pervasiveness of Free Trade Agreements (FTAs) is conducive to
   enhancing labour conditions. The aim of this study is to shed light on
   whether labour clauses in FTAs are conducive to better labour standard
   practices, whether the content of a clause makes a difference, and
   whether changes have anything to do with other (external) pressures that
   play a role in changing labour standards. The main argument of the
   article is that FTAs do not play a determinant role in improving labour
   standards in signatory states. The analysis is done by looking at 13
   FTAs signed by the United States with 19 countries. The United States is
   chosen because of its relatively extensive collection of FTAs including
   different conditions on labour standards. The empirical dataset is
   analysed with Qualitative Comparative Analysis (QCA) method, which
   permits to trace the combined effect of independent variables rather
   than to focus on the direct and individual causality with each of them.},

Abstract = {This article examines the impact of the secret ballot on the market for
   votes at parliamentary elections in the 19th-century United Kingdom. I
   use a formal model of an exchange between a candidate and a voter to
   predict the impact of the secret ballot on bribe prices, the marginal
   effect campaign spending on candidates' electoral prospects, and
   election turnout. I test these predictions against original data on
   bribe prices and campaign expenditures at over 500 parliamentary
   elections. The results are consistent with the argument that the secret
   ballot induced British parliamentary candidates to divert their campaign
   spending away from vote-buying and toward turnout-buying. These results
   point to the adaptability of political actors in the face of
   institutional changes.},

Abstract = {Why is it that new democracies have difficulty generating income
   equality? This article argues that low voter turnout and weak political
   party system institutionalization increase targeted spending. This in
   turn has an effect on income inequality because social spending rewards
   privileged social groups to the detriment of the disadvantaged. The
   argument is tested across six new and fifteen long-standing democracies
   in Europe using a panel-data analysis. It finds that low turnout by the
   poor and weak party institutionalization increase targeted spending,
   which in turn decreases economic equality. The analysis also finds that
   high voter turnout moderates the negative effect of electoral volatility
   on targeted spending.},

Abstract = {Despite the popularity of using games to teach international relations,
   few works directly assess their effectiveness. Furthermore, it is
   unclear if games help all students equally, or if certain students are
   more likely to benefit than others. Finally, how closely the game must
   mirror the concept being taught to be an effective pedagogical tool has
   received scant attention. We address these points by discussing the use
   of an updated version of the classic American election game, Consensus,
   to help illustrate the role of domestic political coalitions in an
   international political economy course. Assessing the performance of 39
   students via a pre- and post-quiz, we find that student performance
   improved overall, particularly among frequent gamers.},

Abstract = {As markets evolve, new regulatory concerns emerge. In response, policy
   makers institute new requirements for private businesses. Because they
   impose costs and generate uncertainty, these requirements may deter firm
   investment. To reduce regulatory uncertainty and favor investment, a
   principal can choose a rule-based regulatory framework. However, unlike
   discretion, rules do not adapt to circumstances and are thus
   inefficient. Using a micro-founded model, we uncover circumstances under
   which the ex ante certainty provided by a rule dominates the ex post
   efficiency provided by delegation to an unbiased agent. We also
   establish when delegating to a biased agent is optimal for a policy
   maker. Our main results highlight that the anticipated economic
   responses of firms can indirectly influence the organization of the
   bureaucracy. As such, any attempt to evaluate firms' direct influence in
   the rule-making processthrough lobbying or information disclosureneeds
   to establish the proper counterfactual that accounts for the indirect
   effects this article identifies.},

Abstract = {The EU referendum has raised questions about the nature of democracy,
   which is not just majority rule. It is wrong to claim that direct
   democracy has now replaced representative democracy, as Parliament is
   required to answer all the questions that the referendum did not. The
   conduct of the referendum reflected the worst aspects of Britain's
   political culture of sterile adversarialism. Both left and right have
   shared assumptions about governing that have made it difficult to
   develop a culture of democratic citizenship. The political system still
   reflects its pre-democratic origins (as in the survival of a House of
   Lords and the obsession with titles) and the role of money in politics
   represents a form of corruption. Institutional reforms depend for their
   success on the nurturing of a democratic culture, which is a task for
   many hands.},

Number = {2},
Pages = {208-215},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Peace agreements offer rule-based approaches, which distinguish from
   some variable peace processes and are manifested as establishing a legal
   peace. This legal peace is provided in the following forms:
   1) Peace agreements evaluate internal and external interactions for the
   legitimacy of government through distorting government and supporting
   human rights; a different composition of public and private
   (non-government) signatories;
   2) Peace agreements are common treaties riding over national (interior)
   and international legal issues;
   3) Different forms of legal commitments; peace agreements embraces both
   valid organizational regulations and contracts or pseudo-commitment
   contracts;
   4) Various third party agencies; peace agreements rely upon common law
   coalition government and contain multiple oppositions, common law and
   political mechanisms and their implementation. These various ways
   simultaneously reflect settlement ways of peace agreements. If legal
   issues are ignored and peace agreements are properly considered, they
   may be argued as a temporary international constitution. Peace
   agreements provide a powerful plan for governing; however, they are
   often minor and temporary requiring developed.},

Journal = {EUROPEAN POLITICAL SCIENCE},

Volume = {16},
Number = {1},

Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {This article explores the connection between time and political
   leadership within the institutional setting of the European Union (EU).
   The discussion first notes how time is linked to power, legitimacy and
   efficiency, and how time rules, time budgets and time horizons influence
   the potential for both institutional and individual leadership. Next,
   the article sets out core features of political time in the EU,
   discusses their implications for leadership and highlights the skilful
   handling of multiple times as a central leadership challenge. Leaders
   with larger, more predictable time budgets and more extended time
   horizons are in a privileged position as are those who enjoy discretion
   regarding the timing of their actions and who are able to act as
   time-setters. Increasingly, leaders in the supranational institutions of
   the EU - notably the Commission and the European Parliament - follow
   their own calendars. In the intergovernmental bodies, differences in
   executives' time budgets and horizons affect their leadership potential.},

Abstract = {The question of the Kurdish state and natural gas pipeline proposals are
   at the core of the power struggle among states key to Middle Eastern
   stability and global balance. The various friendship-hostility
   configurations between the US, Russia, Turkey, Syria, and Iran are
   analyzed to present how changes in the direction of the conflict and
   cooperation disturb the regional balance of power in the Syrian
   conflict. Given the stable hostility between the US and Russia, and the
   stable friendship between Russia and Syria, the Turkish preferences for
   coveting friendship and leaning toward enmity are central in the
   formation of balances. Conditions for Russo-Turkish rapprochement and
   the possibility of an overall friendship between Russia, Turkey, and
   Syria are also discussed. Iran's inclusion in the analysis reveals the
   possibility of a four-state front against the US. Furthermore, a
   competition or an agreement between the US and Russia over Kurdish
   independence in Syria implies a protracted conflict for years to come in
   the Middle East.},

Abstract = {Since the advent of democracy in 1994, South Africa has undergone an
   extensive process of state reform aimed at overcoming the legacy of
   Apartheid and at building a more egalitarian social and political order.
   Whilst progress has been made in reforming the state infrastructure, the
   pursuit of an inconsistent economic growth path has meant that
   inequality and poverty remain serious challenges to the social order.
   The inability of oversight institutions to control powerful political
   interest groups, furthermore, has led to the growth of public sector
   corruption and to power struggles within the ruling alliance. From a
   BRICS perspective this suggests that the current governance challenges
   in South Africa need to be taken into account when factoring in its
   future role in the partnership.},

Abstract = {The right to vote is a fundamental right of citizenship in democratic
   nations, and participation in elections in one of the most important
   acts undertaken by citizens. Although these rights are guaranteed to all
   citizens, international research shows that disabled people are widely
   excluded from participation in elections. Disabled people are less
   likely to vote than non-disabled people and often encounter various
   obstacles when they try to participate in elections. This article
   discusses the voting participation of disabled people in consideration
   of the international research. The main barriers that disabled people
   encounter in the voting process will first be outlined. This will be
   followed by questions concerning the effects these obstacles produce,
   not only for disabled citizens, but what this means overall for the
   health of democracy and democratic institutions when a portion of the
   citizenry encounter serious obstacles concerning their basic civil
   rights. Icelandic research in this field is extremely limited and no
   systematic statistical data exists on the participation of disabled
   people in elections, or politics in general, in this country. Based on
   data drawn from sources from two of the largest disabled people's
   organization in the country, the focus here is on the experiences,
   circumstances and opportunities for disabled people to participate in
   elections in the country. The findings draw attention to the obligations
   of the state to promote and ensure the participation of disabled people
   in politics and public life in light of the recent ratification in
   Iceland of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities
   (CRPD).},

Abstract = {This article presents a theory of reconciliation for postcolonial
   settler societies. It asks: what are the scope, substance and
   limitations of a normative theory of political reconciliation for
   historical wrongs in these societies? The article begins with an
   assessment of communitarian and agonistic theories and then outlines an
   alternative based on mutual respect, which includes three core elements:
   critical reflection, symbolic and material recognition, and political
   participation. The case of the United States and Native Americans is
   used to illustrate this alternative theory.},

   in terms of health and health policies using the Health System Framework
   of the WHO. It can be noted that the AK Party government has improved
   almost all components of Turkey's health system over the course of their
   15-year tenure. Furthermore, these improvements have contributed
   positively to the prosperity of Turkish society, particularly its health
   status indicators. What should be done next? It is important that the
   health care field be designed and continuously improved to create
   sustainable policies and strategies positively associated with the
   Health Transformation Program and to cope with dynamic challenges such
   as the ageing population, changes in disease prevalence, new

Number = {1},
Pages = {83-96},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {The prominence of colonization in Tocqueville's life and works has been
   widely noted, yet scholars disagree about its importance. The perceived
   tension between Tocqueville's analysis of democracy and his advocacy of
   colonization continues to be the subject of heated scholarly debate.
   Revisiting Tocqueville's analytical and practical engagement with
   colonization, this essay reexamines its relationship to Tocqueville's
   account of democracy. It argues that, while lending political support to
   the French empire, Tocqueville was a clairvoyant critic of colonial
   rule; and that his involvement with colonization could only be properly
   understood in light of the historical and civilizational vista that
   informs his oeuvre as a whole. Proposing that Tocqueville viewed
   European expansionism as an instrument of the global movement toward
   democratic equality, the essay concludes with an assessment of the
   significance of Tocqueville's colonial writings for his new political
   science, and their relevance today.},

Title = {Ideas and agency in immigration policy: A discursive institutionalist
   approach},
Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL RESEARCH},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {56},
Number = {1},
Pages = {133-150},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Political science literature tends to depict the role of ideas in policy
   in two distinct ways: as strategic tools mobilised by agents to achieve
   pre-given preferences; or as structures imposing constraints on what is
   considered legitimate or feasible. Discursive institutionalism seeks to
   combine these insights, suggesting that while actors are indeed
   constrained by deeply entrenched ideas, they nonetheless enjoy some
   autonomy in selecting and combining ideas. This article seeks to further
   develop this approach in two ways. First, it identifies three discursive
   strategies through which policy actors can selectively mobilise ideas:
   they may foreground one level over others; exploit ambivalence in public
   philosophies; or link programme ideas over time by invoking policy
   legacies'. Second, the article elucidates the mechanisms through which
   such strategic selections can in turn modify existing public
   philosophies and programme ideas, thereby influencing policy change.
   These claims are examined by comparing discourse on immigration policy
   liberalisation in Germany and the United Kingdom between 2000 and 2008.
   Evidence is found of all three discursive strategies. Moreover, the
   article shows how, in the German case, these discursive representations
   led to longer-term adjustments in underlying programme ideas and public
   philosophies on immigration.},

Title = {Manifesto functions: How party candidates view and use their party's
   central policy document},
Journal = {ELECTORAL STUDIES},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {45},
Pages = {75-87},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Electoral manifestos play a crucial role in visions of party democracy
   and political science analyses of party competition. While research has
   focused on the contents of manifestos, we know much less about how
   parties produce manifestos and the roles they take in campaigns. This
   paper identifies three campaign-related functions of manifestos: they
   provide a compendium of valid party positions, streamline the campaign,
   and are used as campaign material. Based on the characteristics of the
   candidates, the parties and the campaign, the paper then derives
   expectations of how party candidates may differ in attributing
   importance to their party's manifesto. Based on a candidate survey after
   the 2013 Austrian general election, the paper shows that the key
   user-group of parliamentary candidates considers manifestos generally
   important and useful documents. Candidates' policy-centred campaigning
   and left right distance from their own party are important in explaining
   individual differences. While the manifesto's service functions of
   providing a summary of valid party positions for the candidates and as a
   campaign means to be handed out to voters are widely appreciated,
   campaign streamlining is more divisive when it results in constraining
   candidates. (C)2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

Abstract = {This article argues that a media and communication studies perspective
   on reading Marx's Capital has thus far been missing, but is needed in
   the age of information capitalism and digital capitalism. Two of the
   most popular contemporary companions to Marx's Capital, the ones by
   David Harvey and Michael Heinrich, present themselves as general
   guidebooks on how to read Marx, but are actually biased towards
   particular schools of Marxist thought. A contemporary reading of Marx
   needs to be mediated with contemporary capitalism's structures and the
   political issues of the day. Media, communications and the Internet are
   important issues for such a reading today. It is time to see Marx not
   just as a critic of capitalism but also as a critic of capitalist
   communications.},

   Voter Choice},

Pages = {147-179},
Abstract = {The voters' choices about political parties have many similarities with
   how they make their choices about commercial brands. Therefore,
   political parties are now constantly applying the concept and strategies
   of brand management to make the political product attractive,
   appealable, trustable, differentiable, a source of long-term
   relationships, and a decision-making driver. Furthermore, the political
   parties have to play an active role in the community's political
   socialization processes, which rely heavily on branding strategies.
   Because, the party equity is largely based on the community's social
   gregariousness that has profound effect on the electorates' propensity
   to participate in the politics. This study has deeply explored and
   broadened the concept of party equity analogous to commercial brand
   equity typology by developing a politics-specific brand equity model.
   This model demonstrates the integration of political brands in voter
   choice. Empirically, this model has been validated by collecting 550
   valid responses from the constituency of District Gujrat, Pakistan. A
   careful analysis of these responses through structural equation modeling
   methodology has revealed that political parties vary according to the
   outcomes of their role in the political socialization process of the
   communities, loyalty, and voters' attitude. Parties that have favorable
   role in the socialization process have strong party knowledge and thus
   have high party equity as compared to competing political parties, which
   have a weak},

Title = {Towards ending conflict and insecurity in the Niger Delta region: A
   collective non-violent approach},
Journal = {AFRICAN JOURNAL ON CONFLICT RESOLUTION},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {17},
Number = {1},
Pages = {9-27},
Abstract = {Since independence in 1960, insecurity has been a feature of the
   Nigerian State as conflicts in different parts of the country have
   continued to make life insecure. In the Niger Delta, violence has been
   the bane of the region where conflicts have been occurring for over four
   decades. Beginning from the pre-colonial period, the region has
   witnessed a series of conflicts, which had their roots, initially in the
   protest against injustice, and in recent years in the quest for resource
   control. All efforts to resolve conflict in the region failed until 2009
   when amnesty was declared by the Yar'adua/Jonathan administration and
   some form of uneasy peace prevailed. However, seven years down the line,
   there is renewed militancy in the region and effort is once again geared
   towards finding lasting peace. This article assesses the efforts made by
   the Federal Government of Nigeria to address conflicts in the region
   from the early 1960s to date. It is based on a literature study and on
   the author's knowledge of the issues in the Niger Delta. Findings from
   the work show that the Federal Government's approach to resolving
   conflict in the region has not been successful because it has not
   adequately addressed the issues that gave rise to the conflict, and
   because of its emphasis on the use of force. The article therefore
   recommends a Collective Non-violent Conflict Management approach -
   involving a group of negotiators, both international and local, an
   international mediator, as well as all the parties to the conflict - as
   the means for resolving conflict in the region. There is no doubt that a
   viable resource conflict strategy based on an alternative framework of
   multilateral cooperation is necessary for resolving and preventing a
   recurrence of future conflict in the Niger Delta region.},

Year = {2017},
Number = {1},
Pages = {5-20},
Abstract = {This study aims to explore the political theoretical background of
   governing populism in Hungary. It has been argued here that the
   political success of Viktor Orban's Governments are based on mixing
   three main political theoretical pillars: 1) the concept of the
   Political elaborated by Carl Schmitt; 2) the Weberian concept leader
   democracy; 3) and political constitutionalism. What is common in these
   three tendencies is the promise of repoliticisation. I will elaborate in
   this study that elitist populism and illiberal democracy are the two
   core concepts which can synchronize and converge the various ( and
   sometimes contradictory) political theoretical backgrounds of Orban's
   regime. I also put forward here that the populist promise of political
   leadership is inherently false, because instead of repoliticisation,
   populist forces monopolize political representation and liquidate
   political responsibility.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF POLITICAL POWER},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {10},
Number = {2},
Pages = {133-148},
Abstract = {This article is a theoretical exploration of a layer of loyalty called
   self-loyalty. We define self-loyalty as an emotion that is channelled
   through social forms. To show the usage and relevance of the concept we
   present social acceleration as a contextualisation. Two self-loyalty
   strategies in relation to acceleration are discussed: a voluntary form
   based on resistance and an involuntary form based on acceptance and
   `playing the game'.},

Abstract = {The United Nation's mediation mandate evolved during the Libyan
   revolution and was hampered by inconsistent support for the mediation,
   by other mediation initiatives, including that of the African Union, and
   by a proliferation of envoys and transition plans. When a battlefield
   stalemate obliged the international community to agree on a political
   mandate for mediation led by United Nations Special Envoy Abdelelah
   al-Khatib, the challenge was to persuade Gaddafi to accept a transition
   in which he would have no role. Gaddafi would not consent to this, and
   the rebels had little interest in a mediated transition that included
   him.},

Year = {2017},
Volume = {23},

Pages = {231-249},
Abstract = {Recent work on posthegemony has sought to displace the theory of
   hegemony as the primary mode of understanding politics, particularly
   with respect to Latin America. However, this work has yet to address the
   history of the theory of hegemony in Latin America itself. The present
   article traces the history of the theory of hegemony as a reference
   point for Marxists in twentieth century Argentina, working through key
   texts from the theory's regional introduction by Hector Agosti, through
   the work of Pasado y Presente, to that of Ernesto Laclau. I argue that
   the theory of hegemony in the Argentine context has historically served
   to place intellectuals and their productions at the centre of history,
   and has conceived of political strategy and organisation from this
   perspective. Understanding this limitation and its history, I conclude,
   will give posthegemony theory the strategic and conceptual bearings by
   which to surpass the problematic of hegemony.},

Abstract = {Faced with low numbers of women in national legislatures, election
   observers would be expected to recommend action for improving equal
   representation. With data from nearly 100 election observation reports
   of the OSCE Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights, this
   article explores how frequently and how strongly observers recommended
   taking measures to improve participation of women candidates in national
   legislative elections. It was found that the number of such
   recommendations has grown over the past decade, but with a tendency to
   use weak language. In examining these recommendations, this article
   argues that observers should be more consistent and insistent in
   promoting equal opportunities for women candidates.},

Abstract = {To describe events as ``political,{''} or to deny them this quality, is
   part and parcel of confrontations in history. The French revolution, and
   in particular the insurrection in the Vendee, have been the objects of
   this kind of quarrel over labels. Some used to see Vendeans as fanatical
   political counter-revolutionaries; others considered their movement as
   but a primitive and local rebuff. Observing historical actors with an
   ethnographic eye, and analyzing their behavior before the times of peak
   turmoil, this article argues that these seemingly contradictory labels
   are only possible because they share the same issue, that of the forms
   of living alongside one another. Community is an ambiguous notion that
   can be understood as national as well as local. And this ambiguity is at
   the roots of conflict.},

Title = {Presidentialism and Recall in Latin America},
Journal = {POLITICA Y SOCIEDAD},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {54},
Number = {2},
Pages = {497-519},
Abstract = {Recall is a citizen participation and control mechanism principally
   framed in the third wave of democratization and in the 90s Latin
   America's political and constitutional reforms. It appeared between the
   innovations introduced by the rulers in response to the crisis of
   representation. Its appearance opens deep questions about: the
   metamorphosis of modern representation (a certain approach to the
   ``imperative mandate{''}), the changes in the presidential system
   (relaxation, quasi-parliamentarization), new forms of presidential falls
   and crisis resolution, and the democratization of government (another
   instance of voting enabled for the removal of elected officials). In
   this regard, work has two objectives: conceptually analyze the recall,
   specifically, the presidential recall (existing only in Venezuela,
   Bolivia and Ecuador); and link this mechanism with the debate on Latin
   American presidentialism (as it is considered to produce potential
   changes in the presidential system), with the theory of types of
   constitutional succession and with the theory of presidential
   interruptions (since the recall is another removal device available in
   cases of institutional crisis). It is therefore a theoretical study that
   aims to conceptualize a certain type of recall and link it with other
   theoretical developments of which has been absent. These and other
   theoretical and institutional engineering implications motivate this
   article. It aims to elucidate the potential, direct and indirect effects
   of the introduction of this mechanism for Latin American presidential
   democracies.},

   Transformation of the Dominant Discourse},
Journal = {NEW POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {39},
Number = {4, SI},
Pages = {523-537},
Abstract = {This article examines the limitations of rights-based strategies and
   social movements for advancing the interests of marginalized and
   intersectionally-subjected populations in the US, and argues that
   counterpublics offer a viable alternative for populations designated as
   outsiders to cultivate their power, identities and discourses. While
   counterpublics are expected to comply with norms of behavior and
   discourse when attempting to persuade the public, they might find
   greater utility in rejecting the dominant discourse and decorum in favor
   of agitation. By privileging their own discourse and decentering the
   center, the counterpublics retain their power in their interactions with
   the public and can raise the saliency of their issues as exemplified by
   the Black Lives Matter movement. In the current context of abnormal
   justice, the conditions are ripe for counterpublics to unite in an
   intersectional resistance in pursuit of transformative change as
   demonstrated by the protests at Standing Rock.},

Abstract = {This paper analyses the evolution of the legislative activity in the
   field of economic and financial affairs and the impact of the crisis on
   this sector. Even if the relations between member states are marked by
   tensions, we do not observe the same tendency at the institutional
   level: the increased number of legislative acts and their increased
   length do not correspond to growing conflicts between the institutional
   actors. Actually, the economic and financial affairs are less marked by
   conflicts than the other sectors. Moreover, the legislative actors still
   strive to find intra-institutional and interinstitutional compromises,
   which shows the resilience of the European institutions in spite of
   political disagreements among member states. The short-term and
   structural changes that have affected the EU for a decade have a limited
   impact on the consensual dynamics that remains a characteristic feature
   of the EU institutional system.},

Abstract = {The Local Administration, being the one closest to the citizen, is the
   one who best knows their needs, so that their efficiency in providing
   basic collective services is high. However, to ensure optimal provision
   of these services, it requires financial sufficiency. Therefore, the
   study of the financial status of our Local Corporations is a priority, a
   task in addition to the financial issues have many other aspects. This
   paper addresses the financial question based on the financial statements
   and financial ratios applied to local entities, thus measuring the
   evaluation capacity of these financial indicators in relation to the
   economic and financial situation of local entities. The study is based
   on a comparative analysis about the centrality and dispersion of these
   instruments, and the references used are both those established from
   empirical rules and the values reached by the indicators of other Local
   Corporations of similar size at the provincial level and autonomous.
   Concluding with the projection of the ratios of the municipality
   investigated on the different spatial references available, obtaining
   thus a relevant information of the direction to follow to guarantee the
   local provision.},

Title = {INSTITUTIONAL FOUNDATIONS OF ETHNIC FEDERATIONS},
Journal = {POLIS-POLITICHESKIYE ISSLEDOVANIYA},
Year = {2017},
Number = {2},
Pages = {103-117},
Abstract = {The main topic of the article is analysis of institutional foundations
   of the ethnic federations. Special attention is paid to consideration of
   the two key problems: instrumental role of such federations and
   political representation of ethnic groups, including ethnic minorities.
   It is underlined that ethnic federations can play positive role and at
   the same time they don't exclude the risk of destabilization and
   separatism. From the positive side, these federations provide for ethnic
   groups an opportunity for realization of their right for
   self-determination up to creation of their own state or political
   autonomy within the framework of a single state. Ethnic federations also
   broaden the opportunities for protection of culture, language,
   traditions and identity of ethnic minorities. Often ethnic federations
   are considered as a device for settling of ethnic conflicts, overcoming
   of separatism and for social integration. As the international
   experience shows, ethnofederalism serves as a means for securing
   territorial integrity of states. Ethnicity itself does not have any
   political content but can be used for political aims. From the negative
   side, a political autonomy of federal subunits can be used by ethnic
   political elites for ethnic mobilization in order to provide their
   mercenary interests not rarely connected with secession. Ethnic
   federations are often unstable. From the contradictory interaction of
   two general principles of international law-territorial integrity of
   states and right of nations for self-determination, a necessity follows
   to differentiate an estimate of secession and separatism. The author
   criticizes those scholars who ascribe to ethnic federations shortcomings
   not emanating from the objective nature of those federations. For an
   obvious reason political representation of ethnic groups has both moral
   and political meaning. It provides social integration of ethnic groups
   and political stability of foundations of society and state.
   Representation is conducive to overcoming of ethnic minorities'
   estrangement. It is a condition for reduction of intensity of the ethnic
   conflict. The author shows different means for providing political
   representation: proportionality, parity, quota, reserving and some
   others.},

Abstract = {This article studies invalid voting, which has received very little
   attention so far, given the broad interest and substantial relevance of
   voting behaviour research. Existing evidence is mostly limited to rather
   specific and hardly representative countries. Yet, the extent of invalid
   ballots is not negligible. Despite undemanding electoral rules, more
   invalid votes are cast in German general elections than votes for niche
   parties. Against this backdrop, the article describes prevalence of
   invalid voting in the mixed electoral system of Germany and tests
   explanations of its variation between constituencies. Analysing data
   from the most recent Bundestag Election, results give clear support to
   politico-institutional explanations: voters are more willing to waste
   their vote if second-order elections are held concurrently. Specifically
   under the plurality rule, more (first) votes are wasted if there are
   large shares for parties without direct candidates and many competing
   candidates.},

Abstract = {This article examines architectural preservation in North Russia after
   World War II as a movement that treated local vernacular architecture as
   a key to understanding the authentic national history of Russia. It
   argues that Soviet architectural preservationists were driven by
   romantic nationalist ideas that sought to establish northern Russian
   vernacular architecture as an aesthetic system that fully realized the
   expressive potential of wood as a construction material. Moreover,
   Soviet preservationists linked this system to a society free of the
   social conflicts that allegedly existed in North Russia, thanks to its
   geographic and political marginality until the tsarist oppression of the
   nineteenth century. While widely employing the conceptual apparatus of
   early SovietMarxist architects such as Moisei Ginzburg and Aleksei Gan,
   Soviet architectural preservationists petrified the transformative
   social agenda of early Soviet architectural theory.},

Abstract = {This work examines how the American role in the Vietnam War has been
   portrayed in standard college-and university-level textbooks dealing
   with American foreign policy. It argues that this topic has been
   presented in a manner that leaves an incomplete understanding. This
   conclusion is based on scholarship that has been available for decades
   as well as much Cold War historiography that has appeared since 1975. I
   conclude that the distortions need to be addressed for several reasons.
   Their propagation produces bad scholarship, gratuitously alienates
   Americans from their institutions of government, and justifies
   anti-Americanism and authoritarianism elsewhere.},

Volume = {10},
Number = {1},
Pages = {25-39},
Abstract = {In this exchange Haugaard and Pettit begin by discussing power and
   agency. They agree that while many inequalities are linked to deliberate
   agency, a significant number of inequalities comprise structural effects
   that are the unintended effect of social action. These are of normative
   concern: to prevent arbitrary domination and create a society in which
   everyone can pass the eyeball test. Some of these structures are
   naturalized, or reified, which often makes them appear less contestable.
   This includes private property, which is presented as part of the
   natural order of things, thereby often naturalizing domination. From
   these beginnings, the authors discuss the nature of the eye-ball and
   tough-luck tests, including: how they apply to culture, parent-child
   power, gender, and economic inequalities.},

Abstract = {This paper analyses Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership
   (TTIP) negotiations in order to assess how the move towards tighter
   economic integration within the EU-US strategic partnership impacts on
   legislative. executive relations in EU trade policy. The analysis
   examines the institutional, substantive and party political dimensions
   of national parliaments' scrutiny of the Common Commercial Policy. Based
   on insights into both domestic and EU channels of parliamentary
   monitoring of TTIP negotiations, the paper argues that, although the
   government remains the central object of democratic control, the
   involvement of national parliaments in transatlantic trade extends to
   encompass the EU's own transatlantic and trade policies. This is rooted
   in the legislatures' legal capacity to constrain the executive in the
   negotiation, conclusion and, where applicable, ratification phases of EU
   trade agreements. It is argued that national parliamentary influence
   takes the shape of politicisation of the legitimacy of the expected
   policy outcomes of these agreements.},

Abstract = {This article assesses recent Chinese Communist Party responses to the
   issue of post-Soviet ideological fragmentation by examining independent
   documentary media in the context of broader policy discussions
   surrounding culture and the lessons of the Arab Spring. It argues that
   Xi-ist policies of cultural securitization began under Hu Jintao and
   should be understood as the outgrowth of elite consensus-based efforts
   to deal with the implications of new media technologies and
   marketization for authoritarian rule. New political and factional
   formations have, in turn, reconfigured the landscape of institutions,
   patronage networks, and quasi-legal lines of permissiveness affecting
   documentary producers. This political institutionalization of
   independent media practices is significant as a window onto broader
   dynamics of managed pluralism.},

Title = {Helsinki Syndrome: The Parachronistic Renaissance of Finlandization in
   International Politics},
Journal = {NEW PERSPECTIVES},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {25},
Number = {1},
Pages = {55-83},
Abstract = {The ongoing conflict in Ukraine has produced a number of commentaries
   that have tried to grasp the crisis through the comforting lens of
   historical analogies. One of the most perplexing of these has been the
   revival of Finlandization, or the idea of the ``Finnish model{''} as a
   possible solution to the Ukraine crisis. In this article I interrogate
   these arguments, firstly, by historicising the original process of
   Finlandization during the Cold War. Secondly, I argue that the
   renaissance of Finlandization is based on parachronistic reasoning. In
   other words, the Finlandization analogy has been applied to modern-day
   Ukraine in such a way that the alien elements of the past context are,
   to paraphrase Quentin Skinner, ``dissolved into an apparent but
   misleading familiarity{''} in the present re-appropriation of the idea
   and its contextual prerequisites. Indeed, the reappearance of
   Finlandization in the context of the Ukraine crisis reinforces the idea
   that the real drivers of international affairs can be reduced to the
   axioms derived from the transhistorical logic of international anarchy
   and the iron laws of great power politics. Thus, this article makes a
   novel contribution to the theoretical discussion on the role of
   analogies and myths in International Relations.},

Abstract = {This study investigated the use of party and ideological labels and
   candidate names in major party candidate tweets (N = 94,310) during the
   2016 presidential preprimary and primary campaigns to understand the
   extent to which candidates focused on intraparty and interparty themes
   as a part of their marketing strategies. The results show that the
   candidates and their campaigns did not engage in heavy partisan labeling
   to cultivate their social media identities. Outsider candidates were not
   more likely to use party or ideological labels in their tweets than
   insider candidates were. The candidates focused on self-advocacy in
   their tweets.},

   of the ``Dialectic Nature of Progress'?},
Journal = {GERMAN POLITICS},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {26},
Number = {2},
Pages = {235-254},
Abstract = {Euroscepticism is associated with a new cleavage between the losers' and
   the winners' of globalisation. Current research also indicates that
   right-wing extremist, racist, and anti-democratic attitudes are more
   prevalent in lower status groups, particularly those struggling with
   societal change. These findings are combined with a unique data set
   covering both topics and thus add to the growing literature on
   Euroscepticism while also exploring the divide between the losers' and
   winners' of modernisation processes. The article introduces categories
   of occupational status groups, namely the engaged', the skilled
   workers', and the legworkers', which represent different levels of
   involvement in modernisation processes. It explores the differences in
   attitudes between these groups and how those differences correlate with
   citizens' professional status. It is concluded that perceived subjective
   alienation, which manifests in racist and anti-democratic attitudes,
   best explains EU-scepticism.},

Abstract = {Almost nothing remains of the great promises of freedom of the Russian
   Revolution. Poverty and injustice are still prevalent, and freedom and
   emancipation were stalled by Stalinism and the
   authoritarian-bureaucratic etatism. International relations, too, were
   not reconfigured, the more so since the global revolution failed to
   materialise. Communism or socialism of the Soviet type has lost all
   attraction as a model of political order. The most important legacy of
   the Red October is that in Russia, authoritarian-imperial institutions
   and practices continue to exist today, and that in society, the values
   and norms of ``Soviet Man{''} are being reproduced, even though the
   Soviet Union no longer exists.},

Title = {The changing dynamics of policy experiment in Singapore: does the 2011
   general election make a difference?},
Journal = {ASIAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE},

Abstract = {The city-state of Singapore is proactive in harnessing policy
   experimentation to incubate innovations, transfer knowledge and
   facilitate collaborations across different public sectors. Given the
   country's strong knack for pragmatism, international practices and
   lessons are usually first tested and adapted in policy experiments
   before scaling up to nationwide policies. Singapore's practice of policy
   experimentation, however, has also demonstrated evolution over time.
   This article reviews the evolving role of experimentation in Singapore's
   policy decision-making and implementation, and analyses pilot programmes
   in public housing to elicit the key attributes and commonalities of its
   policy experiments. It finds that policy experiments have been
   increasingly used after the 2011 general election, which witnessed a
   radical political rebalancing in Singapore's governance history. Pilot
   projects have thus transformed from a utilitarian to citizen-centric,
   design-thinking approach after 2011. Pilot programmes are used for
   multiple purposes in policy innovations, among which civil service
   mentoring, knowledge transfer and cross-boundary collaboration are the
   values primarily pursued. The article discusses the contributions of the
   findings to the literature and policy implications for practitioners.},

   mechanisms of coordination due to the EU's non-accession (for the time
   being) to the Convention, coordination is nevertheless achieved through
   a practical concordance between the case law of both courts, which in a
   process of both formal and informal dialogue is defining the scope of

Title = {Advancing Respect for Labour Rights Globally through Public Procurement},
Journal = {POLITICS AND GOVERNANCE},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {5},
Number = {4},
Pages = {69-79},
Abstract = {Governments are mega-consumers of many manufactured products and
   services. As such they should in principle be able to influence workers'
   rights abroad via the terms of purchase contracts. Yet to date little
   attention has been paid to the potential of public procurement to
   promote respect for labour rights globally besides the international
   trade law framework. Building on a limited emerging scholarship and
   policy developments, this article addresses this gap. Section 2
   considers legal definitions of public procurement and distinguishes
   primary and secondary aims of procurement under key international and
   regional procurement regimes. This highlights that, although
   historically used to advance labour rights domestically, these regimes
   have restricted public buyers' scope to advance labour rights beyond
   national borders. Section 3 explores new international policy frameworks
   on responsible global value chains and supply chains which by contrast
   appear to augur the greater use of public procurement to promote labour
   rights globally in future. Section 4 argues, supported by analysis of
   the limited examples available, that public buying has the potential to
   positively influence enjoyment of labour rights in practice. Concluding,
   Section 5 reflects on what the more specific impacts of public
   procurement in this context may be, and how public buying should
   complement other mechanisms for improving labour conditions across
   supply chains, such as social clauses in trade agreements. Finally, we
   outline issues for further research and the future policy agenda.},

Abstract = {Out of office and called to account before a royal commission, the
   former prime minister Kevin Rudd demonstrated he had lost none of his
   popular appeal by winning support from those least likely to empathise
   with his position-the families of four young Australians who had lost
   their lives in a tragic failure of public policy under Rudd's
   administration. Chapter 6 demonstrates two other things. First, that
   legal rhetoric cannot match the power of political rhetoric when
   persuasion of a broader public is required. Secondly, a leader out of
   office may no longer feels the constraints of Cabinet or party
   collegiality and will sacrifice established Cabinet conventions in a
   manner otherwise unthinkable within the confines of the Westminster
   government.},

Journal = {IRISH POLITICAL STUDIES},

Pages = {432-453},
Abstract = {Terence O'Neill maintained a keen interest in conservation and
   architectural heritage, but his record on these issues in government in
   Northern Ireland is largely unexamined. This article addresses this
   deficit through a comprehensive review of the existing literature
   reinforced by archival material, revealing the familial and other
   connections that O'Neill had with the conservation world and civil
   society organisations, including his sometimes behind-the-scenes
   interventions on conservation policy. The momentous impact on the
   existing built environment from his drive to transform the face of
   Ulster' is ultimately foregrounded, particularly the contemporary
   philosophy underpinning the balanced approach' to development that was
   initially favoured by progressive opinion in the early 1960s, and the
   effect that the destruction of familiar places had on the creation of
   new heritage values. However, the failure of O'Neill to introduce town
   and country planning legalisation akin to that existing in Great Britain
   frustrated the efforts of conservationists who grew increasingly
   vociferous in their calls for action. As in other contested areas of
   public policy in the 1960s in Northern Ireland, the destructive forces
   unleashed in the built environment threatened architectural heritage and
   essentially remained unchecked in the absence of timely reforms prior to
   Direct Rule from Westminster.},

Abstract = {This article looks at the ongoing insurgency in the remote Indian
   northeast, and has a special focus on the state of Manipur. Manipur is
   regarded as India's eastern most state, and is geographically sandwiched
   in between East Asia proper and South Asia proper. This article tries to
   analyze the different facets of this very complex situation, and pays
   special attention to how the conflict has changed its character with the
   passage of time. For purposes of this article, primary data was
   collected by interviewing local people of Manipuri descent in eastern
   India to get first hand information about the conflict. Finally, at the
   end of the article, methods of peace building have been suggested as the
   way forward.},

Abstract = {Background and objective: In the present study, the comparison of
   deterrence punishment for trade violations in Ja'fari jurisprudence and
   Iran trade was examined. Also, the effectiveness of these punishments on
   reduction of trade violations and the necessity of institutionalizing
   religious orders in different trades were discussed.
   Methodology: the method used in the present study is
   descriptive-analytical and it used different trade laws and Islamic
   narrations and Hadith. According to the variety of trade violations in
   governmental and non-governmental sectors, seven important violations of
   hoarding, health violations, business fraud, not to include price,
   smuggling, use of short weights, and overcharge were discussed in the
   present study.
   According to the main objective of the executives of punishments for
   trade violators to support and observe consumer rights and also the
   study of Quranic verses, narrations and Hadith, showed that paying less
   attention to religious orders has a positive effect on trade violations.
   Inflation in commodity price and sanction of some consumable commodities
   has also a positive effect on reduction of trade violations deterrence.
   The results also showed that the effectiveness of trade violations
   deterrence is more than its legal resources according to religious and
   Islamic factors mentioned in Ja'fari jurisprudence. Thus, the necessity
   of approving a comprehensive trade system law with the approach of
   institutionalizing the culture of Islam based on trade laws of Ja'fari
   jurisprudence is felt.},

Abstract = {This paper seeks to examine the role and functions of the representative
   offices of English local authorities in Brussels by considering the
   democratic legitimacy (i.e. linkage to elected councillors or mayors),
   accountability and transparency of the office's activities. The study
   demonstrates that the offices differ in their governance arrangements
   and funding, which has a direct impact on the approach to democratic
   legitimacy and accountability, noting that those offices which rely most
   heavily on direct funding from a single authority or a combined
   authority have the closest links to the authorities concerned. The
   transparency of the offices varies considerably, with clear distinctions
   between offices that are creatures of contract or where offices are an
   emanation of the authority concerned. The pattern here is less dependent
   on the pattern of funding of the office and depends more on the
   availability of resources and the approach adopted by the office itself.},

Title = {The contested spaces of civil society in a plural world: norm
   contestation in the debate about restrictions on international civil
   society support},
Journal = {CONTEMPORARY POLITICS},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {23},
Number = {4},
Pages = {469-488},
Abstract = {Civil society organizations are facing increasing political restrictions
   all over the world. Frequently, these restrictions apply to the foreign
   funding of NGOs and thus curtail the space for external civil society
   support, which, since the 1990s, has become a key element in
   international democracy and human rights promotion. This so-called
   closing space' phenomenon has received growing attention by civil
   society activists, policymakers and academics. Existing studies (and
   political responses), however, neglect the crucial normative dimension
   of the problem at hand: As we show, the political controversy over civil
   society support is characterized by norm contestation, and this
   contestation reveals competing perceptions of in/justice and touches
   upon core principles of contemporary world order. Taking this dimension
   into account is essential if we are to academically understand, and
   politically respond to, the closing space' challenge. It is also highly
   relevant with regard to current debates on how to conceptualize and
   construct order in a world that is plural in many regards and in which
   liberal norms are fundamentally contested. Empirically, the paper
   combines an assessment of the global debate about closing space in the
   UN Human Rights Council with an analysis of a specific controversy over
   the issue in US-Egyptian relations.},

Abstract = {What are the origins of belief in conspiracy theories? The dominant
   approach to studying conspiracy theories links belief to social stresses
   or personality type, and does not take into account the situational and
   fluctuating nature of attitudes. In this study, a survey experiment,
   subjects are presented with a mock news article designed to induce
   conspiracy belief. Subjects are randomly assigned three manipulations
   hypothesized to heighten conspiracy perceptions: a prime to induce
   anxiety; information about the putative conspirator; and the number and
   identifiability of the victim(s). The results indicate that
   conspiratorial perceptions can emerge from both situational triggers and
   subtle contextual variables. Conspiracy beliefs emerge as ordinary
   people make judgments about the social and political world.},

Abstract = {Utopia and political science are not sharply antithetical models of
   approach to politics. As Hans Blumenberg points out, they were born at
   the same time as alternatives to the model of the Platonic philosophical
   inquiry, and have continued to develop in parallel. Their diversity will
   be illustrated by examining the role of fiction in Thomas Hobbes's
   Leviathan and James Harrington's Commonwealth of Oceana. Describing the
   different role it plays in these works, the essay shows how they both
   use this concept to solve the problem of the uncertainty of knowledge
   and the intransparency of the world.},

Abstract = {This article is a review of the different kind of rulings made by the
   European Court of Justice, in order to find their function and position
   in the Spanish Law system. The analysis is made under two assumptions:
   the first one about the formal autonomy but material dependency between
   EU and Spanish law systems; the second one is that the European Court of
   Justice case law rules over the interaction between both systems. Formal
   and substantive effects of ECJ rulings over both systems are described
   and analysed, considering the integrating role of the Spanish
   Constitution.},

Abstract = {In the interwar period both France and Belgium passed legislation
   reducing the number of working hours and established a hybrid regulatory
   regime lending a certain degree of official authority to collective
   agreements. The paper analyses discourses by scholars who, as experts,
   were close to the political elites, and who tried to legitimize this
   kind of co-regulation by pointing out the inefficiency of state
   intervention and the epistemic authority of non-state actors. Stressing
   the output dimension of legitimacy and the improved quality of legal
   norms, these discourses had a technocratic tendency and ultimately
   argued in favour of a shift of power from the legislative to the
   administrative branch of government.},

Abstract = {Resilience is a widely used concept among development, environmental,
   security and peacebuilding organizations. However, resilience has rarely
   been applied in conjunction with the potentially complementary concept
   of environmental security. Therefore, this paper explores how the
   concepts of resilience and environmental security can be jointly applied
   by non-governmental organizations working to implement peacebuilding
   projects in developing countries. We first review definitions of the
   concepts and explore their strengths and pitfalls. Second, we develop a
   conceptual framework for a joint application whereby environmental
   security sharpens the scope of resilience, while resilience allows for
   taking issues into account that a traditional environmental security
   perspective might miss. Finally, we apply the conceptual framework to a
   case study from Palestine.},

Abstract = {We introduce a method for assessing the overall level of bias and
   relative tracking accuracy in time series analysis of polling data on
   voter intentions by comparing two data sets: the New Zealand Attitudes
   and Values Study (NZAVS; N=13,936) and the One News Colmar Brunton
   election polls (N=10,210). The NZAVS is a national probability
   longitudinal postal panel survey started in 2009. It was set up to track
   stability and change in values, without any intention to predict
   election results. The One News Colmar Brunton Poll is a nationally
   representative random-digit dial telephone survey conducted by Colmar
   Brunton specifically to measure voter sentiment. Our comparison focused
   on responses to both surveys from February 2014 to September 2014, in
   the run up to the New Zealand general election. The NZAVS and One News
   Colmar Brunton Poll detected nearly identical changes in party vote over
   time, and both effectively predicted the outcome of the 2014 General
   Election. This shows the unexpected power of national-scale probability
   postal studies to track change in democratic decisions that affect all
   members of a society. These results further support the validity of the
   NZAVS as an independent and impartial source that might be repurposed'
   to create a continuous monitor tracking political attitudes and
   detecting citizens' reaction to, and relative change in, opinions toward
   different social policies, values, and attitudes, over time.},

Abstract = {Historically, very few female candidates have ever won election to the
   U.S. House of Representatives. In addition, very few third-party
   candidates have ever won election to the House. With data from 1912 to
   2012 on more than 54,000 candidates, we provide an historical overview
   of third-party activity in general elections to the House and the
   participation of female candidates. Our analysis shows that third
   parties have been a consistent presence in elections to the House and a
   major avenue for women. Using a vector autoregression model and Granger
   causality tests, we also show that from 1912 to 1964, women nominated by
   third parties were ``trail blazers{''} potentially influencing the
   movement of women into the major parties. We also show that since 1964,
   the presence of women among third-party nominees has been influenced by
   the increasing proportion of women as major-party nominees. Our analysis
   thus uncovers a ``hidden history{''} that enhances our understanding of
   how women have participated in over a century of electoral politics.},

Journal = {DEMOCRACY \& SECURITY},

Volume = {13},

Abstract = {The northeastern region of India has witnessed several armed movements
   that have sought to achieve a variety of political goals ranging from
   secession to limited autonomy for specific ethnic groups. In seeking to
   limit the violence perpetrated in the course of these contemporary
   subnational insurgencies, a multilayered approach has been developed by
   the Government of India (GoI) and, more specifically, by the Ministry of
   Home Affairs (MHA) in coordination with the provincial (or state)
   governments. The range of de-escalation mechanisms range from ceasefire
   agreements to the more contemporary Suspension of Operations (SoO)
   frameworks as well as ``Surrender and Rehabilitation{''} packages for
   individual members of armed groups. In certain cases, autonomous tribal
   governance institutions have been created within the federal structure
   in the backdrop of ceasefire and SoO agreements. The overall consequence
   of these strategies has been a measureable reduction of direct violence
   between the security forces and armed opposition groups. Conversely,
   there have been several occurrences of ethnic clashes (sometimes
   involving former belligerents) that have led to large-scale loss of life
   and forced internal displacement in the region. Furthermore, the absence
   of violence has not necessarily led to development. Rather, we see a
   situation of peace without peace dividends.},

Abstract = {In Equal Recognition, Alan Patten argues that in a proper relationship
   between normative political theory and democratic politics, we must make
   a clear distinction between two questions related to cultural rights:
   (a) authority (who should decide?) and (b) the substance of
   deliberation. The question he wants to explore, however, is not the
   authority question but the substantive question. The aim of this article
   is to show that an account of equal recognition cannot bracket out the
   democratic element. It argues, first, that Equal Recognition does not
   live up to its initial promise, as it contains a number of reflections
   and recommendations (on language rights, on secession, on the rights of
   migrants' cultures) that either explicitly or implicitly include the
   democratic element. Second, it points at other important areas of
   political decision-making - such as electoral system design,
   districting, referendums, quotas - in which it is quite clear that in
   order to extend equal recognition to minority cultures, we are obliged
   to take decisions related to the design of democratic institutions.},

Title = {METHODOLOGICAL ASPECTS IN THE STUDY OF FOREIGN POLICY AND GLOBAL ROLE OF
   THE EUROPEAN UNION},
Journal = {POLIS-POLITICHESKIYE ISSLEDOVANIYA},
Year = {2017},
Number = {6},
Pages = {25-42},
Abstract = {Methods of research, informed by theories of international relations,
   frequently employed when studying foreign policy and global role of the
   European Union, are analytically discussed in this article for the sake
   of methodologic reflection. Such key concepts as statehood,
   subjectivity, system, identity, norms and differentiation, are used as
   reference points to ``navigate{''} between separate theories in order to
   compare them, thus achieving a clearer description of conceptual
   ambiguity of respective terms, with certain consequences as concerns
   direction, limits and scope of any theoretically-oriented analysis. The
   article shows that IR theories are actively developing and provide good
   assistance to researchers in exploring international behavior and
   possible results of the EU's global influence. The choice the author
   makes in favour of a certain methodology cannot be taken as neutral: it
   influences the ways they are interpreted. Thus, better self-reflection
   is important for credibility of the findings. Ambivalence of the EU as
   an object of political study is a particular challenge for the IR
   theories, pushing on their evolution and consolidation of the analytical
   methods they use. The article presents additional options, provided in
   this respect by introducing methods employed in political economy and
   sociology. The notion of the normative power of Europe, introduced and
   developed by Ian Manners, is singled out as the most popular concept in
   the area of study under consideration, attracting in impressive numbers
   the attention of European specialists with differing theoretical
   predilections. It was found that, when basing exclusively on the
   constructivist theory as proposed by Alexander Wendt, this notion loses
   robustness as an instrument of research: rather than helping to
   understand the specifics of the EU's international behavior, it
   prescribes to the EU a certain quite aggressive conduct on the
   presumption of the indisputable superiority of the European norms for
   the future European and wider (global) order.},

Abstract = {A central argument of the Leviathan has to do with the political
   importance of education. Hobbes wants his book to be taught in
   universities and expounded much in the manner that Scripture was. Only
   thus will citizens realize what is in their hearts as to the nature of
   good political order. Glory affects this process in two ways. The
   pursuit of glory by a citizen leads to political chaos and disorder. On
   the other hand, God's glory is such that one can do nothing but
   acquiesce to it. The Hobbesian sovereign shares some of the effects of
   glory that God has naturally; this, however, has to be supplemented by
   awe and that but fear.},

Journal = {POLIS-POLITICHESKIYE ISSLEDOVANIYA},
Year = {2017},
Number = {3},
Pages = {144-159},
Abstract = {The main forms of interaction of the power institutions and the
   representatives of the expert community are considered in the article,
   namely the three models of interaction: a linearly-autonomous model, a
   model of virtuous reason, and a ``model of the prepaid result{''}
   developed by the authors. The research included ten expert trips to
   different Russian regions and about 40 expert interviews with
   respondents from the expert community, governmental structures, NGOs and
   mass-media. Four focus-groups were organized in Ekaterinburg, Kazan,
   Nizhniy Novgorod and Saratov, formed from the same categories as
   respondents of expert interviews. It is shown that in the contemporary
   Russia, the activities of numerous expert councils established at
   governmental agencies of different levels mostly implement the symbolic
   function of expert knowledge. We explain this by inclusion to this
   expert council of so called `status' experts with high positions in the
   hierarchy of ruling bodies of academician institutes or universities.
   When acting publically, most members of such councils are ready to
   ``play the same game{''} as the representatives of the regional
   authorities, hereby confirming the effectiveness of their power and
   absence of serious unsolved problems in the region. The instrumental
   function, in turn, is implemented mainly in the form of individual
   orders for experts placed by the authorities in the framework of the
   linear autonomous model: firstly, experts autonomously prepare their
   conclusions and recommendations; secondly, representatives of
   authorities take their decisions taking into account the received
   information (also autonomously from the experts).},

Abstract = {The war of June 1967 was a watershed for the Middle East. In just six
   days, Israel inflicted upon the Arabs their most humiliating defeat in
   modern times, perhaps of all time. The great promise of revolutionary
   Arab nationalism, as espoused by Egypt's charismatic president, Gamal
   Abdel Nasser, proved to be no more than an illusion. In this article,
   Asher Susser explores the lasting consequences of war, arguing that the
   Arabs have yet to fully recover, 50 years later.},

Title = {The Effect of Gender Norms in Sitcoms on Support for Access to Abortion
   and Contraception},
Journal = {AMERICAN POLITICS RESEARCH},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {45},
Number = {1},
Pages = {109-127},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Can ostensibly nonpolitical television programming affect policy
   opinions? In this article, I use a laboratory experiment to test whether
   the gender norms portrayed on two primetime sitcoms can alter political
   attitudes on gender issues, specifically access to abortion, and
   contraception. Though the shows in the experiment did not explicitly
   discuss any policy, I find that sitcoms can influence policy opinions,
   particularly when the show conveys a ``boys will be boys{''} mentality
   toward sexual behavior. This finding has important implications for
   public opinion scholars because it suggests that there may not be such a
   thing as apolitical programming, and pop culture may have a profound,
   overlooked effect on public opinion.},

Title = {Does Fusion Undermine American Third Parties? An Analysis of House
   Elections from 1870 to 2016},
Journal = {NEW POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {39},
Number = {4, SI},
Pages = {609-626},
Abstract = {Many third-party scholars argue that fusion, or the co-nomination of a
   single candidate by multiple parties, strengthens American third
   parties. They argue that a widespread use of fusion in the late
   nineteenth century fueled third-party support, that the prohibition of
   fusion by most states around 1900 undermined third parties, and that the
   continued use of fusion in New York State is a primary reason why third
   parties remain strong there. In this paper, which is based on a
   district-level analysis of all elections to the House of Representatives
   since 1870, I argue the opposite. In recent elections, third-party
   candidates have fared worse, not better, in fusion states, and the
   historical evidence shows that a widespread use of fusion has
   consistently led to the destruction of third parties. The evidence
   presented here suggests that the primary impact of fusion is that it
   helps major parties co-opt third parties, and therefore, the more
   effective strategy for third parties would be to instead challenge the
   major parties more aggressively. The paper also suggests, on the
   occasion of the 50th Anniversary of the Caucus for a New Political
   Science, how statistically driven research can be better integrated into
   the Caucus's mission to make the study of politics more relevant for
   progressive change.},

Title = {Linking Land Rights and the Right to Adequate Food in Ethiopia:
   Normative and Implementation Gaps},
Journal = {NORDIC JOURNAL OF HUMAN RIGHTS},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {35},
Number = {2},
Pages = {85-105},
Abstract = {The enjoyment of the human right to adequate food depends on access to
   and control over land and other natural resources and tenure security.
   However, smallholders and indigenous peoples in many developing
   countries face forced evictions or displacements from their lands with
   impunity. Ethiopia often displaces smallholders from their lands without
   adequate due process of law for stated objectives of promoting
   large-scale agricultural investments, urbanisation and industrial
   developments. This article explores the link between land rights and the
   right to adequate food, and appraises normative and implementation gaps
   in Ethiopia's laws regarding land rights and analyses their impact on
   the enjoyment of the right to adequate food. It finds that, instead of
   protecting individual and collective land rights of smallholders and
   indigenous peoples, Ethiopia's laws and practices facilitate
   dispossessions without adequate compensation and relocation options.
   Expropriation without just compensation has a huge negative impact on
   the livelihoods and food security of displaced land users, and has
   resulted in a political crisis in the State of Oromia. I argue that
   Ethiopia should reform land laws in light of its legal obligations under
   the international human rights law to respect, protect and fulfil the
   right to adequate food and ensure freedom from hunger.},

   With a methodology of qualitative character, the investigation was

Title = {MODERN POPULISM AS A SUBJECT OF POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Journal = {POLIS-POLITICHESKIYE ISSLEDOVANIYA},
Year = {2017},
Number = {4},
Pages = {69-89},
Abstract = {The article notes that a lack in the political science literature of
   agreed definition of contemporary populism significantly complicates
   identification and classification of the political forces that represent
   this phenomenon. The article examines differences existing in academic
   researches concerning estimations of the quantitative parameters of
   European populist parties and their current electoral base. At the same
   time, the author presents its own calculations of the scale and forms of
   ``populist wave{''} in Europe, according to which there are today about
   90 populist parties in 31 European countries with average level of
   electoral support of 27\% at the general elections in the period from
   2013 to the beginning of 2017. As to the explanations of the driving
   forces of current populist wave, the article notes the absence of
   sufficient empirical evidence of direct links between the rise of
   populism and the recent crisis in the European economies. The article
   underlines that the very economic crisis is viewed by academic community
   not as the cause of the strengthening of populist tendencies, but only
   as a catalyst, that intensifies the role of a number of other factors,
   among which ethno-cultural factor is of particular importance. Special
   attention is paid to the political scientists' views on the relationship
   between today's populism and democracy. The article argues that
   political science increasingly considers as a distinctive feature of
   contemporary populism its hostility not to democracy as such, but rather
   towards its liberal component. In conclusion, the author describes the
   populist impact on changes of the European political landscape and
   argues that these changes require a rethinking of the problem of
   differentiation the systemic political parties and populist political
   forces.},

Abstract = {This paper shows that contemporary political reasoning and action in the
   context of modern terrorism derives from moral arguments that are
   seriously flawed. Those arguments are built on a simplistic
   understanding of terrorism and exclusively adhere to `conventional'
   act-based ethical, for example, deontological or utilitarian, frameworks
   for morally assessing the political reality of terrorism and
   counter-terrorism. As a result, political reasoning and
   counter-terrorism action fail to take into account certain indispensable
   morally relevant features of terrorism. It will be argued in this paper
   that contemporary approaches are therefore unable to grasp the (moral)
   complexity of the terrorist phenomenon what ultimately leads to
   political paralysis in the domain of counter-terrorism action. In order
   to be able to include a more extended notion of morally relevant
   features of terrorism in an understanding of terrorism and consequently
   in its moral assessment, this paper develops an alternative ethical
   framework based on virtue ethics and on a eudemonistic concept of the
   good life. In a last step, this paper shows how such a comprehensive and
   integrative, virtue-ethical, framework overcomes the limitations of
   current dominant approaches and so contributes to promoting morally
   legitimate, sustainable and effective counter-terrorism action.},

Abstract = {This chapter examines British eurosceptic voting at the 2014 European
   Parliament (EP) election, analyzing British party politics, party
   competition and the role of political entrepreneurs and public
   preferences. It shows that the 2014 EP election campaign did have a
   European dimension, although not the one intended by the EP. The
   campaign was dominated by the question of the UK's continued EU
   membership and related issues, such as EU freedom of movement and UK
   borders. The analysis of United Kingdom Independence Party (UKIP) voting
   reveals both EU and domestic concerns. While voters opted for UKIP as
   they perceived it to be close to their anti-EU attitudes, that party's
   supporters also voted to express disapproval of the government,
   especially as compared to Conservative and Liberal Democrat voters.},

Abstract = {This paper presents a qualitative analysis of stories of adults who
   transitioned from being absolutely homeless to becoming housed.
   Participants' stories are particularly salient for what they reveal
   about this transition in the midst of other challenges including
   substance use, criminalization, and violence, and within a neoliberal
   social policy context. Through strategies of narrative analysis, two
   interconnected processes of becoming housed are discovered: (a)
   experiencing fateful moments; and (b) perceiving and creating social
   supports. The main conclusion is that fateful moments in individuals'
   lives intersect with the push and pull of instrumental and expressive
   supports from family, community, and the state to culminate in an exit
   from absolute homelessness. The implications of these findings for
   understanding and responding to homelessness are also discussed.},

Abstract = {In 1953, Congress supplanted the tribal civil law on some
   American-Indian reservations with the civil law of the US state in which
   they are located. In the vein of cross-national literature on law and
   finance, I demonstrate that Congress's action reduced external financial
   actors' uncertainty over the enforcement of contracts on some
   reservations. Using novel data on 20,000 home loans to tribal members
   guaranteed by a US Housing and Urban Development program (1996-2013), I
   find a causal effect at the individual level: mortgage holders governed
   by US state civil law pay consistently lower interest rates. Thus,
   externally imposed law generates long-term benefits for tribal members.
   Nonetheless, qualitative extensions suggest that neither the presence
   nor the magnitude of the effect offsets many tribes' prioritization of
   their sovereignty, rather than the individual-level economic benefits
   that can result from compromising it.},

Abstract = {This article investigates the eventual performance of critical
   resistance to neoliberal capitalism in the discourse of a marketing
   campaign that promotes the organisational form of cooperatives. Through
   discourse analysis, this article shows that the performed resistance
   activity in the campaign discourse is non-critical resistance since the
   dominant discourse of neoliberal capitalism is reproduced. The analysis
   shows that affective and economic articulations are intertwined in
   resistance through the discursive promotion of cooperation. The article
   contributes to understandings of cooperation as potential resistance to
   neoliberal capitalism, and highlights the risk of resistance
   simultaneously reproducing the power of dominant discourses.},

Abstract = {Text has always been an important data source in political science. What
   has changed in recent years is the feasibility of investigating large
   amounts of text quantitatively. The internet provides political
   scientists with more data than their mentors could have imagined, and
   the research community is providing accessible text analysis software
   packages, along with training and support. As a result, text-as-data
   research is becoming mainstream in political science. Scholars are
   tapping new data sources, they are employing more diverse methods, and
   they are becoming critical consumers of findings based on those methods.
   In this article, we first describe the four stages of a typical
   text-as-data project. We then review recent political science
   applications and explore one important methodological challenge-topic
   model instability-in greater detail.},

Abstract = {The World Trade Center burned for months after the attack. It still
   burns intemperately in the hearts of many Americans, up there with the
   Alamo for fanning patriotic fervor. For Hitchens, it was the occasion to
   decide that someone's else's country could no wrong, and to adjust his
   citizenship accordingly. In A Long Short War, his shrill and unnuanced
   polemics vented his adoptive patriotism. He attacks everyone who
   disagreed with him on the cardinal issue of uncritical support for the
   war on Iraq in quasi-Vyshinkyist fashion. He also tried to maintain all
   the old positions he held on the Left, while uncritically embracing his
   new friends ``the Pentagon Intellectuals{''} or the ``tougher thinkers
   in the Defense Department.{''} The resulting portmanteau politics are an
   uneasy and disturbing mix, not Orwellian in the emulatory sense.},

Abstract = {Social movements challenge the neoliberal economic tendencies in their
   own areas or regions and they are getting together to struggle in a more
   effective manner. These protests indicate that the established
   definitions and concepts have not run to match the people sovereignty.
   People from different places of the world raise their voices in the
   streets with different reasons and their common point is to change
   something in decision-making process which is in lacking of
   representatives. Especially the democracy under the pressure of
   neoliberal free market economy does not reflect popular demands but
   rather organizes the market relations under the control of expertise.
   Democracy is radically challenged in these latest efforts and actions.
   Because this well-known-concept does not run for people life, in
   contrast, the politics without democracy make them out of the game. The
   main argument of the study is that new movements criticize the liberal
   democracy and they create new spaces for the citizens in political
   debates against the policy process of the decision-makers or
   professionals.},

Pages = {195-218},
Abstract = {This article explores three formats for interstate relations developed
   by, or at least significantly influenced by Germany in the post-Cold War
   period: the Petersburg Dialogue, the German-Russian-Polish Trialogue and
   the Weimar Triangle. An examination of the form and function of each of
   these formats is followed by a discussion of what these formats have in
   common and why they are worthy of further study. The paper addresses
   whether this variable geometry' of Germany's foreign policy of
   trust-building is likely to survive a period of turbulent relations or
   changes in leadership and, furthermore, how the effectiveness of
   dialogues, trialogues and triangles might be evaluated.},

Abstract = {To what extent does variation in political culture influence the number
   and types of corruption issues arising in U.S. states? Drawing upon
   Daniel Elazar's enduring typology of American political subcultures and
   using a new news-based measure of corruption issues, we find that
   political culture remains a ``sticky'' deep determinant of the
   distribution of corruption issues across states. Unlike previous
   empirical studies we do not treat political culture as a set of
   consensus values, but rather emphasize tensions that can arise when
   multiple political cultures coexist in a state. Our findings are of
   interest not only with respect to the enduring role of culture itself,
   but also in terms of how it might help us understand the growing number
   of actions that are legal, yet still seen by many as corrupt.},

Abstract = {Food security has emerged as a relatively new policy issue in
   agricultural policy making in developed countries. This policy problem
   is addressed within an institutional landscape in which agricultural
   ideas and institutions are well-established. In this article, food
   security policy making in Australia and Norway is compared. In
   Australia, agricultural normalism (agricultural markets and production
   are considered to be similar to those of other economic sectors) has
   been dominant since the mid-1980s, while Norwegian agricultural policy
   making has been dominated by agricultural exceptionalism (agriculture is
   considered a unique economic sector with special market and production
   conditions). It is demonstrated in the article how these two opposing
   institutionalised ideational foundations have influenced the nature of
   the food security debate in the two countries. In Australia, the debate
   emphasises the positive role of the market and trade in providing global
   food security. In Norway, the debate highlights the need to regulate
   market forces and restrict trade in order to allow countries to develop
   their own agricultural sectors.},

   Scrutinizing the Dutch Flexible Deployment of Mobile Cameras Act},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF POLITICS AND LAW},

Volume = {10},
Number = {5},

Abstract = {The flexible deployment of drones in the public domain, is in this
   article assessed from a legal philosophical perspective. On the basis of
   theories of Dworkin and Moore the distinction between individual rights
   and collective security policy goals is discussed. Mobile cameras in the
   public domain reflect how innovative technological tools challenge
   public authorities in new ways to balance between privacy and security.
   Furthermore, the different dimensions of privacy and the distinction
   between the three types of the value of privacy are reviewed. On the
   basis of the case study of the Dutch Drones Act, the article concludes
   that the flexible deployment of mobile cameras in the public domain is
   not legitimate from a normative perspective. The legal safeguards in the
   Netherlands are insufficient to protect the value of privacy. Therefore,
   further restrictions such as prior judicial review should be considered.},

Abstract = {Since 2000, the French presidential term has been shortened so that it
   is now the same as that of the National Assembly. What is more,
   legislative elections have been scheduled to follow immediately after
   the election of the president. This article assesses the magnitude of
   the presidential coattail effects on legislative elections. We show that
   the identity of the winner at the presidential election affects
   electoral outcomes in subsequent elections in favor of the presidents'
   parties. This may happen through two channels. First, voters who have
   voted for losing candidates may abstain in the following election.
   Second, some voters-particularly those who do not strongly oppose the
   president-may join the winning side. Based on district-level electoral
   data from 2002 to 2017, we appraise the impact of presidential election
   results on turnout and voter choice in legislative elections. Our
   results highlight that winning the presidential election produces a 25\%
   increase in the votes for the winning presidential parties in
   legislative elections. Furthermore, while the decline in turnout may
   partly explain this result, we provide some clues that swing voters
   contribute considerably to the increase for presidential parties. More
   generally, this article shows that the new electoral calendar weakens
   the parliament and considerably increases the power of French
   presidents.},

Abstract = {This article tries to analyze the notable impact of the globalization on
   the sovereignty of the peoples, the democratic system, the Human rights
   and, in sum, the set of props that have supported the constitutionalism
   from his emergence at the end of the 18th century and up to the current
   days. Equally, and simultaneously that we examine the effects of the
   globalization, we seek to offer alternatives to the destruction of the
   rights and political principles that in the last centuries have been
   allowing an imperfect but progressive civil empowerment and a
   recognition every time major of the dignity of every member of the
   political community. All this from the conviction of which the
   republican thought that for so many centuries has inspired the
   constitutionalism, is today the only route to save it.},

Journal = {EUROPEAN UNION POLITICS},

Volume = {18},

Pages = {536-559},

Abstract = {Support for radical parties on both the left and right is on the rise,
   fueling intuition that both radicalisms have similar underpinnings.
   Indeed, existing studies show that radical left and right voters have
   overlapping positions and preferences. In this article, however, we
   focus on the differences in the voting bases of such parties. We show
   that radical left and right voters have sharply diverging ideological
   profiles. When it comes to the historical traditions of the left' and
   right', these voters differ radically from each other. Both groups
   express the traditions associated with their mainstream
   counterpartsparticularly with respect to (non-)egalitarian,
   (non-)altruistic, and (anti-)cosmopolitan values. Such differences also
   explain why radical left voters tend to be more, not less, educated than
   mainstream or radical right voters.},

   contribute a chapter to John Saul's book on the country's transition to
   socialism. Her initial research there turned into multiple visits during
   the 1980s, which formed the basis of And Still They Dance: Women, War,
   and the Struggle for Change in Mozambique (Monthly Review Press, 1989).
   She made her first visit to the country at the end of 1980, the second
   at the end of 1981, and a third in 1983.},

Abstract = {State governments are now the principal source of immigrant legislation
   in the US. Existing research presents contradictory findings concerning
   the sources of pro- and anti-immigration state legislation. However,
   research has not adequately accounted for the multidimensional nature of
   immigrant legislation and the fact that many variables hypothesized to
   affect state legislation encompass both within-state, time-varying
   effects and time-invariant, cross-sectional effects. Measurement and
   research design strategies to address these problems are applied to a
   dataset of state immigrant legislation approved between 2005 and 2012.
   The findings are important because they show that partisan, demographic,
   and economic effects are often different within versus across states and
   may differently affect the volume versus the relative tenor of
   legislative output.},

Abstract = {To what extent do electoral institutions influence positions on same-sex
   marriage? Debates over same-sex marriage legislation have increased
   globally for the past 20 years, yet little research focuses on either
   debates in East Asia or the effect of electoral institutions. Using an
   original dataset on Taiwanese legislators and their public stances on
   same-sex marriage, this research finds that legislators elected under
   proportional representation (PR) are consistently more likely to support
   same-sex marriage laws than their counterparts elected in single-member
   districts (SMDs), even after controlling for partisanship. The results
   here not only highlight overlooked institutional influences on support,
   but also tie the broader literature on mixed-member systems to the
   growing research on same-sex marriage rights.},

Abstract = {One of the most important and consistent findings to emerge from the
   study of immigration politics over the past decade is the seemingly
   uniform preference among mass citizenries for high-skilled immigrants.
   One potential conceptual flaw in this mounting body of literature is
   that skill is confounded with prevalence: people may prefer high-skilled
   immigrants not because they are skilled but because there are not very
   many of them. To address this possibility, we conducted an original
   experiment within a nationally representative survey of over 12,000
   respondents. We conducted three main empirical tests and found that the
   skill premium is not confounded by prevalence. However, low-skilled
   Mexican immigrants specifically are disadvantaged when people are told
   that they are prevalent, a finding that comports with extant research on
   the construction of Latino immigration as a unique threat to American
   society.},

Abstract = {The relationship between education length and voter turnout has been one
   of the most studied in the political participation literature in recent
   decades. However, few studies focus on education type, and most of the
   existing research on this topic relies on cross-sectional data. In the
   current study, we utilize a large register-based panel dataset to
   investigate the effect of education type. We find no effects of
   education type when investigating overall types of education, but we
   find substantial effects when examining a specific type of education
   program with a particularly high civic content. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {This article addresses a neglected class of cases of civic resistance
   involving the anonymous and covert disruption of institutions and
   practices. Such cases have become more commonplace in the first decades
   of the twenty-first century with the rise of ``hacktivism,{''} but they
   sit uneasily within the traditional conceptual and normative framework
   of civil disobedience the legitimacy of which is premised on the
   publicity of dissent and on the willingness of dissenters to accept the
   legal consequences of their actions. To make sense of these new forms of
   civic resistance, the article introduces the concept of ``disruptive
   disobedience.{''} It elaborates the concept by contrasting it with other
   forms of civic resistance, and proposes a moral justification for it by
   presenting it as a corrective to democratic exclusion. Finally, it tests
   that justification by applying it to a prominent contemporary case
   involving Aaron Swartz's illegal download of JSTOR research articles.},

Abstract = {In recent decades, instructors have increasingly adopted the use of
   ``serious{''} games in their classrooms. Typically, these games take the
   form of role-playing simulations or wargames. However, online
   computer-run games have opened up new possibilities: to explore complex
   conceptual relationships, to utilize and display asymmetric information,
   to be playable anywhere and by anyone, and more. This article describes
   the game, Dark Networks, and shows why this type of game is valuable as
   well as how it has been used for pedagogical gains.},

Abstract = {Government formation in the German Lander has been characterised by an
   increasing variety of different coalitions, particularly in the last few
   years. Although coalition theories are able to explain `typical'
   patterns of government formation, they are much less successful in
   explaining why political actors may, under certain circumstances, decide
   to choose new coalition options over long-standing patterns of coalition
   formation. The article analyses what conditions are either necessary or
   sufficient for the emergence of such `non-established' coalitions. It
   employs a Qualitative Comparative Analysis to study the effect of five
   different conditions on government formations in the German Lander since
   1990. The results show that especially the absence of parliamentary
   majorities for traditional Lager coalitions acts as a necessary
   condition for the formation of innovative coalitions. Additionally, the
   deselection of the current government coalition and the non-existence of
   a specific electoral mandate favouring the opposition also facilitate
   the formation of such coalitions in the vast majority of cases.},

Abstract = {The lobbying industry is frequently held out as the most unethical part
   of the American political system, corrupting the governing system for
   the benefit of special interests at the expense of the public interest
   and thus in need of stern regulation, if lobbying is permitted at all.
   But what does it mean for a lobbyist to be ``unethical,{''} or
   ``ethical{''} for that matter? Is there such a thing as ethical
   lobbying? In this paper, I argue that theoretical models of how lobbying
   works and constitutional protections of the profession, taken together,
   provide a foundation for determining what kinds of lobbying might be
   considered ethical, and why lobbyists frequently slide into ethical gray
   areas. I then use data from interviews conducted with lobbyists working
   on six issues over a period of four years to empirically test
   explanations as to why lobbyists might behave in ways that are arguably
   unethical. Finally, I end the paper by speculating on what might be done
   to constrain lobbyists into behaving ethically.},

Abstract = {The (unheralded) first step in many applications of automated text
   analysis involves selecting keywords to choose documents from a large
   text corpus for further study. Although all substantive results depend
   on this choice, researchers usually pick keywords in ad hoc ways that
   are far from optimal and usually biased. Most seem to think that keyword
   selection is easy, since they do Google searches every day, but we
   demonstrate that humans perform exceedingly poorly at this basic task.
   We offer a better approach, one that also can help with following
   conversations where participants rapidly innovate language to evade
   authorities, seek political advantage, or express creativity; generic
   web searching; eDiscovery; look-alike modeling; industry and
   intelligence analysis; and sentiment and topic analysis. We develop a
   computer-assisted (as opposed to fully automated or human-only)
   statistical approach that suggests keywords from available text without
   needing structured data as inputs. This framing poses the statistical
   problem in a new way, which leads to a widely applicable algorithm. Our
   specific approach is based on training classifiers, extracting
   information from (rather than correcting) their mistakes, and
   summarizing results with easy-to-understand Boolean search strings. We
   illustrate how the technique works with analyses of English texts about
   the Boston Marathon bombings, Chinese social media posts designed to
   evade censorship, and others.},

Abstract = {The regional security architecture in Southeast Asia, arguably even
   within the broader East Asian region, has largely revolved in the last
   25 years around the viability of the Association of Southeast Asian
   Nations (ASEAN) as the driving force behind Southeast Asian (and East
   Asian) regionalism. Multilateral institutional arrangements established
   since 1994 had the ASEAN states as their core component, and the ASEAN
   way of conducting foreign affairs as their normative guide. These
   arrangements were seen as being a critical aspect of maintaining
   peaceful relations in the region in the face of long standing disputes
   and historical suspicions. This state of affairs, underpinned by ASEAN's
   ability to provide the basis for managing regional relations, has now
   begun to unravel with the intensifying strategic competition between
   China and the United States. Is the ASEAN-driven multilateral security
   architecture sustainable in the face of intensifying great power
   competition?},

Title = {Science Diplomacy in the Indo-Pacific Region: A Mixed but Promising
   Experience},

Abstract = {Among other things, a globalizing world has challenged the old dichotomy
   between science and diplomacy and helped to facilitate the advent of
   Science Diplomacy. This term encompasses a particular form of public
   diplomacy and refers to the use of scientific collaborations among
   nations to tackle common challenges. Science Diplomacy operates on the
   assumption that many of today's problemsfood, water, energy, climate,
   and healthcannot be solved by any single state and, more often than not,
   require international technical or scientific solutions. Does Science
   Diplomacy represent a major paradigm change or simply a minor adjustment
   in the making of foreign policy? In the Indo-Pacific, the need for
   Science Diplomacy is clear, but at present there are mixed signals on
   whether states in the region are really prepared to develop its
   potential. On one hand, the Square Kilometre Array projectthe
   construction of a large radio telescope in Australia and South Africa
   from 2018represents a good example of a multilateral diplomatic effort
   to facilitate and extend scientific collaboration to dramatically
   improve human capabilities to survey the sky. On the other, science
   diplomacy has so far largely failed to live up to its potential to
   address climate change, the most significant threat to the future of the
   Indo-Pacific region and the world beyond. However, successful efforts to
   make Ross Sea a global marine sanctuary also shows that, despite
   obstacles, Science Diplomacy can sometime have spillover effects into
   political decision making with positive outcomes. This mixed picture
   highlights a paradox. While the emergence of Science Diplomacy reflects
   a recognition by states that a growing number of national problems
   require international scientific solutions, such recognition remains
   patchy and somewhat uneven. Many states, particularly the most powerful
   ones, continue to be constrained in the international arena by the old
   Westphalian idea of unfettered state sovereignty.},

Year = {2017},
Volume = {61},
Number = {4},
Pages = {892-907},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {A hallmark finding in the study of public opinion is that many citizens
   approach the political realm with one-sided attitudes that color their
   judgments, making attitude change difficult. This finding highlights the
   importance of citizens with weak prior attitudes, since they might
   represent a segment of the electorate that is more susceptible to
   influence. The judgment processes of citizens with weak attitudes,
   however, are poorly understood. Drawing from dual-process models in
   psychology, I test the idea that citizens with weak explicit attitudes
   rely on implicit attitudes as they render political judgments. I find
   support for this conjecture in experimental and observational data.
   There are two main contributions. First, I show that an important and
   understudied segment of the electorate arrives at political decisions
   via automatic (but nonetheless predictable) mental processes. Second, I
   characterize the conditions under which implicit political attitudes
   matter more and less.},

Abstract = {We explore the impact of campaign effort on constituency-level turnout
   variation in Britain, under the premise that higher levels of campaign
   visibility stimulate electoral participation. We focus on the
   relationship between the competitiveness of the race and campaign effort
   as a provider of electoral information on the one hand, and voter
   turnout on the other hand. In doing so, we address the role of campaign
   effort and competitiveness in shaping turnout both independently as well
   as jointly. Further to this, we seek to add nuance to our understanding
   of how electoral campaigns mobilise voters by evaluating the comparative
   ability of different parties - based on whether or not they are `viable'
   contenders in a particular constituency - to stimulate turnout. We find
   evidence that campaign effort mobilises voters and has a significant
   positive effect on voter turnout; this effect is independent from, and
   unconditioned by, the competitiveness of the race. However, we do find
   that this effect is mostly driven by the campaign effort of the `viable'
   contenders in the constituency.},

Abstract = {This paper proposes to investigate the influence of legislative quotas
   on gender differences in political participation by analyzing the
   within- and across-country effects of quotas. Gender quotas can signal
   to women that their presence in politics is welcome, leading to a
   subsequent increase in their involvement in political activities. This
   change in political behavior should not be reproduced in men; thus, when
   gender quotas are present, the gap between men's and women's
   participation narrows. Using the European Values Survey and data from
   eighteen European democracies, this paper demonstrates that this indeed
   occurs for some political activities when gender gaps are compared
   before and after the introduction of quotas within countries. This
   result, however, is not replicated for across-country analyses. European
   countries without legislative gender quotas tend to have smaller gender
   gaps than countries with them. This result is explained by referring to
   the context of the adoption of gender quotas.},

Abstract = {This article reconstructs the intense cycle of workers' protest of the
   Summer of 1946 and its impact on the Chilean political system. Focusing
   on the Bulnes Square massacre and the national work stoppages of January
   30 and February 4, it argues that the government established new
   repressive mechanisms to neutralize dissent, discipline the labor
   movement, and impose social peace after the end of World War II. To
   achieve this purpose, the article relies on primary sources rarely
   analyzed before, such as reports of the Trade Union and Confidential
   Section of the Investigations Police of Chile and the court record of
   the Bulnes Square massacre, in addition to hemerographic sources.},

Journal = {SCANDINAVIAN POLITICAL STUDIES},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {40},
Number = {3},
Pages = {247-264},

Abstract = {Recent studies find that defection from one's most preferred party to
   some other party is as common under proportional representation (PR) as
   it is in plurality systems. It is less elaborated how election-specific
   contextual factors affect strategic vote choice under PR. This study
   looks at the impact of two potentially important contextual factors:
   parties' coalition signals about cooperation with other parties
   (referred to as pre-electoral coalitions') and polling information,
   which vary from one election to the next. The focus is strategic voting
   for smaller parties at risk of falling below an electoral threshold. The
   hypothesis is that parties that are included in well-defined coalitions
   will benefit from strategic insurance' votes if the polls show that they
   have support slightly below the threshold. However, smaller parties that
   do not belong to a coalition would be less likely to benefit from
   insurance votes. Extensive survey experiments with randomized coalition
   signals and polls give support to the idea that a voter's tendency to
   cast an insurance vote depends on whether the polls show support below
   or above the threshold and whether the party is included in a coalition
   or not.},

Abstract = {According to the Iranian Constitutional Constitution, the parliament was
   considered as the foundation of Constitutionalism and was supposed to
   realize the most important goal of the Constitutionalists, namely
   controlling the absolute power of the Shah through defining a recognized
   law and supervising its enforcement. Such a process took place in Iran
   and Constitutional Revolution was a product of it. The present paper is
   trying to investigate the role and impacts of Tehran's Bazaar (market)
   on the first Constitutionalist parliament. In doing so, after fully
   describing the context of the study, the required data is gathered
   through descriptive - analytical approach. The findings of this study
   show that members of the Tehran's Bazaar is in line with the different
   social groups, by pressuring the Shah of Iran forced him to acknowledge
   their demands and played a considerable role in establishing the first
   Constitutional parliament of the country.},

Abstract = {Given the methodological sophistication of the debate over the political
   resource cursethe purported negative relationship between natural
   resource wealth (in particular oil wealth) and democracyit is surprising
   that scholars have not paid more attention to the basic statistical
   issue of how to deal with missing data. This article highlights the
   problems caused by the most common strategy for analyzing missing data
   in the political resource curse literaturelistwise deletionand
   investigates how addressing such problems through the best-practice
   technique of multiple imputation affects empirical results. I find that
   multiple imputation causes the results of a number of influential recent
   studies to converge on a key common finding: A political resource curse
   does exist, but only since the widespread nationalization of petroleum
   industries in the 1970s. This striking finding suggests that much of the
   controversy over the political resource curse has been caused by a
   neglect of missing-data issues.},

Abstract = {What do we mean when we say populism? Is populism a threat for democracy
   or a contribution to improve a system whose performance falls below our
   expectations? This essay seeks to find an answer to these questions.
   Keeping the available literature in mind, it shall reflect on populism
   myths before presenting a new concept of populism. A concept based on
   fight for hegemony. The essay argues that, on one hand, there is no
   democracy without populism, and on the other hand, populism can
   represent both a threat and a chance for democracy. Moreover, it shall
   analyze the reality of populism and democracy in the European Union by
   crosschecking the data of the Authoritarian Populism Index and the
   Democracy Index, without forgetting the last reports on the citizens'
   satisfaction degree with the functioning of democracy and per capita
   income. This is a relevant theme at a time when the populist parties
   have popped up in some democracies, share, or occupy the power in some
   EU countries, and in one case both the ruling party and the one leading
   the opposition are of populist nature. A populist democracy.},

Abstract = {Values and elements of popular culture play an important role in shaping
   and implementing the foreign policy of Iran. In this paper, using
   content analysis and after explaining the characteristics of Iranian
   identity, the author seeks to investigate the implications of Iranian
   social beliefs on foreign policy. In other words, the author sets out to
   explore whether the perceptions and attitudes of Iranian identity at
   different historical periods have been the basis according to which
   Iranian politicians have followed the same model or not? For this
   purpose, three major components, the influence in the regional area,
   xenophobia, and conspiracy theory that are complementary in nature, have
   been selected. Research findings illustrate that the long history of
   societies like Iran has been the raison d'etre for the recurrence of
   social beliefs and values in various political eras of such societies.},

Abstract = {State-corporate crime research has been critiqued for fetishizing events
   and specific institutional arrangements. In recent years, this tendency
   has been changing as researchers are increasingly transcending the
   empiricist orthodoxy by giving more attention to relations and processes
   behind events and institutional arrangements. This is evidenced in the
   UK by the work of Steve Tombs, David Whyte and Kristian Lasslett. Their
   complementary concepts of ``state-corporate crime symbiosis{''} and
   ``regimes of permission{''} direct the analysis of social harm at
   systemic relations and processes expressed through state and corporate
   practices constitutive of capitalism. Following from this, Kristian
   Lasslett's application of Marxist dialectic to the study of state crime
   provides a scientific vantage point for the analysis advocated by Tombs
   and Whyte. Drawing lessons from their works, the article attempts a
   Marxist dialectical analysis of the Bt cotton and its contribution to
   the agrarian crisis in India.},

Abstract = {The result of the 2017 general election was widely expected to be a
   foregone conclusion, namely a comfortable, probably landslide,
   re-election for Theresa May's Conservative Party, and an electoral
   disaster for Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party which would irrevocably prove
   the futility of campaigning on a radical Left-wing programme in Britain:
   it would be like 1983 all over again. Yet when the Exit Poll was
   announced at 22.00 on 8 June 2017, it was apparent that the election had
   produced one of the biggest shocks in British electoral history. The
   Conservatives had actually lost their previous narrow parliamentary
   majority, while the Labour Party had made significant and wholly
   unexpected advances. Most of the opinion polls had entirely failed to
   predict this outcome. This article examines Labour's performance in one
   of the most astonishing British general elections ever, and explains how
   the Party confounded expectations, and stunned Corbyn's many vociferous
   critics in the process. In so doing, it will examine the critical
   importance of the election campaign itself, the extent to which Labour
   voters prioritised different issues to their Conservative counterparts,
   the scale of Labour's support not only among younger voters, but more
   surprisingly among professions in the AB socioeconomic category, and the
   way in which the Labour leader's television and social media appearances
   seemed to counteract some of the negative press coverage he received.},

Abstract = {Rates of foreign direct investment (FDI) to Africa are increasing, yet
   little is known about how this will affect the political environment.
   One possibility, explored here, is that increasing levels of FDI within
   developing states will incentivize state conflict activity. Using an
   instrumental strategy, we show that in states with a low regard for
   civil liberties, or with unhealthy economies (i.e. states with a cash
   deficit), increased access to investment is associated with a higher
   number of conflict actions by the state. We argue that access to
   investment can push regimes into using violent strategies to secure
   their internal environment and to ensure their survival, specifically in
   their engaging in conflict against opposition and armed combatants. This
   underscores the need for extensive monitoring of state behavior
   following the receipt of investment, similar to the oversight of
   conditional aid.},

Abstract = {Genealogies of governance have a significant contribution to make to
   studies of the European Union (EU). Genealogies denaturalize relations
   of rule by revealing the overlooked or hidden history of the practices
   and knowledges that underpin the exercise of political power. They also
   sensitize us to little shifts in practices that are often overlooked by
   general theories of governance. This argument is developed through a
   critical analysis of EUROSUR, a project the EU has recently launched to
   enhance and better integrate border surveillance capabilities at EU
   external frontiers. The paper has three aims. First, to enhance the
   intelligibility of EUROSUR through a historical focus on one if its key
   concepts, situational awareness. Second, to explore the relationship
   between this concept, its material infrastructure, and the emergence of
   a new time-space that I call the situation. This time-space materializes
   in contexts where information, infrastructure, and reaction capabilities
   combine in such a way that social events and emergencies can be
   monitored and acted upon in near real time: a state of affairs I call
   `live governance'. Finally, the paper asks what is at stake when we
   write genealogies of very contemporary, fluid regimes of power. It
   concludes that EUROSUR is better analysed as a dynamic and experimental
   assemblage of elements rather than the kind of relatively stable and
   enduring apparatus that interested Foucault. Describing it as an
   assemblage is intended to counterbalance the tendency, evident in some
   areas of security studies, to overestimate the solidity of new
   governance arrangements.},

Abstract = {This article critically examines the predominant narratives which
   emanate from political discourse in relation to two significant events
   in Scotland in 2014 - the Glasgow Commonwealth Games and the
   independence referendum. This article uses an analysis of the political
   discourse from the two largest parties in the Scottish Parliament at the
   time of the Games, the pro-independence Scottish National Party (SNP)
   and the pro-union Scottish Labour Party, to highlight the contrasting
   discursive strategies of each party within their manifestos, policy
   documents, press releases and parliamentary speeches. This analysis
   demonstrates that each party portrayed nuanced positions on the Games,
   with the SNP illustrating the constraining nature of the constitutional
   status quo in relation to the potential economic and social benefits of
   the Games, and Labour using the event to illustrate the effectiveness of
   their stewardship of the Glasgow City Council despite the council
   funding cuts imposed by the SNP-led Scottish Government. Despite
   acknowledging the marginal status of the Games on the eventual outcome
   of the referendum, both parties suggested that the success of the event
   could lead to a `feel-good factor' which could boost the `Yes' vote.
   Such questionable claims are evaluated in light of past academic studies
   which question the validity of legacy outcomes from sporting events such
   as the Games (e.g. Giulianotti, 2016; Horne, 2007; Horne and
   Manzenreiter, 2006; Martin and Barth, 2013; Stewart and Rayner, 2016;
   Zimbalist, 2015).},

Abstract = {What motivates authoritarian regimes to crack down on corruption? We
   argue that just as partisan competition in democracies tends to
   politicize corruption, authoritarian leaders may exploit anticorruption
   campaigns to target rivals' power networks during internal power
   struggles for consolidating their power base. We apply this theoretical
   framework to provincial leadership turnover in China and test it using
   an anticorruption data set. We find that intraelite power competition,
   captured by the informal power configuration of government incumbents
   and their predecessors, can increase investigations of corrupt senior
   officials by up to 20\%. The intensity of anticorruption propaganda
   exhibits a similar pattern. The findings indicate that informal politics
   can propel strong anticorruption drives in countries without
   democratically accountable institutions, although these drives tend to
   be selective, arbitrary, and factionally biased.},

Abstract = {This article explores the nature of the main opposition parties to the
   incumbent hegemonic regimes in Malaysia and Singapore. I argue that the
   differing characters of these opposition parties should be considered.
   In Singapore, where there is no ideological challenge to the ruling
   party, I contend that even if the opposition takes over it will be the
   end of a hegemonic party but not hegemony. In Malaysia, the opposite is
   true. This article contributes to the literature on transition theory in
   two ways: (1) it recognizes the diversity of authoritarian regimes and
   enhances analyses of various authoritarian regimes by focusing on one
   type - hegemonic parties; and (2) it brings ideology into the reckoning
   by focusing on the nature of the opposition parties most likely to take
   over.},

Abstract = {After 1991, Russia, heir to the Soviet Union, remains a strong State
   within the world order and maintains considerable human and natural
   resources. This situation allows Russia to impose her will over some of
   the neighboring States. However, Russia cannot longer be considered a
   superpower: the crisis of her rule and society debilitated her. Even
   after the economic recovery and stabilization, which began in 1990, this
   State no longer has a dominant position to impose a socio-economic or
   political model. Despite the aforementioned situation, Russia's
   capability and political will to have an influential position within
   international politics make of her a ``Great Power{''} in the
   traditional sense of the word. Consequently, Russia leaves a privileged
   position within international relations to the United States of America,
   making of the latter a ``hyperpower{''}. Such a situation allows
   Washington to exercise her leadership over a significant number of
   States - those ruled by democracies- and to pose a more dominant model.
   Bearing this in mind, the article analyzes the situation of Russia
   during the administration of Boris Yeltsin and the beginning of the
   presidency of Vladimir Putin, periods known for the efforts to
   consolidate a strong and prosperous State, both internally and in
   relation to other countries.},

   that justice is the result of how the political constitution and the
   social and economic institutions distribute the positions and positions

Abstract = {Serious election forecasting has become a routine activity in most
   Western democracies, with various methodologies employed, for example,
   polls, models, prediction markets, and citizen forecasting. In the
   Netherlands, however, election forecasting has limited itself to the use
   of polls, mainly because other approaches are viewed as too complicated,
   given the great fragmentation of the Dutch party system. Here we
   challenge this view, offering the first structural forecasting model of
   legislative elections there. We find that a straightforward Political
   Economy equation managed an accurate forecast of the 2017 contest,
   clearly besting the efforts of the pollsters.},

Abstract = {In this article, we argue that authoritarianism will be associated with
   reduced political interest and participation to a greater extent among
   those who identify with the left rather than the right because
   left-leaning politicswhich challenges the status quothreatens more
   instability and flux. Using data from the United States, we provide
   evidence for this first hypothesis. Using multinational European data,
   we also provide support for a second hypothesis that this interaction
   would be more evident in Westernized contexts, where the traditional
   left-right difference is clearly defined, than in Eastern European
   countries, where its meaning is less distinct; and we conceptually
   replicate the authoritarianism results using a measure of support for
   conservation values favoring security, conformity, and tradition.
   Together, these results suggest that the lower visibility of left-wing
   authoritarianism relative to its counterpart on the right may be due in
   part to greater withdrawal from politics among left-leaning
   authoritarians.},

Abstract = {Religious norms can undermine the effects of property rights
   institutions. Districts in colonial India that provided widows with
   rights to inherit the joint-family property of their deceased husband
   had significantly higher widow immolations than districts that did not.
   Religious elites (Brahmins) burnt disproportionately more widows, and
   widow immolations were higher in regions with a higher density of
   religious elites. The findings indicate that egalitarianism requires
   egalitarians. Elite norms embedded in religion can mediate the effects
   of property rights and lead to negative consequences.},

Abstract = {Affluent Americans support more conservative economic policies than the
   nonaffluent, and government responds disproportionately to these views.
   Yet little is known about the emergence of these consequential views. We
   develop, test, and find support for a theory of class cultural norms:
   These preferences are partly traceable to socialization that occurs on
   predominantly affluent college campuses, especially those with norms of
   financial gain, and especially among socially embedded students. The
   economic views of the student's cohort also matter, in part
   independently of affluence. We use a large panel data set with a high
   response rate and more rigorous causal inference strategies than
   previous socialization studies. The affluent campus effect holds with
   matching, among students with limited school choice, and in a natural
   experiment; and it passes placebo tests. College socialization partly
   explains why affluent Americans support economically conservative
   policies.},

Abstract = {The ability of citizens to advance arguments and have them considered
   fairly is essential to the equality and epistemic quality of
   deliberative institutions. This article builds on game-theoretic models
   of strategic information transmission to offer a theory of how the
   interests that deliberators have in the outcome of deliberation can
   reduce the influence of some citizens in deliberative process.
   Specifically, this article argues that the influence of an argument
   depends on whether the deliberator making the argument is in the
   majority or minority in terms of her interests in the outcome of
   deliberation. An argument made by a member of the minority will be less
   influential than the same argument made by a member of the majority. We
   offer the first empirical test of this kind of model in realistic
   deliberative conditions using a laboratory experiment and a field
   experiment and find support for this theory.},

Title = {Postliberalism: The New Centre Ground of British Politics},
Journal = {POLITICAL QUARTERLY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {88},
Number = {3},
Pages = {500-509},
Month = {JUL-SEP},
Abstract = {Brexit and support for anti-establishment insurgencies suggest that
   British politics is moving away from the old left-right opposition
   towards a new divide between the defenders and detractors of progressive
   liberalism. As this article suggests, progressive liberalism differs
   significantly from both classical and new liberalism. It fuses
   free-market economics with social egalitarianism and identity politics.
   Both the hard left and the radical right reject this combination and
   want to undo a number of liberal achievements. British politics is also
   moving in a postliberal direction. In the economy, postliberalism
   signals a shift from rampant market capitalism to economic justice and
   reciprocity. In society, it signals a shift from individualism and
   egalitarianism to social solidarity and fraternal relations. And
   politically, it signals a shift from the minority politics of vested
   interests and balkanised group identity to a majority politics based on
   a balance of interests, shared identity and the embedding of state and
   market in the intermediary institutions of civil society. This article
   argues that postliberalism is redefining Britain's political centre
   ground in an age where neither progressive liberalism nor reactionary
   anti-liberalism commands majority support. First, it charts the
   ascendancy of progressive liberalism over the past quarter-century.
   Second, it contrasts anti-liberal reactions with postliberal
   alternatives, before exploring why earlier iterations of postliberalism
   failed to gain traction with the political mainstream. Third, it
   provides a discussion and critique of Theresa May's postliberal
   conservatism, notably the tension between free-market globalisation and
   free trade, on the one hand, and the support for national industry and
   the indigenous working class, on the other.},

Abstract = {Consociational theory posits that political elites in divided societies
   will show a stronger spirit of accommodation' than the groups they
   represent, and that this prudent leadership on behalf of the elites
   explains why divided societies hold together. Belgium has long been
   considered to be one of the best examples of such a consociational
   democracy. Yet in this country the spirit of accommodation of prudent
   leaders was questioned and discussed publicly during the 2010-11
   political gridlock. The question is therefore whether Belgian political
   elites are indeed less radical and hold less extreme views than voters,
   as suggested by consociational theory. To explore this question, this
   article relies on survey data gathered during the historically long
   government negotiations of 2010-11 between members of all six Belgian
   assemblies. This original data set on MPs is compared with data on
   voters gathered in 2009 and 2014 in order to contrast their views on the
   reform of Belgium's federalism. The results show that voters are less
   radical than MPs on this question, but the data also reveal that MPs are
   strongly divided within communities and also within party. Neither
   communities nor parties are monolithic blocks.},

   situation of displaced persons from Colombia, attended by the Jesuit

   is use, whose findings show that the displaced are civilian victims not
   involved in the armed conflict, but suffer the consequences, as these
   events affect your life: personal, cultural, social, educational
   identity and fragmenting the families; complicating their present and
   doing more uncertain the future of children and adolescents, especially
   in the educational aspect, since the displacement means an abrupt
   interruption of human development, quality of life and directly affects
   education. That is why, the Jesuit Refugee Service believes that access
   to education a fundamental right and a means to build peace and
   development therefore involved to educational purposes, to improve the
   conditions of life and work of the people who are in a situation of
   displaced persons.},

Abstract = {The political alliance Cambiemos (PRO) has recently become part of the
   Argentinean national government by winning, among others, in historical
   strongholds of the Peronist movement such as the province of Buenos
   Aires. The triumph of PRO breaks with the historical difficulty of the
   right to gain access to power by electoral means. This situation, which
   was unexpected by a large segment of the social sciences, undoubtedly
   reopens the debate about the scope and nature of the political process
   in the making. The article proposes an analysis of political discourse
   in order to demonstrate the formation of a discourse that tends to hide
   the conflictive dimension of politics and replaces it with a
   consensualist conception while being based on an ahistorical perspective
   on the past as an essential element of the story.},

Abstract = {European Jewish history from 1789-1939 supports the view that
   construction of national identities even in secular liberal states was
   determined not only by modern considerations alone but also by ancient
   patterns of thought, behaviour and prejudice. Emancipation stimulated
   unprecedented patriotism, especially in wartime, as Jews strove to prove
   loyalty to their countries of citizenship. During World War I, even
   Zionists split along national lines, as did families and friends. Jewish
   patriotism was interchangeable with nationalism inasmuch as Jews
   identified themselves with national cultures. Although emancipation
   implied acceptance and an end to anti-Jewish prejudice in the modern
   liberal state, the kaleidoscopic variety of Jewish patriotism throughout
   Europe inadvertently undermined the idea of national identity and often
   provoked anti-Semitism. Even as loyal citizens of separate states, the
   Jews, however scattered, disunited and diverse, were made to feel, often
   unwillingly, that they were one people in exile.},

Abstract = {Aim: The present study aims to demonstrate the passive and active impact
   for the regional role of Qatar which played heavily on the Middle East
   countries through the limitations and capabilities possessed by the
   performance of this regional role towards the countries of the region's
   issues that could be detrimental to the strategic interests.
   Methodology: The researcher fellowed a descriptive analytical
   methodology for description and analysis of a scientific phenomenon of
   Qatar's role on the Middle East countries through the limitations and
   capabilities possessed by the performance of this regional role towards
   the countries of the region's issues that could be detrimental to the
   strategic interests. Results: The current study has revealed 3 main
   points: 1st The national policy regional and international roles
   selectors are not in accordance with the standards of the international
   force generally accepted in the political and strategic doctrine, 2nd
   The Consequent obligations calculated in the framework of the
   competition between the major powers, but according to the size of the
   state in terms of the location, population and limited capabilities in
   the regional competition and 3rd was that Physical force, and political
   statesmanship can be substituted in the diplomatic game management, all
   the way to the strategic goals and the task of maintaining the state and
   its political system that burgles them, not by the big powers, but by
   competing regional powers to dominate the region. Conclusion: Qatar
   plays a key role in the Middle East region. This role mainly connected
   to the size of determinants, elements, and potentials, which constitute
   the elements of the State of Qatar's power. The size of the impact of
   the State's role could be expected, according to the tasks have been
   undertaken by the State, which depend on the potentials of the state.},

   Who Do Not Compromise},

Abstract = {In American politics, legislative compromise is often seen as a
   necessary and desirable aspect of policymaking, yet people also value
   politicians who stick to their positions. In this article, we consider
   these conflicting expectations of legislators and ask two intertwined
   questions: what conditions lead people to punish legislators for not
   compromising (when legislative action is at stake) and, conversely, what
   conditions leave people more willing to overlook a legislator's
   unwillingness to engage in compromise? Relying on previous research, we
   suggest that legislator gender, legislator partisanship, and issue area
   may all affect which legislators are punished for not compromising.
   Relying on two national experiments, we demonstrate that the extent to
   which lawmakers are punished for not compromising is conditional on the
   intersection of the three factors in this study. In general, our results
   suggest that people may be most willing to overlook unwillingness to
   engage in compromise when party, gender and issue ownership align than
   when party, gender, and issue ownership are at odds.},

Abstract = {How do the survival incentives facing incumbents in hybrid regimes
   affect the engineering of bureaucratic reforms? This article tackles
   this question by departing from the literature on competitive
   authoritarianism and with the help of detailed empirical evidence from
   Georgia's public administration reforms (2004-2012). It first argues
   that in order to preserve their hold on power, dominant parties have to
   tilt the political playing field, while still upholding popular support.
   I posit that this dual incentive structure leads the incumbents to
   promote efficiency of public service, but to also curb these policies at
   a point that would jeopardize their ability to use administrative
   resources for partisan ends. Consequently, bureaucratic reforms reach a
   saturation point, beyond which no more reforms can be endured.},

   development and growing assertiveness of particular states in terms of
   their various strategies and tactics. It critically analyses the
   efficacy of `New Warsaw Pacts' concepts and argues that in the Central
   and Eastern European area, we observe a specific form of a post-Cold War
   multi-polarity, whereby interstate rivalry is becoming increasingly more
   complex. The term of `Beggar Imperialism' is utilized as a possibly
   useful description of a specific form geopolitical strategy shown by the
   example of Poland.},

Abstract = {This study examines lobbying activity during four California
   policymaking processes and through the four institutional venues
   available in that state: the legislative, executive, and judicial
   branches, and the ballot initiative. It shows that past advocacy
   activity explains future mobilization on the same policy issue. Groups
   that fail to reach their policy goals will be more likely to mobilize
   later if the policy process changes venue, compared with those that have
   achieved their policy preference. Thus, the availability of multiple
   venues provides a counterweight to the possible advantages received by
   certain group types in each venue. Furthermore, public interest groups
   are more likely to mobilize across venues and repeatedly within a venue,
   while business groups are less likely to do so.},

Abstract = {Russia's Eurasian view of the world brings together anti-Western and
   state-centric elements. Placed at the center of its own geo-political
   sphere of influence and civilizational milieu, Russia's worldview is
   self-contained and insular. What Russian policy slights is the global
   context in which its primacy over a heterogeneous Eurasia is embedded
   and which, when disregarded, can impose serious costs. This paper traces
   the broad contours of Russia's geopolitical and civilizational
   Eurasianism, linking it to earlier scholarship on regions and
   civilization. We also explore selected aspects of Russia's foreign
   security (Crimea and Ukraine) and economic (energy) policies as well as
   the constraints they encounter in an increasingly global world that
   envelops Russia and Eurasia in a larger context.},

Abstract = {Turkey has faced a number of challenges in the recent past, but the
   government has acted swiftly and successfully to limit the impact on the
   economy. However, in order to generate sustainable growth in the
   country, structural reforms are required to enhance the competitiveness
   of the economy. This article looks at how Turkey can take advantage of
   its significant human capital potential in order to improve
   competitiveness and attract foreign direct investment (FDI), and details
   activities the European Bank of Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) is
   undertaking in the area of inclusion to help the country build a
   sustainable growth model.},

Title = {Workers-as-consumers: Rethinking the political economy of use-value and

Journal = {CAPITAL AND CLASS},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {41},
Number = {2},
Pages = {315-332},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {The relationship between the working class and consumer culture is
   undoubtedly contentious and often held as problematic in Marxist
   critical theory, owing to the exploitative nature of the mass production
   that facilitates consumption. Consequently, consumption sometimes
   appears as a distraction from the inequality perpetuated during the
   accumulation of capital, and thus as a social problem with normative
   undertones. As I reiterate in this article, however, workers are not
   simultaneously consumers because they have been inundated with consumer
   culture and advertising, but because they are separated from the means
   of production and must resort to exchange to reproduce their
   labour-power. As a result, they seek commodities as use-values, which is
   altogether different from a capitalist's desire to realise
   exchange-value in the sale of commodities. This article is an attempt at
   examining the contradictions that arise in working-class interests in
   consumption, in order to illustrate why the act of consumption does not
   necessarily engender the continuous reproduction of capital, and thus of
   exploitation.},

Abstract = {This article examines the durability of neoliberalism in the face of
   crisis by analysing the Building the Education Revolution (BER), a key
   part of the Australian Labor Government's stimulus measures in response
   to the global financial crisis in 2009. The fiscal stimulus measures
   enacted by governments in the aftermath of the crisis led many
   commentators to herald the end of neoliberalism. By examining the design
   of the BER, however, this article finds that one of the key policy tools
   of neoliberalism - the outsourcing of public sector capacity - was
   extended through such stimulus programs. The article argues that a
   materialist analysis of neoliberalism is better able to understand this
   phenomenon than the recent tendency to analyse neoliberalism in
   ideational terms.},

Abstract = {The main aim of this paper is to prove that religious communities can
   play a vital role in building peace and trust among conflict-divided
   societies such as Bosnia and Herzegovina. A special focus has been put
   on five municipalities in East Bosnia that survived the genocide, ethnic
   cleansing and mass deportation. Enforcement, peacekeeping, agreement
   making, and institution and capacity-building are the main elements that
   have to be taken into consideration in the process of peacebuilding. The
   peacebuilding process is challenged in East Bosnia due to the lack of
   desire on the part of the Serbian Orthodox Church to take part and be
   involved in a joint peacebuilding process with the Islamic Community.},

Abstract = {Since the 1960s, Manipur has been plagued by Meitei secessionist
   movements demanding/striving for independence from India. However, in
   the 1990s, following the upsurge of Naga ethnicity-based autonomy
   movement within the state and its counter movements by other groups, the
   secessionist movement was embroiled in internal feuds. In this process,
   grouping and regrouping of tribal communities had taken place, impinged
   by the predatory elites for their political and economic interests.
   Unfortunately, the state's interventions failed to contain protracted
   conflicts; they rather compounded the situation, gave rise to hybrid
   ethnic identities and led to the recurrence of demands for internal
   autonomy.},

Journal = {IRISH POLITICAL STUDIES},

Volume = {32},

Abstract = {Ireland's national climate law, the Climate Action and Low Carbon
   Development Act, was enacted in December 2015. It forms part of a
   broader trend of countries enacting overarching national framework
   climate change legislation, with the UK Climate Change Act of 2008
   considered to be the pioneering legislation. This article seeks to
   answer two questions. First, to what extent did Irish policy-makers and
   other stakeholders draw explicitly on the example of the UK Climate
   Change Act in developing the Irish climate law? Second, to what extent
   was the development of the climate law in Ireland characterised by
   convergence towards the UK Climate Change Act, and how can we explain
   the observed level of convergence? Using a framework drawn from policy
   diffusion studies, the article argues that the development of Irish
   climate legislation can be characterised as partial policy diffusion
   from UK. The broad concept of overarching national climate legislation
   travelled from the UK, as did certain limited design features. However,
   domestic politics - in particular vigorous lobbying by business and
   farming groups - and divergent circumstances constrained the process of
   policy diffusion.},

   of feedback on assessed work, dissatisfaction expressed by students
   remains visible. This article draws upon the preliminary findings of a
   Higher Education Academy Collaborative Research Project on assessment
   feedback within two large political science and international relations
   departments. It offers a critical review of current feedback practices
   and processes and identifies four key issues negativity,
   transferability, intelligibility, and consistency that require attention
   in order to deliver more effective assessment feedback. The article also
   suggests practical ways forward in addressing these issues, highlighting

Abstract = {In this article I focus on those aspects of Keith Dowding's book that
   are most concerned with interpretive approaches to the study of
   politics. I argue that, in ways not adequately captured by Dowding's
   descriptions, the historical study of political concepts tells us
   something about their historical political effects and for this reason
   has a distinct value for how we think about and study politics.
   Furthermore, I argue, concepts of and about politics, including the
   concepts of political science, cannot be fully separated from the
   political contexts of which they are a part. Concepts which function as
   generalisable explanations at one point in time can shape the thinking
   and behaviour of political actors and thus be very particular causes. A
   philosophy or method of political science unaware of or inattentive to
   this dimension of politics and political science is incomplete.},

Abstract = {This article traces the limits of branding as a tool for
   (re)constructing nations as `imagined communities' (Anderson 1983).
   Drawing on examples from post-socialist Eastern Europe, I analyse
   discourses and practices of nation branding from a critical perspective,
   rooted in the theoretical traditions of political economy and cultural
   studies. Focusing more closely on branding campaigns implemented by
   post-Soviet Ukraine and post-war Kosovo - two nations seeking to assert
   themselves as independent actors on the global stage - I consider the
   impact of nation branding on national identities and democratic
   governance. I identify three interconnected limits of the branded
   national imagination as a structuring discourse for nation building.
   First, the branded national imagination is structured through its
   subjection to a foreign gaze; second, it is heavily dependent on
   commercial transnational media; and third, it produces branded national
   subjectivities that contradict the lived experiences of national
   populations. I argue that while nation branding effectively
   depoliticises national (re)definition, it may in fact serve to
   reinvigorate ethnic nationalisms in the post-socialist region. Finally,
   I suggest that although we must be aware of local histories and
   legacies, the post-socialist experience can inform our understanding of
   the structuring limits of the branded national imagination in other
   post-conflict and post-colonial contexts as well.},

Abstract = {South Africa's 2011 White Paper on foreign policy, ``Building a Better
   World{''}, is predicated on the far-reaching ambition of how Ubuntu
   (humanity) and Batho Pele (putting people first) together with their
   underlying humanist principles will guide the country's external
   relations. However, while noble, this calculus is poorly conceived as an
   approach to global issues. The article argues that while still a
   relatively successful nation brand if measured by marketing indicators,
   South Africa's normative currency and agency in foreign policy has
   depreciated considerably, with a direct bearing on its nation brand and
   identity. These are examined with regard to the security of citizens and
   the personality of the state and provide a register of the branding and
   image deficits of the White Paper. Such deficits are then considered in
   terms of the cosmopolitan vision in South Africa's foreign policy and
   its moral and normative underpinnings. The article provides examples in
   both the domestic and global regimes to demonstrate the extent to which
   South Africa has lost its normative resilience in the conduct of its
   foreign policy, thus giving rise to ambiguities in its brand image and
   identity.},

Abstract = {This article uses data collected across the four Waves of the National
   Income Dynamics Study (NIDS) to construct a measure of social cohesion
   for South Africa. We compare our index to one derived using the
   Afrobarometer data and find a large degree of consistency in trends in
   the index and its constituent components over time across the two
   datasets. However, there is less consistency in the measures once one
   moves to lower levels of geographic disaggregation. We also find far
   less variability in the constructed index relying on NIDS panel data as
   opposed to the repeated cross-sections from Afrobarometer. Having
   derived the index, we then correlate it with a variety of indicators of
   social and economic well-being. We show that higher levels of education,
   per capita income and employment are positively associated with higher
   social cohesion whilst social cohesion is negatively associated with
   poverty, service delivery protest and perceptions of crime. In addition,
   municipal policy and competence are closely associated with higher
   social cohesion. Whilst this work is exploratory, it is encouraging, and
   suggests new opportunities for future research to begin to take the link
   between social cohesion and economic and social development seriously.},

Abstract = {This article analyses Arendt's concept of public sphere in the
   perspective of her political phenomenology. It focuses on the way Arendt
   sets politics into the correlation between the Visible and the
   Invisible, which characterises the world as the horizon of human
   existence. The article stresses the influence of the philosophy of
   Nietzsche, Heidegger and Merleau-Ponty on this specific level of
   Arendt's political thought. It aims to show that this political
   phenomenology is a pivotal dimension of Arendt's Philosophy, especially
   of her interpretation and conceptualisation of totalitarianism, which is
   a form of government characterised by the project of total domination,
   that is by the attempt to pass every boundary, also the boundary that
   separates the Visible from the Invisible.},

Abstract = {When members of Congress neglect the needs of their districts or vote
   contrary to the wishes of their constituents, their public approval
   suffers. Does the same hold true for representatives at the state level?
   Using experiments, I explore whether people dole out similar rewards and
   penalties to state legislators and members of Congress for their
   successes and shortfalls in representing constituents. I find that a
   similar model of political accountability travels from national politics
   to state politics. People value policy representation, casework, and
   attention to the district as much from state legislators as they do from
   members of Congress.},

Abstract = {Members and supporters of the British government say that the only
   constitutionally legitimate course of action over Brexit after the
   referendum is to press ahead with withdrawal from the European Union,
   even if that would entail the complete severance of all ties (which we
   normally call hard Brexit'). A more sophisticated view of the
   constitution, however, shows that these more or less populist arguments
   are false. As the Supreme Court confirmed in the recent Gina Miller
   judgment, the constitution did not change with the June referendum.
   Parliament is still supreme and determines both ordinary legislation and
   constitutional change. In fact, if one examines closely the claim that
   the referendum entails hard Brexit, it becomes obvious that this claim
   is false as well. The referendum opened the door for one among four
   different possibilities. Which Brexit optionif anythe United Kingdom
   should take is a matter for Parliament now to decide, following the
   normal processes of democratic deliberation and representation.},

Volume = {9},

Abstract = {South Korea undergoes frequent and large-scale government
   reorganizations (GRs) that have generated social, administrative, and
   political problems; all of these have negative impacts on the quality of
   democracy by lowering people's satisfaction with their government. This
   article critically reviews past literature's major discussions on the
   quality of democracy and argues that well-performing democratic
   governance that not only secures democratic principles but also develops
   governments' ability to perform well is required for the enhancement of
   democratic quality. Drawing insight from the Centripetal Democratic
   Governance perspective, this article defines the core principles of this
   governance model as institutional consistency, authority, and inclusion,
   and analyzes key features of Korea's GR, focusing on the science and
   technology administration system. The research results show that the
   features not only align directly with the problems engendered by
   frequent GR but also go against the core principles of well-performing
   democratic governance. Last, this article addresses the policy and
   theoretical implications of this finding.},

Abstract = {Ethnic groups are thought to be particularly good at enforcing
   cooperative behavior, in part because social networks among coethnics
   are favorable to peer sanctioning schemes, resulting in observed
   outcomes like higher public goods provision in ethnically homogeneous
   areas and infrequent interethnic conflict. This article formalizes this
   process, accounting for networks that spread news relevant to
   sanctioning from peer to peer. It shows that impediments to intra- and
   interethnic cooperation arise from positions in the network that are too
   peripheral or too controlling: contrary to conventional wisdom, the
   definitive feature of networks is not density but integration. Some
   groups can only support a low volume of civil interethnic interactions
   due to intra-ethnic networks that are poorly integrated. These results
   help explain variance across homogeneous areas, identify a barrier to
   cooperation in heterogeneous areas, generate empirical predictions,
   reveal sources of improvement masked by nonnetwork models, and offer
   guidance for future network elicitation.},

   Programme (WFP)},
Journal = {GLOBAL SOCIAL POLICY},

Volume = {17},

Pages = {3-20},

Abstract = {As the world's largest humanitarian organization fighting hunger, and
   primary expositor of food insecurity in sub-Saharan Africa, the World
   Food Programme's (WFP) activities offer a unique opportunity to examine
   the contemporary food-security nexus. In this article, we examine the
   turn' toward resilience in the practices and policies of the WFP. Our
   analysis emphasizes that resilience is one of a family of security
   strategies through which the WFP seeks to govern food security. As such,
   it is impossible to claim, as some have, that resilience is displacing
   security as the dominant logic for governing insecurity. Nevertheless,
   resilience is a cornerstone of the WFPs' current activities. Whereas
   more familiar strategies of security attempt to pre-empt or contain
   disruptive events - in the context of food crises - resilience is a
   style of thinking that assumes the inevitability of unpredictable,
   high-impact events and aims to foster the capability for systems and
   people to adapt, absorb, and bounce back from their effects. Resilience,
   while championed as part of an overall solution to a range of ills
   afflicting human populations today, aims only to equip people and
   populations with the capacity to live with the instabilities of a
   neoliberal food system without questioning, destabilizing, or resisting
   the very sources of socio-economic and political instability.},

Abstract = {Well-established methods exist for measuring party positions, but
   reliable means for estimating intra-party preferences remain
   underdeveloped. While most efforts focus on estimating the ideal points
   of individual legislators based on inductive scaling of roll call votes,
   this data suffers from two problems: selection bias due to unrecorded
   votes and strong party discipline, which tends to make voting a
   strategic rather than a sincere indication of preferences. By contrast,
   legislative speeches are relatively unconstrained, as party leaders are
   less likely to punish MPs for speaking freely as long as they vote with
   the party line. Yet, the differences between roll call estimations and
   text scalings remain essentially unexplored, despite the growing
   application of statistical analysis of textual data to measure policy
   preferences. Our paper addresses this lacuna by exploiting a rich
   feature of the Swiss legislature: on most bills, legislators both vote
   and speak many times. Using this data, we compare text-based scaling of
   ideal points to vote-based scaling from a crucial piece of energy
   legislation. Our findings confirm that text scalings reveal larger
   intra-party differences than roll calls. Using regression models, we
   further explain the differences between roll call and text scalings by
   attributing differences to constituency-level preferences for energy
   policy.},

Journal = {POLITICS \& POLICY},

Volume = {45},

Abstract = {Commissions of inquiry are frequently used as venue-alteration
   mechanisms to investigate and depoliticize local government reforms.
   Through the application of a leadership identity framework that examines
   the judgments commission chairs make during the course of the inquiry,
   this article explores the roles commission chairs play as interpretive
   authorities. The judgments that commission chairs make about the scope
   of stakeholder engagement and whether to adjust the agenda of the
   inquiry generate four types of leadership identity: conservator,
   consolidator, advocate, and catalyst. The leadership identity framework
   is applied to two commissions conducting inquiries into proposed
   structural reform of local government in two subnational systems:
   Northern Ireland and New South Wales. The application of the framework
   reveals that the commission process itself leads to a shift from a
   conservator to a consolidator leadership identity in both systems,
   despite their different and distinctive historical, social, and
   political contexts.},

Title = {China's Assertive Posture in Reinforcing its Territorial and Sovereignty
   Claims in the South China Sea: An Insight into Malaysia's Stance},
Journal = {JAPANESE JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {18},
Number = {1},
Pages = {67-105},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {China's growing assertiveness in strengthening its territorial and
   sovereignty claims in the South China Sea has arguably intensified
   friction and deepened tension between the rival claimant States. In
   sharp contrast to the strong reactions of its fellow ASEAN claimants,
   such as Vietnam and the Philippines, Malaysia traditionally has been
   less critical and more inclined to downplay China's perceived emotive
   actions. This subtle foreign policy orientation is likely to remain
   unchanged in the immediate future. Malaysian leaders are aware of the
   need to continue adopting a more cautious but pragmatic approach to
   counter China's increasingly aggressive actions in the Spratly Islands.
   Because of the significant economic and political benefits derived from
   its close relationships with China, Malaysia's policy preference is
   aimed to avoid jeopardizing such relations. However, the growing
   presence of Chinese military vessels in Malaysia's waters in recent
   years has forced the latter to reassess its foreign policy approach,
   which might include adopting a more assertive stance towards China. Set
   against this backdrop, this article aims to give an exploratory insight
   into Malaysia's external behaviour and actions in response to China's
   recent growing aggressiveness in the South China Sea. To this end, the
   aim of this article is achieved through a twofold approach. First, it
   examines Malaysia's overlapping claims to maritime features and waters
   with China, with the focus on the Spratly Islands group. Lastly, the
   article provides an explorative insight of Malaysia's rationalist
   stance, particularly under the current administration of Prime Minister
   Najib Tun Razak, in response to China's aggressiveness. It also examines
   the motivations, intentions, and basis of this external posture.},

Abstract = {The EU, as a promising peace project, is viewed as the cornerstone of
   European stability and prosperity. However, the reputation of the EU
   today is not the same as before. Currently, the EU faces a range of
   challenges resulting from within and outside the continent. Among the
   most prominent are the economic crisis, irregular migration, the rise in
   extremist movements, and Brexit. The founding principles of the EU are
   also being tested in response to these crises. Several critical issues
   are argued in the article that should be taken into consideration for
   the sake of the EU project at a time when the Union is going through a
   self-review process.},

Title = {Rhetorical Adaptation and Resistance to International Norms},
Journal = {PERSPECTIVES ON POLITICS},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {15},
Number = {1},
Pages = {83-99},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Scholarship on states' responses to international norms has focused on
   commitment, compliance, and noncompliance; paying insufficient attention
   to responses that fall outside these categories. Beyond simply complying
   with or violating a norm; states contest, resist, and respond to
   international norms in a range of ways. I identify rhetorical adaptation
   as a central form of resistance to international norms. Rather than
   simply rejecting a norm or charges of norm violation, such a strategy
   draws on a norm's content to resist pressures for compliance or minimize
   perceptions of violation. Theorizing the relationship between norms'
   content and states' resistant rhetoric, I identify four types of
   rhetorical adaptation: norm disregard, norm avoidance, norm
   interpretation, and norm signaling. To probe the plausibility of these
   propositions, a case study of Turkey's post-World War II narrative of
   the Armenian Genocide traces a sequence of rhetorical adaptations over
   the past six decades. Building on the case study, I then draw out
   generalizable insights into the uses and effects of rhetorical
   adaptation. Connecting theoretical concerns in political science with
   the interdisciplinary fields of genocide studies and memory studies, I
   delineate the ways in which actors instrumentally use norms and expand
   understandings of the forms and effects of so-called norm takers'
   agency.},

Abstract = {To help explain public sentiment about reconciliation among contemporary
   South Africans, two major issues are discussed. The first is how
   reconciliation was articulated and performed' by key leaders during the
   early transition. The second relates to factors shaping South Africans'
   current perceptions of reconciliation. By recalling significant
   statements made by political leaders, and outlining the roles of the
   National Peace Accord and the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, it is
   shown that reconciliation was initially accepted by South Africans when
   it was defined as an acceptance of their interdependence, and was seen
   as being based on a commitment to justice and inclusivity. The
   post-apartheid leadership was mandated to build on these commitments in
   order to create a more just society over time. However, data from
   various public opinion surveys reveal that, despite important
   achievements, the government's failure to pay reparations, combined with
   state corruption and denial from the white community, have created
   increasing disillusionment with reconciliation.},

Title = {The public valuation of religion in global health governance: spiritual
   health and the faith factor},
Journal = {CONTEMPORARY POLITICS},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {23},
Number = {1, SI},
Pages = {81-99},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {This article explores how the role of religion is evaluated in global
   health institutions, focusing on policy debates in the World Health
   Organization (WHO) and the World Bank. Drawing on Luc Boltanski and
   Laurent Thevenot's pragmatist approach to justification, I suggest that
   religious values are creative and worldly performances. The public value
   of religion is established through a two-pronged justification process,
   combining generalizing arguments with particularizing empirical tests.
   To substantiate the claim that abstraction alone does not suffice to
   create religious values in global public health, I compare the futile
   attempts of the 1980s to add spiritual health' to the WHO's mandate with
   the more recent creation of a faith factor' in public health. While the
   vague reference to some Factor X' inhibited the acceptance of spiritual
   health in the first case, in the second case, compassion' became a
   measurable and recognized religious value.},

Abstract = {This paper explores the role of threats from below in the emergence of
   electoral authoritarianism. Mass uprisings for democratic regime change
   undermine closed authoritarian regimes by making it difficult for
   autocrats to maintain their regimes through repression and co-optation.
   Anti-regime uprisings also promote the establishment of electoral
   authoritarianism by toppling the existing closed regime or by compelling
   autocrats to offer political reform as a survival strategy. Looking at
   closed authoritarian regimes from 1961 to 2006, my analysis reveals that
   anti-regime mass uprisings are significantly associated with transitions
   to electoral authoritarianism. I also find that nonviolent uprisings are
   more likely than violent uprisings to result in the establishment of
   electoral authoritarianism and that the effect of anti-regime uprisings
   on transitions to electoral authoritarianism is greater when a country
   is surrounded by more democracies or is ethnically or religiously
   homogeneous.},

Abstract = {Turkey-EU relations are going through a difficult period, which is not a
   new feature per se as they have been through many different stages.
   However, the present situation is unsustainable. The accession process
   continues to stall due to political obstacles and can proceed only if
   the Cyprus issue is resolved. As accession is the dominant feature, this
   situation poisons the overall relationship. While the migration crisis
   brought the two sides closer, the July 15th coup attempt in Turkey and
   its aftermath again caused consternation. In a world with a multitude of
   challenges, the two sides need each other and should build their
   relationship on trust and realistic expectations.},

Abstract = {This article examines strategies for immigrants to improve integration
   by exploring the relationship between occupational choice and
   assimilation. I ask whether immigrant-origin individuals will be viewed
   as better representatives of the nation when employed in occupations
   that reflect national identity. I examine this question with data from
   original surveys in France, Germany, and the United States. Results
   suggest that native and immigrant-origin individuals in occupations that
   reflect national identity are more likely to be seen as ideal
   representatives of the nation. Yet, the benefits of an occupation that
   reflects national identity are fairly minor for immigrant-origin
   individuals in France and Germany and roughly one third the size of the
   benefit for native-origin individuals. In comparison, native and
   immigrant-origin individuals in the United States have the same increase
   in likelihood of being seen as ideal representatives of the nation.
   These findings have implications for our understanding of immigrant
   integration and national identity.},

Abstract = {The aim of this article, written especially for the 100th anniversary of
   the October 1917 Revolution, is certainly not to denigrate this first
   gigantic socialist project. Humanity owes an enormous debt to the Soviet
   Union that resulted from this revolution as it was the Red Army, and it
   alone, that put the Nazi hordes to rout. The support of the Soviet Union
   to the national liberation struggles of the peoples of Asia and Africa
   at that time forced the imperialist powers to retreat and to accept a
   polycentric globalization that was less unequal and more respectful of
   the sovereignty of nations and of their cultures. However, neither is
   the objective of this study to be a nostalgic looking back on this
   historic event. On the contrary, I shall try to identify the mistakes
   and weaknesses of the original construction and then describe the drift
   away from it that led to efforts for its reform. And I show how, when
   these failed and led to the brutal restoration of capitalism, an end was
   put to this first great wave of humanity's progress towards socialism.},

Journal = {REVISTA DE CIENCIA POLITICA},

Volume = {37},
Number = {2},
Pages = {305-333},
Abstract = {This article argues that the legitimacy of the political system is
   currently at its lowest point since the return to democracy.
   Presidential approval ratings dipped to a record low in 2016. The year
   also saw the highest levels of electoral absenteeism and distrust in the
   three branches of government, and the lowest levels of identification
   with political parties. This low legitimacy of the political system can
   be attributed to cyclical - governmental mismanagement and corruption
   scandals- and underlying causes - interpersonal mistrust, detachment
   from the political activity and insulated elites-. If these trends
   continue, we may witness a transformation of the party system, the
   emergence of populist movements and leaders, and the erosion of the
   quality of Chilean democracy.},

   legal order is possible, and examines the role of China in particular,
   basing its arguments on concrete issues, rather than theoretical ones.
   This paper will first discuss the Eastphalian proposal, initially
   illustrating the main arguments for the Eastphalian order, and then
   discussing the possibility of an Eastphalia era. This study stresses
   that, as a growing international actor, China has the potential to
   affect the current international order in certain ways. However, these
   effects will not be enough to cause a transformation of that order,
   because there other determinative factors exist. This study identifies
   and assesses these determinative factors for Asia, and in particular
   China, seeing them as offering new autogenous principles and minimizing
   the problem of coherence in foreign policy, as well as helping establish
   a strong regional organization. While autogenous principles are an
   important way to distinguish a new era from the preceding one, there are
   several considerations that are equally vital for global acceptance and
   adoption of these autogenous principles that China would develop. This
   paper first discusses existing concerns with regard to the Five
   Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, on which China has based its foreign
   policy. Then, we will highlight coherence issues that have been raised
   with regard to China's strategies and practices. Finally, we will
   emphasize the importance of founding an organization that will
   facilitate regional cooperation in Asia. It is currently unclear whether
   an Eastphalian world order will manifest itself based on choices made by
   leading Asian powers, and we must ascertain how far this ideal is from
   being achieved. The current study contributes to the literature by
   providing more insight into this largely ignored topic.},

Abstract = {How can we best gauge the political opinions of the citizenry? Since
   their emergence in the 1930s, opinion polls-or surveys-have become the
   dominant way to assess the public will. But even given the long history
   of polling, there is no agreement among political scientists on how to
   best measure public opinion through polls. This article is a call for
   political scientists to be more self-conscious about the choices we make
   when we attempt to measure public opinion with surveys in two realms. I
   first take up the question of whom to interview, discussing the major
   challenges survey researchers face when sampling respondents from the
   population of interest. I then discuss the level of specificity with
   which we can properly collect information about the political
   preferences of individuals. I focus on the types of question wording and
   item aggregation strategies researchers can use to accurately measure
   public opinion.},

Abstract = {The thematic section of this issue of ``Scienza \& Politica{''} focuses
   on the problem of utopia. Though in the last decades Utopian Studies
   have developed significant analyses of this issue, their concept is
   still poor in reflexivity. The historiographical reconstructions and
   conceptual investigations operate through meanings of a concept which
   escape the control of their users: the many, and even incompatible,
   meanings of Utopia available today are often loosened from each other,
   with the result that scholars very often give rise to dialogues that run
   the risk to be only apparent, since they develop through different
   semantics. The purpose of a research that engages today in an attempt to
   elaborate reflexively this category cannot be to look for a unifying
   meaning of the term: this, in fact, would add up a single definition to
   the others available on the marketplace of ideas. On the contrary it
   seems more promising to build an accurate repertoire of meanings in use,
   in which the concept of Utopia shows its varying boundaries and the
   contradictions characterizing its long tradition.},

Abstract = {The October Revolution was the founding myth of the USSR, and determined
   the way in which Soviet citizens viewed history. With the collapse of
   the USSR, the history of the Revolution lost its binding force; since
   then, there has been much debate in Russia as to how it should be
   interpreted. The Putin government wants to harmonise history textbooks
   in order to promote national unity. But the complex legacy of the
   October Revolution prevents it from being exploited for the purposes of
   patriotic educational programmes. The centenary could provide an
   opportunity for renewed consideration of the Revolution and its
   consequences. However, those in power are attempting to ignore it to a
   large degree.},

Abstract = {Internet has revolutionized many aspects in the way that political
   parties communicate. The Network has induced a complete transformation
   of the political strategies used during election campaigns to spread
   their message to the electorate. Politicians use social networks and
   digital platforms to promote their messages and to communicate with
   citizens during these periods of time. Facebook has proven to be one of
   the most effective networks in this regard. The party Podemos was born
   in 2014 in Spain, surrounded by a deep economic, institutional and
   political crisis. This political party promises to be a real hope to the
   negative situation of the country. In the recent years, Podemos has
   aroused the interest of social scientists because of the innovative way
   they use social networks. This paper explores the cybercampaign
   strategies that Podemos used during the 2015 Castile and Leon regional
   elections, a region where the population is very different from the
   party's average voter. To this end, a quantitative analysis of their
   activity on Facebook and their website was made during the regional
   election campaign. The results of this study allow us to observe an
   ordinary use of the digital tools by Podemos that highlights the
   engagement achieved with users in Facebook.},

   show how the author engenders a particular explanation in defense of
   Japanese immigration, distancing the racial aspects that denied as
   ``ideal immigrant.{''} Above all, fulfilling the desires of a targeted
   national project in political debates. Noteworthy is the Revoredo
   dialogue with intellectuals of the period, biological concepts and their
   thesis as Japanese immigrant, denied by many, it would be passed over
   for the national identity, especially in the assimilation of questions,

Abstract = {In the EU multilevel polity, domestic interest groups seek to shape EU
   legislation by accessing both national and EU institutions. Previous
   studies indicated that institutional and issue contexts as well as
   organisational characteristics shape their strategies of interest
   representation. However, we know much less about how alignments and
   arguments impact on their participation in EU and national policy
   consultations. Addressing this gap, we investigate the lobbying
   strategies of almost 2900 national interest organisations from five
   member states (Germany, the Netherlands, Slovenia, Sweden, and the
   United Kingdom) on 20 EU directive proposals also bringing a new
   empirical scope to the study of multilevel interest representation. The
   findings indicate that alignments and arguments shape the participation
   of domestic interest groups in consultations on EU policies. We infer
   from our study that some general predictions of interest group behaviour
   are overstretched and outline four major variations of interest
   representation routines.},

Journal = {DEMOCRATIZATION},

Volume = {24},

Pages = {61-80},

Abstract = {Economic globalization and, in particular, foreign direct investment
   (FDI) have often been considered to be catalysts for economic reform and
   political liberalization. It is argued that openness to foreign
   investment spurs democratization by empowering pro-liberalization actors
   and undermining elite cohesion. This article explores and tests three
   alternative hypotheses linking FDI and autocratic regime survival. The
   liberalization hypothesis claims that FDI promotes democratization. The
   state-capture hypothesis suggests that FDI, by increasing the value of
   power, may raise the risk of an autocratic transition. Lastly, the
   stabilization hypothesis, contrary to the first two, claims that FDI can
   enhance dictatorships' stability by opening new opportunities for
   distributing benefits to regime elites. The empirical analysis, covering

Title = {The Majority-Party Disadvantage: Revising Theories of Legislative
   Organization},
Journal = {QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {12},

Pages = {269-300},
Abstract = {Dominant theories of legislative organization in the U.S. rest on the
   notion that the majority party arranges legislative matters to enhance
   its electoral fortunes. Yet, we find little evidence for a short-term
   electoral advantage for the majority party in U.S. state legislatures.
   Furthermore, there appears to be a pronounced downstream majority-party
   disadvantage. To establish these findings, we propose a technique for
   aggregating the results of close elections to obtain as-if random
   variation in majority- party status. We argue that the results from this
   approach are consistent with a phenomenon of inter-temporal balancing,
   which we link to other forms of partisan balancing in U.S. elections.
   The article thus necessitates revisions to our theories of legislative
   organization, offers new arguments for balancing theories, and lays out
   an empirical technique for studying the effects of majority- party
   status in legislative contexts.},

Abstract = {This article addresses whether Albert Weale's view in Democratic Justice
   and the Social Contract (OUP 2013) fits into one of two strands of
   social contract traditions, and how his account stands up to critics. He
   claims to stand in the contractarian tradition, which seeks to justify
   normative principles of justice from non-moral premises. The alternative
   is the contractualist tradition which assumes that individuals are also
   motivated by other-regarding moral considerations. The aim of the latter
   theories is often limited to systematise and specify vague and contested
   normative judgements concerning shared institutions. There are tensions
   in Weale's account as to whether it addresses the question of concern to
   contractarians or rather that of contractualists. A second challenge
   concerns Weale's attempt to extrapolate principles of justice from
   common property resource regimes within the basic structure of society
   to that basic structure of a `great society' itself. The impact of the
   basic structure on individuals is so pervasive that the principle Weale
   proposes seems misapplied. A claim to the marginal product in complex
   modes of production supplemented by a social insurance scheme says
   little about the distributive principles for assessing how the basic
   structure as a whole should engender the distribution of marginal
   products among us.},

Abstract = {The Eurozone crisis constitutes a grave challenge to European
   integration. This article presents an overview of the causes of the
   crisis and analyzes why it has been so difficult to resolve. We focus on
   how responses to the crisis were shaped by distributive conflicts both
   among and within countries. On the international level, debtor and
   creditor countries have fought over the distribution of responsibility
   for the accumulated debt; countries with current account surpluses and
   deficits have fought over who should implement the policies necessary to
   reduce the current account imbalances. Within countries, interest groups
   have fought to shift the costs of crisis resolution away from
   themselves. The article emphasizes that the Eurozone crisis shares many
   features of previous debt and balance-of-payments crises. However, the
   Eurozone's predicament is unique because it is set within a monetary
   union that strongly constrains the policy options available to policy
   makers and vastly increases the interdependence of the euro crisis
   countries. The outcome of the crisis has also been highly unusual
   because the costs of crisis resolution have been borne almost
   exclusively by the debtor countries and taxpayers in the Eurozone.},

Abstract = {In this research two electoral campaigns in Spanish regional elections,
   Andalusia 2008 and 2012, are examined. The most important electoral
   advertising, spots, are analyzed. This article ex-poses the results of a
   study focused on determining the persuasive strategies that were used by
   the three main political forces, Partido Popular, Partido Socialista and
   Izquierda Unida in their 25 electoral videos. The methodology used is
   both qualitative and quantitative. The variables employed are the
   structure, design, content, direction and strategy, themes, participants
   and social groups and metaphors. All this helps us to know the
   strategies that different political parties used in both campaigns.},

Abstract = {How far have social activism changed in the last two decades? What is
   the role of technological progress in shaping new, and very new social
   movements? Can we validly see the crowd as the representation of
   empowered and leading social action? Current expressions of social
   change invite to revisit old concepts in the social sciences.
   Crowdfunding can certainly help in this endeavor; for one, it helps with
   the visualization of these changes. By observing current practices of
   crowdfunding from the perspective of the social sciences we can do away
   with some useless abstractions to deepen in our understanding of new
   interfaces between technology and activism.},

Abstract = {This article explores the role of multi-level governance and power
   structures in local water security through a case study of the
   Nawalparasi district in Nepal. It focuses on economic sustainability as
   a measure to address water security, placing this thematic in the
   context of a complicated power structure consisting of local, district
   and national administration as well as external development cooperation
   actors. The study aims to find out whether efforts to improve the
   economic sustainability of water schemes have contributed to water
   security at the local level. In addition, it will consider the
   interactions between water security, power structures and local equality
   and justice. The research builds upon survey data from the Nepalese
   districts of Nawalparasi and Palpa, and a case study based on interviews
   and observation in Nawalparasi. The survey was performed in water
   schemes built within a Finnish development cooperation programme
   spanning from 1990 to 2004, allowing a consideration of the long-term
   sustainability of water management projects. This adds a crucial
   external influence into the intra-state power structures shaping water
   management in Nepal. The article thus provides an alternative
   perspective to cross-regional water security through a discussion
   combining transnational involvement with national and local points of
   view.},

Abstract = {This article traces some of the attempts that have been made to analyse
   time and emotions in order to gain a broader understanding of how power
   and resistance entangle in online administrative systems in university
   spaces. Rising levels of Internet usage in the university sector, and
   society in general, imply a new era for public administration. Online
   administrative systems have moved into the university sector, creating
   different reactions, new practices, temporalities and emotions. The
   administrative online systems, which govern through, as our respondents
   understand it, various time-consuming scripts (for example, the travel
   expenses programmes or programmes regulating working hours or duty
   periods) or through online communication systems (for example,
   emailing), give rise to a rich and varied resistance against the
   different systems, which informs the employees' temporalities and spent
   time (clock time). Among other things, people reacted emotionally with
   avoidance, time-travel, manipulations, ignorance and by exact rule
   following.},

Abstract = {It is pertinent to ask how the current confrontation between Russia and
   the West can be overcome. However, the recommendation by peace
   researchers Spanger and Dembinski for a new policy towards Russia fails
   to convince. The notion of a ``plural peace{''} is no more than a
   re-labelling of the ``multipolar peace{''} a la russe. Their arguments
   amount to a guarantee of the continued existence of an autocratic regime
   in the name of pluralism. They offer a formula from the Cold War, namely
   peaceful coexistence along Soviet lines: the acceptance of zones of
   influence and a Russian cordon sanitaire at the expense of the states in
   ``Zwischeneuropa{''}.},

Journal = {AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE},

Volume = {52},
Number = {4},
Pages = {481-499},
Abstract = {Contemporary political systems are experiencing a democratic disconnect
   between formal institutions of representative government, and the more
   informal spaces of political participation. Rather than offer an
   institutional remedy, this article turns to practice and considers how
   citizens themselves are seeking to transform dysfunctional democratic
   practices. The article provides an in-depth analysis of democratic
   events that have unfolded between 2012 and 2017 in the Australian
   federal electorate of Indi. The analysis explores the intertwined
   participatory efforts of the citizens' group, Voices4Indi, and the local
   Independent federal member, MP Cathy McGowan. The Indi experience
   demonstrates that while citizens may be frustrated with politics as
   usual', they are not rejecting the system but rather instigating
   creative democratic reforms.},

Abstract = {As in coalition governments policy-authority for specific policy areas
   is delegated to the cabinet ministers, ministers have incentives to
   implement policies which oppose the preferences of the coalition
   partner. However, government parties can monitor partners by appointing
   committee chairs for those policy areas that are under the
   responsibility of a minister from the coalition partner. For the first
   time, this paper tests the use of this control mechanism for the
   governments of the German federal states. The results show that one
   third of all ministers are controlled by a committee chair from the
   coalition partner. Control takes place in Grand Coalitions between the
   SPD and the CDU, when parties are governing together for the first time,
   and when the number of committee members is small.},

Title = {Between Political Rigidity (Towards Conflict) and Liquid Fluidity
   (Towards Peace): The Water Boundaries of Mexico with Guatemala and
   Belize},
Journal = {REVISTA DE PAZ Y CONFLICTOS},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {10},

Abstract = {Mexico shares two borders with Guatemala and Belize where surface waters
   are abundant, a situation that enables dynamic relations between waters
   and boundaries. The border rigidity has traditionally contrasted with
   profound local transboundary interactions between water linked to
   socio-cultural dynamics and the multiple circumstances of liquidity.
   Resulting from more than a decade of research in the area, this paper
   proposes to analyze different water borders conceived as an integrative
   duality-rigidity versus fluidity-from a perspective which looks beyond
   dominant methodological nationalism. Instead of opposing water fluidity
   and the rigidity of political boundaries, through examples of
   ``transboundary water crossings{''} and transboundary river basins, the
   article proposes ``water transbordering{''} as a perspective that
   dynamically intertwines waters and borders. Finally, it highlights the
   importance for research to go beyond nationalist, homogeneous and
   hegemonic visions about rigid borders, which ultimately feeds conflicts
   and moves towards a perspective that includes local dynamics of waters
   and boundaries in support a transboundary analysis that moves towards
   transboundary environmental peace.},

Journal = {POLITISCHE VIERTELJAHRESSCHRIFT},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {58},
Number = {3},
Pages = {407-417},
Abstract = {When elections are distant, polls are poor predictors. Too few voters
   are paying attention and too much can change before election day.
   Structural models can establish baseline expectations but suffer from
   high uncertainty and underspecification imposed by small samples. We
   present an early forecast of the 2017 Bundestag election results for
   individual parties that leverages economic and political data as well as
   state parliament (Land tag) election results in the German states
   (Lander) to sidestep these shortcomings. A linear random effects model
   provides our estimates. Lander elections are dispersed over the calendar
   and offer the advantage of capturing both actual voter preferences and
   new political issues. We argue that this approach offers a promising
   method for early forecasts when polls are not informative.},

Volume = {9},

Abstract = {The relationship between democracy and terrorism remains a source of
   significant debate, with academic evidence suggesting that democracy
   both inhibits and encourages acts of terrorism and political violence.
   Accepting this apparent contradiction, this paper argues that a more
   nuanced approach to understanding political systems, focussing on the
   subjective perceptions of individual actors, may allow these differences
   to be reconciled. Using regression analysis undertaken with UK data from
   the European Values Study, the results shows how attitudes to politics
   may frame assessments of the intrinsic valence -or attractiveness of
   political participation, support for terrorism, and the implications
   this may have for both counter-terrorism and counter-extremism policy.},

Journal = {POLITICS GROUPS AND IDENTITIES},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {5},
Number = {3},
Pages = {482-487},
Abstract = {Studying symbolic representation is not only relevant, but also
   challenging. Hanna Pitkin {[}1967. The Concept of Representation. CA:
   University of California Press, 97] already warned us that ``{[}w]e can
   never exhaust, never quite capture in words, the totality of what a
   symbol symbolizes: suggests, evokes, implies.{''} We will discuss the
   opportunities and challenges we encountered in our study of symbolic
   representation from a discursive politics approach, where we took
   political discourse as the agent. A discursive approach has allowed us
   to study symbolic representation as a dimension of representation per
   se, and to unpack the relation between agent and principal in symbolic
   representation by revealing the activity of constructing meanings and
   ascribing them to the principal. Yet, a number of questions arise: what
   makes a symbol a symbol and what does this mean for a discursive
   approach to symbols? What makes symbolic representation different from
   substantive representation when the agent is of a discursive nature? And
   what methodological challenges does the broadening of the agent in
   symbolic representation to discourse include?},

Abstract = {The Partido de los Trabajadores (PT) in Brazil and the Partido
   Justicialista/Frente Para la Victoria (PJ/FPV) in Argentina are both
   labor based parties that reached the government under the Latin American
   ``left turn{''} on the XXI Century. They specially undertook a
   discursive position that counteracted with the recent past, its actors
   and values, and that reintroduced workers and trade unions in the
   political arena. In order to do that, they put into play a whole
   discursive framework from which carried out the (re) constitution of a
   new identity with the CUT (Brazil) and the CGT (Argentina) respectively.
   In this regard, taking into account the public positions of Lula and
   Kirchner, as well as all documents and interviews with key leaders from
   both parties and trade unions, this paper will be focused on analyze if
   there is an identity convergence of worldviews, especially in the
   definition of those who are borders inside ({''}we{''}) and outside
   borders ({''}others{''}).},

Journal = {DEMOCRATIZATION},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {24},
Number = {6},
Pages = {889-905},
Abstract = {The question of how ordinary courts in new and emerging democracies may
   gain judicial independence remains an understudied subject compared to
   its constitutional court counterpart. Through a case study of Taiwan,
   this article adopts and expands upon the concept of power diffusion from
   the extant literature, arguing that the growing power of Taiwan's
   private corporate sector led the dominant political party Kuomintang
   (KMT) to grant independence to the ordinary courts as a means to check
   against this threat, because the excessive rent-seeking and corruption
   brought about by these empowered corporations were threatening the
   nation's successful economic model and its rule of law. Also, due to the
   corporate sector's growing influence on the ruling party itself, the KMT
   leadership had to devise strategies that can credibly commit to ordinary
   court independence, which would otherwise be reversed thereafter. This
   unique implication guides a qualitative empirical analysis that
   reinterprets the historical events surrounding the judicial reforms that
   took place in the mid-1990s. The results yield strong evidence in
   support of the theory.},

Title = {The `Quasi-Permanent Crisis': Understanding Collective Rebellion and
   Sectarian Violence in the CAR},
Journal = {POLITIKON},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {44},
Number = {2},
Pages = {187-204},
Abstract = {This paper is a critical application of Ted Gurr's theory of political
   rebellion to understanding the dynamics of the long history of
   socio-economic and political crises in the Central African Republic
   (CAR). Gurr locates his explanation for political rebellion in people's
   shared grievances', discontentment', and group mobilisation' within the
   context of repressive state actions. Gurr, however, gives no real
   explanation as to what kind of people engage in collective rebellion,
   and whether or not popular grievances touch on all the people. In light
   of this, this paper explores what group identity issues, and what kinds
   of beliefs or appeals within CAR led to collective violence in the
   country, particularly the Seleka rebellion (2012-2013) and the
   anti-Balaka counter-response. The paper further discusses why and how
   groups like the Seleka remain a small but cohesive organisation, willing
   to kill and or die for their motives. Additionally, it engages with the
   spill-over' effects of CAR's crises by discussing how the official
   borders in the Central African Region, as with the rest of Africa,
   remain insignificant in the everyday life of Central Africans.},

Abstract = {Adolf Storms was not hard to find in the summer of 2008. He was listed
   in the German telephone book. The former SSUnterscharfuhrer, who had
   been a member of the Waffen-SS Panzer Division Wiking, was accused,
   along with two other SS men, of having shot to death at least
   fifty-seven Hungarian-Jewish forced labourers on 29 March 1945 in
   Deutsch Schutzen, a village close to the Austrian-Hungarian border.
   Immediately after that massacre, he allegedly executed a Jew - a man,
   name unknown, who could not walk any further - by shooting him from
   behind. Adolf Storms had lived in Duisburg under his true name since the
   late 1940s. In 2008, the author interviewed Storms and two Hitler Jugend
   (HJ) leaders who also took part in this crime, and three Jews who
   survived the massacre. In 2009, Storms was charged with murder and as an
   accessory to murder in Dusseldorf. In June 2010, shortly before the
   decision for the trial to commence, he died at the age of ninety-one.
   This case study scrutinizes the intersection of ideology, Nazi morality,
   motivation and situational factors in perpetrating massacres. It also
   analyses how the judicial system in Austria dealt with this crime.},

Abstract = {Inspired by sociolinguistic scholarship, this study examines the
   influence of linguistic vitality, the social health of a language, on
   perceived in-group threat and out-group attitudes. Using an experimental
   design that manipulated perceptions of the linguistic vitality of French
   in Quebec, this study sought to ascertain the causal role of linguistic
   vitality on intergroup attitudes. The results demonstrate that the type
   of information, positive or negative, about linguistic vitality
   influences perceptions of threat towards a language. However, results
   about linguistic vitality information's impact on out-group attitudes,
   support for independence and subjective identity revealed
   inter-individual heterogeneity.},

Abstract = {The article analyzes the main substantive components, factors of
   stability and the potential for erosion of the politico-ideological
   consensus established in the modern Russia. On the one hand, A. Melville
   documents the extraordinary strength of this consensus, buttressed by
   the powerful factors such as the long-term position of power holders,
   support from the elitist and bureaucratic circles, effective propaganda
   with a strong mobilizational impact, conservative orientation of the
   middle class and dominating mass attitudes. On the other hand, the
   author draws attention to a number of not-so-obvious factors that could
   turn the tide in the long term, such as volatility of mass sentiments,
   possible alterations within the elite groups, as well as the internal
   flaws of the modern neoconservative idea.},

Abstract = {This paper applies the ARDL approach to cointegration in order to
   address the defense unemployment nexus. We use information on Portugal,
   Italy, Greece and Spain for the period 1960-2015. Our main results
   suggest that: (i) there is a stable long-run relationship between the
   variables under consideration for Portugal, Greece and Spain. (ii)
   Defense spending decreases (increases) unemployment for the case of
   Portugal and Greece ( Spain), (iii) the impact of non-defense spending
   is weaker than that of defense spending and (iv) Okun's law is validated
   for Portugal, Greece and Spain. (v) These results are robust to the use
   of heterogeneous panel cointegration and causality analysis.},

Abstract = {This paper examines the implications of Ukraine's move from a mixed
   electoral system to one of proportional representation in the 2006
   parliamentary elections. In particular, it seeks to understand how the
   elimination of district contests affected the two major parties'
   strategies in selecting candidates. Two strategies are outlined:
   prioritizing inclusion and prioritizing cohesion. Under the former,
   parties co-opt unaffiliated district deputies to improve their electoral
   fortunes despite potential costs to party discipline. The latter
   involves parties selecting affiliated deputies on the expectation of
   greater loyalty if elected. The analysis reveals that while the ruling
   party, Our Ukraine, employed a cautious version of inclusion, its
   opponent, the Party of Regions, emphasized cohesion. The findings show
   that ``one size does not fit all{''} when it comes to how parties react
   to the introduction of list-only systems. Furthermore, given the greater
   subsequent success of The Party of Regions in gaining office, the
   results question the degree to which ruling parties benefit electorally
   from greater inclusion when responding to the advent of more
   proportional electoral rules.},

   The case of subnational administrations in Turkey},
Journal = {REGIONAL AND FEDERAL STUDIES},

Abstract = {Subnational mobilisation literature has tended to focus on EU members
   and either their establishment of liaison offices or the engagement
   activities of their subnational administrations (SNAs) with the EU
   institutions in Brussels. Extending this scope to include cases from a
   candidate state, this article aims to enhance our understanding of such
   processes by proposing a four-stage model for subnational mobilisation
   in the EU. The model includes: growing awareness; changing
   organizational settings; building transnational activities; and
   conducting EU-level activities in Brussels. Based on 65 semi-structured
   interviews with representatives from local and national institutions in
   Turkey and EU institutions in Brussels, this work evaluates six SNAs
   from three Turkish cities (Izmir, Samsun and Diyarbakir) between 1999
   and 2013. Findings reveal that patterns of subnational mobilisation can
   vary significantly within a single candidate country, owing mostly to
   organizational-level factors and region-specific factors related to how
   particular administrations are embedded.},

Abstract = {This present work addresses with the theme of citizen education in basic
   education in Mexico. To understand the way in which the State, through
   the educational authorities, forms students for citizenship, use is made
   of pedagogical and political theories, which account for the importance
   of training citizenship in a good democracy. On 2012, the president
   Enrique Pena Nieto, promoted the Educational Reform whose purpose is to
   ensure the quality of education through the teacher's formation and the
   improvement of infraestructure in the schools. Unfortunately, the
   education reforms, have given little importance to the way in which
   contents of school subjects and pedagogical practices form a certain
   type of citizen, which will develop in the public sphere and that its
   behavior will depend on the mechanisms and instruments that it has to
   exercise its rights and its intervention in the decision making. In this
   context, it is vital to analyze the documents presented by the Secretary
   of Public Education as a complement to the education reform, to
   determine what type of citizen is intended to be formed and what are the
   tools that are granted to the student form a critical and analytical
   thinking, that allows to participate in politics and is able to discern
   and issue a logical judgment.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE EDUCATION},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {13},
Number = {4},
Pages = {404-425},
Abstract = {This mixed-methods study examined the long-term associations between two
   kinds of politics courses-required political science courses and
   required family policy courses and the political participation,
   knowledge, skill, efficacy, and politically engaged identity of child
   and family studies alumni. Two special cases were examined: those who
   remembered their required political science and policy courses compared
   with the other groups. Additionally, open-ended responses were coded and
   analyzed. Together, the quantitative and qualitative data suggest that
   college courses impacted alumni political awareness in college but
   political awareness did not translate as strongly into later political
   participation as previous literature has assumed. Findings highlight the
   importance of postcollege personal connections and work experience in
   shaping political participation. Educators and researchers should
   consider this complex relationship between what students learn in
   college and what they may later experience in adulthood when developing
   curriculum for students who are not political science majors.},

Abstract = {In the absence of enforcement mechanisms, it is unclear how legislators
   can cooperate over time to protect the diverse interests of the diverse
   subnational interest of small provinces. Using Argentina as a case
   study, this research argues that the economic geography of a country and
   the need to maintain inter-party cohesion directly influences the
   ability of legislators to advance diverse subnational interests. Since
   the mid-1990s, a small group of Argentine legislators has protected
   sugar producers by forming coalitions to override two presidential
   vetoes under institutional characteristics unfavorable to inter.
   temporal cooperation. This research demonstrates that territorial
   patterns of economic production and the need for political parties to
   maintain internal cohesion has played a critical role in allowing the
   formation of the super majorities necessary to protect varied
   subnational interests across time.},

Abstract = {This work builds off the observations of contemporary scholarship in the
   study of food security to explore its potential effects on the normative
   foundations of state legitimacy and rural governance. Today the concept
   of food security is different; states no longer need to primarily rely
   on domestic agricultural production to feed their population. Similarly,
   countries with available land for agriculture like Colombia are exposed
   to an increasing rush for land which is transforming the dynamics of
   rural governance. The article suggests that central government is
   willing to outsource governing functions in remote areas to private
   investors as long as they increase economic output, control populations
   and provide public goods. This finding has important implications for
   the post- conflict scenario in Colombia.},

   DE-POLITICIZATION The case of commons},
Journal = {PARTECIPAZIONE E CONFLITTO},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {10},
Number = {2, SI},
Pages = {493-516},
Abstract = {The essay aims to demonstrate that the process of de-politicization does
   not only affect political institutions but also the inspiring narrative
   of grassroots and anti-systemic movements engaged against neoliberalism.
   This circumstance is one of the most important reasons why, despite the
   huge and persistent crisis of neoliberalism, we do not witness a real
   hegemonic shift, and politics continues to be a very marginal forge of
   social life, as the neoliberal recipe prescribes. De-politicization is
   the main effect of ``horizontalism{''}, i.e. the descriptive and
   normative belief that social order is and has to be the ex post result
   of the interaction dynamics between social actors. Thus, a social order
   is much more desirable insofar as it leaves out the subject ``as is{''},
   promoting a process of self-revelation. Our thesis is that both
   neoliberalism and the largest part of anti-systemic movements who
   pretend to oppose to it share this basic frame. The narrative of
   ``commons{''} represents a special case of what we call ``conformist
   alternatives{''}. It develops an ambivalent tension: on the one side the
   search for pre-symbolic spontaneity and, on the other, the unmentionable
   search for hyper-symbolism. Finally, we identify a structural and then a
   sociocultural reason that currently prevent re-politicization.},

Abstract = {Scholars of international communication recognize that strategic
   narratives are important for policymaking (Miskimmon, O'Loughlin, \&
   Roselle, 2013) and scholars studying alliances suggest that
   communication is central to the formation and maintenance of alliances
   (Weitsman, 2010). This essay addresses how strategic narratives affect
   US alliance behavior- and hence international order-in two specific
   ways. First, alliance behavior can be affected by other allies'
   narratives as demonstrated in the case of military intervention in Libya
   in 2011. Here the evidence suggests that the UK and France were able to
   use strategic narratives to influence the decision of the US to agree to
   military intervention in Libya by using narratives that could evoke a
   fear of abandonment. Second, alliance cohesion can be affected by
   narrative contestation by non-allies as demonstrated in the case of the
   Ukrainian crisis in 2014. Russia has used strategic narratives in a new
   media environment in an attempt to elicit a fear of entrapment to
   counter the US attempts to coordinate alliance support for economic
   sanctions. In both cases, distinguishing between system, identity, and
   policy narratives give us a deeper understanding of narrative
   contestation today. This analysis adds to our understanding of the
   factors that affect alliances set within a new media environment
   characterized by a proliferation of sources and outlets and thus a more
   horizontal structure of information exchange.},

Abstract = {The article analyses the causes for the recent success of right-wing
   populist parties and movements from a gender perspective. The article
   aims first at a deeper understanding of right-wing populism and second
   it wants to demonstrate the analytical potential of gender as a
   political science category. While gender ideologies have always been
   crucial for extreme right parties and groups, only recently a
   gender-based strategy moved to the forefront of (European) right-wing
   populist actors. Based on an `anti-gender' strategy right-wing populists
   aim at contributing to the resolution of a `crisis of masculinity' in
   western societies as well as antidiscrimination policies, implemented
   since they prepare their anti-hegemonic project against equal
   opportunity and anti-discrimination since the 1960s and 1970s.},

   Becoming a `Country of Immigration'},
Journal = {GERMAN POLITICS},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {26},
Number = {4, SI},
Pages = {498-515},
Abstract = {Germany's leading role in responding to the current refugee crisis in
   Europe reflects a development of its approach towards migration and
   cultural diversity that would have been difficult to imagine 27 years
   ago. German unification was a decisive trigger for changing the
   country's sense of nationhood and the popular narrative of what
   constitutes modes of legitimate belonging and inclusion. The hypothesis
   of this article is that over the two and a half decades Germany has
   shifted the coding of its national identity from an ethno-cultural
   framing to one that is primarily based on civic political principles. A
   comparison between framing strategies of the political elite in two
   periods (1990-95 and 2010-15) serves as an empirical indicator for the
   scope and nature of this transformation. The article identifies four
   factors to explain what has instigated this change and what is driving
   the long-term socio-political transformation of German society as a
   result of growing migration and cultural diversity: (a) the demographic
   change and transformation of civil society through migration; (b) the
   growing relevance of European communal belonging; (c) the dynamic of
   competitive party politics; and (d) the significance of the subnational
   level in addressing migration and diversity matters.},

Abstract = {With ``The Russian Orthodox Church's Basic Teaching on Human Dignity,
   Freedom and Rights{''}, the Orthodox Church is attempting to reposition
   itself in Russia. It presents itself as a witness to and counsel for
   human rights on the basis of Orthodox anthropology. With this
   theological teaching, the church formulates its aspiration to shape the
   legislative framework and society in Russia according to Orthodox ideas.
   However, in so doing, it underestimates the religious and social
   plurality of the Russian population, and Russia's integration in the
   globalised world.},

Journal = {DEMOCRACY \& SECURITY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {13},
Number = {2},
Pages = {144-165},
Abstract = {Immanuel Kant's political treatise Perpetual Peace can be seen as a
   project for world peace with practical value. Applied to contemporary
   word politics, the United Nations is commonly seen to be the closest
   approximation of this project. This article argues that such a view is
   misguided and fails to perceive that the United Nations lacks crucial
   elements of a Kantian peace federation. Kant's argumentation for
   perpetual peace rests on two pillars: peace through law and peace
   through institution. Both of these are necessary conditions that must be
   supplanted by an exclusive peace federation of republican states in
   order to make a sufficient guarantee for lasting peace. Viewed from this
   perspective, the European Union comes closest to a real-world Kantian
   peace federation, even though it remains a regional organization, and
   despite the current challenges it faces.},

   COMMUNICATION},
Year = {2017},
Pages = {97-110},
Abstract = {In contrast to the theory that human beings make rational decisions that
   maximize their own benefits, prominent theories of cognitive functioning
   currently assert that there are universal flaws in information
   processing and decision-making. Still others emphasize cognitive
   personality traits that underlie individual differences in
   decision-making tendencies. Unlike these primarily trait-oriented
   constructs, integrative complexity (IC) theory proposes a state
   variable: a structure of information processing that changes dynamically
   as a function of various exogenic and endogenic factors. One of these is
   stress, hypothesized to cause curvilinear changes in the complexity of
   thought. Predictions based on IC theory have had considerable empirical
   support - e.g. in studies of leaders' decision-making in international
   crises. In addition, recent research has shown that some eminent leaders
   are relatively impervious to the usual disruptive impact of stress on
   IC. The ability to process information and make decisions at high levels
   of IC even under stress may be a factor underlying the stability of
   long-term successful careers, although the causal relationship is as yet
   unknown and in at least one situation (the aftermath of revolutions) the
   effect is reversed.},

Abstract = {This article describes the creation and implementation of a new online
   assessment program ({''}PACKS{''}) for the department of politics at the
   University of Virginia. It discusses the benefits of online assessments,
   including the ease of administration, minimal faculty involvement,
   ability to link assessment data to existing student data (e. g., GPA and
   courses completed), and ability to track student progress over time. The
   assessment can be easily adapted for use by other departments in the
   social sciences and by other colleges and universities. The authors
   discuss the drawbacks to this type of assessment, including the
   challenge of obtaining the highest number of respondents. They recommend
   using a strong incentive to ensure full participation, such as an
   advising hold that prevents students from registering until they
   complete the assessment. The authors contend that implementing
   survey-based assessment tools is an ideal way for departments to meet
   their accrediting institutions' assessment requirements.},

Abstract = {This article intervenes in the debate about whether democracies should
   adopt national education standards. For many democrats, national
   education standards may promote economic growth, social justice, and a
   common set of interests. In this article, I reconstruct John Dewey's
   warning against oligarchs using standardization to control the schools
   as well as his argument that democracy requires student, teacher, and
   community autonomy. The article argues that the Common Core State
   Standards Initiative has been a top-down policy that aims to prepare
   children for the economy rather than democracy, and for the foreseeable
   future, economic elites will tend to dominate efforts to create national
   education standards. In the conclusion, I make a pragmatic argument for
   local education control and address objections such as that democracies
   need national educational standards to ensure racial equity.},

Journal = {POLITIX},

Abstract = {Based on an ethnography of young workers who have taken their employer
   to court, this paper examines the genesis of their mobilization. It
   shows that the sentiment of injustice is not necessarily the only force
   driving their recourse to the Council of Prud'hommes. Certainly,
   litigants believe that the hardships they have experienced in the
   workplace should be recognized and compensated symbolically and/or
   financially. However, next to offensive uses of justice stands a more
   defensive approach: for some of them, legal action is, above all, a last
   resort and aims to put an end to their employment contract. Furthermore,
   this paper sheds light on the socializing effect of litigation. Once the
   court proceeding is completed, although young workers can experience an
   improvement of their legal and procedural knowledge, it tends to remain
   limited to their particular case. On the other hand, the effect on their
   perception of employment relationships appears more striking. Their
   experience of the tribunals confirms the existence of conflicting
   interests between workers and employers and encourages the development
   of a consciousness of ``the right to have rights.{''}},

Abstract = {In recent decades, the role of objects in the determination of social
   situations has attracted the attention of various disciplinary
   approaches, from anthropology to sociology, to the theory of design. In
   this regard, it has been widely suggested that thorough understanding of
   social phenomena requires acknowledgement that also objects - under
   certain conditions - have agency, i.e. the capacity to produce
   autonomous and unexpected effects in their surroundings. The
   Actor-Network Theory of Bruno Latour is a potentially very important
   theoretical source for this debate. This article reconstructs the
   contribution of Latour's theory to the discussion on the agency of
   objects by addressing three matters in particular. Latour's theory is
   presented in the context of the debate on the agency of objects in order
   to highlight its original contribution. The roots and evolution of the
   Latourian position on agency of objects is reconstructed within the
   broader framework of the Actor-Network Theory, because Latour's theory
   has undergone constant change and specification over the years since its
   original formulation. The article concludes by reflecting on an issue
   that Latour's contribution does not help to resolve: the correct
   definition of the role performed by the phenomenological intentionality
   of humans in determining the agency of objects.},

Abstract = {The move from territorial defence to `wars of choice' has influenced the
   domestic politics of military interventions. This paper examines the
   extent to which both the substance and the procedure of military
   interventions are contested among political parties. Regarding the
   substance, our analysis of Chapel Hill Expert Survey data demonstrates
   that across European states political parties on the right are more
   supportive of military missions than those on the left. On the
   decision-making procedures, our case studies of Germany, France, Spain
   and the United Kingdom show that political parties on the left tend to
   favour strong parliamentary control whereas those on the right tend to
   prefer an unconstrained executive, although with differences across
   countries. These findings challenge the view that `politics stops at the
   water's edge' and contribute to a better understanding of how political
   parties and parliaments influence military interventions.},

Abstract = {Does globalization affect the demand-side of politics, and if so, how?
   This paper builds on new developments in trade theory to argue that
   globalization matters, but that its effects on individuals' perceptions
   of labor market risk and policy preferences are more heterogenous than
   previous research has acknowledged. Globalization exposure increases
   risk perceptions and demands for social protection among low-skilled
   individuals, but decreases them among high-skilled individuals. This
   conditional effect is observationally distinct from classic trade models
   as well as arguments that deindustrialization or ideology predominantly
   drive such perceptions and preferences. Analyzing cross-national survey
   data from 16 European countries and focusing both on trade and
   offshoring, the empirical analyses support the prediction that exposure
   to globalization affects high-and low-skilled individuals differently,
   leading to variation in labor market risk perceptions and policy
   preferences.},

Abstract = {While Airstrip One is indeed quintessentially English,-not even
   British-in its setting and flavor, and it has a Soviet style political
   ethos mediated through that setting, it is clearly part of an
   Anglo-American polity which, perhaps if death had not been looming,
   Orwell would have drawn in a more intellectually satisfactory and
   coherent way. His correspondence with New York showed that he drew
   sustenance in more ways than just financial, but also intellectual
   stimulation about social and geopolitical developments, not least
   discussion of Utopias and dystopias. Orwell helped Macdonald to create a
   mode of discourse, a space in which Howe and others could flourish.
   Rooted and assured as they both were in their own societies, they could
   integrate their socialist visions with the real world about them. They
   could bring humanity, decency (that word again), and intellectual rigor,
   along with humor and practicality, to discuss politics.},

Abstract = {China's economy ended 2016 with 6.7\% growth. It formally ended its era
   of double-digit growth in 2012 with 7.7\%. China has managed growth
   deceleration remarkably well by letting it slide gradually. This was
   achieved mainly by the government's pro-growth policy intervention
   through expansionary fiscal and monetary policies. The government has
   recently refocused its macroeconomic policy from demand-side management
   to supply-side structural reforms, giving priority to reducing
   over-capacity and de-leveraging. For 2017, growth is expected to slow to
   6.5\% due to great uncertainties including the potentially hostile US
   economic policies of President Trump.},

   Ideology},
Journal = {NEW PERSPECTIVES},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {25},
Number = {1},
Pages = {19-54},
Abstract = {Critical Balkanology is a sub-discipline of Central and East European
   Studies that deconstructs and renders arbitrary the claims of ethnic
   nationalisms and Western ``colonial{''} representations of the Balkans.
   Yet, this critical and nominally anti-racist project is parasitic on a
   hegemonic Euro-Atlantic liberal ideology in that it cannot see beyond
   the singular individual as victim and vanguard, thereby obscuring and/or
   effacing an awareness of class inequality. Tomislav Longinovic's Vampire
   Nation: Violence as Cultural Imaginary (2011) is emblematic of this
   project. I place this text under an immanent critique and a contrapuntal
   reading as an example of how one can rescue class consciousness from
   this literature and push the limits of its politics while, in
   Longinovic's case, reading it against the socioeconomic contradictions
   of post-Milosevic Serbia. Longinovic's tracing of the vampire metaphor
   as a way of understanding the consumptive nature of both ethnic
   nationalism and Western imperialism reveals a politics that stigmatizes
   Serbia's plebeian history in favour of a Westernized and urban middle
   class youth cult of techno-culture, rock music, and the disembodied
   voices of (male) intellectuals - a form of epistemic violence that
   parallels processes of privatization, social cleansing, and class
   oppression consuming the bodies of (sub)proletarians.},

Abstract = {Research on the supply side of politics demonstrates that populism acts
   as a common denominator even though populist parties possess very
   different ideological positions. However, it is uncertain whether this
   translates to the demand side: Do voters support left and right-wing
   populist parties for similar reasons? Using the Netherlands as our case
   study, we investigate the common demand side characteristics of
   supporters of populist radical right and populist radical left parties.
   The paper concludes that populist attitudes (i.e. a people-centered
   notion of political representation) unify supporters of both populist
   radical left and populist radical right parties. Supporters of both
   parties also demonstrate lower levels of political trust (than voters
   for other parties): this is particularly the case for PVV supporters.
   Beyond these similarities we find that the PVV and the SP attract very
   different supporters. PVV supporters demonstrate low immigrant
   tolerance, while SP voters support more income equality.},

Abstract = {As European populations become more religiously diverse and governments
   respond to the changes brought by recent migration, political debates
   vis-a-vis the place of religion in the public sphere are likely to
   increase. The apparent tensions between individual religious freedom,
   national cohesion, and government control of the public sphere lie at
   the heart of French narratives of `laicite',France's particular approach
   to secularism. In this paper, the laicite narratives of the top
   Republicain candidates-Juppe, Fillon, and Sarkozy-illustrate the range
   of narratives used by parties on the right, from `establishment' to
   `identitarian.' The paper also provides a general political opportunity
   space model that incorporates right-left and cosmopolitan-identitarian
   dimensions and stretches beyond the boundaries of the French right to
   include a full range of the available space on this issue. This model
   can thus be applied to similar research in other states and regions.},

Year = {2017},
Volume = {45},
Number = {6},

Abstract = {What if everyone voted? There is consensus that increased turnout
   generally, but not always, benefits Democrats, but recent evidence
   suggests that it is unlikely to change election outcomes considering the
   paucity of close races. For the first time, we examine this question
   using gubernatorial races along with Senate races from 2008 and 2010,
   estimating the behavior of nonvoters based on individual-level data from
   known voters. We find that the substantive effect of full turnout is
   understated, particularly in close gubernatorial races. As these races
   determine partisan control of executive branches, we demonstrate that
   full turnout would result in more politically meaningful changes than
   suggested in previous research focusing only on Senate or presidential
   elections. While the empirical consequences of increased turnout are
   well understood, our findings suggest that the substantive effects
   continue to be understated.},

Abstract = {Intellectuals as presidents are few-seven in all-and mostly far between:
   the two Adamses, Jefferson, and Madison early on; the first Roosevelt
   and Wilson early in the last century; and Obama most recently. The early
   cluster springs in part from social recruitment and education then
   prevailing. The later pair also came at a time of elevated public
   discourse. The latest seems to be a product of sheer chance. The
   intellectualism of the latter three was self-conscious and mostly
   constructive to their presidencies. The prospects for future
   intellectuals as presidents are not bright.},

Title = {The Contagion Effects of the Feminist Initiative in Sweden:
   Agenda-setting, Niche Parties and Mainstream Parties},

Abstract = {As new parties have emerged in Europe on the left and the right, they
   have placed pressure on mainstream parties to adjust their issue
   positions and engage with new issues. This research note asks whether
   women's parties have the same effect. Analysing election manifestos of
   the mainstream parties in Sweden from 1991 to 2014, this article
   considers the extent to which the Swedish Feminist Initiative (F!) has
   influenced the attention parties pay to women's issues. The data
   indicate that a profound discursive change has occurred among these
   parties in Sweden around gender and women's roles in society, resulting
   in near consensus that gender inequality is a problem necessitating
   government action. There is gradual evolution for most of the period
   under study but a marked departure from past trends in 2014, coinciding
   with the emergence of F! as a contender for EU and parliamentary seats.
   Consistent with contagion theory, the concerns of women acquired urgency
   as F! grew more competitive. News coverage and public comment by
   political parties suggests that F! has had disproportionate influence,
   given its electoral support, on the issue agenda of the mainstream
   parties, pressuring them to take up' the issues of this niche party and
   engaging them in a competitive struggle to address women's issues in
   politics. The results indicate that we should look more closely at
   women's parties as a tactical choice of social movements to enhance
   women's representation and encourage public discourse about gender and
   power.},

Abstract = {A comprehensive literature relates voters' electoral decisions to their
   perceptions of candidates' personalities. Yet the mechanisms through
   which voters are attracted to certain candidates and not to others
   remain largely unresolved. To answer this question, this article
   integrates two recent interdisciplinary insights. First, leader and
   candidate preferences are found to be strongly dependent on levels of
   contextual conflict. Second, individual differences in political
   ideology are shown to be rooted in psychological orientations leading
   conservatives and liberals to perceive society in fundamentally
   different ways: Conservatives tend to perceive the social world as
   dangerous and threatening, whereas liberals to a larger degree see
   society as a safe place characterized by cooperation. Based on this, it
   is predicted that conservatives and liberals will also prefer different
   candidate personalities. Specifically, conservatives are predicted to
   value candidate power and ``strong leadership{''} more than liberals,
   whereas liberals are predicted to value candidate warmth more than
   conservatives. The prediction is supported observationally using the
   1984-2008 American National Election Studies and experimentally in two
   original experiments conducted in the United States and Denmark.
   Consequences and scope conditions for trait-based voting are discussed.},

Abstract = {Does direct democracy strengthen popular control of public policy in the
   United States? A major challenge in evaluating policy representation is
   the measurement of state-level public opinion and public policy.
   Although recent studies of policy responsiveness and congruence have
   provided improved measures of public opinion using multilevel regression
   and poststratification (MRP) techniques, these analyses are limited by
   their static nature and cross-sectional design. Issue attitudes, unlike
   more general political orientations, often vary considerably over time.
   Unless the dynamics of issue-specific public opinion are appropriately
   incorporated into the analyses, tests of policy responsiveness and
   congruence may be misleading. Thus, we assess the degree of policy
   representation in direct democracy states regarding same-sex
   relationship recognition policies using dynamic models of policy
   adoption and congruence that employ dynamic MRP estimates of attitudes
   toward same-sex marriage. We find that direct democracy institutions
   increase both policy responsiveness and congruence with issue-specific
   public opinion.},

Abstract = {This article seeks to highlight the main lines of the debates on
   populism in Spain in recent years. As these debates have taken place
   mostly, but not exclusively, within academia, it will examine
   intellectual contributions with significant influence on the discussion
   or representative of prevalent views on the populist question. After a
   brief review of the main milestones of the recent reception and
   development of the debate in Spain, we will begin by addressing the
   understanding of what populism is and what it responds to, as well as
   its rejection of liberal positions and its republican reception, before
   analysing the various ways in which the populist phenomenon is thought
   in relation to future political praxis. As we will see, this transit
   cannot be traversed without considering the type of articulation between
   concepts such as (post) hegemony, sovereignty, representation, nation or
   people, and reflecting on the relationship between subject and culture
   under the neoliberal regime. The relevance of the topic, its very
   different modulations, and the public presence that it has acquired,
   advise the consideration of further sources beyond the strictly academic
   ones.},

Title = {President Obama on the ballot: Referendum voting and racial spillover in
   the 2014 midterm elections},
Journal = {ELECTORAL STUDIES},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {50},
Pages = {80-90},

Abstract = {The 2014 elections were widely viewed as a referendum on the presidency
   of Barack Obama. Republicans ran against the incumbent president, and
   many view the Republican Party's victories in 2014 as a mass rejection
   of President Obama's policies. We argue that this account of the 2014
   elections is incomplete. We advance the theory of racial spillover that
   associating an attitude object with President Obama causes public
   opinion to polarize on the basis of racial attitudes to explain both
   vote choice and referendum voting in the 2014 elections. In an analysis
   of the CCES and an original survey, we show that congressional vote
   choice was strongly racialized in 2014. We go on to show that
   perceptions of the election as a referendum on President Obama were also
   racialized, and that these perceptions mediated the link between racial
   animus and 2014 congressional vote choice. This represents the first
   study to show that racialized congressional evaluations continued into
   2014 and we provide direct evidence that attitudes about President Obama
   mediated the effect of racial animus on congressional vote choice. We
   conclude by discussing the implications for referendum voting, racial
   spillover, and the 2014 midterm elections. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {While a vast theoretical literature argues that we live in populist
   times, the success of populism beyond its electoral dimension is rarely
   investigated empirically. This paper analyses the development of
   populism in five Western European countries (Austria, Germany,
   Netherlands, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom) from the 1970s to the
   2010s. First, it measures whether political parties articulate populist
   discourses more and more often in their election manifestos. Second, the
   paper tests whether the presence of populism has increased over time in
   newspaper articles. The results show that populism is not a new
   phenomenon and that there is no linear increase over the decades.
   Moreover, while election manifestos are significantly more populist in
   the 2010s than in previous decades, populism in newspaper articles
   remains rather stable at a low level, suggesting that the media curb
   rather than foster populist discourses.},

   Constitution of Costa Rica to acknowledge the multicultural and
   pluriethnic character of the nation, in terms of its protagonists and
   timing of approval. On the one hand, it suggests a relationship between
   racial formation processes and a constitutional multicultural delay. On
   the other, it recognizes the challenges and strategies of Afro-Costa

Abstract = {Much is known about the domestic politics of globalization, but
   political scientists have largely ignored one critical link between the
   international economy and many individuals around the world: mass media.
   Considering the likely effects of mass media on public perceptions of
   responsibility, this article develops an argument about the effects of
   mass media on individuals' blame attributions for the adjustment costs
   of economic globalization. The theory is tested on survey data from
   France in 1992-1993. The evidence suggests that mass media may shift the
   public's blame attributions away from the government and toward
   external, international forces.},

Abstract = {This article, a pilot study, examines the behavior of courts in
   federalism disputes. It explores the circumstances that lead courts to
   take a centralist or, more interestingly, a noncentralist stance in
   disputes between national and subnational governments. Several
   hypotheses are tested, relying on a sample of eleven federations, with
   attention to institutional features such as the extent of subnational
   representation in federal policymaking, the degree of integration of the
   party system, the role of states in the appointment of judges and
   composition of the court, the extent of decentralization of the federal
   system, and the devolutionary and multinational nature of the
   federation. Courts seem more likely to take a noncentralist stance in
   the presence of weak representation of subnational governments at the
   federal level, a low centralization gradient or, in particular, the
   context of a devolutionary multinational state. In contrast, low
   representation of states in selection of judges or composition of the
   courts seem to encourage a more centralist stance.},

Abstract = {Explaining the principles of civil liability in cases that someone
   injured bodily is now one of the most important issues of law. In fact,
   in these cases, the question is why someone should compensate other
   damage? While has not been violated of the contract. If doing the action
   is allowed, and the subject has the legal authority to do it or fault or
   bad intention does not occur from him, can be imagined again a
   responsibility for him? In this regard, civil and criminal liability
   separate from each other and each is analyzed separately. Foundations of
   theoretical, practical, legal and in addition to these, in our rights
   jurisprudence foundations have been added to the former cases. Each of
   these has sub sets, and each tried to explain that when someone injured
   bodily the other, why and how to compensate? Who should compensate? To
   compensate, what must be proved? And of course, in similar cases,
   results are obtained that each has minor and sometimes major
   differences. Now, the theoretical foundations (fault, risk, etc.) are
   accepted and analyzed in Iranian law and in English law, but absolutely
   none of them have gone towards one of the comments.},

   resistance Union Confiteros, which grouped confectionery officers
   employed in shops and factories of the city of Buenos Aires, and was
   under socialist hegemony between 1904 and 1919. This case study of a
   union directed by socialist militants is relevant to analyze the
   ``thorny{''} relations between the Argentine Socialist Party and the
   labor movement during the first decades of the 20th century. This will
   allow us to show, for this case, a dynamic articulation between union
   activity and political struggles. We will analyze socialist press (La
   Vanguardia) and the trade union newspaper Union Confiteros.},

Abstract = {Previous studies have shown nonpartisan direct mail interventions have a
   small turnout effect. It is less clear, however, what effect these
   interventions have with regard to cognitive mobilization of young
   voters. We report the results of a large (N=52,324) experiment conducted
   during the February 2015 mayoral election in Chicago. A random sample of
   22,179 registrants between 18 and 30 were sent a voter guide containing
   two sets of orienting political information for the five candidates: a
   list of their endorsements and their policy positions on five issues in
   the campaign. We find turnout among the treated group was 0.9 points
   higher than the control group which did not receive a guide (33.6\%
   compared with 32.7\%; SE is 0.003). We find, however, that treated
   registrants in above-median household income census tracts are
   significantly more likely to vote than treated registrants in
   lower-income census tracts.},

Volume = {45},

Abstract = {One of the more important innovations in the study of how citizens
   assess the U.S. Supreme Court is the ideological updating model, which
   assumes that citizens grant legitimacy to the institution according to
   the perceived distance between themselves and the Court on a
   unidimensional ideological (liberal-conservative) continuum. Under this
   model, citizens are also said to update this calculation with every new
   salient Supreme Court decision. The model's requirements, however, do
   not seem to square with the long-established view that Americans are
   largely innocent of ideology. Here, we conduct an audit of the model's
   mechanisms using a series of empirical tests applied to a nationally
   representative sample. Our general conclusion is that the ideological
   updating model, especially when supplemented with the requirement that
   citizens must become aware of Court decisions, simply does not square
   with the realities of American politics. Students of Supreme Court
   legitimacy may therefore want to search for other theories of legitimacy
   updating.},

Abstract = {The formalization of indigenous autonomy in the context of the
   decolonization of the Bolivian State engenders new opportunities for
   reconciliation between indigenous communities and the mixed-urban
   society, but in the Andean highlands this process has stalled. The
   mechanisms of self-government of the highland indigenous peoples, known
   as the ayllu system, are tied to ways of thinking which are not easily
   compatible with notions of Nation State and representation through
   political parties. At the same time, views differ both within the
   communities and in the government about what indigenous autonomy should
   look like in practice, and who would benefit from it. This essay focuses
   on four case studies-Totora Marka, Jesus de Machaca, Chayanta and Uru
   Chipaya- which share the ayllu social system.},

Abstract = {Much of what we know about Zimbabwe's liberation war heroes and heroines
   is associated with the Zimbabwe African National Union Patriotic Front
   (ZANU-PF)'s recognition of individuals who defended its hold on power.
   However, of late, an upsurge in factionalism in the party has resulted
   in increasing reference to heroism as a means to exert factional
   dominance. An understanding of how this has been done can be used to
   explain ZANU-PF factional dynamics. Current studies call for the study
   of factionalism to focus on intra-party group dynamics instead of the
   traditional organisation forms of factions. It is in this context that
   this study argues that survival or fall of factions within (ZANU-PF) is
   framed around issues of heroism that is around one's perceived
   contribution or non-contribution to the liberation struggle. This
   article demonstrates this growing phenomenon in ZANU-PF by analysing
   five well-known ZANU-PF veteran leaders whose status has been reshaped
   by new political moments as factionalism intensified. In light of rising
   factionalism, we argue that, war hero/heroine status in ZANU-PF is not
   permanent, but is highly shaped by obtaining factional political

Abstract = {It is widely assumed that political parties need to have members in
   order to fulfil their functions in a representative democracy (drawing
   up platforms, candidate nomination and electoral mobilization) and in
   terms of their legitimacy. However, the theoretical literature on party
   models - the evolution from the mass party to the catch-all party, the
   electoral-professional party and/or the cartel party - suggests an
   increasing marginalization of members within the party organization. In
   the business-firm party model, members no longer have any role
   whatsoever. The next phase in this development seems to be a party
   without members. This article analyses the contextual (societal,
   communicational and institutional) factors favouring the rise and
   endurance of the memberless party as well as the strategic conditions
   for doing without formal membership (such as maximizing the
   centralization of internal decision-making, promoting party unity and
   enhancing electoral effectiveness). The functioning of two no-member
   parties - the Freedom Party in the Netherlands and the Lega dei Ticinesi
   in Switzerland - will be discussed in the empirical part of this
   article.},

Abstract = {How do members of racial groups explain the large disparity in the way
   Blacks and Whites are treated by the criminal justice system in the
   United States? And how do such explanations (attributions) influence
   support for punitive crime control policies in America, as well as
   arguments against such policies? Our study of the structure, sources,
   and consequences of racial attributions in the justice system, using
   original survey data in Washington state, contributes to the literature
   in several ways. First, unlike traditional measures of racial
   prejudicethat is, racial resentment and stereotypesour measure of racial
   attributions distinguishes cleanly between dispositional explanations
   (e.g., Blacks' aggressive nature) and discrimination. Second, we examine
   the attributions of three pivotal groups with different experiences with
   legal authorities: Latinos, Blacks, and Whites. Third, an issue framing
   experiment demonstrates the power of both attributions for shaping
   support for the death penalty and arguments against the policy based on
   racial justice.},

Abstract = {In a recent Research and Politics article, we showed that for many types
   of time series data, concerns about spurious relationships can be
   overcome by following standard procedures associated with cointegration
   tests and the general error correction model (GECM). Matthew Lebo and
   Patrick Kraft (LK) incorrectly argue that our recommended approach will
   lead researchers to identify false (i.e., spurious) relationships. In
   this article, we show how LK's response is incorrect or misleading in
   multiple ways. Most importantly, when we correct their simulations,
   their results reinforce our previous findings, highlighting the utility
   of the GECM when estimated and interpreted correctly.},

Abstract = {Individual cities are active interest groups in lobbying the federal
   government, and yet the dynamics of this intergovernmental lobbying are
   poorly understood. We argue that preference incongruence between a city
   and its parent state government leads to underprovision of public goods,
   and cities need to appeal to the federal government for additional
   resources. We provide evidence for this theory using a data set of over
   13,800 lobbying disclosures filed by cities with populations over 25,000
   between 1999 and 2012. Income inequality and ethnic fragmentation are
   also highly related to federal lobbying activities. Using an
   instrumental variables analysis of earmark and Recovery Act grant data,
   we show that each dollar a city spends on lobbying generates substantial
   returns.},

Abstract = {The right to know the truth is established as one of the rights

   different grounds: certain victim's information is protected as personal
   data on the grounds of privacy rights and certain files are still kept
   as a classified information. Thus, the article analyses if such
   limitations in post-Communist countries are compatible with Article 8 of
   the European Convention on Human Rights. The answer is provided using
   mainly an analysis of the case law of the European Court of Human
   Rights. Lithuania as a case study was chosen for the analysis in a
   situation where certain files are kept as classified information.},

Abstract = {In this introduction to the Special Issue, we undertake a little ground
   clearing in order to make room in International Relations for thinking
   differently about anarchy and world politics. Anarchy's roots in, and
   association with, social contract theory and the state of nature has
   unduly narrowed how we might understand the concept and its potential in
   International Relations. Indeed, such is the consensus in this regard
   that anarchy is remarkably uncontested, considering its centrality to
   the field. Looking around, both inside and outside International
   Relations, for alternative accounts, we find ample materials for helping
   us think anew about the nature of and possibilities for politics in
   anarchy. In the second part of the introduction, we show how our
   contributors develop and expand on these resources and what we hope the
   Special Issue brings to International Relations.},

Abstract = {This paper analyzes how different levels of political constraints
   influence the reform outcomes of ideologically different party
   governments. The statistical analyses show that leftist governments
   facing high level of political constraints privilege the core workforce
   by increasing the redistributive generosity of core social security
   programs while at the same time accommodating the right-wing opposition
   with higher cuts in social spending. If constraints are low, left-wing
   governments have a less clientelistic approach to welfare state reforms.
   Right-wing party governments are mostly interested in cost containment
   and significantly decrease social spending when political constraints
   are low. The findings of this paper complement the literature on the
   dualization of labor markets and the privileged position of labor market
   insiders within the workforce by showing that leftist governments, under
   certain circumstances, lead to an increasing difference between labor
   market insiders, and globalization losers. The empirical analysis is
   based on pooled cross section time series analysis covering 18 countries
   over a period of 30 years.},

Abstract = {Why have group-party alliances become more common since the
   mid-twentieth century? To address this question, I develop a continuum
   of group-party relationships, running from fluid, unstructured
   interactions, akin to political pluralism, to highly institutionalized
   alliances, as we might see in a firm. Drawing on pluralist scholarship
   and theories of firm formation and evolution, I explore the costs and
   benefits of different arrangements and explain why we might expect to
   see movement along the continuum over time. On the one hand, pluralism
   offers flexibility to parties and groups, and alliances have little
   value when parties are too weak to discipline their members in Congress.
   On the other, institutionalized alliances offer significant efficiency
   and security gains, which are especially valuable during periods of
   growth. I demonstrate the plausibility of this organizational theory by
   examining the evolution of group-party relations in the executive branch
   from the Nixon through Reagan administrations using archival documents
   collected at four presidential libraries.},

Abstract = {This article analyses how the representation of women legislators may
   affect the oversight of national ICT policy. The article uses Critical
   Mass Theory (CMT) to explain the composition of the Media and
   Communications Committee (MCC) of parliament. The case of Malawi is
   analysed, which represented a low-income economy in Africa. The article
   uses electoral reports and legislative documents. The results show that
   women legislators in the MCC achieved a critical mass despite the
   decrease in the representation of women in parliament. The women
   legislators have the opportunity to support gender issues related to ICT
   legislations and national ICT policy oversight. However, the functions
   of MCC related to national ICT policy oversight were not aligned with
   the gender equity strategies. This may affect the priority of gender
   issues in the policy oversight. The article contributes towards
   literature on national ICT policy oversight in the context of developing
   countries.},

Title = {Ideal Theory after Auschwitz? The Practical Uses and Ideological Abuses
   of Political Theory as Reconciliation},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF POLITICS},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {79},
Number = {4},
Pages = {1177-1190},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Contemporary debates about ideal and nonideal theory rest on an
   underlying consensus that the primary practical task of political theory
   is directing action. This overlooks other urgent practical work that
   theory can do, including showing how injustice can be made bearable and
   how resisting it can be meaningful. I illustrate this important
   possibility by revisiting the purpose for which John Rawls originally
   developed the concept of ideal theory: reconciling a democratic public
   to living in a flawed world that may otherwise seem more of a home for
   catastrophe than justice. However, Rawls's account of reconciliation is
   flawed; because of his methodology, the realistic utopia he constructs
   as a source of hope can be used to defend an unjust status quo. By
   drawing lessons from Theodor Adorno's contrasting view of reconciliation
   after the Holocaust, I offer a more democratic method for political
   theory to offer sources of hope to the public.},
