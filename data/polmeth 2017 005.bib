Abstract = {We know compulsory voting is associated with higher levels of electoral
   turnout. It has been suggested that this leads to a trade-off with the
   quality of the vote, i.e. the ideological congruence between voters and
   the party they vote for. In this study, this claim is investigated using
   data from the 2007, 2010, and 2013 elections in Australia. We also
   include a comparison with two recent elections in Belgium, another
   country with compulsory voting. The results show that reluctant voters
   vote less ideologically congruent, but that this effect is mediated by
   political knowledge and political interest. However, this does not lead
   to less ideologically congruent election results at the aggregate level
   and compulsory voting does not have an impact on electoral results. We
   speculate that in future studies, it is important to make a distinction
   between reluctant voters, and those who take a strong hostile stand on
   the electoral process.},

Abstract = {At current era, international humanitarian law has much importance and
   different dimensions while before the establishment of the United
   Nations Organization; merely bill conventions considered this issue. But
   after the formation of the United Nations Organization, Geneva rights
   were formed in 1949. Humanitarian law has different dimensions like
   family discussions that have been reflected in numerous documents of
   humanitarian law. For example, in quadruple Geneva conventions and two
   additional protocols, the cases from this view for exerting some humane
   supports of families can be considered. Even in some cases, according to
   the competence of the international penal court, some crimes against
   women and children have been criminalized, and massive criminal
   guarantees have been ordained for dealing with them. Therefore, in this
   article about the necessity and importance of the support of a family
   dynasty as the central core of human societies, numerous documents of
   humanitarian law have been studied and analyzed for supporting this
   important social element. Also, this result was obtained that in armed
   conflicts such as domestic or international, protection of a relation
   between the family members and special support of women, physically
   challenged persons and children in the first degree are considered as
   supportive priorities in Geneva conventions and supportive documents of
   humanitarian law.},

Abstract = {Worldwide, the publishing industry has been compelled to change with
   digital media technology, and some traditional academic journals are
   struggling to adapt. This article examines the marketing and publicity
   actions available to the Canadian Journal of Political Science/Revue
   canadienne de science politique and similar flagship journals in an
   environment characterized by open access (OA) and impact factor (IF)
   metrics. It reviews the opportunities and threats presented by a
   movement towards publishing in ungated forums and pressure in the
   academic community to prioritize bibliometrics. It then looks at the
   experience, characteristics and comparative position of the
   Journal/Revue before reporting on perceptions and recommendations drawn
   from depth interviews with journal editors, presidents of the Canadian
   Political Science Association, and a university librarian, which are
   supplemented by suggestions from editorial board members. It concludes
   with proposals to address these circumstances head on, many of which are
   generalizable to other journals wrestling with marketing and publishing
   in the digital age.
   Resume Dans le monde entier, l'industrie de l'edition s'est vu
   contrainte d'evoluer avec la technologie numerique et certaines revues
   specialisees peinent a s'adapter. Cet article examine les actions de
   mise en marche et de publicite dont la Revue canadienne de science
   politique/Canadian Journal of Political Science et des publications
   phares similaires disposent dans un environnement caracterise par les
   mesures du libre acces (LA) et du facteur d'impact (FI). Il analyse les
   opportunites et risques que presente le passage a la publication dans
   des plates-formes non balisees et la pression exercee sur le milieu
   universitaire pour accorder la priorite aux donnees bibliometriques. Il
   passe ensuite en revue l'experience, les caracteristiques et la posture
   comparative de la Revue/Journal. De plus, il presente les differentes
   observations et recommandations issues d'entretiens approfondis avec des
   editeurs, des presidents de l'Association canadienne de science
   politique et d'un bibliothecaire universitaire. Des suggestions emanant
   des membres du comite de redaction completent le portrait. En
   conclusion, il formule des propositions pour attaquer de front ces
   circonstances, dont beaucoup peuvent etre generalisees a d'autres revues
   qui se debattent avec les enjeux de la mise en marche et de la publicite

Abstract = {There has been considerable debate among historians and public
   commentators about whether or not the Great Irish Famine (1845-1851)
   could be considered as genocide. Recently, controversial journalist Tim
   Pat Coogan has argued that England's treatment of Ireland in this period
   can be considered genocide. Historical evidence suggests otherwise.
   There was considerable blame for the perpetration of Ireland misery
   beyond the ill conceived and poorly executed policies of successive
   British governments. At the root of the famine tragedy was an outmoded
   and poorly functioning landholding system and over-dependence of an
   impoverished rural underclass on the potato staple. Anglo-Irish
   landlords, merchants, businessmen of all denominations, large
   landholding farmers, nationalist politicians, clergy, ineffective
   implementation of poor relief by local gentry, and unscrupulous port
   officials and ship's captains must also bear some responsibility in
   contributing to this calamity in modern Irish history.},

Abstract = {In order to explore the roots of contemporary Sinophobia in Central
   Asia, this article combines historical analysis with ethnographically
   informed interviews. It shows that Sinophobia is widely spread through
   conspiracy theories especially in Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan. Based on
   the territorial acquisitions made by China in the immediate post-Soviet
   period, conspiracy theories suggest that China is planning to ``take
   over{''} Central Asia. However, a diachronic view of relations between
   China and Central Asian states demonstrates that these acquisitions were
   part of an attempt to resolve colonial disputes dating back to the late
   19th century, and that China has already significantly reduced its
   territorial claims. Fears of contemporary Chinese territorial expansion
   are therefore greatly exaggerated. This article concludes by endorsing a
   proactive stance on tackling Sinophobia in Central Asia, both for the
   Chinese government and for regional states. Other than the many economic
   initiatives it funds in Central Asia, China must put more efforts to
   enhance its soft power so as to assuage the century-long Sinophobia in
   the region.},

Abstract = {It is likely that ten years of economic crisis have eroded the support
   of democracy in Europe. But how much? The existing research is divided
   on this issue. Some claim that the degree of satisfaction with democracy
   has declined across the whole of Europe during the Great Recession.
   Other researchers have found no empirical evidence that the support of
   democracy as a core value has declined across Europe. They claim that
   merely the specific support has decreased in some countries. This
   article will use the data from the European Social Survey to verify both
   claims. It shows that the Great Recession did not lead to a legitimacy
   crisis of European democracies and that the diffuse support of democracy
   remains high in most regions. The degree to which the specific support
   of democracy has been weakened is moderated by the type of welfare
   regime. In countries where the economic crisis did strike hard and the
   welfare state is weakly developed, the support of democracy has dropped
   dramatically. This outcome takes a middle position between two extremes
   in the ongoing academic debate on the support of democracy. Both
   positions regarding the increase or decrease of support of and
   satisfaction with democracy are in need of more nuance by taking into
   account the impact of welfare regimes. Existing research often assumes a
   uniform European context that shows either increasing or decreasing
   levels of satisfaction with democracy. Our research has shown that the
   response of citizens to the Great Recession has been influenced by the
   welfare regime.},

Abstract = {The 2013 Italian parliamentary election was characterized by the
   outstanding performance of the MoVimento Cinque Stelle, which in its
   first participation in a general election obtained a remarkable 25\% of
   the national vote. Where did these votes come from? Furthermore, is it
   possible to observe different electoral dynamics across geographical
   areas of Italy? In order to address these questions, we first estimate
   the flow of votes between the 2008 and 2013 general elections by
   applying an ecological inference method-the Goodman model to the entire
   Italian voting population, and then we take a closer look at the
   differences in the four geopolitical areas in which Italy is
   traditionally divided. We find that the extraordinary performance of the
   MoVimento 5 Stelle was largely due to its capacity of attracting similar
   amounts of former Partito Democratico and Popolo della Liberta
   supporters, as well as a considerable amount of voters from their
   traditional allies: Lega Nord and Italia dei Valori. The MoVimento 5
   Stelle was also able to mobilize previous non-voters. We shed light on
   the territorial features of these dynamics.},

Abstract = {The ongoing surge of right-wing populism and the post-truth environment
   in Europe and the US have cast a global threat to civic space. Recent
   developments in national and international politics render us, citizens
   of the world, incapable of fully enjoying our rights to free assembly,
   protest, travel, or simply to speak out. This narrowing trend revives
   discriminatory debates over refugees, minorities, and racism, and is
   reinforced by populist leaders speaking ``for the people.{''} The danger
   of populism asserts itself in ways ranging from restricting civil
   society through limiting foreign funding for civil society organizations
   to closing space for peaceful assembly. The future is concerning.
   However, it can be saved through sustainable support to civil society
   actors.},

Abstract = {Turkey-EU relations have historical significance in terms of politics,
   societal structures along with the longevity of Turkey's EU accession
   process. The relationship between them should not be seen as one in
   which the EU requires and Turkey fulfills accordingly. A
   multi-dimensional and reciprocal approach is necessary to evaluate the
   flow of relations rather than short-term or daily political ups and
   downs. This paper analyzes the relationship between Turkey and the EU
   under successive AK Party governments in chronological order, along with
   political and social reflections by focusing on the main turning points
   and considering the development of relations in the long-run of
   politics.},

Number = {1},

Abstract = {By using American state-level data from 1999 to 2008, this article
   explores how the recent immigrant influx has influenced public welfare
   spending in the American states. By integrating the race/ethnicity and
   globalization compensation theory, I hypothesize that immigration will
   increase welfare spending in states with a bleak job market and
   exclusive state immigrant welfare policy; in contrast, immigration will
   decrease welfare spending in states with a good job market and inclusive
   state immigrant welfare policy. Empirical tests show evidence for both
   hypotheses, suggesting that the applicability of general political
   science theories depends on a combination of state policy and economic
   contexts.},

Abstract = {The macroeconomic and financial stability orientation of AK Party
   governments, with their emphasis on fiscal discipline and the regulatory
   function of the state in the financial system, has allowed the Turkish
   economy to firmly withstand several internal and external shocks.
   Nevertheless, low economic growth, as well as high inflation, interest,
   and unemployment rates, and an unsustainable current account deficit
   continue to be the main challenges ahead. In the face of these
   challenges, AK Party started to follow a developmentalist discourse.
   Turkey's transition to the status of a developmental state requires a
   comprehensive industrial, technological strategy so that different
   policy areas are in coordination with one another. For this purpose,
   public organizations need to improve their organizational capabilities
   and their communications with the real sector.},

Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Recent years have seen an explosion of popular complaint about the
   British `political class'. Within this narrative, the political class is
   feckless, unrepresentative, immoral and elitist. It rules over `ordinary
   people' from Westminster with no conception of what `real people' think.
   How can one respond to such complaints? It is argued in this article
   that a coherent solution will only be possible when the problem can be
   defined clearly. `Political class' should not be a catch-all description
   for elected politicians. Instead, the political class' narrative should
   be divided into three distinct but related concepts - the political
   elite, political professionalisation and political careerism - in order
   to highlight the ways in which the term needlessly conflates distinct
   ideas and adds more confusion to an already vague debate.},

Abstract = {The work at hand focuses on the reconstruction of student sociabilities
   at the University of Buenos Aires (UBA) between 1917-1921. It aims to
   inquire into the implementation of the University Reform and the effect
   it had on the capital's collegial student body, which concentrated more
   than half of the universitary population in the country. To achieve this
   purpose, the present paper will resort to analyzing publications written
   by left-wing reformists who, by means of their reviews, interpellated
   university youths to reformulate their practices, their ways of
   associating, and to socialize a new student profile.},

Abstract = {Do endorsements from incumbent politicians to co-partisans lead to more
   electoral accountability for the performance of the government? I use a
   randomized experiment embedded in a national survey conducted before the
   2012 Mexican general election to examine the effect of endorsements by
   the outgoing president Felipe Calderon to the Senate candidates of his
   Partido Accion Nacional (PAN). Results show that among PAN identifiers,
   the incumbent vote is more tightly linked to the performance of the
   president when voters are exposed to the endorsement. I improve on the
   current standing of the accountability literature by showing that the
   relationship between an outgoing politician and the candidates of her
   party matters for electoral sanctioning. My findings imply that
   politicians' strategic decisions have an effect on how voters assign
   responsibility: By nominating candidates without close ties to the
   endorser in cases of weak government performance, parties can use
   nominations strategically to diffuse responsibility. (C) 2016 Elsevier

Abstract = {In the last few years policy innovators have implemented a variety of
   new voting reforms aimed at increasing the ways voters can cast their
   ballot and with it voter turnout. While these efforts have largely
   suggested that the net effect of these reforms has been minimal,
   scholars have not analyzed the effectiveness of the use of these methods
   by partisan campaigns to increase targeted turnout or to change the
   methods voters use to cast their ballot. In collaboration with a state
   party organization, I examine the effect of a partisan get-out-the-vote
   effort using an absentee vote-by-mail push. I find that these
   get-out-the-vote efforts to target voters using absentee ballot request
   forms are effective at shifting more voters to vote absentee. However,
   while pushing absentee vote-by-mail balloting may bank votes for a
   campaign before Election Day, the overall effect of partisan campaigns'
   use of absentee ballot efforts to increase turnout appears limited.},

Abstract = {The fight against serious crime, and in particular against organised
   crime and terrorism, is of great importance in order to guarantee
   security, and its efficacy depends very much on the use of modern
   investigation techniques. However, although this general interest
   objective is crucial, it cannot justify the use of any kind of
   investigative measures. In this paper we analyse some of the guarantees
   that should be observed when searching and tapping into computers,
   keeping in mind the unique features that this measure presents in a
   digital world that is interconnected at the world level. The multiple
   functions of computers and the varied information that is usually stored
   in them calls for special constitutional protection.},

Title = {Just Transitions for the Miners: Labor Environmentalism in the Ruhr and
   Appalachian Coalfields},
Journal = {NEW POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {39},
Number = {2},
Pages = {218-240},
Abstract = {As environmental legislation threatens energy-related jobs, unions may
   seek to assure just transitions for their workers. Just transitions are
   programs to guarantee decent, well-paying new jobs or early retirement
   for workers displaced by environmental regulations. Militant unions with
   a tradition of neo-corporatism will be best positioned to demand just
   transitions for their members. This article provides two comparative
   case studies of coal miners' unions in areas where environmental reform
   threatens coal workers' livelihoods. Workers in Germany's IG Bergbau,
   Chemie, Energie/Industrial Guild Mining, Chemical, Energy (IG BCE) have
   applied sustained militancy to force the German government and employers
   to accept increasingly comprehensive and democratic worker input into
   the energy sector's policy-making. Possessing a good deal of control
   over their industry, IG BCE was prepared to demand a just transition for
   their miners by the time the German government began phasing out
   underground mining. The UMWA (United Mine Workers of America) miners
   have a long tradition of militancy and have, at various junctures in
   their history, forced their employers and union bureaucrats to accept
   some degree of industrial democracy. However, the UMWA's corporatism was
   a limited corporatism that was never as democratic as German
   neo-corporatism. The UMWA's commitment to environmentalism increased as
   they won an expanded level of input into the coal industry's
   decision-making. Nevertheless, since the late 1970s the UMWA's militancy
   has waned and they have come to reject just transitions and other
   environmentalist policies.},

Pages = {41-62},
Abstract = {The success of microcredit lending programs depends in part on the
   regulatory framework that policymakers create to support them. A fact
   that many microcredit analyses often ignore or overlook is that this
   framework is shaped by both ideological and partisan political
   considerations of policymakers. In Argentina, the Peronist governments
   of Nestor and Cristina Kirchner launched and supported a state-centered
   microcredit program characterized by strict loan conditions and direct
   state grants for capital and operational costs to existing non-profit
   organizations that were largely supportive of Peronism. Provinces and
   municipalities governed by anti-Peronists refused to participate. As a
   result, the National Microcredit Program has come to mimic past
   patronage based policies to a significant extent, engendering dependency
   on government resources, and thereby threatening its long-term
   viability. This article explores the impact of the left's ideological
   and political project on microcredit policy, implementation, and
   outcomes in Argentina.},

Abstract = {This paper aims at presenting and discussing Roberto Mangabeir a Unger's
   social and political theory as an alternative to the two mainstream
   theories of justice: Rawls' egalitarian liberalism and critical theory,
   represented by authors such as Habermas and Honneth. The text is
   designed in three moments. Firstly, it looks for comparing how each
   theory builds its conception of normativity, the ``ideal{''} or
   ``programmatic{''} character. Then, it situates particularly Unger's
   ``super-liberalism{''}. Finally, it discusses how the different currents
   of normative theory apply themselves to the analysis and proposition of
   institutions.},

Journal = {RESEARCH \& POLITICS},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {4},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN 1},
Abstract = {Kahan and Corbin suggest that the cognitive capabilities that constitute
   actively open-minded thinking (AOT) are used in the defense of favored
   positions, thus leading to polarization concerning global warming. Such
   a conclusion is contrary to the definition of AOT. I suggest, and
   dispute, two ways in which such a result could be consistent with the
   definition: the scale that measures AOT is correlated with other traits
   that do increase polarization; or AOT may itself not be a general trait,
   so that conservatives do not apply it to global warming. A third, more
   plausible, explanation is that part of the main result is based on a
   floor effect, a statistical artifact. It is also possible that the
   effect of AOT is exerted primarily on political identification. The
   substantial correlation between AOT and political liberalism also helps
   us interpret prior conflicting results concerning politics and cognitive
   style, especially in view of the total absence of any correlation
   between politics and the Cognitive Reflection Test in the same data set.},

Abstract = {Marx's Okonomisch-philosophische Manuskripte of 1844 established the
   basis for the Marxist project to overcome capitalism. For this purpose,
   he developed a critique of wage-labor from the dual perspectives of a
   Hegelian dialectic and a Feuerbachian critique of religion. This
   analysis served to establish other concepts such as a materialist
   alterity and the reduction of man to animality, from which one could
   build an alternative Marxism, different from that which was evident in
   Das Kapital.},

Abstract = {One of the thematic areas that privileges current political science in
   Latin America is political leadership, as a relational phenomenon and
   historical force capable of conditioning the functioning of the
   political system in its entirety, for various reasons that are explored
   in this work, where we review some of the different theoretical models
   that explain political leadership in relation to democracy. The
   methodology used is documentary observation within the framework of a
   version of dialectical hermeneutics, interested in deciphering the
   meanings of texts in their contexts. It is concluded that the
   theoretical approaches useful to approach the political leadership,
   configure a varied panorama around a dense and complex phenomenon that
   admits and demands multiple perspectives and perspectives of analysis.
   For this reason, we advocate the gradual structuring of an eclectic or
   integrative approach, capable of articulating, as logically as possible,
   the different ideas, concepts, methodologies and perspectives that arise
   around political leadership and its Differential facets.},

Abstract = {This article studies campaign effects at the 2013 German Federal
   Election. It analyses whether and how the 2013 campaign contributed to
   electors' ability to cast votes in line with their political preferences
   - correct' votes in the terminology of Lau and Redlawsk. The article
   takes a novel perspective at correct voting by analysing its dynamic
   development during the course of an election campaign, using
   observational data collected by means of a rolling cross-section survey.
   It finds that voters' likelihood to choose correctly significantly
   increased during the election campaign. Two campaign-induced processes
   in particular contributed to explaining this development: voters'
   growing involvement with electoral politics and their decreasing
   indifference with regard to the parties competing for their votes. These
   findings suggest that by stimulating citizens to engage more intensively
   with electoral politics campaigns can strengthen the linkage between
   voters' preferences and their actual voting behaviour. Despite much
   criticism of how they are conducted, election campaigns can exert
   normatively desirable effects, thereby improving the quality of
   representative democracy.},

Abstract = {This article explores the works of Cesare Lombroso on the man of genius
   and his relationships with insanity. It highlights these works'
   prominent features such as the medicalized approach, the question of the
   heredity of talents, and the links between abnormality and eccentricity.
   Although for Lombroso music has a special effect on the human psyche, he
   develops few specific ideas on the musician's genius in comparison to
   other artists. Underlining the development of the theme of the man of
   genius in post-unitarian Italy, this article suggests that it becomes a
   genre which combines literary aspirations, common sense, and medical
   considerations. While relying on existing scholarship and on
   interpretations of artists' behavior, Lombroso points out the close
   relationship between the genius's psychology and that of the mentally
   ill. Treating the question of the genius and the neurotic artist,
   Lombroso's research, despite the criticisms it faced, clearly echoed
   preoccupations of great interest today.},

Abstract = {Innovative teachers of political science have frequently moved beyond
   the confines of conventional teaching formats to better engage students
   with the demands of the discipline. In particular, the use of
   simulations has been proposed as an alternative to passive,
   lecture-based techniques, and a growing literature examines their value
   and efficacy. This article contributes to the literature by describing
   the development of a simulation that draws on the principles of
   immersive theater in an attempt to maximize participation while
   encouraging students to think critically about political concepts and

Abstract = {Food production is integrated in the global agri-food chain and is
   characterized for its technological modernization and high productivity.
   The recent implementation of quality standards into the global agri-food
   chain have radically transformed their production processes and working
   conditions. Numerous studies have examined how the implementation of
   quality systems has led to a significant increase in the quality of
   products and of their production processes. However, some studies show
   that the increasing of the quality of products and processes has not
   necessarily led to a substantial improvement in the quality of
   employment nor to a de-casualization of working conditions. On the
   contrary, job insecurity and informal employment persist, and in some
   cases are accentuated by increasing control over processes and workers.
   This paper explores this hypothesis in the case of table grapes industry
   in the Region of Murcia.},

Abstract = {On the occasion of the Federal Election 2009, Germany experienced a
   drastic decline in turnout. In 2013, the most recent Federal Election,
   turnout was thus a political issue hotly debated in the media and the
   Social Democrats ran an explicit non-voter campaign. Nevertheless,
   turnout rates remained at a low level, and the election resulted in the
   second lowest turnout in the entire history of post-war Germany. At the
   same time the SPD, one of the traditionally cleavage-based parties in
   Germany, suffered equally dramatic losses in terms of electoral support
   in 2009 from which it did not recover in the succeeding election. While
   the sudden decline of the vote share of a cleavage-based party may cast
   doubt on previous findings of a relative stability of cleavage voting in
   Germany, the almost parallel decline in turnout points to a blind spot
   in the cleavage voting literature. This research has focused exclusively
   on the role of social cleavages in shaping choices between parties, and
   thus has neglected the possibility that cleavages erode due to a decline
   in electoral mobilisation of cleavage groups. The present article looks
   at the long-term and short-term changes in party choice and turnout in
   the social groups that traditionally formed the constituency of the main
   cleavage parties, the SPD and the CDU/CSU. In doing so, the article also
   examines whether and how these changes in party vote and electoral
   participation are related to cohort and period effects. Empirically, we
   show that a decline in the support for the SPD among the working class
   consists of both long-term and short-term components, but it does not
   lead to vote defection yet mostly to abstention from voting. Further it
   shows that the CDU/CSU is unaffected by the mobilisation problems that
   plague Social Democracy in Germany. However, first long-term effects are
   visible across birth cohorts. Younger core religious groups are
   increasingly opting for other parties.},

Title = {Understanding the 2015 marriage referendum in Ireland: context,

Abstract = {On 22 May 2015 the marriage referendum proposal was passed by a large
   majority of Irish voters and the definition of marriage in the
   constitution was broadened to introduce marriage equality. This
   referendum is remarkable for a number of reasons: (1) it is uniquely
   based on an experiment in deliberative democracy; (2) the referendum
   campaign was unusually vigorous and active; and (3) the voting patterns
   at the referendum point to a significant value shift along the deep
   seated liberal conservative political cleavage of Irish politics. This
   article provides an overview of the background to the referendum
   initiative, the campaign prior to the referendum, and the key factors
   that drove voter turnout and preference. Based on a post-referendum
   survey, we find that while support for the government of the day,
   political knowledge, and social attitudes have the same effects as
   commonly found in other referendums, the variation among social classes
   was less prevalent than usual and door-to-door canvassing by the two
   sides of the campaign impacted through turnout rather than vote
   preference. The voting behaviour of the different age groups suggests
   strong generational effects.},

Abstract = {In this article I analyze acts of citizenship within environmentally
   friendly food initiatives in Iran. I show that act of environmental
   citizenship intersects with politics of pluralizing the public sphere
   within these initiatives. I present original research that shows how
   these practices are determined by state-society relations. It is shown
   that the main objective of most of the initiators of these enterprises
   is to provide a source of information about healthy and environmentally
   friendly food as well as providing access to such food. In contrast,
   many consumers also use these initiatives as spaces where they can
   experience and make a more pluralistic public sphere. This article
   contributes to a better understanding of the concept of environmental
   citizenship and demonstrates the relevance of the concept to broader
   notions of citizenship.},

Title = {Voting in Controversy: A Critical Analysis of the Canadian Arab Youth
   Vote in the 2015 Federal Election},
Journal = {CANADIAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW},

Abstract = {This paper analyzes the Canadian Arab youth votes in the federal
   election of 2015 through the lens of critical race theory and the
   literature on age-ism and Islamophobia. First, we investigate mainstream
   academic theories about ethno-cultural youth political decision-making
   as they pertain to voting, and then investigate how such theories can be
   critically re-evaluated in light of the literature on constraining
   structures. We then examine some of the most provocative elements of the
   2015 election campaign, and analyze how Canadian Arab youth responded,
   why, and how their decisions were informed by and informed the greater
   literature on ethnic minority youth voting. In this process, we ask:
   what concepts might help us better understand this rising demographic,
   its political animus, and its significance for Canadian politics? Of
   great interest in this paper is whether voter apathy historically
   reported for young people and ethno-cultural communities continued to
   hold in the 2015 federal election. We critically interrogate what the
   2015 federal election meant to Canadian Arab youth, and identify the
   predominant political priorities for young Arab Canadians through the
   findings of structured focus groups. Our results indicate that Arab
   Canadian youth were highly engaged with the election which they felt
   largely revolved around stereotypes of Canada's Arab and Muslim
   communities. Due to the perceived efficacy of their vote and an animated
   defiance of imposing structures, apathy among Arab youth was the
   exception rather than the norm.},

Abstract = {The article examines the evolution of the Republican poetic inspiration
   in the second half of the nineteenth century. While in 1848-1849, the
   compositions of the major Republican poets of the Risorgimento (Goffredo
   Mameli, Francesco Dall'Ongaro, Alessandro Poerio, Luigi Mercantini ... )
   are largely influenced by the teachings of Giuseppe Mazzini, in
   1859-1860 the Republican inspiration evolves into Garibaldi's positions,
   celebrating national unity under the rule of the House of Savoy, in the
   name of the primacy of the struggle for independence. After Italian
   Unity, the poetic of anti-monarchism revolt is carried on by Giosue
   Carducci, spokesman of the Italian revolutionary movement in the
   cultural sector with its Jacobin poetry. But the seeking of conciliatory
   solutions between democratic commitment and respect for the ``people{''}
   who chose to be represented by the Monarch pushes the poet to deprive
   himself of the Republican illusion and to celebrate the House of Savoy
   as best guarantor to defend the supreme value of Unity.},

Abstract = {European Parliament (EP) elections have been described as ``midwives to
   new parties{''}, facilitating in many ways the birth of parties that
   fractionalize party systems and have knock-on effects for government
   formation. This chapter proposes a previously unmentioned mechanism that
   would ``pump{''} support from new and previously non-voting individuals
   toward support for parties they would not have supported at a national
   election. The mechanism is hypothesized to operate because of the
   habit-forming process of voting for a party. The chapter establishes
   that this mechanism does operate as hypothesized, though it does not
   account for the largest part of continuing support for eurosceptic
   parties. Ironically this limitation on the pump's productivity is due to

Title = {{[}en] The Development of Critical Management Studies in

Journal = {POLITICA Y SOCIEDAD},

Pages = {45-64},
Abstract = {This article's goal is to examine the development of critical management
   studies in the Spanish-speaking Latin American countries. I examine the
   production of the top five countries in terms of the production of
   scientific articles in business and management. (Mexico, Argentina,
   Chile, Colombia and Venezuela.). The analysis is descriptive and seeks
   to identify the production of both conceptual and empirical knowledge in
   books and articles whose subject is related to the tradition of critical
   management studies. After a review of the relevant literature, it can be
   concluded that there is a certain level of production in the countries
   analyzed. In addition, it can be observed that, in some countries, the
   development of research framed within a critical perspective to
   management and organizations is not only carried out by researchers
   affiliated with business schools or faculties of economic sciences, but
   by those who work in academic units of other social sciences. To
   conclude, the article provides some reflection about the prospects for
   the development of CMS in the region.},

Abstract = {This article examines changing patterns of voting for parties on the
   left in the UK and Europe. It shows that while combined support for
   social-democratic, left and Green parties remains strong, the
   composition of the left's electorate has radically changed.
   Increasingly, left parties rely on a coalition of new middle-class
   voters and traditional and new working-class constituencies. This
   coalition is relatively cohesive on questions of economic
   redistribution, but divided on social and cultural issues. Recent
   instability in Labour's electoral coalition reflects broader structural
   trends facing left parties across Europe.},

Abstract = {Although often unable to satisfactorily solve the problem, democracy
   (especially enduring democracy) is commonly believed to reduce
   corruption. Yet, both Transparency International and the World Bank
   continue to attach a high risk of corruption to Latin American
   countries: corruption and impunity remain prevalent in the area, despite
   consolidating democratic regimes and recent anticorruption reforms.
   Using level of democracy and its endurance, as well as information on
   the perceptions of democratic performance and corruption obtained from
   the Latinobarometro, we analyzed a panel data covering the period
   2005-2010 in 14 Latin American countries. Our main results show that
   levels of democracy and citizens' assessment of government fairness have
   a positive impact on corruption. However, satisfaction towards democracy
   has the opposite effect: when citizens believed democratic governments
   and public administrations to be efficient, they also perceived that
   gains against corruption had significantly decreased.},

Title = {No Way to Escape Imbalances in the Eurozone? Three Sources for Germany's
   Export Dependency: Industrial Relations, Social Insurance and Fiscal
   Federalism},
Journal = {GERMAN POLITICS},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {26},

Pages = {360-379},
Abstract = {Over the last two decades, the German political economy has increasingly
   relied on export specialisation as a strategy for economic recovery.
   This export-led development strategy turned out to be a mixed blessing.
   While, on the one hand, specialisation in high-quality manufactured
   goods has preserved Germany's competitive edge vis-a-vis many other
   industrialised countries, it has, on the other hand, led to an
   increasing dependency on exports as the engine for growth. There has
   been no equally strong evolution of a domestic service economy beyond
   manufacturing-related services. The issue of export dependency becomes
   increasingly important in light of the financial crisis and global
   imbalances, vis-a-vis Greece and the Eurozone but also globally. Weak
   aggregate demand depresses both domestic employment and endangers the
   still fragile construction of the Eurozone. The paper argues that
   Germany finds itself in an export-dependency trap due to imbalances
   between domestic services and export-driven manufacturing. It analyses
   three sources for the over-reliance on export-oriented manufacturing and
   weak employment in domestic services: firstly, the industrial relations
   system, secondly, the social insurance financing of the welfare state
   and thirdly, fiscal federalism. All three are fundamental pillars of the
   German political economy and locked into political coalitions that are
   not easily changed.},

Abstract = {In the Euro debt crisis, it is hardly surprising that reciprocal
   stereotyping is carrying the day in the national media reviving old
   images of the respective `other'. The study asks how covers of German
   news magazines are shaped by the use of national stereotypes and images
   when reporting about this crisis. The paper seeks to build a bridge
   between the seemingly distanced disciplines arts and political science
   by offering a lean framework for analysis. It uses some cover images
   taken from two German weeklies and modifies Panofsky's semiotic model
   revealing traditional stereotypes and images of Greece.},

Abstract = {An important part of Stephen Harper's early strategy to form a majority
   government was to appeal to Quebec voters. Open federalism, the
   recognition of the Quebec nation in the House of Commons, and
   international representation at the UNESCO were all measures aimed at
   increasing support for the Conservatives in the province. This article
   reviews Quebecers' reception to several key policy decisions taken by
   Stephen Harper's government in the 2006-2011 time period. It also
   estimates the impact of these policies on satisfaction towards the
   federal government, appreciation of Stephen Harper, and voting
   intentions towards the Conservatives in Quebec.},

Abstract = {This article analyzes how from 2010 is happening a new cycle of claims
   and conflicts for political rights associated with local democracy
   through the requirement of popular referendums to decide on territorial
   development against the realization of extractive projects in the
   municipalities. We explain the dynamics of collective action, key
   actors, strategies, repertoires and positions regarding expansive or
   restrictive interpretations of political rights, and argue that the
   implementation of Popular Consultations at the municipal level
   represents an expansion of political rights and renewal of the Colombian
   local democracy.},

Abstract = {The article is based on the assumption that the October Revolution had a
   major impact on human history and brought into play relevant motifs,
   which may also influence the future. The author deals with this future
   legacy in three steps. First, the article shows the parallels between
   the soviets (councils) and current participatory systems, which allow
   the implementation of various concepts of economic and political
   democracy. Second, the text analyses several kinds of economic
   democracy. In the third step, the author analyses the heritage to-date
   of socialism. He explains the need to overcome economic, political and
   cultural reductionism, to involve various progressive social groups as
   subjects of social change and to base their emancipation on the
   institutional social justice models that these social groups have
   created at local, national, macro-regional, and global levels. It
   clarifies that the future will indeed be limited by past and future
   conditions but the historical development will hardly copy a linear
   trajectory. The future legacy of the Russian revolution is both
   potential and burden which will influence our activities next decades.},

Abstract = {The goal of this paper is twofold. On the one hand, it seeks to
   evaluate, after two decades since its inception in the UK, the main
   outcomes of the Critical Management Studies (CMS) movement in the field
   of social sciences. CMS represents an alternative to orthodox
   organizational theory taught in business schools: as compared to the
   latter, it aims at introducing students to deeper and more critical
   analyses of organizations, helping them to engage with new theoretical
   grounds in order to change their views on business. Hence, the legacy of
   this school of thought will be discussed, as well as an additional
   reflection on the reorientation of its research agenda in a context of a
   deep economic crisis and changes in university governance. On the other
   hand, the text will also reflect on the impact CMS has had on the
   Spanish academia, discussing the limitations of this project in the
   Spanish organizational and business framework.},

Abstract = {To what extent does the presence of a competitive female legislative
   candidate influence women's political engagement in the context of a
   gender quota regime? Existing work on the effects of increasing
   descriptive representation on women's engagement suggests a positive
   effect, but less attention is paid to how gender quotas may alter the
   relationship. We develop and test two hypotheses, one suggesting female
   candidates positively influence women's engagement, while the other
   suggests female candidates in a gender quota regime may create a
   backlash effect and negatively influence women's engagement. We draw on
   two nationally representative post-election surveys from Mexico and
   original data on the number and competitiveness of female candidates to
   examine the influence of these candidacies on multiple measures of
   political engagement. Overall, our results are more consistent with a
   backlash effect. We find female legislative candidates have little
   positive effect on increasing political engagement among women.},

Abstract = {Deportation and extradition have been one of the long-standing issues in
   international law. After proposing new human rights' issues in the
   development of international law and human role in international
   relations, sometimes the question of deportation and extradition is in
   conflict with European human rights concept. It should distinguish
   between extradition with similar concepts such as delivery, transfer and
   dismissal. The extradition is the process that reflects the country's
   international collaboration and cooperation in the implementation of
   more stringent standards of criminal justice. Its successful
   implementation requires the cooperation of different countries in
   extradition with no political and security excuses. European Court of
   Human Rights as a judicial organ of the European Convention on Human
   Rights has issued sentences in its practice regarding some of these
   conflicts. Researcher with knowledge of neglecting the debate in the
   Iranian legal system, insists to evaluate the performance of the Human
   Rights Committee and the European Court of Human Rights in relation to
   deportation and extradition and procedure that the European Court has
   dealt using analytical methods to review the extradition from different
   angles and it is hoped that open a step for progress in Iran's penal
   policy and the legal in the international arena.},

Title = {Between Milieu and Vacuum Organizational, Programmatic, and Electoral
   Strategies of the Former Party of Democratic Socialism (PDS) and the
   Communist Party of Bohemia and Moravia (KSCM) Reexamined},
Journal = {POLITOLOGICKY CASOPIS-CZECH JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2017},
Number = {3},
Pages = {302-329},
Abstract = {This paper proposes an updated approach to explaining two outcomes
   unforeseen by the existing comparative literature on post-communist
   successor parties: 1) the electoral stabilization (and even growth) and
   2) the divergent developments of the Party of Democratic Socialism (PDS;
   later DIE LINKE) in Germany and the Communist Party of Bohemia and
   Moravia (KSCM). The paper proceeds by integrating a critical
   reexamination of earlier studies' organizational and programmatic
   explanations of electoral success with an analysis of the party-system
   level of government-opposition signaling and positioning vis-a-vis other
   parties, which can be expected to take on heightened importance in
   `third-generation elections.' It is argued that both parties' successes
   were tied to a strategic orientation toward going beyond their
   confinement in a delimited electoral `milieu' and occupying a wider
   electoral `vacuum' to the left of their Social Democratic competitors,
   albeit with early programmatic modernization and delayed organizational
   centralization in the PDS as opposed to a near-total continuity of
   programmatic non-reform and decentralized organization in the KSCM. The
   findings suggest that earlier studies specifically overlook the impact
   of subsequent ('third-generation') iterations of party competition on
   successor-party success as well as the mediation of organizational and
   programmatic factors by the party-system level.},

Abstract = {Amid further political and economic sanctions imposed by the USA and the
   EU on the Russian Federation, Russia is experiencing a gradual pivot
   towards the East; among other states Russia is intensifying its ties
   with Central Asia and China. From this perspective, deepening conflict
   between Russia and the USA might be explained as a clash of their
   political interests. The political environment of the modern system of
   international relations reflects the rise of political disagreements
   between Russia and the USA in the Central Asian republics. To pursue its
   political ends in Central Asia Russia has to promote relations and
   cooperation within the Collective Security Treaty Organization, the
   Eurasian Economic Union and the Shanghai Cooperation Organization.},

Abstract = {Paper aimed to consider of approaches to big data (social network
   content) utilization for understanding of social behavior in the
   conflict zones, and analysis of dynamics of illegal armed groups.
   Analysis directed to identify of underage militants. The probabilistic
   and stochastic methods of analysis and classification of number,
   composition and dynamics of illegal armed groups in active conflict
   areas are proposed. Data of armed conflict - antiterrorist operation in
   Donbas (Eastern Ukraine in the period 2014-2015) is used for analysis.
   The numerical distribution of age, gender composition, origin, social
   status and nationality of child militants among illegal armed groups has
   been calculated. Conclusions on the applicability of described method in
   criminological practice, as well as about the possibilities of
   interpretation of obtaining results in the context of study of terrorism
   are proposed.},

Journal = {POLIS-POLITICHESKIYE ISSLEDOVANIYA},

Number = {6},
Pages = {109-124},
Abstract = {The author considers the influence of the Russian Revolution of 1917 on
   the entire subsequent history of Russia and draws a conclusion that the
   year 1917 was a very special period not only in the history of Russia,
   but also in global political practice. The article proves the existence
   in the Russian history of certain crisis cycles, provoked by the
   revolution. Now Russia is facing broader opportunities to get out of the
   revolutionary crisis cycles. The author believes that in Russia the
   political culture is gradually changing not only in form, but also in
   deeper content. A challenging ascent to the rule of law is a movement
   toward a republican political culture. However, it is necessary for the
   people of power and people of opposition to develop respect for the
   republican values, overcoming the chronic disease of disrespect for
   their own people, which is characteristic for frank supporters of
   authoritarian forms of government suffer, as well as for people who
   consider themselves liberals. Russia is gradually leaving the old
   Russian path of the movement from authoritarian calm to turmoil,
   rebellion, revolution and back to the authoritarian order. However, this
   process of transforming political culture has not yet been completed.
   This will require considerable efforts.},

Title = {POLITICAL BEHAVIOR IN MODERN RUSSIA IN THE LIGHT OF THE RESSENTIMENT
   CONCEPT},
Journal = {POLIS-POLITICHESKIYE ISSLEDOVANIYA},
Year = {2017},
Number = {1},
Pages = {85-98},
Abstract = {The article analyzes the phenomenon of mass political response to the
   Ukrainian crisis and the decline of Russian-American and
   Russian-European relations, as well as promotion of these events in the
   media in 2013-2015. For many researchers it was the case to describe
   different patterns of mass behavior as one of conditions for the modern
   political process. The article discusses the concept of anomie and
   ressentiment, which allows to give a new interpretation of the crisis of
   modern Russian society and to describe this situation as a complex
   phenomenon that is associated with the previous historical development
   by path dependence logic. The article also examines the possibility of
   interpreting the crisis, taking into account its development in the
   framework of the consumerist society. As a result, we can conclude that
   the recent significant changes in Russian mass politics partly
   associated with the development of the politics of nostalgia, which in
   interaction with various practices of ressentiment fit fully into the
   logic of consumerist society and influence to the production of new
   important ideological and cultural goods for mass consumption. We can
   speak about the interesting type of possible political behavior of the
   individual or social group, which combines variety of values connected
   with the ideology of ressentiment, the illusion of participation in
   politics through consumerist consumption of media political product, the
   need for constant design of involvement' s feelings to the existing
   political regime by power and media through the implementation of the
   specific historical policy aimed to work with images of the past and
   their active consumption by the modern Russian society. These political
   orientations hardly fit into the traditional ideological and political
   schemes of the European society of modernity (liberalism, conservatism,
   left ideologies, etc.) and make possible a new approach to estimate as
   the ways of describing of the current political preferences of the
   Russian society as the dynamics of their possible changes in the future.},

Pages = {71-84},
Abstract = {This paper reconstructs Michel Foucault's account of pornography by
   placing it into his theory of power. To explain the novelty of
   Foucault's position, it counterpoises it with anti-pornography feminism
   and its analysis of the modern state. The paper argues that Foucault
   considered pornography to be a strategy of biopower to regulate
   individual sexual conduct. By inciting the discourse on sex, pornography
   participates in the production of truth about sex. Through confession,
   its consumers discover their sexual identities, becoming
   self-regulating. The result is a proliferation of sexualities, but also
   their rigidification and categorisation, leading to a mass deployment of
   perversion.},

Abstract = {The constituency orientation of Irish politicians is a recurring topic
   in Irish political science. Its analysis has predominantly focused on
   TDs. This article uses a content analysis of candidate video statements
   in the 2016 general election in order to assess the strength of
   constituency orientation among Irish politicians. The results show a
   distinct geographical pattern, with a band of strong constituency
   orientation along the West coast extending into a corridor that reaches
   far into the East of the country. Differences between urban and rural
   areas and between centre and periphery shape this pattern, indicated by
   the weak constituency orientation in Dublin and Cork constituencies.
   Results also indicate differences between parties and some political
   statuses, while the gender of the candidates is of no relevance.
   Although the material does not permit a clear distinction between
   effects of political culture and short-term considerations, taken
   together the results indicate that localism in Irish politics matters,
   but in more complicated ways than usually depicted.},

Abstract = {Recent years have witnessed a rise of contentious political activity
   across the world heralding what some perceive as a new major cycle of
   protest. Much attention has focused on Europe, where the economic crisis
   generated considerable social unrest deemed comparable to earlier waves
   of protest. This article seeks to examine the basic constituents of the
   social forces unleashed by this economic crisis and to assess the main
   motivations driving this new cycle of protest. It distinguishes between
   conventional and radical political activity and seeks to identify the
   main correlates of each. The article uses an original telephone survey
   designed, piloted, and conducted in Greece (n = 5025) to construct a
   12-item conventionalism scale and a 10-item radicalism scale. Using
   psychometric techniques, it assesses the effects of various independent
   variables on the two modes of political action. The article finds that,
   even in this economic crisis-hit setting, economic deprivation has a
   minimal effect on the two modes of behavior. Ideology, especially on the
   left of the political spectrum, has the strongest effect on both radical
   and conventional political action. Despite the major changes in the
   political context brought about by the economic crisis, political action
   displays significant continuity with the past.},

Abstract = {Research on Hong Kong lawyers has so far focused on their internal
   differences and the rise of cause lawyering. Not much has been done on
   their role in promoting political liberalism. This paper fills a gap by
   reviewing the history of lawyers' political activism before and after
   Hong Kong's sovereignty shifted from a liberal-colonial to an
   authoritarian regime in 1997. It argues, first, that Hong Kong's
   post-colonial constitutionalized politics and prolonged democratic
   deficit have given the legal complex-which includes lawyers and also
   increasingly legal academics-a key role in its pro-democracy movement,
   and second, critical political junctures have driven activist lawyers to
   use various means, from electoral politics to civil disobedience, to
   defend the rule of law and Hong Kong's tortuous democratization.},

Abstract = {The Chinese people's Perception of the EU can be roughly divided into
   two groups: that of the general public and that of the elite, which has
   been surveyed from three perspectives including their degree of
   favorability towards the EU, their evaluation of the EU's international
   influence and their opinions concerning the status quo and the prospects
   for China-EU relations. Both the elite and the general public view the
   EU relatively optimistically and positively in general terms; however,
   in the last two years the percentage of those being positive has
   increasingly decreased. The elite's perception of the EU is more
   rational than that of the general public. The general public is more
   positive than the elite with regards to the status quo of China-EU
   relations, and vice versa with regards to the degree of favorability
   towards the EU and the future development of the bilateral relations. As
   a conclusion, the Chinese people's perception of the EU has been
   influenced by the general atmosphere of China-EU relations, China's
   strategy towards the EU and the changing mentality of the Chinese people
   in the context of globalization.},

Abstract = {The number of candidates competing in elections may have significant
   political consequences. In Latin America, presidential contests in many
   countries yield a large number of candidates, which contradicts
   theoretical expectations based on the fact that this is effectively a
   single-member competition. I provide an explanation based on
   coordination cost incurred by candidatess in unstable and
   low-programmatic electoral markets. Given this cost, we should expect
   entry decisions to exceed the theoretical upper limit. At the empirical
   level, the explanation is tested using statistical models of
   presidential election data in 18 Latin American countries between 1993
   and 2010. I find evidence in support of the hypothesis that unstable and
   low-programmatic electoral markets are associated with a larger than
   expected number of presidential candidates.},

Title = {Struggles and ambiguities over political subjectivities in the camp:
   Roma camp dwellers between neoliberal and urban citizenship in Italy},
Journal = {CITIZENSHIP STUDIES},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {21},
Number = {6, SI},
Pages = {640-656},
Abstract = {What is the political subjectivity of the Roma living in Italian camps?
   Although the camp prevents the Roma from enjoying a series of rights, it
   does not fully determine their citizenship status. Indeed, citizenship
   is always contested and evolving through the interaction of a plurality
   of actors. By understanding the camp as an assemblage space', this
   article aims to unpack the complex political subjectivities of Roma
   camps-dwellers and to reflect on the struggles and ambiguities
   characterising the citizenship-making process in camp spaces. Through
   in-depth interviews conducted with members of non-governmental
   organisations and social movements in the city of Rome, I investigate
   the contention over meanings produced around the space of the camp and
   the Roma political subjectivities. I finally identify and discuss two

   their demand to housing inclusion: a neoliberal and a right to the city'

Abstract = {The role of the multiparty system in the context of Russian troubles as
   a systemic crisis of the Empire is one of the key issues for
   understanding the mechanisms of destruction of Russian imperial state,
   which happened twice in the last century. The article criticized the
   theoretical positions that: 1) the multiparty system is a universal
   constructive factor of civil society development; 2) the mass position
   towards the parties is determined by comparing the party programs and
   people's interests; 3) the interparty rivalry in Russia is carried out
   in the sphere of rational public policy. These provisions contradicted
   the Russian national practice: 1) the Russian multiparty system became
   one of the factors of the catastrophes, played an important role in the
   sad end of the Russian and Soviet empires; 2) in Russia, people didn't'
   use to read party programs and don't do that now; 3) the real struggle
   of parties and ``historical alternatives{''} takes place in mass
   consciousness, serving as the true dominant of political history of the
   Russian troubles. ``Empire{''} is regarded as a special, adequate for
   mass consciousness form of unity of the power and the masses, and ``the
   Time of Troubles{''}-as a temporary destructurization of the system of
   interaction between authorities and masses of the Empire, caused by the
   threat of interruption of historical continuity imperatives of state and
   civilizational identity. In the article three ``waves{''} of the Russian
   multiparty system are identified and compared: 1) the beginning of the
   XX century; 2) the end of the XX century; 3) the beginning of the XXI
   century. The first and second options of national multiparty system are
   analyzed in the context of their role in the deaths of historical
   empires. The modern stage is interpreted in the context of the opposite
   of historical trends as the least harmful in this situation.},

Abstract = {Bangladesh, third largest Muslim populated country in the world,
   recently faced a frightful and dreadful militant attack. The militant
   movement in the country is the deadliest but not the very first. As a
   liberal Muslim country in the world, the augmentation of Islamic radical
   movement is not desired. But the inequality and the increasedracism that
   spreads into the veins of every part of the society are the main reason
   behind the movement. Political instability, economic discrimination and
   absence of the rule of law are key factors behind the militancy and
   radical movement in the country. The article will analyze the key
   factors behind the Islamic Militant movements in Bangladesh with social,
   economic, current law and order situation, political unrest along with
   social injustice and inequality to name just a few. The way to fight
   against Islamic Militancy must be by Islam, not by permuting it. The
   social justice and economic impartiality has to be ensured to win the
   war against terrorism and also political stability has to be kept for a
   long time.},

Journal = {CRITICAL REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL SOCIAL AND POLITICAL PHILOSOPHY},

Volume = {20},
Number = {6},
Pages = {763-773},
Abstract = {In this response to six critics, I begin by clarifying the sense in
   which my approach to the issue of immigration is `realistic'. I also
   explain why a realistic approach must place immigration in a
   nation-state context, although without treating it as primarily
   reparative for historic injustice. I suggest that it is implausible to
   regard global equality of opportunity, as opposed to global sufficiency,
   as setting limits to national self-determination. I then defend my use
   of the distinction between refugees and economic migrants to frame the
   discussion of immigration against the charge that all migrants are
   potentially vulnerable to the decisions of admitting states, since these
   may determine the fate of their life-projects. And I also defend the
   claim that, in the case of refugees, justice requires only that each
   state should discharge its fair share of the burden of admitting them;
   doing more than this would require popular consent. Finally, I consider
   the case of irregular migrants, and explain in what sense they have
   taken unfair advantage of other potential migrants; I defend offering a
   conditional amnesty to people in this category.},

Abstract = {The Donbas region has disappeared from public view. However, not only
   are skirmishes are a daily occurrence in the transition zone between the
   Ukrainian and separatist controlled areas. Also in the interior of the
   two ``People's Republics{''} a dynamic process is unfolding. While at
   the end of 2014, they were still anarchic, gang-ruled territories,
   today, they have become dictatorships with a high concentration of
   political and economic power. The decisive factor in this state
   building, which is being driven forward with an extreme degree of
   savagery, is Russia. Only those who are in favour with Moscow and who
   receive Russian resources are in a position to eliminate their opponents
   and set themselves at the top of the state structure.},

Pages = {107+},
Abstract = {Georg Leibbrandt belonged to those experts who owed their status
   primarily to their origins. Born an ethnic German in Ukraine, Leibbrandt
   subscribed early on to ethno-nationalist thinking and the struggle
   against the Bolsheviks. After 1933, he pursued a career in the
   National-Socialist regime. He saw it as his task to liberate the peoples
   of the Soviet Union from Bolshevik rule. His plans aimed at the
   dissolution of the Soviet Union. During the war and the occupation, he
   recommended betting on the national Ukrainian cause. With that, he
   failed. He belongs to the National-Socialist functionary elite which
   later succumbed to the illusion that they themselves were victims of the
   regime. This instance of academic knowledge placed at the service of
   National Socialist policies of conquest and annihilation is just one
   example of the tragic bond that science and politics formed during the
   20th century.},

Abstract = {Here we set the scene for the book, questioning the reasons for the
   phenomenal success of eurosceptic parties at the European Parliament
   (EP) elections of 2014 and considering the likely consequences. Above
   all, did these elections represent a new phenomenon, no longer ``second
   order{''} in nature? We define this term and introduce a new
   term-{''}second rate{''}-to describe an aspect of EP elections that
   distinguishes them from other second-order elections with more
   immediately evident policy consequences. The chapter goes on to discuss
   whether the second-order character of these elections might actually
   help to account for their more remarkable features. It also defines and
   introduces additional terms that are used in the book and provides an
   overview of the chapters that follow.},

Abstract = {This article discusses authority culture in Ukraine. `Russian power',
   i.e. a particular configuration of power relationship that has been
   prevailing in the Russian, Soviet and post-Soviet empires, is used as a
   point of reference. Two features of Russian power explain its closeness
   to violence: mostly negative associations (such as force, money and
   corruption) and a high power distance. It is argued that a potential
   movement from violence to power understood as human ability to act in
   concert exists in Ukraine. Members of Ukraine's subelites have a chance
   to become a driving force of this process. Under certain conditions they
   could take a lead in transitioning to less violent models of power in
   politics and elsewhere. The data were drawn from three mass surveys
   conducted in Russia (N = 2939 and N = 11,096) and in Ukraine (N = 2040)
   from July 2016 to January 2017.},

Journal = {LABORATOIRE ITALIEN-POLITIQUE ET SOCIETE},
Year = {2017},
Number = {19},
Abstract = {The failure of 1848 insurrection led to reflect on the nature of the
   historical process. The words of Republican political vocabulary were
   interrogated and questioned. Carlo Pisacane provided an initial
   interpretation of the facts. Illustrating the ways of the revolt, he
   examined the conditions of Sicily, the weakest region in Italy. The
   crisis that characterized Sicily could lead to revolutionary renewal or
   could produce the triumph of the worst behaviors. Forty years after
   Pisacane, Verga presented in Mastro-don Gesualdo the victory of
   selfishness and self-interest. The whole history of modernity took place
   under the sign of these negative passions, which generated conflicts
   between individuals. The words of the Republican culture of the
   Risorgimento were used only as a screen. They hid the attachment to
   wealth and protected the political power of the new rich. De Roberto and
   Pirandello moved on the same path indicated by Verga. The split between
   the misleading words and the true interests were explicit and even
   theorized. There was nothing left of the dream of the Risorgimento,
   except a vague and sterile memory.},

Abstract = {A close reading of Capitalism, Socialism and Democracy underscores
   Schumpeter's critique of elite political capacities. Given the neglect
   of this critique in contemporary scholarship, it might warrant a
   revision of our understanding of Schumpeterianism. To notice the
   critique of elites, we need to read Part IV in the context of the work
   as a whole, and with greater sensitivity to the sarcasm, irony, and
   humor that permeate the book. Such a reading produces a fundamentally
   altered understanding of Schumpeter's contribution to democratic theory.},

Abstract = {Researchers in many fields have needed to develop a measure of
   infrastructure, and many proxies have been used toward this end, such as
   night light data and the Digital Chart of the World. Yet there are
   issues in using these methods. This paper presents a new way of proxying
   infrastructure: analysing the file sizes of map images on the Bing,
   Google, OpenStreetMap and Sina websites. The paper also demonstrates
   four ways in which this can be achieved. This approach is by no means
   perfect and does not solve all of the difficulties presented by other
   methods. Nevertheless, it does provide a simple and functional
   alternative proxy for level of infrastructure development.},

Abstract = {For present-day indigenous populations in Chile, the recovery of
   ancestral lands, the strengthening of indigenous culture and the
   rediscovery of traditional knowledge are priority matters. This is
   certainly the case for the Mapuche communities of the Panguipulli
   municipality, located in the Los Rios Region. In the indigenous imagery,
   community tourism has become a powerful instrument for the presentation
   of demands before the hegemonic national society. An emergent strategy,
   community tourism brings together the possibility to organize resistance
   against domination practices, reengage indigenous cultural practices and
   generate economic opportunities. This paper adopts a qualitative
   methodological approach, but uses quantitative methods and techniques as
   well. The imagery and experiences of indigenous communities are explored
   in order to unearth the elements that contribute to the construction of
   a tourism development pattern suitable for conflict territories where
   the effects of globalization become visible by the day.},

Abstract = {In the Council of the European Union (EU), a qualified majority is
   mostly required to adopt legislative acts. Based on this majority rule,
   individual member states can be outvoted and are subsequently obliged to
   implement the law. This article analyses whether opposition in the
   Council of the EU affects the transposition of directives into national
   law by using the example of Austria from 2000 to 2008. The results
   demonstrate that domestic factors, rather than a negative political
   attitude, were responsible for delays and procedures when implementing
   previously contested directives. However, the effects of opposition in
   the Council on implementation were particularly apparent in cases where
   there was a high degree of misfit between EU provisions and the domestic
   legal structure.},

Abstract = {Since 2015, the European Union (EU) has faced a serious problem
   regarding the management, reception and integration of refugees, of a
   magnitude unprecedented since the end of the Second World War. The
   migratory wave has tested EU policies on border control, asylum and
   immigration, highlighting their shortcomings and limitations. Hence, the
   Union is faced with the need to strengthen these policies, in order to
   respond effectively to this challenge. Such a response must be based on
   the values and principles on which the EU is founded. Only moving
   towards an authentic federalization of these policies will be sufficient
   to confront this irrepressible expression of globalization.},

Abstract = {The main purpose of this paper is to present an analytical approach of
   the self-proclaimed ``new socialism of the XXI Century{''} in the
   context of the transformations undertaken by the so-called ``Bolivarian
   revolution{''} and its implementation in Venezuela, Argentina, Ecuador
   and Bolivia. This model of the state is based on a revolutionary
   socialism that is based on an authoritarian regime, a strongman and
   populist. The reforms undertaken by taking as a reference the ideology
   of XXI century socialism in these countries were characterized by an
   intensification of the process of transformation of the state structure
   and the relations between the state and society, continuing with the
   nationalization of sectors of the economy, the recentring of the
   political apparatus of State administration and the sustained loss of
   autonomy of public powers in favor of the Government of the day.
   However, in the last four years in some countries where it has been
   implemented the socialism of the XXI Century, the civilian population
   has been demonstrating against this type of regime due to the rampant
   corruption, the deplorable implementation of public policies and for the
   constant violations of fundamental rights.},

Abstract = {Estonia has been electing its political representatives online since
   2005, and is therefore on the forefront of a digital revolution. The
   interesting question arises how other European countries have developed.
   More specifically, whether the way has been paved properly elsewhere,
   and whether their efforts hold promise for the future. The country
   selection for this study was done mainly on the basis of where data is
   available, which is to some degree analysable. Therefore, the study
   should primarily be seen as exploratory. In Europe, Switzerland seems to
   be the closest pursuer of Estonia on this field. Here one can expect to
   see the nationwide implementation of online elections in the near
   future. In Germany and Austria the efforts are also ambitious, but the
   concepts still less developed, and at this stage not implementable, for
   a number of reasons. In these countries the challenge is not to fall
   further behind, and to accelerate the respective efforts.},

Abstract = {This article examines how and why four Arab states, Morocco, Jordan,
   Tunisia, and Egypt, have increased official Islam (OI) to counter the
   new challenges in the regional environment following the Arab uprisings.
   It argues that regimes responded to the initial rise of popular Islam as
   well as the threat from extremist groups by enhancing their support for
   official Islam. In an effort to control the religious space and
   legitimize their rule, these regimes have allocated financial resources,
   political capital, and institutional power to elements of official
   Islam. Furthermore, these regimes' survival strategies vary according to
   the regime type and the presence or absence of inherited religious
   institutions. For example, we find that Tunisia turned to foreign
   training of their imams and greater cooperation with religious leaders
   in other countries. By contrast, Egypt, under President Abdel Fattah
   al-Sisi, further coopted al-Azhar and OI by setting the agenda for how
   religion institutions should engage society. Meanwhile, Jordan continued
   its long-standing development of OI while Morocco further expanded and
   internationalized OI. These similar goals but distinct approaches
   demonstrate the importance of the understanding the context in which
   these specific policies are developed.},

Abstract = {The Stalin era is very much present in Russia today, albeit for the most
   part in an idealised form. When it is equated with the war, Stalin
   stands for victory; when the Great Terror is recalled, the victims are
   front and centre. The crimes and the perpetrators are not part of the
   discussion. This has as much to do with the lack of a legal basis for
   prosecution as with the fact that differentiating between perpetrator
   and victim is often difficult. In addition, official history policy
   marginalises and trivialises terror as a feature of Stalinism.},

Abstract = {Vote buying is widespread in developing democracies despite the secret
   ballot. What explains its resilience? I argue that brokers condition
   future payments on published electoral results to enforce these
   transactions and that this is effective at inducing voters' compliance
   only when the results of small voting groups are available. Using
   monitors' and citizens' reports of electoral manipulation and survey
   data from Colombia, I find a robust negative correlation between the
   average polling station size and various measures of vote buying.
   Evidence from a variety of identification strategies suggests that this
   relationship can be attributed to aggregate monitoring sustaining these
   transactions and not to the brokers' increased ability to identify
   compliers or other characteristics of places where polling stations are
   small.},

Abstract = {Historical evidence shows that Latin America has always suffered from
   economic and political inequality where the role of commercial unions is
   fundamental in order to eliminate such barriers. In this sense, the
   Pacific Alliance has emerged as an agreement to balance the existing
   differences between its member-countries and to achieve regional
   economic development. Evidently this cannot be achieved without
   considering the political situation of each one of its members and how
   national policies should be enforced besides consolidating the
   democratic institutions by stimulating the political participation of
   citizens and generating the appropriate mechanisms given that democracy
   leads to prosperity. The objective of this article is to highlight the
   theoretical elements that are needed for the motivation of citizen's
   political participation in order to seek a healthy democracy for the
   development and growth of regional economies. This objective is achieved
   by analyzing the regulatory frameworks of each of the Pacific Alliance's
   member-countries and the role of political advertising as a
   dissemination tool for the construction of democracy.},

Abstract = {Whereas optimists argue that military conflict in the Taiwan Strait has
   become increasingly unlikely, pessimists warn that conflict remains a
   real option. The landslide victory for the pro-independence Democratic
   Progressive Party (DPP) of President Tsai Ing-wen in the January 2016
   presidential and legislative elections adds fire to the debate. The DPP
   win makes a peaceful unification on China's terms an ever-distant
   prospect. Since the election, Beijing's strategy has rested on
   pressuring Taipei into accepting the 1992 consensus as the precondition
   for constructive relations. However, this article argues that strategies
   of coercion are a double-edged sword for China: its very success in
   deterring Taiwan from declaring formal independence has backfired as far
   as compelling the island from accepting unification on its terms. While
   pessimism about a new period of cross-Strait tensions is premature, the
   Taiwan Strait remains a volatile regional flash point in East Asia.},

Abstract = {Why are judicial nominees allowed to refuse to answer questions about
   important issues that could come before the courts? We address this
   question by examining the information environment surrounding judicial
   nominations. Using the Supreme Court as our example, we formulate a
   model that departs from the existing literature by incorporating the
   fact that the Senate often does not know what type of candidate the
   President is trying to appoint. Our model shows when the President and
   Senate are ideologically divergent, low information about nominees'
   views results in the Senate occasionally rejecting acceptable nominees.
   However, when the President and Senate are ideologically close, the
   President benefits from leaving the process opaquethat is, allowing his
   nominees to avoid answering tough questions. Thus, even though low
   information can be costly to both parties, keeping the process
   nontransparent shields the President from being penalized for selecting
   more like-minded (and possibly extreme) judges.},

Journal = {RETHINKING MARXISM-A JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS CULTURE \& SOCIETY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {29},
Number = {4},
Pages = {592-609},
Abstract = {This essay explores the value form of branding as it can be understood
   through an interpretation of Marx's value theory in the tradition of
   Resnick and Wolff. It argues that a brand is best understood as a
   fictitious value form-a construct that allows expected future revenues
   to circulate as current values. In combination, consumers' communicative
   work about a brand and their payment of a price premium at the cash
   register make the brand intellectual property with a positive money
   equivalent. The brand's value form bears no necessary relationship to
   the paid advertising, marketing labor, and unpaid communicative work of
   consumers that went into its creation but is rather found to be in
   proportion to the expected future payments of the price premium. The
   brand's money equivalent can now potentially be realized, but no
   productive labor has yet been performed and no labor value has been
   realized, making the brand a fictitious value form.},

Abstract = {This study examines whether broadcast news reduces negativity toward
   political leaders by exposing partisans to opposing viewpoints. For
   analysis, both exposure to broadcast news and variation in media content
   are used to predict changes in feelings toward the candidates during the
   2008 presidential election. The results suggest that increased exposure
   to broadcast news increased partisans' favorability toward the out-party
   candidate. In addition, increased coverage of the candidates was
   followed by increased favorability among members of the opposing party.
   These results demonstrate the benefits of exposure to two-sided
   communications flows for the reduction of animosity between the
   political parties. Moreover, these results suggest that public
   negativity toward political leaders might be even worse if not for the
   large amount of overlap between the audiences for partisan and
   mainstream news outlets.},

Abstract = {Political party leaders are among the most influential actors in
   parliamentary democracies, and a change in party leadership is an
   important event for a party organization. Yet, we do not know how these
   leadership changes affect voter perceptions about party policy
   positions. On the one hand, we may expect party leadership changes to
   renew attention to the party, educate voters about its policy positions,
   and hence reduce disagreement among voters about party positions. On the
   other hand, rival parties may use a leadership change as an opportunity
   to defame the party, its leadership, and policies, and hence, increase
   voter confusion about the party's policies. Using data from seven
   Western European democracies, I show that leadership changes help
   parties reduce voter disagreement about party policy positions. This
   effect is stronger if the new leader shifts the party's policy
   positions.},

Abstract = {The United Nations use Security Council resolutions to attribute
   responsibility for issues of world politics either to itself or to other
   actors. In this article, we analyze the development of responsibility
   attribution over time. We evaluate whether the end of the Cold War and
   initiatives such as the Agenda for Peace and the Responsibility to
   Protect (R2P) influenced the prevalence of responsibility attribution in
   Security Council resolutions. The analysis is based on a dataset
   covering all resolutions published between 1946 and 2015. Using methods
   of quantitative text and time series analysis we document an increase of
   responsibility attributions through resolutions over time. However, this
   increase is not clearly attributable to initiatives such as the Agenda
   and the R2P.},

Abstract = {As China becomes a more prominent international player, the Chinese
   Communist Party (CCP) has stepped up its external propaganda in a bid to
   promote its image as a superpower. The operations of the CCP's external
   propaganda system are no longer guided by dogma; rather, these
   incorporate many Western theories related to public diplomacy, which
   emphasizes the role played by non-governmental actors and the use of a
   softer approach. However, the CCP's understanding of the concept of
   public diplomacy is influenced by the people's diplomacy of the Cold War
   period. This means that it continues to base its external propaganda on
   the idea of a struggle against enemies, attempting to establish an
   international united front with a view to boosting the CCP's right of
   discourse in the international arena and weakening anti-China forces in
   the West.},

Pages = {175-185},
Abstract = {The recently published collection of papers by Aleksei Demosfenovich
   Bogaturov is an excellent opportunity to reflect on his contribution to
   the theory of international relations and its future in Russia.
   Bogaturov introduced, polished, and popularized a number of important
   ideas and concepts such as the ``paradigm of adjustment,{''} the
   ``pluralistic unipolarity,{''} the ``enclave-conglomerate{''} structure
   of the world, the ``strategy of grindering{''} of in world politics, and
   others. Russian IR scholars know and exploit these concepts in
   theoretical and applied research. There have been three influential
   traditions or ways thinking about the world in Russian science of
   international relations. Their representative value experiences of the
   West (Westernizers), independent statehood (Statists), and distinct
   system of cultural values (Third Rome), respectively. Each tradition of
   school of thought possesses its own images of Russia and international
   system that, historical changes notwithstanding, has preserved its
   internal coherence, continuity, and difference from other schools.
   Unlike Western realists, who assumed the centrality of the West in the
   international system, Russian enlightened statists take Russia's
   internal development seriously. They seek to combine the ideals of
   strong, independent state with those of human rights learning from
   others. In the post-Soviet period of Russian international relations
   theory (RIRT) the school of Enlightened Statism was best represented by
   the work of A. Bogaturov and his students. Following M. Khrustalev,
   Bogaturov sees the main tasks of RIRT in synthesizing theory and applied
   analysis of international relations. In terms of applied analysis, the
   main challenge for RIRT after the Soviet dissolution has been to
   understand the new system of international relations and Russia's role
   in it. In this respect, it is important to study political, military,
   normative-institutional, as well as geo-economic dimensions of the
   problem. The important theoretical conclusion is the need to develop
   Russian school of international relations while preserving flexibility
   and active dialogue with the West. Russia's academic experience teaches
   us to not be limited to schools and paradigms, but instead develop
   approaches and concepts grounded in empirical realities. This is hard to
   follow model that should serve as an important goal in further RIRT
   development.},

Title = {Interpretation, judgement and dialogue: a hermeneutical recollection of
   causal analysis in critical terrorism studies},
Journal = {CRITICAL STUDIES ON TERRORISM},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {10},
Number = {2, SI},
Pages = {220-239},
Abstract = {This article problematises Critical Terrorism Studies's (CTS) seeming
   reluctance to engage in causal explanation. An analysis of the
   meta-theoretical assumptions on causation in both orthodox and critical
   terrorism studies reveals that the latter's refusal to incorporate
   causal analysis in its broader research agenda reproduces - despite its
   commitment to epistemological pluralism - the former's understanding of
   causation as the only sustainable one. Elemental to this understanding
   is the idea that causation refers to the regular observation of constant
   conjunction. Due to the positivist leanings of such a conception, CTS is
   quick to dismiss it as consolidating Orthodox Terrorism Studies's lack
   of critical self-reflexivity, responsibility of the researcher, and
   dedication towards informing state-led policies of counterterrorism.
   Drawing on recent work in the philosophy of science and International
   Relations, this article advances an alternative understanding of
   causation that emphasises its interpretative, normative and dialogical
   fabric. It is therefore argued that CTS should reclaim causal analysis
   as an essential element of its research agenda. This not only
   facilitates a more robust challenge against Orthodox Terrorism Studies'
   conventional understanding of causation but also consolidates CTS's
   endeavour of deepening and broadening our understanding that (re) embeds
   terrorist violence in its historical and social context.},

Abstract = {The official idiom of Soviet power, referred to here as ``newspeak{''},
   was by no means a random cluster of heterogeneous stylistic features,
   but a uniform whole that was systematically and thoroughly organised to
   create higher-level, semantic polarisation. As with all propaganda, the
   central axis emerged from the separation of the familiar and the
   foreign, or the ``good guys{''} from the ``bad guys{''}. At the same
   time, however, the means used to do so covered large areas of what had
   originally been value-neutral lexis, starting with pronouns such as all
   or every, as opposed to several or some, adverbs such as always as
   opposed to sometimes, modal expressions such as must or necessary as
   opposed to can or possible. In so doing, they had a profound effect on
   sentence semantics and syntax.},

   British Labour Party because, apart from the commitment to equality,
   there was not much about Socialism that was important to him. His
   economics were rudimentary, and he had little patience for the

   work in India clearly set him on his political path. But his opposition
   to imperialism in principle did not blind him to the pragmatic benefits
   that the system could bring, or even to the dedication of some its
   practitioners on the ground. Describing himself as a ``Tory
   Anarchist,{''} to the editor of the Adelphi magazine was not the same as
   being a conservative: Samuel Johnson, William Cobbett, Dean Swift, and
   others provided a respectable pedigree for writers who happily called
   themselves Tories while defending what they saw, or at least presented,
   as ancient liberties against contemporary encroachments. It gave them,

Abstract = {Thessaloniki, the second largest city in Greece, has seen a sudden
   attempt to establish LGBT politics during the last 5 years, due to
   movement mobilization and favourable local and European opportunity
   structures. The article suggests a multiscalar analysis of Thessaloniki
   Prides, which takes into account politics articulated by a series of
   actors located in distinct scales. These actors include institutional
   and religious authorities, as well as the local LGBT movement. The
   analysis demonstrates that Thessaloniki Prides are shaped by conflicting
   discursive blocks articulated through the national, urban/local, and
   transnational scale. Prides, as the most visible outcome of the local
   LGBT movement, become a collective action, which is shaped and
   continuously challenged by its embeddedness in these scales. This
   analysis brings new insights into the geo-temporal politics of LGBT
   politics, reminding that European periphery's sexual politics are
   located in a nexus of progressive cosmopolitanism and nationalist
   anti-modernity. In fact, the Thessaloniki case demonstrates that being
   part of the Western periphery places sexual politics between a globalist
   EU-ized discourse of modernity on the one hand and anti-secular views on
   heteronormative traditions on the other. Such a space is the setting
   where grassroots LGBTQ movements perform their politics.},

Abstract = {Since the Islamic State (IS) has secured control of large parts of the
   Iraqi and Syrian territory, scientists and pundits have discussed its
   raise and character. This article asks how the regime of the IS in Iraq
   and Syria can be typologically categorized. Is IS an organization? Is
   the IS regime a state? And is the IS regime a totalitarian dictatorship?
   In answering these questions the article considers the current state of
   knowledge about the IS's organization, ideology, and regime. In doing so
   it becomes evident that IS is a ``bureaucratic organization{''} which
   was quite successful in establishing a state-like political system, and
   that displayed the characteristics of ideo-cratic and totalitarian
   dictatorship, both in its ideological claim and - albeit to a lesser
   extent - the actual empirical patterns of its governance. The article
   concludes with consideration of possible dilemmas of IS and scenarios of
   its future development, both as a state in Iraq and Syria and as an
   organization.},

Abstract = {Party polarization is perhaps the most significant political trend of
   the past several decades of American politics. Many observers have
   pinned hopes on institutional reforms to reinvigorate the political
   center. The Top Two primary is one of the most interesting and
   closely-watched of these reforms: a radically open primary system that
   removes much of the formal role for parties in the primary election and
   even allows for two candidates of the same party to face each other in
   the fall. Here we leverage the adoption of the Top Two in California and
   Washington to explore the reform's effects on legislator behavior. We
   find an inconsistent effect since the reform was adopted in these two
   states. The evidence for post-reform moderation is stronger in
   California than in Washington, but some of this stronger effect appears
   to stem from a contemporaneous policy changedistrict lines drawn by an
   independent redistricting commissionwhile still more might have emerged
   from a change in term limits that was also adopted at the same time. The
   results validate some claims made by reformers, but question others, and
   their magnitude casts some doubt on the potential for institutions to
   reverse the polarization trend.},

Volume = {70},

Abstract = {In Anarchist Women and the Politics of Walking, Kathy Ferguson
   identifies rich and unexpected connections between anarchist feminists,
   walking, and Whitehead's process philosophy. In attuning readers to
   resonances between the physiological and sensory complexity of walking,
   and the latter's role in the lives of anarchist feminists Alexandra
   David-Neel and Lily Gair Wilkinson (and Ferguson's own), her essay sheds
   crucial light on the concept of process for political thinking and what
   the everyday process of walking might mean for political praxis. At the
   same time, I argue that the anarchist feminist walking praxes of
   David-Neel and Gair Wilkinson depend in some degree on disavowed white
   supremacist frames of reference. Moreover, Ferguson's circumscription of
   the politics of walking to exclude situations of coercion and
   vulnerability correspondingly raises the question of what and for whom
   the politics of walking is for. I suggest that a radical politics of
   walking must not only open its horizons to nonvoluntary, threatened, and
   resistive perambulatory modes and the histories that they carry, but
   avow these feminist anarchist ancestors' disavowals along with their
   achievements as part of a living radical lineage.},

   of Comparative Governance and Politics and describes the development of
   Comparative Politics in Germany between 2007 and 2017. Thereby it
   concentrates on two aspects: First, it discusses the institutional
   development of the discipline in Germany, especially the development of
   female scientists in case of professorships and the mid-level faculty.
   Second, we analyse the productivity of comparativists in three german
   political science journals: The Politische Vierteljahresschrift (PVS),

Abstract = {This paper analyzes the political and theoretical limits of the logic of
   hegemony in relation to the categories of community, state, and
   mobilization. To this end, this article focuses on the nexus between two
   radical thinkers of contemporary Latin America; mainly, the current
   vice-president of Bolivia Alvaro Garcia Linera and the theorist of
   social movements Raquel Gutierrez Aguilar. Furthermore, this paper
   analyzes the notion of movement as a logic that grounds the political,
   which allows for an ambivalent articulation between politization and the
   impolitical, state and community. The essay also invites to consider a
   posthegemonic reflection that can interrupt the privilege of the
   political as the ultimate horizon of thinking in the present.},

   politics by delineating the workings of Vanniyar organizations such as
   the caste associations and the political party in the post-1980s period
   in Tamil Nadu. Even though scholarship on caste and politics is
   concerned with the relationship between caste associations and political
   parties, the interface and networking between and among these
   organizations, particularly of a political party that has emerged out of
   the caste movement, need much more attention. This article, therefore,
   maps the interrelations between the caste associations and the political
   party within the Vanniyars' politics by outlining the specific issues on
   which these Vanniyar organizations work.},

Volume = {56},

Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {The systemic turn in deliberative democratic theory presents empirical
   researchers in this field with a problem. Deliberative systems are
   complex, porous and shifting in nature. These features cannot be
   adequately assessed by existing tools for measuring deliberative and
   democratic qualities. Such qualities only become apparent when set
   against practices in other systems. Meaningful analysis rests on
   comparison. However, in turning to the comparative politics literature
   for inspiration, we caution that the two dominant traditions in this
   subfield - rigidly systematic comparison or thickly descriptive area
   studies - are of only limited utility. On the one hand, rigid
   comparative analysis will map uncomfortably on the systemic account. On
   the other, there is a need to move beyond idiographic accounts produced
   in thick descriptions. Instead, this article emphasises the value of two
   alternative traditions in comparative political analysis. The first is
   through the use of family resemblances' in comparative research design.
   The second is through post hoc comparisons that draw together eclectic
   affinities between systems. Both approaches are sensitive to the
   contextual complexities of deliberative systems in practice. Both can
   tell us a great deal about why and how deliberative practices and
   institutions emerge, flourish or fail, and how they enable, enhance or
   undermine the democratic and deliberative qualities of the system
   overall. This article draws on promising examples of these two
   approaches to emphasise their value in understanding deliberative
   systems in practice.},

Abstract = {Transfer and redistribution of wealth accompany most violent conflicts
   throughout the world, yet the local-level political and economic effects
   of this phenomenon remain unexplored. We address this omission by
   examining the long-term impact on the surrounding communities of the
   Nazi death camp Treblinka in Poland, where nearly a million Jews were
   murdered. The assets of murdered Jews sometimes ended up in the hands of
   the local population. We are able to identify the enduring impact of
   these property transfers on local economic and political outcomes
   because the exact location of Treblinka was exogenous to the
   characteristics of surrounding communities. We find that communities
   located closer to the camp experienced a real estate boom but do not
   exhibit higher levels of economic and social development. These
   communities also showed higher support for an anti-Semitic party, the
   League of Polish Families. Our findings speak to an important but
   overlooked challenge to post-conflict reconstruction and reconciliation.},

Abstract = {Political parties are in a unique situation, being able to change
   electoral rules and regulations to minimise any potential negative
   effects on their electoral prospects. Attempts to influence regulators,
   however, can be complex and include voicing concerns, public pressure
   and the regulatory capture of electoral regulators. Little is known
   about this relationship between parties and their regulators. This
   article focuses on this crucial electoral relationship through a study
   of political parties' relations with the UK Electoral Commission. The
   first section addresses the background to the legal regulation of
   political parties. The second section proposes a framework through which
   parties' reactions to regulation may be understood. The third part
   introduces the British case, providing evidence to demonstrate the broad
   utility of the framework. The final section analyses the issues that
   parties have raised with their regulators.},

Abstract = {This article examines the attitudes of national political elites towards
   the EU and the recent politicisation of Europe in the Italian party
   system. Italian political elites have experienced some important
   transformations in the recent past as a consequence of the emergence of
   new parties, the re-alignment of other established parties and some
   structural transformations in their socio-demographic traits. This
   article shows that positive feelings towards the EU have survived the
   acute change to the composition of the political elites, and that
   support for Europe is still widespread. Variations are mainly
   differences in degree of support. Although opposition to the EU has
   emerged, this has not occurred in a linear way and remains dispersed,
   while a Eurosceptic camp able to challenge the mainstream pro-European
   conduct of the Italian elites is far from being in place.},

Abstract = {Several studies have demonstrated a gap in support for the political
   system between electoral winners and losers. This research has generated
   a large stock of knowledge about the causes and effects of this
   winner-loser gap. However, we know little about the dynamics of the
   winner-loser gap over time. Drawing on a unique Swedish panel survey,
   this study investigates the stability of the winner-loser gap among
   Swedish voters over an electoral cycle of four years. The empirical
   analyses demonstrate a substantial consistency of the gap over time also
   when controlling for other determinants. The winner-loser gap thus seems
   to be a stable phenomenon rather than a short-lived election effect. The
   results are robust to different specifications and statistical
   techniques.},

Title = {The structure of foreign policy attitudes in transatlantic perspective:

Abstract = {While public opinion about foreign policy has been studied extensively
   in the United States, there is less systematic research of foreign
   policy opinions in other countries. Given that public opinion about
   international affairs affects who gets elected in democracies and then
   constrains the foreign policies available to leaders once elected, both
   comparative politics and international relations scholarship benefit
   from more systematic investigation of foreign policy attitudes outside
   the United States. Using new data, this article presents a common set of
   core constructs structuring both American and European attitudes about
   foreign policy. Surveys conducted in four countries (the United States,
   the United Kingdom, France and Germany) provide an expanded set of
   foreign policy-related survey items that are analysed using exploratory
   structural equation modeling (ESEM). Measurement equivalence is
   specifically tested and a common four-factor structure that fits the
   data in all four countries is found. Consequently, valid, direct
   comparisons of the foreign policy preferences of four world powers are
   made. In the process, the four-factor model confirms and expands
   previous work on the structure of foreign policy attitudes. The article
   also demonstrates the capability of ESEM in testing the dimensionality
   and cross-national equivalence of social science concepts.},

   supporting this research are available from the UK Data Archive (Study
   Number 851142): http://dx.doi.org/10.5255/UKDA-SN-851142/. The use of
   non-probability samples obtained by such matching methods is a topic of
   considerable discussion in the survey methodology literature. Some
   research focusing on the American context finds differences in estimates
   from probability and non-probability samples (e.g., Malhotra \& Krosnick
   2006), while other research finds few differences in the estimates
   obtained from matched sampling methods (such as those used by YouGov)
   and probability-based samples (Ansolabehere \& Schaffner 2014). Research
   comparing survey modes focusing on the British context has found that
   differences are relatively small, and that substantive conclusions do
   not differ (Sanders et al. 2007). Additionally, an important criterion
   in the choice of sampling method is fit for purpose (Baker et al. 2013).
   Given that our focus is on discovering the underlying factor structure
   (as a type of correlational structure) in our survey data and not on
   specifying sample point estimates for individual survey items, we hold
   that there is a fit between our research aims and the use of matched
   samples.},

Abstract = {The Brexit referendum in 2016 was a major turning-point in British and
   Scottish politics, reflected in a majority for Leave in England, but for
   Remain in Scotland. This article uses the British and Scottish Social
   Surveys for 2016 to explain Scottish-English differences, and finds that
   there were broad similarities in terms of social and demographic
   characteristics, and in terms of social values ('authoritarians' voting
   for Leave). Being `English', however, was much more significant than
   being `Scottish' in accounting for Brexit vote. The association between
   Brexit vote and constitutional preferences, notably voting intention in
   a future Scottish Independence Referendum, is far less clear-cut. Brexit
   promises to be a political game-changer, but in ways which are complex
   and unpredictable.},

Abstract = {In many systems, legislators find themselves accountable to multiple
   principals. This article seeks to further answer how legislators decide
   between their principals and what factors condition legislators to
   choose one over the other. We argue that electoral uncertainty,
   operationalized as electoral volatility, pushes legislators towards the
   principal that has the greatest influence over their re-election. Using
   European Parliament electoral results and roll-call data from the second
   to the sixth European Parliaments (1984-2009), we show that increases in
   electoral volatility decreased European group cohesion and pushed
   legislators to side more with the positions of their national parties
   over their European group when the two disagreed.},

Abstract = {This article maps debates within poststructuralism, particularly
   poststructuralist political theory. I argue that the category, or
   question, of representation can make sense of theoretical and political
   debates within poststructuralism in general and poststructuralist
   political theory in particular. Poststructuralists criticise all forms
   of presence, whether the presence of the subject, identities or
   structures. Following poststructuralism, representation can no longer be
   seen as the reflection of a presence. However, while poststructuralists
   agree on the turn away from presence, they disagree where to turn and,
   specifically, on the role and nature of representation. They disagree
   whether representation is constitutive, and they disagree about how to
   relate to the hierarchy and violence which, they all agree, is a part of
   representation. The question of representation may not explain all
   divisions among poststructuralists, but the question of representation
   divides poststructuralism in so many ways that it makes sense to analyse
   the differences among them through the lens of representation. I first
   look at two issues central to poststructuralism: critique and how to
   relate to the other'. In the second half of the article, I turn to look
   at three debates within poststructuralism: immanence versus
   transcendence, abundance versus lack, and autonomy versus hegemony.},

Abstract = {This article analyses three major aspects of the English author Michael
   Oakeshott's thinking. First, we study the relation between philosophy
   and politics, along with the possibility of finding a concept of
   political philosophy in his work, since he always considered relations
   between the two spheres to be problematic. Second, we analyze his
   skeptical attitude towards politics, an attitude contrary to those
   positions that maintained confidence and certainty regarding the
   attainment of a goal or an end, displaying an attitude comparable to
   followers of the postulates of a religious faith. Finally, we consider
   how this skeptical position became identified with the behavioral
   parameters he considered appropriate for a gentleman.},

Title = {Implementing gender mainstreaming in Public Administrations},
Journal = {REVISTA DE ESTUDIOS POLITICOS},
Year = {2017},
Number = {178},
Pages = {137-168},
Month = {OCT-DEC},
Abstract = {This paper examines gender mainstreaming in Spain. Two dimensions of the
   gender mainstreaming approach are considered. First, the evolution of
   gender equality policies and, second, the interplay between the
   implementation of gender mainstreaming and the dominant working
   practices inside Spanish public administrations. In relation to the
   former, we studied a wealth of equality plans at different
   administrative levels. To study the latter, we conducted an original
   survey targeting both junior and senior officials at local, regional and
   national levels of public administration in Spain.
   Our results highlight a paradox at the level of equality plans: while
   many public bodies are abandoning their duty to update them, a small
   number of frontrunners are engaging in proactive definitions of public
   policy-making in the field of gender equality. As regards
   implementation, we identified a number of forms of internal resistance
   to the involvement of gender specialists, as well as to the adoption of
   horizontal modes of working and organizing. Gender mainstreaming must
   therefore be viewed as a very challenging goal that is perhaps out of
   reach for very many public organisations.},

Journal = {ASIAN POLITICS \& POLICY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {9},
Number = {4, SI},
Pages = {541-563},

Abstract = {Since 2011, the Aquino administration has bolstered the development of a
   credible external defense posture of the Armed Forces of the Philippines
   (AFP) in the face of China's territorial expansion in the South China
   Sea. This move entailed the upgrading of the Philippine Navy's and the
   Philippine Air Force's capabilities for maritime domain awareness and
   naval interdiction. The Aquino administration also anchored its
   strategic agenda on the 60-year-old Philippines-U.S. alliance by signing
   the Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement (EDCA). The election of
   President Rodrigo Roa Duterte as the 16th president of the Philippines,
   however, generated uncertainties on whether or not he will continue
   building the AFP's territorial defense capabilities. Eventually, Duterte
   decided to continue the Aquino administration's build-up as a hedge, in
   case he should find it imperative in the future to pursue his
   predecessor's policy of challenging China's expansive claim in the South
   China Sea. The article concludes that like Aquino's security policy, the
   Duterte administration is also committed to building up the Philippine
   military's credible defense posture-in light of the growing
   uncertainties in the region marked by China's emergence and the
   perceived retreat of the United States as a Pacific power.},

Abstract = {We develop front-door difference-in-differences estimators as an
   extension of front-door estimators. Under one-sided noncompliance, an
   exclusion restriction, and assumptions analogous to parallel trends
   assumptions, this extension allows identification when the front-door
   criterion does not hold. Even if the assumptions are relaxed, we show
   that the front-door and front-door difference-in-differences estimators
   may be combined to form bounds. Finally, we show that under one-sided
   noncompliance, these techniques do not require the use of control units.
   We illustrate these points with an application to a job training study
   and with an application to Florida's early in-person voting program. For
   the job training study, we show that these techniques can recover an
   experimental benchmark. For the Florida program, we find some evidence
   that early in-person voting had small positive effects on turnout in
   2008. This provides a counterpoint to recent claims that early voting
   had a negative effect on turnout in 2008.},

Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Profound differences exist in how Americans from various racial and
   ethnic groups view police and court officials. We argue that vicarious
   experiences contribute to this racial and ethnic divide. Drawing on
   research on social communication, social network composition, and
   negativity biases in perception and judgment, we devise a theoretical
   framework to articulate why vicarious experiences magnify racial and
   ethnic disparities in evaluations of judicial actors. Four hypotheses
   are tested using original survey data from the state of Washington.
   Results provide strong evidence that vicarious experiences influence
   citizens' evaluations of both police and courts, and they do so in a
   manner that widens racial divides in how those actors are perceived.},

   informational specialisation. Expectations are linked to the theories of
   legislative organisation and tested using exponential random graph
   models of the co-sponsorship patterns during the seventh legislature of
   the European Parliament. The results indicate that representing the same
   member state, sharing committee membership, and being affiliated to the
   same European Parliament Party Group all contribute to the formation of
   recurring co-sponsorship ties. Furthermore, this study indicates that
   especially the European United Left-Nordic Green Left has strong
   within-party co-sponsorship bonds and that Alliance of Liberals and
   Democrats for Europe adopts a pivotal link between left and right in
   cross-party co-sponsorship.},

Abstract = {China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) seems to have exhibited its
   goodwill by aiming to integrate its neighbors peacefully and
   cooperatively into joint economic prosperity; nevertheless, there are
   various concerns about the implications of China's mounting influence in
   Central Asia. This article attempts to compare the results of several
   small-scale surveys conducted among university students in Kyrgyzstan
   and Kazakhstan, so as to get a glimpse of local perceptions in Central
   Asia on the growing Chinese influence in their countries. Our primary
   survey analysis shows that Kazakhstani respondents tend to believe China
   has the biggest influence in Central Asia, while Kyrgyzstani respondents
   believe that Russia outperforms China in status in the region. However,
   both Kyrgyzstani and Kazakhstani respondents believe that Russia's
   influence will largely decline and be overtaken by China in the next
   decade. Although our respondents have some awareness of China's presence
   in their countries and an understanding of China's influence, they do
   not consider the Chinese development model a suitable one for their
   country. China's much advocated Belt and Road Initiative has not seemed
   to reach the radar of the young respondents included in this study.},

Volume = {15},

Abstract = {In the study of political knowledge, the emphasis on facts is misplaced.
   Evidence has grown that predispositions and social contexts shape how
   individuals are exposed to and interpret facts about politics, and the
   ready availability of information in the contemporary media environment
   may exacerbate these biases. We reexamine political knowledge from the
   bottom up. We look at what citizens themselves treat as relevant to the
   task of understanding public affairs and how they use this information.
   We draw upon our research in three different projects involving
   observation of political talk and elite interviews to do so. We observe
   that people across a range of levels of political engagement process
   political information through the lens of their personal experience.
   Failing to acknowledge this aspect of the act of using political
   information presents an incomplete empirical understanding of political
   knowledge. We propose an Expanded Model of Civic Competence that
   presents an alternative interpretation for what it means to be an
   informed citizen in a democracy. In this model, the competence of
   listening to and understanding the different lived experiences of others
   cannot be considered separately from levels of factual knowledge.},

Abstract = {The aim of the study is to explore young people's attitudes towards
   political participation, both towards social-movement participation,
   such as taking part in protecting the environment and advocate for human
   rights; and towards more conventional participation such as voting.
   Their attitudes are examined in relation to their understanding of
   democracy, their empathy level, their parents' support, and both their
   own and their parents' conventional and social-movement participation.
   The study is a part of the research project, Young People's Civic
   Engagement in a Democratic Society. The participants are Icelandic, age
   14 and 18, in total 1042. They all responded to a questionnaire and 21
   of them were interviewed.
   The study's main findings were: Proportionally more young people
   emphasized social-movement participation than conventional
   participation. The more understanding they had of democracy and the
   higher level of empathy they expressed, the more positive attitudes they
   had towards social-movement participation. Furthermore, those who
   experienced more parental support and reported their own or their
   parents' conventional and social-movement participation had more
   positive attitudes towards social-movement participation. Fewer factors
   were related to the young people's attitudes towards conventional
   participation. The more girls found characteristics of democracy
   important, the more positive attitudes they had towards conventional
   participation; also, if their parents had participated in political
   parties.
   The interviews revealed that the young people felt social-participation
   an important way to have a voice, be active, and to have an impact on
   societal issues. Lack of trust towards authorities reduced their
   political participation. Also, they called for information about ways
   and fields to be active.},

Abstract = {This article is based on the findings of a research into the procedures
   regarding the handling of classified and confidential information at law
   enforcement agencies and related institutions. The aim was to examine
   how this information was being dealt with at these institutions. A
   secondary aim was to shed light on the duties and requirements regarding
   how confidential information should be handled and how the information
   were being enforced, in addition to examining the knowledge that the
   employees possessed regarding the legal environment. Procedures
   regarding the processing of confidential information have not been
   studied before in a comprehensive manner from the perspective of having
   the operation and purpose of these institutions in mind.
   The research was based on a qualitative methodology, interviews to be
   exact. The main findings showed that the respondents honoured the legal
   requirements regarding confidentiality when they handled such
   information. They referred to declarations of confidentiality,
   obligations of State employees, and their responsibilities in connection
   with the legal requirements regarding discretion. There was a difference
   of opinion whether current laws and regulations regarding the handling
   of confidential information were sufficient or should be changed.
   Traditions and customs had furthermore created certain work procedures
   in the daily work, and proved more valid than predefined rules.},

Abstract = {The Arab Spring engulfed most of the Arab countries in the Middle East
   and North Africa, starting in 2011. Erupting first in Tunisia and later
   spreading to other countries in the region, the uprisings have
   illustrated that the borders of the Arab Middle East are permeable. The
   public rallies that called for better living standards, crackdowns on
   corruption, and a narrowing of the socio-economic gap evolved into a
   call for political reform, and destabilized the incumbent regimes. In
   this article, the author argues that as a result, some Islamist actors
   emerged as the main beneficiaries of the Arab uprisings, and their
   electoral rise in some countries - particularly in Tunisia with the
   Ennanda Movement - have necessitated systematic approaches to understand
   the role of Islamist parties in the region.},

Volume = {18},

Abstract = {Previous literature suggests that citizens lack information about
   European Union politics and need party cues to develop attitudes toward
   European Union issues. This process would make party positions the cause
   rather than the consequence of voters' preferences, reducing the
   accountability of the political elite. The article tests the premise of
   this top-down model investigating how issue complexity and citizens'
   political knowledge affect party cue effectiveness. The results from
   both experimental and observational data show that party influence is
   higher among less knowledgeable citizens. Moreover, well-informed voters
   have autonomous opinions on easy issues, but they rely on party cues
   when facing harder ones. Given the low availability of information about
   European Union politics and the high complexity of the debated issues,
   parties appear largely able to shape voters' attitudes.},

Abstract = {Water is a strategic resource for life and the development of all
   nations, thus water security governance has been an issue of vital
   importance to countries, especially those which do not have guaranteed
   sources of potable water. The Lancang-Mekong Cooperation (LMC)
   mechanism, which focuses on water resources cooperation along the
   Lancang-Mekong River, serves as a good example. The current features of
   water security governance in the Lancang-Mekong River Basin indicate the
   necessity and importance of the LMC mechanism. Against the background of
   climate change and deficiency in governance capacity, all the
   Lancang-Mekong countries should concentrate on water security governance
   in the region. China, in particular, should continue to practice the
   Asian Security Concept in order to serve its Belt and Road Initiative
   (BRI) and its vision to build a community of shared future with
   neighboring countries.},

Abstract = {This article presents a new survey of Members of the European Parliament
   (MEPs) conducted during 2015, which adds to a time series of MEP surveys
   carried out by the European Parliament Research Group. The data allow
   for comparison of MEPs' views with those of the EU public, European
   Parliament candidates, and members of national and regional parliaments
   in Europe. The survey includes questions on topical issues, such as
   intra-EU migration and the UK-EU relationship. The dataset can be used
   to address a range of research questions concerning MEPs' preferences
   and representation. This article presents details of the 2015 MEP survey
   and uses the data to assess what explains MEPs' attitudes to the
   question of whether all EP plenary sessions should be held in Brussels.},

Volume = {50},

Abstract = {This article explores the coalitional success of mass-mobilizing,
   reformist parties once they achieve power. Why are some of these parties
   more successful than others at managing the potentially conflicting
   interests of their diverse social bases? We argue that organizational
   strategies adopted early on matter greatly. The nature of the party's
   core constituency, together with the linkage strategies undertaken by
   party leaders in crafting a coalition of support, shapes a party's
   ability to maintain that coalition over time. When coalitional partners
   are intensively rather than extensively integrated, they are more likely
   to compromise over policy disagreements rather than defect when
   defection becomes attractive. We develop this theory by comparing the
   evolution of two Bolivian parties: the Revolutionary Nationalist
   Movement and the Movement Toward Socialism. Against conventional
   explanations that are overly dependent upon structural factors, our
   argument stresses the impact of strategic choices in shaping a party's
   ability to maintain its coalition.},

Abstract = {Recent child development research shows that the psychosocial or
   noncognitive skills that children developincluding the ability to
   self-regulate and integrate in social settingsare important for success
   in school and beyond. Are these skills learned in childhood also
   important for adult political behaviors like voting? In this article, I
   use a unique school-based 20-year field experiment to explore whether
   children who develop psychosocial skills early on are more likely to
   vote in adulthood than those who do not. Matching subjects to voter
   files, I show that this intervention had a noticeable long-run impact on
   political participation. These results highlight the need to better
   understand how childhood experiences shape civic behaviors later in
   life. During this critical period, children can be taught the not
   explicitly political, but still vital, skills that set them on a path
   toward political participation in adulthood.},

Abstract = {Why do voters in electoral autocracies vote for opposition parties that
   are co-opted by the government? The logic of electoral accountability
   should lead constituents to vote such parties out, and parties, knowing
   this, should never agree to be co-opted. Yet there is evidence that
   constituents often do not sanction opposition parties for failing to
   prevent the government from consolidating power. Standard accountability
   models suggest that this accountability failure is due to the parties
   having developed good reputations. This article develops a formal theory
   that offers a novel explanation for accountability failures specific to
   electoral autocracies. The theory shows how a consolidation of power by
   an authoritarian regime, increasing its ability to punish opposition
   politicians, can lead citizens not to vote opposition parties out of
   office even after seeing them fail to prevent a consolidation of power.},

Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {This paper analyses parties' policy supply in electoral campaigns. In so
   doing, it proposes to look at issue clarity which is defined as the
   share of objectively testable pledges within an election manifesto. The
   main argument states that parties not only decide their positions and
   issue saliencies, but also the level of specificity with which they
   present their policies. The data come from Austria (1990-2008) and,
   thus, provide a good example for a Western European multi-party system
   with proportional representation. The analyses show that extreme parties
   present manifestos with higher issue clarity compared to moderate
   parties. Furthermore, this result is strengthened by a party's role in
   government. Issue ownership, however, seems to have no effect on issue
   clarity. (C) 2017 The Author. Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

Abstract = {Does power persist within families? This article considers whether
   members of the UK House of Commons with longer legislative careers after
   1832 were more likely to establish a political dynasty. Tenure can
   create opportunities to promote relatives. A regression discontinuity
   design for re-election races helps to rule out the confounding influence
   of inheritable traits. There is no evidence for a causal effect of
   tenure length on establishing or continuing a dynasty. Established
   families may have constrained further dynasty development, explaining
   the null result of tenure.},

Abstract = {The production of social science in developing societies has attracted
   scholars across the continents. Certain perspectives dominate these
   studies, like academic capitalism and academic dependency. While these
   perspectives are useful to assess the position of national social
   science, they overlook the level of development of social science in a
   country. Employing institutional and social science division of labor
   perspectives and using Indonesia as a case, the article argues that the
   current poor state of the Indonesian university system can be traced to
   a failure to embrace wide-ranging reforms on the part of politicians and
   universities. The causes for this failure can be found in a relatively
   weak production of the social sciences. This study reveals that
   shortfalls in state policy on higher education are the source of low
   academic productivity. Reforming this policy must be made a priority to
   strengthen social science and make it useful for formulating policy in
   the public sphere.},

Abstract = {Scholars of morality politics have argued that while secular parties
   politicise value-driven issues, Christian Democrats are more reluctant
   to do so. By investigating the individual cosponsoring of proposals on
   conscience issues in the German Bundestag between 2005 and 2009, we show
   that Christian Democrats use their freedom in this context and engage
   more frequently in politicising moral issues than deputies of secular
   parties. However, MP's engagement is also shaped by their religious
   denomination and the policy-specific issue salience. These findings
   enrich our understanding of the `Christian-Democratic Phoenix' in modern
   times and shed new light on the motives that drive agenda setting of
   morality issues in the parliamentary arena.},

Abstract = {This article shows the results of research on organizational change
   derived from the implementation of the Programa Integral de
   Fortalecimiento Institucional (PIFI), as a management tool from 2001, at
   the Autonomous University of Baja California (UABC). The study is
   addressed from the Organizational Studies; specifically the New
   Sociological Institutionalism. From this perspective, the process of
   organizational change is investigated in three levels of analysis:
   normative (Organic Law, General Statute and Planning Regulation), formal
   structure; (division of administrative work and decision making) and
   financial (allocation of extraordinary financial resources to the
   university).},

Abstract = {Political parties seek to make optimal nominations of candidates to
   maximize the number of seats they may win. In a multimember district
   with a single nontransferable vote (SNTV) electoral system, parties need
   to run the optimal number of candidates in each electoral district. If
   too many or too few candidates run, they may lose seats they might
   otherwise have won. In this situation, district-level party
   organizations face a collective action problem: they do not have the
   incentive to run multiple candidates for fear of losing all seats,
   despite needing to do so in order for the party to win a majority of
   seats in a legislature. This study examines the factors that enable
   parties to run multiple candidates in SNTV districts, and shows that
   parties undertake this action when they are able to divide the vote
   between party candidates on the basis of geography in the case of Japan.},

Abstract = {This article is a review of the fundamental principles of Participatory
   Action Research (PAR) within the framework of the socio-critical
   paradigm. It addresses the conceptual foundation of this methodology,
   scope and the usual procedures from the perspective of its most
   significant theoretical representatives. Investigating from the
   socio-critical paradigm intrinsically implies a political, social
   commitment, for justice, equality and peace. From the history of the
   PAR, this method involves the promotion of social or educational
   transformations, so it is a process that not only seeks and generates
   knowledge, but also hopes to arouse changes cultivated by and with the
   actors involved. Its principles exalt the inductive, dialogical and
   ideographic nature of knowledge; in addition, an inseparable
   relationship between theory and practice. The procedures proposed by
   different authors, always involve the recursive phases of
   action-reflection-action, an open loop in permanent movement. In the end
   we will see that this type of research represents an opportunity for the
   transformation of the chair of peace, which will allow to visualize the
   possible applications of the method in the university context.},

   super-sovereign reserve money where SDR (Special Drawing Rights) is the
   most favourable candidate. Joining SDR will push forward China's
   exchange rate reform to meet the standard of a real international
   reserve currency, which requires more skilful domestic and international

Abstract = {In direct response to the rise in fake news as a socio-cultural and
   political phenomenon, this article presents an analysis of the factors
   that may help to explain the reception of fake news. In addition, recent
   pronouncements made by the Trump White House seem to challenge the
   nature of an objective truth. An immersive narratology emphasizes that
   different universes of discourse can intermingle and overlap, with fact
   and fiction becoming difficult to distinguish in our increasingly
   mediated lives. A tenable definition of fake news is offered prior to
   exploring historical antecedents of fake news. Persuasion, construction,
   immersion, distribution, and polarization represent the core factors
   that demystify the reception of fake news regardless as to whether an
   individual believes a story. A concluding discussion offers a critical
   evaluation of the potential of fake news to augment the news media
   landscape in the coming years.},

Abstract = {This paper re-examines the findings from a recently published study on
   hydrocarbon rents and autocratic survival by Lucas and Richter (LR
   hereafter). LR introduce a new data set on hydrocarbon rents and use it
   to examine the link between oil income and autocratic survival.
   Employing a placebo test, we show that the authors' strategy for dealing
   with missingness in the new hydrocarbon rents data set - filling in
   missing data with zeros - creates bias in the reported estimates of
   interest. Addressing missingness with multiple imputation shows that the
   LR findings linking oil rents to democratization do not hold. Instead,
   we find that hydrocarbon rents reduce the chances of transition to a new
   dictatorship, consistent with the conclusions of Wright et al.},

Abstract = {We know how sex (rather than gender) structures political preferences,
   but researchers rarely take into account the salience or importance of
   gender identity at the individual level. The only similar variable for
   which salience is commonly taken seriously is partisanship, for which
   direction and importance or strength are both considered imperative for
   measurement and analysis. While some scholars have begun to look at
   factors that may influence intragroup differences, such as feminism
   (Conover, 1988), most existing research implicitly assumes gender
   salience is homogenous in the population. We argue that both the content
   of gender identity (that is, what specifically is gender identity, as
   opposed to sex) as well its salience should be incorporated into
   analyses of how gender structures political behaviour. For some, gender
   simply does not motivate behaviour, and the fact that salience moderates
   the impact of gender on behaviour requires researchers to model
   accordingly. Using original data from six provincial election studies,
   we examine a measure of gender identity salience and find that it
   clarifies our understanding of gender's impact on political attitudes.},

Title = {Chinese Investments in Serbia-A Joint Pledge for the Future of the New
   Silk Road},
Journal = {BALTIC JOURNAL OF EUROPEAN STUDIES},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {7},

Pages = {64-83},

Abstract = {Following the political changes in 2000, Serbia has rapidly started to
   catch up with the countries of Central and Eastern Europe in various
   aspects of the transition process. One of these very important aspects
   were foreign investments, both `direct' and ` portfolio' ones, that had
   a significant impact on the development of Serbian economy by recovering
   economic structure and raising competitiveness in world markets,
   followed by improving the balance of payments and technological,
   scientific and managerial base. Foreign investments as an ``economic
   engine{''} enable accelerated realization of national economic goals
   which include re-industrialization and renewal of industrial capacity.
   The openness of the Serbian market and the lack of financial resources
   allow China and other states concerned under favourable conditions
   invest in the development of Serbian economy. In this way, Chinese
   investments have become a driving force for the promotion of economic
   and other relations between the two countries. On the other hand,
   however, Chinese investments have proven to be an ideal test for the
   realization of the objectives of the development strategy of the `New
   Silk Road' which among other things include the improvement of China's
   position on world markets, including the EU market. For the proper
   understanding of Sino-Serbian relations, this study first gives a short
   explanation of the Chinese strategy of the New Silk Road. Then, it
   includes an analysis of Serbia's position towards China. Analysis of the
   development of Serbian-Chinese economic relations, especially in the
   field of foreign investment and within the framework of multilateral
   cooperation mechanism `16+1', occupies the central part of the study.
   The study concludes with an evaluation of comparative advantages and
   certain disadvantages for the Chinese foreign investment in Serbian
   economy, which in itself has certain significance for the realization of
   the New Silk Road strategy.},

Abstract = {This essay examines how or why Huck came to recognize the humanity of
   the slave Jim. Christian principles and those of the Declaration of
   Independence play little or no explicit part in the change. In addition,
   a careful examination of the dispute over King Solomon and language in
   chapter 14 suggests that Jim's capacity for reason did not prompt the
   change. Several subsequent episodes reveal that Huck's recognition of
   Jim's humanity is rooted rather in sentiment, especially sympathy. This
   approach places Twain's thought closer to Rousseau than to Locke and
   suggests that the novel can be understood as an exploration of the
   pre-political relations needed for overcoming racism.},

Abstract = {The twenty-fifth anniversary of the collapse of the USSR naturally
   provokes us to reflect on the course of Eurasian and world history in
   the post-communist era. Upon closer examination, however, it is not
   clear what significance the precise time span of two and a half decades
   has for the scientific study of political and institutional change. A
   review of the social science literature indicates that we are very far
   from having any consensual understanding of how long processes of regime
   evolution typically takeand thus, how to establish the relevant time
   span for judging the scientific accuracy of initial predictions about
   the outcomes of post-communist transitions. I argue that the first step
   in assessing the lessons of post-Soviet political change to date, from a
   social-scientific point of view, lies in defining the term regime more
   precisely, so that scholars can at least agree when one regime has ended
   and another begun. In this respect, Weberian sociological theory
   provides useful conceptual materials for a more general theory of regime
   evolution within which the empirical results of the first twenty-five
   years of post-Soviet change can be situated.},

Abstract = {This paper explores the developments of the contemporary Croatian
   citizenship regime, with particular focus on the ones that took place
   after Croatian accession to the EU. The first two stages of development
   of Croatian citizenship regime, from the 1990s until the Croatian
   membership to the EU, are focused on the consolidation of the status and
   rights dimensions of citizenship. The aftermath of the EU accession
   (re)introduced identity in the focus of the Croatian citizenship
   debates, particularly when it comes to issues of the status and rights
   of two categories of citizens: Serb minority and veterans of the
   Homeland War. This paper will argue that the dynamics of these
   developments is impossible to understand without: a) comprehending the
   specific legal tradition and political context that shaped the
   circumstances of the foundation of the Croatian state; b) understanding
   the role of the Homeland War as the symbolic foundation of the Croatian
   statehood; c) the development of the new statuses and categories of
   citizens that emerged from the constellation of this context and
   symbolic foundations of the state; and, finally, d) how the
   institutionalization of these statuses shape the context and agenda for
   Croatian-citizenship-related debates.},

Abstract = {As voters across Northern Ireland went to the polls on 5 May 2016, it
   was by no means obvious that they were participating in a landmark
   election. The preceding campaign was largely lacklustre, voters were
   left uninspired, and competition for votes was primarily conducted along
   predictable ethno-national lines. The Democratic Unionist Party and Sinn
   Fein retained their positions as the dominant unionist and nationalist
   parties respectively, while the Ulster Unionist Party and Social
   Democratic and Labour Party struggled to retain their existing support,
   let alone expand it. The cross-community Alliance Party remained
   stagnant in fifth place. However, these ostensive signs of continuity
   with previous elections mask deeper signs of substantive change. The
   establishment of Northern Ireland's first official opposition within
   current structures and the publication of a draft Programme for
   Government framework within a month of the election are indicative of a
   new era in consociational power sharing. Meanwhile, the growth in
   support for smaller parties, a further fall in voter turnout and an
   audible debate around social issues suggest at least a partial decline
   in the salience of the ethno-national dimension in the electoral arena.},

Abstract = {The secret ballot is one of the cornerstones of democracy. We contend
   that the historical process of modernization caused the switch from open
   to secret ballot with the underlying mechanism being that income growth,
   urbanization, and rising education standards undermined vote markets. We
   undertake event history studies of ballot reform in Western Europe and
   the U.S. states during the 19th and 20th centuries to establish that
   modernization was systematically related to ballot reform. We study
   electoral turnout before and after ballot reform among the U.S. states
   and British parliamentary constituencies to substantiate the hypothesis
   that modernization reduced the volume of trade in the vote market.},

Month = {APR-JUN},
Abstract = {On August 9, 1974, Richard M. Nixon formally resigned the presidency;
   however, folklore hints Nixon informally quit fulfilling his duties well
   before then. As Watergate became less ``a third rate burglary{''} than
   ``high crimes and misdemeanors,{''} rumors of President Nixon's
   wallowing, wandering, drinking, and mumbling swirled. Yet evidence for
   such assertions has been thin, and prevailing scholarship offers
   compelling reasons to believe Nixon's institutional protocols overrode
   his individual proclivities. This study offers a new, systematic look at
   Nixon's presidency by coding his public events and private interactions
   with top government officials during every day of his presidency.
   Contrary to our expectations, the results corroborate the rumors:
   Richard Nixon effectively quit being president well before he resigned
   the presidency. In fact, it turns out there was a defining moment when
   Nixon disengaged from his administration: on December 6, 1973, the day
   Gerald Ford was confirmed as Vice President.},

Abstract = {We examine strategic voting in the second round of the 2014 French
   municipal elections. We focus on the 96 cities where the number of lists
   remained constant (three, four, or five) in the two rounds, and we
   examine the evolution of the vote for these 329 lists from the first to
   the second round. We show that support for the top two lists (in the
   first round) systematically increases in the second round at the expense
   of the other lists. The second list makes as much progress as the first
   list, ruling out a bandwagon effect. Strategic desertion of the
   non-viable lists is more pronounced when the distance from the second
   list is high, and there is close competition between the top two lists.
   This suggests that voters in these cities behave in a second round of a
   two-round election as they do under FPTP, provided that there are many
   candidates/parties and that the second round is held under plurality.},

Abstract = {In the United States during the 1960s and 1970s, appeals to authenticity
   were deployed across the political spectrum. Taken together, these
   notions offered competing and often contradictory accounts of what
   authenticity entailed, where it resided, and who could be authentic.
   Despite how ideologically diverse and protean these claims were, many
   activists chose to hold onto the term rather than jettison it. They
   contested popular accounts of who and what was authentic and deployed
   the term for their own purposes. In doing so, they were able to advance
   a variety of political causes. By analyzing four texts associated with
   movement politics of the time, this article shows how authenticity
   appeals could help marginalized groups to contest oppressive
   stereotypes, animate resistant practices of truth telling, and provide
   alternative accounts of justice, freedom, equality, and solidarity. In
   this article, I first show that the political potential of such appeals
   can be detached from the purported truth of their ontological claims,
   and second, that while it is possible to deploy authenticity
   strategically that is, without really believing that an inner self
   exists such a deployment may eclipse some of the more potent discursive
   effects offered by such appeals.},

Abstract = {The proliferation of increasingly strict voter identification laws
   around the country has raised concerns about voter suppression. Although
   there are many reasons to suspect that these laws could harm groups like
   racial minorities and the poor, existing studies have been limited, with
   most occurring before states enacted strict identification requirements,
   and they have uncovered few effects. By using validated voting data from
   the Cooperative Congressional Election Study for several recent
   elections, we are able to offer a more definitive test. The analysis
   shows that strict identification laws have a differentially negative
   impact on the turnout of racial and ethnic minorities in primaries and
   general elections. We also find that voter ID laws skew democracy toward
   those on the political right.},

Abstract = {Why, many Americans rightly ask, can material racial inequality and
   widespread segregation still persist 50 years after the enactment of key
   civil rights legislation and eight years after the election of an
   African American to the nation's highest office? Many from outside the
   US pose similar questions about modern America. The explanation, I
   argue, lies with inconsistent and fluctuating levels of federal
   engagement to building material racial equality. National engagement
   fluctuates because it is energetically resisted and challenged by
   opponents of racial progress. This vulnerability to disruption is
   exposed by varying strategies of resistance, some fiscal, some violent,
   some judicial, some desultory and some combining violent protest against
   change with local electoral triumphs for anti-reformers. Public
   resistance to employing national resources to reduce inequality
   encouraged a de-racialization strategy amongst many African American
   candidates for elected office who opt to de-emphasize issues of racial
   inequality in campaigns and in office. Whatever the means, the effect is
   uniform: the slowing down or outright death of federal civil rights
   activism.},

Abstract = {The conventional wisdom is that class divisions once prevailed but in
   recent decades have gradually declined. Indeed, many now suggest that
   the working class has been voting Republican since the 1980s. The
   historical evidence on voting in presidential elections does not
   indicate that there was a decline since the 1950s. If anything, the
   well-off and more educated have moved somewhat more Democratic,
   lessening class divisions. There has, however, been a change since the
   2008 election, with the working class - whether only whites or all
   moving away from the Democrats. This may not mean a decline of the
   working class voting their interests. It may be that the economic
   recovery of recent years has done little to help the working class and
   they have taken a gamble that a businessman will help their job
   prospects more.},

Abstract = {This article seeks to illuminate the use of exceptional national
   security and emergency powers in the fight against terrorism in Turkey.
   The article is organized in four parts. Section I looks at the role of
   terrorism in the activation and justification of a state of emergency
   and introduces the Turkish case within this context. Section II explores
   the historical origins of the Turkish state of emergency regime and
   analyses the principles regulating emergency regime at the Turkish
   domestic level. Section III examines the operation of governmental
   emergency powers by providing an analysis of the state of emergency
   practices in Turkey, both past and present. A principal focus is
   necessarily directed at the state of emergency and the measures deployed
   within this framework in Turkey's predominantly Kurdish southeast, where
   emergency rule was in force from 1987 to 2002, and the recent nationwide
   state of emergency in the wake of the 15 July attempted coup. Section Iv
   presents concluding remarks.},

Abstract = {Public finance is at the heart of politics. In China, public finance has
   remained marginal to political contestations. This is puzzling because
   public revenue as a percentage of gross domestic policy has risen
   rapidly in the past two decades, indicating enhanced extractive efforts
   by the state. By examining two components of China's public financial
   systemtax and nontax revenuesthis article considers the specific sources
   of China's public revenues and the state-society relationship implicated
   in the processes of collecting them. I argue that there has been an
   institutional design by the Chinese central state to depoliticize public
   finance in the reform era, with both intended and unintended
   consequences. First, China's evolving tax structure played the role of
   fending off the formation of politically active social groups that could
   develop out of a progressive tax profile. Second, fiscal centralization
   attempted by the central state since the 1990s has severed the fiscal
   contracts established previously between grassroots governments and
   local communities. It has turned local governments into upwardly
   oriented applicants for central fiscal transfers and economic
   entrepreneurs on the capital market.},

Abstract = {Fiscal Illusion deals with the issue of tax payers' perceptions devoted
   to the size of the public sector and tax revenues to finance public
   expenditures. Due to the factors as complexity of tax system, tax rates,
   governments preference between debt finance or increasing money supply
   instead of taxation, the share of indirect taxes in tax revenues, lack
   of confidence to government policy, etc. tax payers can underestimate
   the level of real tax burden and the size of the public sector. In this
   study we will evaluate the theoretical development, different approaches
   and evidences of empirical studies about fiscal illusion. On the basis
   of these information, we will assess fiscal illusion level of Turkish
   Economy by employing Factor Analysis as a Multivariate Statistical
   Method.},

Abstract = {Elected governments sometimes deal with protests by authorizing the
   police to use less-lethal tools of repression: water cannons, tear gas,
   rubber bullets, and the like. When these tactics fail to end protests
   and instead spark larger, backlash movements, some governments reduce
   the level of violence but others increase it, causing widespread
   injuries and loss of life. We study three recent cases of governments in
   new democracies facing backlash movements. Their decision to scale up or
   scale back police repression reflected the governments' levels of
   electoral security. Secure governments with relatively unmovable
   majorities behind them feel freer to apply harsh measures. Less secure
   governments, those with volatile electoral support, contemplate that
   their hold on power might weaken should they inflict very harsh
   treatment on protesters; they have strong incentives to back down. Our
   original survey research and interviews with civilian authorities,
   police officials, and protest organizers in Turkey, Brazil, and Ukraine
   allow us to evaluate this explanation as well as a number of rival
   accounts. Our findings imply that elected governments that rest on very
   stable bases of support may be tempted to deploy tactics more commonly
   associated with authoritarian politics.},

Abstract = {This article contributes to our understanding of the autonomy, control
   and management of public agencies in Spain, based on managers'
   perceptions of their financial and operational capacities as well as
   their mechanisms of accountability. Its findings derive from the
   opinions of senior officials of Spanish public agencies, gathered
   through a survey conducted between July and November 2013. The survey is
   modeled on an international collaborative project (COBRA) that aims to
   analyze the processes of agencification among public administrations in
   different countries. The results of this study suggest that managers of
   Spanish public agencies enjoy a high level of autonomy. The results
   additionally show that agencies perceived as more autonomous tend to be
   more accountable towards their respective parent ministries. The study
   thus conclude that the implementation of the public agency model has not
   reduced the level of accountability and transparency of public
   administration in Spain, but, on the contrary, has contributed to
   encouraging the emergence of a new public manager profile more concerned
   about the importance of being accountable for its activities.},

Abstract = {Research on how economic factors affect attitudes toward immigration
   often focuses on labor market effects, concluding that, because workers'
   skill levels do not predict opposition to low- versus highly skilled
   immigration, economic self-interest does not shape policy attitudes. We
   conduct a new survey to measure beliefs about a range of economic,
   political, and cultural consequences of immigration. When economic
   self-interest is broadened to include concerns about the fiscal burdens
   created by immigration, beliefs about these economic effects strongly
   correlate with immigration attitudes and explain a significant share of
   the difference in support for highly versus low-skilled immigration.
   Although cultural factors are important, our results suggest that
   previous work underestimates the importance of economic self-interest as
   a source of immigration policy preferences and attitudes more generally.},

Abstract = {In this paper, we examine the ways in which citizens emotionally react
   to and cognitively process campaign advertisements that contain
   group-based appeals. Specifically, we focus on the emotional, cognitive,
   and persuasive effects of three campaign ads aired during the 2012
   election campaign that contained explicit appeals to women voters. We
   analyze differences across women and men in their emotional responses to
   the ads, in their reports of the memorability of the ads, in their
   cognitive engagement with the ads, and in how persuasive the ads were
   for vote choice. In so doing, we add nuance to studies of gender and
   campaigns and contribute to the expanding literature on the impact of
   strategic campaign communications.},

Abstract = {The main objective of this study was to investigate the relationship
   between working capital management, financial constraints and
   performance of listed companies in Tehran Stock Exchange. To verify this
   financial information from 148companies listed on the Tehran Stock
   Exchange during the period 2009-2013 were studied. Information required
   extracted from Rah Avard Novin 3 software, and thensummarized,
   classified, and calculated by Microsoft Excel, and finally through
   Eviews 8 and Stata 12 software were analyzed. According to the
   statistical procedures conducted in 95/0 reliability, the assumptions
   are tested. methods of the study are inductive reasoning and in terms of
   time are cross-sectional and in terms of relationship between variables
   is correlation. the results showed that ROA has a negative impact on
   working capital management. While financial constraints affect the
   relationship between working capital management and return on assets.
   better management of working capital can improve companies' performance.
   On the other hand, effect of working capital on companies' performance
   would be increased when facing financial constraint.},

Journal = {JAPANESE JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE},

Volume = {18},
Number = {1},

Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Since the financial crisis of 2008-9, how a state can play a more active
   role in correcting market failure has become a central topic in
   political economy. Thus, academia is again discussing state capitalism
   seriously. Contemporary state capitalism assumes state intervention in
   markets is becoming more multifaceted. Consequently, traditional
   state-owned enterprises exist alongside new government-favored actors,
   such as privately owned national champions and sovereign wealth funds,
   intervening in markets. This coalition helps the state achieve its
   security, political, economic, social, and nationalistic goals more
   efficiently. Its growing power in markets also heralds the return of
   state capitalism. This paper uses state capitalism theories to
   re-interpret China's food security governance. The three preliminary
   findings are as follows. First, China's food security governance is
   typically operated under state capitalism, which has successfully
   managed China's food availability, though not without some corruption,
   but has weakened its food accessibility. Second, using state capitalism
   to manage China's food safety has been impeded, so the effects remain to
   be seen. Third, state capitalism has successfully improved the stability
   of the food supply and demand in China, but its agricultural business
   branching-out strategy has worried the international community and
   should be observed further.},

Abstract = {This article analyses the security, governance and economic reforms
   carried out by Fujimori in the 1990s as strategies of pacification
   seeking to restore a capitalist social order disturbed by the economic
   and social turmoil of the 1970s and 1980s. First, I show how different
   forms of state violence were intrinsically connected to the pacification
   process. Then, I argue that the social order produced resulted from the
   articulation of populism and authoritarianism with neoliberalism.
   Subsequently, I contend that crimes, harms and violence continue within
   the current democratic configuration precisely because pacification is
   an ongoing process seeking to maintain an order which is intrinsically
   exploitative, creates favourable conditions for economic crimes and
   corruption and resorts to repressive violence when challenged. I
   conclude by suggesting that the social, political and economic
   landscapes that provided the impetus for pacification have been
   transformed through the new social order, further weakening already
   frail democratic institutions.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF POLITICS AND LAW},

Volume = {10},
Number = {2},
Pages = {73-81},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Comprising 57 member states, the Organization for Islamic Cooperation
   (OIC) is the second largest intergovernmental organization in the world
   after the United Nations. Its membership extends from Southeast Asia,
   South Asia and the Middle East to Africa, Eurasia, the Balkans and South
   America.
   In 2005, OIC launched a reform program that culminated in adopting a
   revised Charter in 2008 replacing the Charter of 1972. The new Charter
   seemed to reflect an increased prominence for human rights within the
   OIC, and it paved the way for the establishment of the OIC's Independent
   Permanent Human Rights Commission (IPHRC). In addition to the
   stipulation that IPHRC will be one of the eleven primary organs of the
   OIC, the new Charter expresses the OIC's determination to ``promote
   human rights and fundamental freedoms, good governance, rule of law,
   democracy and accountability{''}, and ``safeguard and promote the rights
   of women and their participation in all spheres of life{''} in member
   States in accordance with domestic legislation. In addition to these
   transformations, OIC appear to be more willing to engage with civil
   society organizations on human rights. It is in this context, and the
   increasing need to understand the OIC, particularly its human rights
   mechanisms and discourse, this paper tries to have a general analysis on
   subject.
   It should be noted that for some researchers (Mayer. 2015) the OIC's
   record is shown to be full of confusing and even self-contradictory
   statements on Islam and human rights. For them, OIC is not a competent
   organization for promoting the Human Rights as a universal value.
   As our major question, the paper seeks to evaluate the index growth of
   human rights and their criteria in OIC. Which are the main instruments
   for protection of Human Rights in OIC? Has OIC been successful in
   promotion of Human rights in the Member States and in the world?
   To carry out the research, a descriptive and analytical method is
   selected and based on OIC documents, it will be a documented analysis.},

Abstract = {How do the communicative events of the Trio Presidencies of Poland,
   Denmark and Cyprus contribute to the reproduction or transformation of
   the EU's social and political order? This research question is addressed
   by comparing the discourses of the three consecutive Polish, Danish and
   Cypriot EU Presidencies in the period between 2011 and 2012, using a
   Fairclough-inspired analytical framework. The overall hegemonic EU
   discourses identified in this time period are characterized as follows:
   `more Europe' and `more European integration is the only way out of the
   economic crisis'. However, the three Presidencies attach different
   meanings to this discourse. The key order of discourse of the Polish
   Presidency is ``More Europe{''} safeguards freedom and democracy'; the
   mantra of the Danish Presidency is ``More Europe{''} through tangible
   results'; and last, the key order of discourse of the Cypriot Presidency
   is: ``More Europe{''} through more solidarity and social cohesion'. To a
   certain extent, these differences in the meaning of the hegemonic
   discourse reflect the interests and ideological foundations of the
   national governments responsible for the Presidencies; however, this
   relationship is far from straightforward.},

Abstract = {To what extent can we understand abstention from voting in European
   Parliament elections as Eurosceptic behavior? This article answers the
   question empirically, drawing upon data gathered by the European
   Election Studies 2014 post-election survey. Several sub-dimensions of
   political support for the EU as well as different types of non-voters
   are analyzed. The findings indicate that - in addition to traditional
   determinants of electoral participation - a lack of trust in the
   political institutions of the EU is a major factor explaining non-voting
   in European elections. Other attitudes towards the EU show much less
   explanatory power for the individual turnout decision. Finally, the
   article shows that the difference in participation between elections at
   the national and the European level - commonly called the Euro Gap - is
   a consequence of Eurosceptic attitudes. Thus it can be assumed that many
   citizens perceive voting in national elections while abstaining from
   European elections as an appropriate means through which to express
   their dissatisfaction with the EU and its institutions.},

Abstract = {Open contracts are agreement whereby parties of the contract can insert
   terms and conditions in the contract, delete them, or revise them. Some
   contracts for the supply of goods or construction are examples of such
   contracts. One party ( usually a contractor or seller) can have many
   initiatives by increasing and decreasing the price or by changing
   elements of the contract. Certainly, there are many reasons, motives,
   and important goals in creating this type of conventions and its
   acceptance by the legal community. Discovery of these reasons and the
   goals leads to fundamental changes and definition of this type of
   contract could be a major driver of reform in Iranian contract laws, as
   Iranian community prefers to use example or pre-specified forms of
   contracts. Therefore, referring to the Principles of European Contract
   Law and implementation of the legal provisions, legal doctrines, and
   jurisprudence, presentation of new concepts such as open contract as
   well as analysis of its nature, validity, and effects leads to
   establishment of grounds for accepting new contractual frameworks and
   its localization of contractual rights in Iran because it has been
   rejected due to traditional perspectives. It may result in legislation
   to pave the way for solving many legal problems in specialized issues
   such as oil contracts. In this regard, in addition to genealogy of open
   contract, this article aims to examine its types and its effects legally
   in the laws of countries like Iran and European countries.},

Journal = {POLITICAL RESEARCH QUARTERLY},

Abstract = {States have increasingly taken the process of redistricting out of the
   hands of elected legislators and placed it with the public. The shift is
   in part driven by a concern that legislators are motivated to partition
   districts to advantage their own and their political party's electoral
   prospects, whereas citizens are not. We know little, however, about the
   preferences of the public when it comes to redistricting. One
   party-based argument is that individuals should prefer to share a
   district with as many like-minded partisans as possible to maximize
   their legislative representation, whereas other arguments suggest that
   nonpartisan factors, such as sharing a district with their community,
   may be more important. Using a novel experimental design, we find that
   for most participants, the draw to share a district with copartisans is
   stronger than a preference for preserving a community (county) within
   the district even when participants are specifically instructed to
   attend to local jurisdictional boundaries.},

Abstract = {We examine the puzzling phenomenon that authoritarian governments are
   perceived to be more responsive than democratic governments. By
   comparing China and Taiwan by both large-N statistical analyses and
   in-depth case studies, we show that the answer lies in the differences
   between democratic and authoritarian institutions. First, failing to
   elect one's preferred candidate in democracies predisposes voters to
   critical assessment of government responsiveness. There is no such
   predisposition in authoritarian countries where elections are
   nonexistent or nominal. Second, elections incentivize democratic leaders
   to over-respond to certain groups. There is no such mechanism in
   authoritarian countries. Third, the solid and clear legitimacy
   established by electoral victories shield democratic leaders from
   particularistic demands made through unconventional channels. Without
   such legitimacy, authoritarian leaders are compelled to cement
   legitimacy by increasing responsiveness.},

Pages = {3-20},

Abstract = {In this article we seek to revisit what the term `technopolitical' means
   for democratic politics in our age. We begin by tracing how the term was
   used and then transformed through various and conflicting adaptations of
   ICTs (Information and Communication Technologies) in governmental and
   civil organizations and grassroots movements. Two main streams can be
   distinguished in academic literature: studies about internet-enhanced
   politics (labelled as e-government) and politics 2.0 that imply the
   facilitation of existing practices such as e-voting, e-campaigning and
   e-petitioning. The second stream of the internet-enabled perspective
   builds on the idea that ICTs are essential for the organization of
   transformative, contentious politics, citizen participation and
   deliberative processes. Under a range of labels, studies have often used
   ideas of the technopolitical in an undefined or underspecified manner
   for describing the influence of digital technologies on their scope of
   investigation. After critically reviewing and categorizing the main
   concepts used in the literature to describe ICT-based political
   performances, we construct a conceptual model of technopolitics oriented
   at two contra-rotating developments: Centralization vs.
   Decentralization. Within a schema consisting of the five dimensions of
   context, scale and direction, purpose, synchronization and actors we
   will clarify these developments and structure informal and formal ways
   of political practices. We explain the dimensions using real-world
   examples to illustrate the unique characteristics of each
   technopolitical action field and the power dynamics that influence them.},

Journal = {ELECTORAL STUDIES},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {45},

Abstract = {As the connection between an individual's socioeconomic status and
   electoral participation originates from the socialization process in
   childhood and adolescence, inequalities in voting are often argued to be
   relatively stable throughout the life cycle. However, social mobility
   during adulthood may mitigate the effects of family background. Using
   individual-level register-based data, this study examines the extent to
   which changes in adults' social class and income between 2000 and 2011
   influenced voting propensity in the 2012 Finnish municipal elections.
   The results show that turnout among socially mobile voters settles
   between the stable members of their socioeconomic group of origin and

Abstract = {Pakistan has had a chequered democratic history but elections in 2013
   marked a second turnover in power, and the first transition in
   Pakistan's history from one freely elected government to another. How do
   we best categorize (and therefore understand) political developments in
   Pakistan? Is it now safe to categorize it as an electoral democracy or
   is it still a hybrid case of democracy? Using the Pakistani case as an
   example, this article argues that hybrid regimes deserve consideration
   as a separate case (rather than as a diminished subtype of democracy or
   authoritarianism), but must be categorized along a multidimensional
   continuum to understand the dynamics of power within the political
   system.},

Abstract = {This paper seeks to answer a simple question: When do regional powers
   get involved in civil wars? Some civil wars see a significant
   involvement of regional actors, while others show a remarkable level of
   isolation. What explains this difference? This research answers this
   question by looking at two case studies: the Algerian civil war
   (1991-2002) and the Syrian civil war (2011-up to date). The paper
   identifies and develops five factors of regional involvement. These are:
   capabilities, regional dynamics, country's relevance, regional security
   issues/containment and domestic-external links. civil wars are today one
   of the most prominent and deadly forms of conflict, and this paper
   contributes to understanding the important but understudied issue of
   regional involvement.},

Abstract = {Despite the widespread scholarly attention given to get-out-the-vote
   tactics the recent one and a half decade, few have studied the effect of
   short text messages (SMS) on voter turnout, and no previous such study
   has been conducted outside the US. We analyze four SMS experiments with
   more than 300,000 voters conducted in relation to two elections in
   Denmark and find intention-to-treat (ITT) effects between 0.33 and 1.82
   percentage points with a pooled effect of 0.74 percentage points.
   Furthermore, we vary the timing and the content of the messages to test
   existing theories of text messages as mobilization tools. In one
   experiment, we find messages delivered before Election Day to have a
   higher effect than those delivered on Election Day, while we find no
   additional effect of delivering multiple messages. We also vary message
   content and in general find no significant differences from sending
   different messages.},

Abstract = {Non-medical innovation has become progressively more open, harnessing
   the enterprise and creativity of a variety of players (including

   innovation, however, remains more closed and regimented because of
   age-old traditions, reinforced by modern funding and regulatory
   practices that require the costly ex-ante demonstration of efficacy.
   These practices, which seek to replicate those of the natural sciences,
   militate against the pluralistic creation and use of medical innovations
   and suppress ad-hoc, accretive-and potentially life-saving-advances.},

Abstract = {Independent central banks prefer balanced budgets due to the long-run
   connection between deficits and inflation, and can enforce their
   preference through interest rate increases and denial of credit to the
   government. This article argues that legal central bank independence
   (CBI) deters fiscal deficits predominantly in countries with rule of law
   and impartial contract enforcement, a free press and constraints on
   executive power. It further suggests that CBI may not affect fiscal
   deficits in a counter-cyclical fashion, but instead depending on the
   electoral calendar and government partisanship. The article also tests
   the novel hypotheses using new yearly data on legal CBI for
   seventy-eight countries from 1970 to 2007. The results show that CBI
   restrains deficits only in democracies, during non-election years and
   under left government tenures.},

Abstract = {Social policy has undergone a major process of de-politicization all
   over Europe in the last twenty years, that was fostered by the paradigm
   shift towards the so-called Social Investment Welfare State. Though
   similar processes are taking place in many policy areas, social policy
   can be considered one of the most promising fields of observation of
   de-politicization. The downgrading of the political character of
   decision making, indeed, is in sharp contrast with the relevance of the
   debate about values and justice and with the conflicts that accompanied
   the establishment of welfare systems. The paper argues that
   de-politicization is the result of the interaction between three
   different mechanisms: the shift of emphasis from justice to
   effectiveness and the model of ``governance by numbers{''}; the process
   of individualization of social intervention that marginalized collective
   responsibilities; the inclusive model of governance that co-opt civil
   society organizations reducing their role as conflicting actors. The
   three mechanisms give way to a model of de-politicization distinguished
   by the narrowing of the political debate about solutions, models of
   intervention and principles, based on inclusion rather than delegation
   and in which political actors do not disappear. The process of
   de-politicization is relatively independent from the trend of
   retrenchment that begins with the political success of neoliberalism.
   However,as we will see, it is essential to the survival of its
   principles.},

Title = {{[}en] Reconstructions of Labour Identity in Unlivable Organizational
   Contexts},
Journal = {POLITICA Y SOCIEDAD},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {54},
Number = {1},
Pages = {65-86},
Abstract = {Transformations in work experience are provoking a work-related
   identities crisis, as long as work conditions discourage investment in
   unsafe, unstable identity referents, which are also more demanding in
   qualitative and quantitative terms. These problems with a positive link
   to work identities are behind the concern big companies express about
   job involvement or work commitment, which is key to their efforts on
   workers' control through new mechanism, especially those relying in
   mechanisms involving directly workers' subjectivity, while they offer
   less and less ground to their workforce to commit to their job. Under
   these conditions workers express more frequently a certain subjective
   distance to their job and organization in different forms: from
   acceptance of organizational demands, sometimes sincerely, sometimes
   cynically, to subjective uninvolvement, more or less covert, including
   the exit of the organization. The aim of this work is the analysis in
   depth of workers' responses, in terms of agency, to the conditions under
   which they perform their tasks, paying especial attention to the
   voluntary exit of the organization. These strategies represent nicely
   the malaise new forms of regulation of subjectivity are producing. The
   analysis is based on in-depth interviews from different research
   projects. Results show the diversity of responses workers implement
   before potentially unliveable situations. Notwithstanding the general
   dominance of conformity responses, diverse forms of evitative responses
   show up like critical or simulated accommodation, as well as subjective
   distancing. Equally exit response are also relevant (escapist
   identities) in search of better to option to find a desired
   acknowledgment in more liveable identities.},

Volume = {10},

Abstract = {This study analyses the extent to which the recent economic crisis
   influences the political attitudes that are fundamental to legitimacy of
   a democratic system of government. The article focuses on two questions:
   how much does crisis exposure affect democratic legitimacy attitudes?
   And what is the role played by social mobility perspective on this
   effect?
   The findings, based on a sample of the Life in Transition Survey II,
   show that economic crisis exposure significantly affects political
   legitimacy attitudes. The results confirm that higher crisis exposure is
   associated with lower legitimacy. Additionally, the present research
   rules out the possibility that crisis exposure affects attitudes in a
   specific way, depending on the expected mobility valence. While
   replicating previous evidence supporting the negative democratic effect
   of adverse economic changes, the current research sheds light on the
   critical role that the future perspective plays in determining this
   effect.},

Abstract = {The recent reform of the General Court of the European Union by the 2015
   regulation / 2422 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16
   November 2015 is worthy of special attention. It is likely to be
   criticized from various points of view: at least for the way in which
   led reform, financial cost, and finally the impression that reform did
   not come truly to achieve their goals. This article explains the scope
   of reform and various criticisms that can be performed to it.},

Journal = {PARTECIPAZIONE E CONFLITTO},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {10},
Number = {1, SI},
Pages = {221-245},
Abstract = {This paper questions the contribution of social innovation to the
   capacity of disadvantaged communities to resist the effects of the 2008
   financial crisis and its social repercussions. It does so on the basis
   of a study on the dynamics of urban segregation and social innovation in
   the context of the crisis in Catalonia (Spain). The study adopts a
   multi-method approach that combines statistical analysis of urban
   segregation dynamics in the 2001-2012 period; the mapping of social
   innovation practices across the region; and a cross-case comparison of
   six case studies. The paper highlights the structural and metropolitan
   character of urban segregation in the region, which has been
   significantly aggravated both by the crisis and the residential
   transformation that occurred during the years of the housing bubble. It
   also shows that social innovation practices are distributed very
   unevenly in spatial terms, being concentrated in middle-income areas
   with a tradition of social mobilisation. In summary, the paper states
   the limits of social innovation as a driver for socio-spatial cohesion
   in cities and stresses the need for stronger (redistributive) public
   policies.},

Journal = {POLITY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {49},
Number = {1},
Pages = {69-99},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {It is well known that tax compliance is low in Italy, and lower in the
   South than in the North. Many scholars have examined Italian taxpayer
   behavior, mainly using experiments and surveys. However, little
   attention has been given to the historical circumstances that have
   shaped divergent taxpayer behavior by Northern and Southern Italians.
   This article uses historical data from Italian unification through the
   Second Republic to assess the effects of Italy's major formal
   institutions (the church, state, and political parties) and informal
   institutions (clientelism) on Italian tax behavior. It argues that
   nineteenth-century unification had significant repercussions on the two
   most important institutions in Italy the Catholic Church and the state
   and hence led to two different kinds of clientelism. Since Southern
   clientelism favored private interests and Northern clientelism led to
   the construction of public institutions, this created two different tax
   compliance environments.},

Abstract = {The US has prolonged its stay in Afghanistan with the security situation
   remaining far from improving. The indefatigable demand for resources to
   maintain counter-insurgency operations was a major debate in 2016 US
   Presidential elections with a demand for an earlier withdrawal from
   America's trillion dollars plus war effort. Russians having sensed the
   weakening of the US influence warmed upto the idea of new Afghan
   situation involving Taliban and their masters, the Pakistan army. Russia
   had experienced vulnerabilities of Islamisation in Central Asia and
   Caucasus, and the ISIS brand radicalisation added to the fear of
   political destabilisation of Central Asian states. The Islamic State
   showed up in Afghanistan and Pakistan as ISIS-Khorasan branch. Russia
   needed Pakistan as an ally to fight Daesh's presence on its southern
   periphery. However, there remained many intertwined security challenges
   that complicate the South Asian geopolitics, especially, the Af-Pak
   region. Russia's Taliban policy might be the hitherto unused leverage
   that it might be using in order to strike balance all along the shatter
   belt.},

Abstract = {How does a policy of reacting to terrorist attacks with restrictions on
   free speech protections affect the likelihood of terrorism in the first
   place? In this article, I develop a dynamic model of an interaction
   between a security agency and a terrorist organization to study the
   dynamic consequences of adopting policies that curtail free speech
   protections and other rights when terror strikes. The article shows that
   in a world in which democratic governments respond to major terrorist
   attacks with restrictions on freedom of expression and other rights and
   liberties, such policies have perverse effects on the pre-attack
   incentives of terrorism prevention/occurrence, which can make a
   terrorist attack more likely. The analysis suggests that a commitment to
   respecting fundamental rights and liberties in times of duress can be
   security-beneficial: if liberal societies were to remain faithful to
   their fundamental values in the aftermath of terrorist attacks, such a
   strategy can decrease the probability of a terrorist attack in the first
   place.},

Abstract = {This paper examines the challenges raised by the practice of direct but
   sporadic observation of activist spaces. Some tangible effects of
   observing intermittently are the difficulty for the researcher to assume
   a role that makes sense in the activist space under scrutiny, or to
   build trust and bonds with the persons surveyed. The recognition of a
   weak socialization in the milieu can trigger a particular emotional
   impact. It is necessary to take this into account, as this emotional
   experience constitutes a source of information about the subject under
   study just like the data obtained from observations and interviews.},

Abstract = {Drawing on the family resemblance between quantum physics and Eastern
   wisdom identified by Niels Bohr, this article brings insights from
   Buddhism and Daoism to the task of enhancing our understanding of the
   significance of Alexander Wendt's argument for a quantum-based social
   science. Five areas of overlap between his argument and Eastern wisdom
   are explored: vitalism and the idea that life goes all the way down; the
   dependence of consciousness on both subjectivity and relationality; the
   ethical significance of language; the notion of changing the past; and
   the importance of leaders. The family resemblances between Wendt's
   perspective and those available in Daoism and Buddhism are remarkable.},

Pages = {379-403},
Abstract = {In this article, we argue that a comparative study of state and
   non-state terrorism that uses the minimal foundationalist definition of
   terrorism as its central analytical framework offers a unique and
   instructive approach for answering the question: ``what is
   terrorism?{''} To date, most recent comparative case study analyses of
   terrorism focus on ideologies, political/governance models,
   structural/contextual enablers, practices, organisational structures,
   and/or the basis of issues such as trust, belonging, and membership. We
   uniquely contribute to the growing literature on comparative terrorism
   studies by comparing and contrasting state and non-state terrorism on
   the basis of strategic communication vis-a-vis the preparation,
   execution, and outcomes of political violence (the ``terrorism attack
   cycle{''}), the instrumentalisation of victims, and fear management. We
   argue that state and non-state terrorism are co-constituting and
   co-enabling phenomena, possibly best conceptualised as two bounded and
   coiled strands of the political violence DNA.},

Title = {GYORGY LUKACS AND STALINISM: A COMPLEX RELATIONSHIP AND ITS RELEVANCE
   FOR THE POLITICS OF THE 21ST CENTURY},

Volume = {5},

Abstract = {One of the arguments that is used frequently by the critics of Gyorgy
   Lukacs is built around the label of Stalinism, a label which obviously
   discredits the Hungarian philosopher in the eyes of those left wing
   sympathizers who are less familiarized with his writings and his
   activity. If for the neoliberal and/or conservative public it's usually
   enough to use the stamp of Marxist to damage the image of an author or
   the ideas he releases, for those who have progressive views, only
   bringing into discussion Stalinism, maybe the most horrible face of the
   left wing totalitarianism, can really be harmful for the target of the
   attack. Therefore, it is easily understandable why well intended
   critics, but also individuals who with clumsiness are trying to hide the
   anti-Semitism which fuels their contempt towards Lukacs, equalize him
   with a doctrine which provoked so many destructions in Central and
   Eastern Europe. But how much truth there really is in this accusations
   which many take for granted?
   My study focuses on some aspects from Lukacs' biography, but the main
   component of the analysis is represented by fragments from books and
   articles written by the philosopher, and also from the interviews that
   he has given. To better understand these texts, I rely on volumes
   dedicated to Lukacs's life and activity. For the clarity and depth of my
   conclusions, I also consult some elements from the writings of an
   important philosopher of the XXth century linked to the Marxist theory,
   Leszek Kolakowski. The main conclusion of my research is that we cannot
   label Lukacs as a fully committed Stalinist.},

Title = {The limits of local citizenship: administrative borders within the
   Italian municipalities},
Journal = {CITIZENSHIP STUDIES},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {21},
Number = {3},
Pages = {327-343},
Abstract = {This article explores residency, a form of municipal membership that
   plays a strategic role in Italy. Residency is a formal status and a
   means to have access to rights. Therefore, it is a sort of local
   citizenship that, at least in part, equalises citizens and non-citizens.
   Due to its strategic role, many local authorities have paid serious
   attention to it recently. Municipalities have illegally tightened the
   requirements provided for by national laws for obtaining the status of
   resident or introduced new requirements. Stressing the different
   mechanisms of exclusion from residency, this article explains that they
   often work as administrative borders. These are bureaucratic barriers
   that, by denying residency, aspire to regulate, symbolically and
   sometimes materially, the composition of the people living within
   municipal territories and to redistribute rights between `deserving' and
   `undeserving' individuals. As such, administrative borders fragment
   individual statuses and provoke an increase in civic stratification.},

Abstract = {Parties in government face a decline in EP elections after experiencing
   a surge in votes to win the national election. This occurs because
   voters are more inclined to give voice to their dissatisfaction with
   current government performance by voting for the opposition or exiting
   because less is at stake in second-order elections. These elections
   negatively affect the electoral fortunes of governing parties as voters
   opt to punish poorly performing national governments in EP elections.
   Meanwhile, greater reliance on the EU issue dimension in vote choice
   models is taken as evidence for the increasing Europeanisation of EP
   elections. We examine the role of the media in making the EU issue
   dimension salient in such a way that government parties may benefit
   electorally from this increased saliency. To examine whether visibility
   of government party actors in media coverage increases loyalty for the
   governing parties either directly or via priming the EU issues for
   voters, we combine survey data from the 2009 European Election Studies
   with data on news coverage of those elections that links the governing
   party to the EU issue. We show that where the government is visible in
   EU news coverage, EU issue voting tends to increase loyalty while
   decreasing the probability to vote for the opposition and thus improves
   the electoral prospects for governing parties. This is even more the
   case if the issue is primed by negative campaign coverage.},

Abstract = {This article discusses the protection children subjected to
   honour-related violence are entitled to under international human rights
   law. The issue is examined from the perspective of the practical and
   effective implementation of the right to physical and psychological
   integrity. In ensuring this right, relevant authorities must take the
   child's right to family life into consideration, which may require
   specific measures to ensure a safe home environment in the long term. In
   cases of honour-related violence, this arguably entails addressing
   attitudes of family members that uphold violence, notably attitudes
   towards what is considered acceptable social behaviour for girls and
   boys and how the family can uphold its honour without resorting to
   violence. An obligation to support parents in such a manner can be held
   to exist under the Convention on the Rights of the Child, but has not
   yet been advanced by the European Court of Human Rights.},

Journal = {CITIZENSHIP STUDIES},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {21},
Number = {4, SI},
Pages = {393-408},
Abstract = {In the prolonged aftermath of the economic crisis, urban citizenship is
   becoming nuanced with a multifarious array of quotidian grassroots
   organisational forms, aiming at re-appropriating essential right to the
   city, such as housing. In the case of the Italian capital city, Rome,
   squatting has become a widespread practice for both native and migrant
   dwellers for tackling with conditions of severe housing deprivation and
   lack of public housing, despite the punitive legislative context. This
   paper contends that their subjective composition, and the forms of
   organisation and life stemming from squatting nowadays, can contribute
   to updating Lefebvre's definition of right to the city, and his critique
   of the citizen as the enfranchised subject for exerting a transformative
   power over the urban environment. In order to ground this argument, I
   will discuss the evidences collected in two big housing occupations
   located in the marginalised borough of Tor Sapienza, Metropoliz and four
   Stelle Occupato.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF POLITICAL POWER},

Volume = {10},
Number = {3},
Pages = {326-341},
Abstract = {The article elaborates an account of exploitation in romantic love
   relationships. As a starting point, I borrow Vrousalis' analytical
   Marxist definition of economic exploitation under capitalism. Second, I
   briefly discuss Federici's conception of capitalist exploitation of
   women's labour in the family and in the romantic couple. I introduce and
   discuss, then, Jonasdottir's theory of `love power', which currently
   counts as the most elaborated critique of exploitation affecting sexual
   love. I proceed to sketch out my own account, according to which love
   power is not extracted or appropriated, as Jonasdottir puts it, but
   rather suffocated as result of what I call `romantic exploitation'. In
   this view, lovers' positions of vulnerability and power over, that may
   give rise to exploitation, are brought about by an intersection of norms
   defining and regulating notions of romance, gender, race, labour, etc.},

Journal = {CONTEMPORARY POLITICS},

Pages = {369-387},
Abstract = {By negotiating Free Trade Agreements the EU aspires both to increase the
   competitiveness of its industry and contribute to sustainable
   development in the partner country. It pursues a flexible approach to
   norm promotion which aims at supporting developing countries in their
   attempt to adjust to international standards. Ideational and
   institutionalist scholars interpreted this approach as a manifestation
   of its normative power. We show that in the negotiations with Singapore
   and Vietnam the positions of the EU were not consistent with its
   declared goals, since they put stronger pressures upon Vietnam to adjust
   to regulatory standards. We explain this lack of consistency as the
   result of different patterns of interest group mobilization in the two
   negotiations. Those patterns, in turn, depend upon the bargaining power
   the EU has with single trade partners, competition between the EU and
   third countries, especially the US, and the structure of the economy of
   the trade partners.},

Volume = {29},
Number = {2},
Pages = {235-247},
Abstract = {Oscar Larsson's sympathetic critique of constructivist institutionalism
   calls for a clarification of my understanding of subjectivity,
   inter-subjectivity, and their mutual interdependence. That
   interdependence lies at the heart of any genuinely constructivist
   approach, just as the interdependence of structure and agency lies at
   the heart of any genuinely institutionalist approach. As such, I reject
   the charge of subjectivism just as I would that of voluntarism. Building
   on the social ontology of Berger and Luckmann, we can distinguish
   between subjectivity and intra-subjectivity and proceed to show how the
   latter implies a notion of inter-subjectivity. An example of the social
   construction of a political crisis shows that social facts are made and
   remade through a fusion of inter- and intra-subjectivities.},

   purpose, we focus on some strategies with much communicative potential
   concerned with text construction itself, as well as with how the
   external world is built textually, and how the speakers' inner world is
   articulated. Thus we scrutinise argument fallacies and conceptual
   metaphors, and explore how facial expressions may complement, be in
   accordance with or clash with encoded meanings. The comparison shows
   differences regarding sincerity, assertiveness and the degree of
   optimism evidenced in the country's portrayal, which can be explained
   based on ideology and position in politics.},

Title = {Great expectations: the effect of democratic ideals on political trust
   in European democracies},
Journal = {CONTEMPORARY POLITICS},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {23},
Number = {2},
Pages = {214-230},
Abstract = {While in the older literature, low levels of political trust were
   routinely interpreted as a lack of support for democracy, more recently
   authors have claimed that the value pattern of critical citizens is a
   hallmark for a mature and stable democratic system. In this paper we
   assess the empirical validity of this claim, by relying on the relative
   deprivation literature highlighting the relation between expectation and
   frustration. The 2012 wave of the European Social Survey included an
   extensive battery measuring democratic ideals, and using latent class
   analysis we identify a group with high ideals on how a democracy should
   function. Multilevel regression analysis shows that strong democratic
   ideals are associated with lower levels of political trust, and most
   strongly so in countries with low quality of government. We close with
   observations on how rising democratic ideals could be a cause for the
   occurrence of a new group of critical citizens'.},

Abstract = {Wracked by crime and violence, Bogota, Colombia adopted a unique urban
   security policy in 1998 called Mission Bogota (MB). MB identifies the
   poor as at risk' of being violent. The program seeks to decrease crime
   by employing the poor and educating them on entrepreneurial urban
   citizenship, fomenting their sense of belonging to the city, a good work
   ethic, conflict resolution skills, and cosmopolitanism. Participants are
   then employed as citizen guides,' modeling their citizenship skills in
   public in order to instill exemplary citizenship in others by example.
   There is no evidence that MB reduces either crime or poverty.
   Nevertheless, the program establishes norms for ideal citizenship and
   structures the relationship between state and society. Based on one year
   of ethnographic research, I argue that MB uses pedagogy as a technology
   of governance to transfer responsibility for security provision from the
   state to society by making citizens responsible for their own security
   provision.},

Abstract = {While parties in many new democracies frequently split, merge, change
   labels, and make and break electoral alliances, comparative systematic
   research on how these changes are related to each other is limited. This
   study addresses this gap by conceptualizing change as a result of
   intra-party conflicts, conflicts in or consolidation of existing
   electoral alliances, and the formation of new alliances and mergers. We
   develop measures for each type of change using an original dataset that
   covers almost 800 party-electoral term dyads in 11 countries in Central
   and Eastern Europe in the period between 1990 and 2015. Our findings
   contradict the idea of party change as a uni-dimensional phenomenon.
   Instead we find that exits from existing electoral alliances, their
   consolidation through mergers, and the formation of new alliances and
   mergers are moderately related to each other, but not with intra-party
   splits. Our findings suggest that parties and their alliances structure
   political competition in Central and Eastern Europe relatively well.
   Moreover, negative consequences of party change on representation and
   accountability are limited, as under the relative absence of multiple
   and nearly simultaneous changes in party identity the electorate should
   be able to follow party evolution.},

Abstract = {The culture of consumption involves positioning a subject in front of
   other people by means of things. Things have symbolic significance and
   act as a form of underlining the social status of its owner. Fashion,
   advertising and branding point to a symbolic status. Consumer culture is
   fundamentally apolitical. Its wide operation depoliticised mass
   consciousness that can be beneficial to political elites. Consumers are
   particularly interested personal problems. They tend not to mobilize
   against the political course, they are not characterized by the pursuit
   of any political projects. In a capitalist society infrastructure of
   consumerism manifests the ability to absorb anticonsumer discourse so
   that it serves purposes of capitalism. Fashion is usually not very
   anticonsumer culture, and its entourage. In the process of absorption
   anticonsumer ideological content in it neutralizes substantive depth and
   radical, and what remains is the shell, which is not opposed to capital,
   and used them for the sake of maximizing profits. Revolutionary
   characters turn into fashion items and lose their revolutionary
   potential. The author cites a number of examples of this trend from the
   sphere of advertising, cinema and politics. Capitalism, by absorbing
   anticapitalist ideological content, finds new areas to maximize profits.
   It reinforces consumer culture and the depoliticization of the mass
   consciousness, the tendency to reduce of interest of the people of the
   world to the fashionable gadgets, and branded goods.},

Abstract = {Early research on new social movements suggested that they form a new
   set of internal politics in Western democracies (Muller-Rommel 1985).
   Aft er more than three decades aft er these predictions have been
   formulated it is time to assess these assumptions. In this article I
   focus on the environmental movement as one important member of the
   family of new social movements and its impact on the environmental
   positions of governments, on the one hand, and on substantial changes in
   environmental performance, on the other. The results of this study
   confirms the research of three decades ago which suggested that these
   movements may have a profound effect on the political system as well as
   new politics issues. However, the paper also shows that over the course
   of time the green environmental dimension has been incorporated into the
   traditional left-right dimension with significant consequences. First,
   this means that left positions are increasingly associated with
   environmental concerns. Second, the incorporation of green position into
   the left-right dimension shows that the conflict of the green policy
   dimension has been transferred into the left-right dimension. Finally,
   this shift suggests that green politics has lost momentum in the new
   millennium and that during the recent economic crisis the left-right
   dimension was less concerned about environmental improvements, leaving
   environmental issues on the back burner. The paper analyzes 21 highly
   industrialized democracies from 1970s to 2012 and applies a new method
   of optimized time lags in order to grasp the political process as a
   sequential process.},

Abstract = {This article takes as its starting point the importance of the
   preliminary ruling as a fundamental instrument of the current
   multi-level European constitutionalism, since it allows for
   strengthening the basic principles of the rule of law at both the State
   level and the EU level (especially legal certainty, responsibility, due
   process of law and optimization of fundamental rights). With such a
   premise, a critical analysis of more than dubious strategies (not always
   apparently guided by good procedural faith) is carried out. Indeed,
   these strategies, by action or omission, breach Article 267 TFEU by
   challenging the fluid articulation of the European legal system (of
   national and supranational provisions) as well as the correct
   distribution of the European judicial power (between national and
   supranational courts) and, as a result, the optimal realization of the
   European system of fundamental rights. Finally, the paper concludes with
   proposals that seek to improve supranational judicial dialogue through a
   true spirit of collaboration supported by a solid training of judges in
   European law, a positive jurisdictional will (inspired by the favor
   libertatis principle), a re-dimension of the obligation to submit the
   preliminary ruling in the cases referred to in Article 267 TFEU and a
   specific discipline of a double preliminary ruling (both before the
   national Constitutional Court and before the Court of Justice).},

Abstract = {Marx's development and deployment of a teleological account of history
   derived, in part, from Hegelian tenets has been central to modern
   notions of progress. This stands in contrast to Rousseau's romanticism,
   which holds that human well-being declines as technology advances. In
   this article, I challenge these two positions through engagement with
   the case of Aboriginal Australian societies. I explore the possibility
   that an appreciation of the intricacies of societies demeaned as
   ``primitive,{''} can lead Marxian and Rousseauian tenets to affirm those
   societies, but for reasons that Marx and Rousseau may not have
   originally appreciated. In light of the cultural or superstructural
   problems caused by modes of production, there may be grounds to
   appreciate the achievements of societies, which have actively rejected
   apparently essential means of progress, such as agriculture.},

   Performance and Satisfaction with Democracy across Europe, 2002-13},
Journal = {GOVERNMENT AND OPPOSITION},

Volume = {52},

Abstract = {While previous research has generally shown that economic performance is
   an important predictor of satisfaction with democracy, differences
   between political systems on the majoritarian-consensual dimension have
   not been as marked as expected. What has been neglected in previous
   studies is how the interaction between economic performance and type of
   power-sharing arrangement co-produce democratic satisfaction. This study
   uses multiple rounds of data from the European Social Survey between
   2002 and 2013 involving 31 countries. The results show that short-term
   changes in economic performance and government fractionalization
   interactively increase or decrease levels of political support. The
   effect of economic performance on satisfaction with democracy becomes
   weaker the more fractionalized a government is. Satisfaction with how
   democracy works in a country remains relatively high in systems with
   fractionalized coalition governments when the economy is performing
   poorly. But when the economy performs extraordinarily well, satisfaction
   with democracy is even higher in countries with a dominant party in
   charge of government power.},

Abstract = {This article is a case study of armed opposition factions in the Central
   Equatoria region within South Sudan's current civil war. Based on
   research in South Sudan and northern Uganda during the spring of 2017,
   the study focuses on the internal organisation, recruitment and funding
   processes, and political ideas of these organisations, engaging with
   recent theories concerning governance and civilians in rebel-controlled
   territories. It argues that rebels and civilians are not separate
   analytical categories, and that the region's new wartime orders are
   embedded in common local knowledge drawn from historical practice.},

Volume = {8},

Abstract = {It is shown that the Arab Spring acted as a trigger for a global wave of
   socio-political destabilization, which significantly exceeded the scale
   of the Arab Spring itself and affected absolutely all world-system
   zones. Only in 2011 the growth of the global number of large-scale
   anti-government demonstrations, riots and political strikes was to a
   high degree (although not entirely) due to their growth in the Arab
   world. In the ensuing years, the Arab countries rather made a negative
   contribution to a very noticeable further increase in the global number
   of large-scale anti-government demonstrations, riots and general strikes
   (the global intensity of all these three important types of
   socio-political destabilization continued to grow despite the decline in
   the Arab world). Thus, for all these three important indicators of
   sociopolitical destabilization, the scale of the global echo of the Arab
   Spring has overshadowed the scale of the Arab Spring itself. Only as
   regards the fourth considered indicator (major terrorist attacks /
   guerrilla warfare) the scale of the global echo for the entire period
   considered did not overshadow the scale of the Arab Spring (and,
   incidentally, ``Winter{''}) - and in 2014-2015 Arab countries continued
   to make a disproportionate contribution to the historically record
   global values of this sad indicator global number of major terrorist
   attacks/guerilla warfare. To conclude, triggered by the Arab Spring, the
   global wave of socio-political destabilization led after 2010 to a very
   signifi cant growth of socio-political instability in absolutely all
   World System zones. However, this global destabilization wave manifested
   itself in different World System zones in different ways and not
   completely synchronously.},

Title = {Legitimizing Private Actors in Global Governance: From Performance to
   Performativity},
Journal = {POLITICS AND GOVERNANCE},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {5},
Number = {1},
Pages = {54-62},
Abstract = {Global governance is frequently criticised because of major legitimacy
   deficits, including lack of public accountability and democratic
   control. Within this context, questions about the legitimacy of
   non-state governance actors, such as non-governmental organizations,
   transnational corporations and private security companies, are neither
   an exception nor a surprise. Many actors have, therefore, turned to the
   measurement of performance, defined as publicly beneficial outcomes, in
   order to gain legitimacy. However, the rise of performance assessments
   as legitimizing practice is not without problems. Taking global security
   and health interventions as examples, this article contends that the
   immaterial, socially constructed and inherently contested nature of such
   public goods presents major obstacles for the assessment of performance
   in terms of observable, measurable and attributable outcomes.
   Performance is therefore frequently replaced by performativity, i.e. a
   focus on the repetitive enactment of specific forms of behaviour and
   capabilities, which are simply equated with the intended results. The
   implications for how global public goods are conceptualized and,
   ultimately, implemented are profound.},

Abstract = {Contemporary just war theory is divided into two broad camps:
   revisionists and traditionalists. Traditionalists seek to provide moral
   foundations for something close to current international law, and in
   particular the laws of armed conflict. Although they propose
   improvements, they do so cautiously. Revisionists argue that
   international law is at best a pragmatic fiction-it lacks deeper moral
   foundations. In this article, I present the contemporary history of
   analytical just war theory, from the origins of contemporary
   traditionalist just war theory in Michael Walzer's work to the
   revisionist critique of Walzer and the subsequent revival of
   traditionalism. I discuss central questions of methodology, as well as
   consider the morality of resorting to war and the morality of conduct in
   war. I show that although the revisionists exposed philosophical
   shortcomings in Walzer's arguments, their radical conclusions should
   prompt us not to reject the broad contemporary consensus, but instead to
   seek better arguments to underpin it.},

Abstract = {In 1997, the Russian historian Yuri Dmitriev discovered a secret mass
   grave dating from 1937/38 near Medvezhegorsk. He has since found and
   identified numerous bodies and published the names of thousands of
   victims of Stalin's terror. Thanks to his efforts, the former killing
   site was transformed into the memorial of Sandarmokh, devoted to the
   memory of each individual victim. Dmitriev's meticulous work is of vital
   importance for Russian society's ability to relate to its own past.
   However, this work has been interrupted by a systematic campaign against
   him: Dmitriev has been held in prison under blatantly false accusations
   since December 2016.},

Volume = {30},

Pages = {55+},
Abstract = {Workers with disabilities are invisible and discriminated against. This
   article examines how labor unions' representatives, in France, mobilize
   the law and the labor court to make this population visible among
   employers and members of unions. First, it shows how labor unions
   started to make the cause of disabled workers visible in their
   mobilization. Then, it examines their mobilization of the law and the
   court and how it varies according to the arenas and goals. Through this
   analysis, the article presents the various framings of disability within
   labor unions, which combine mobilization to protect their members'
   rights and claims for equal opportunity. More broadly, this study
   suggests new ways of analyzing labor unions' mobilization by examining
   the role of the law in making a population visible.},

Title = {Normal Peace: A New Strategic Narrative of Intervention},
Journal = {POLITICS AND GOVERNANCE},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {5},
Number = {3},
Pages = {146-156},
Abstract = {International actors have used multiple discursive frameworks for
   justifying interventions, from human security to the responsibility to
   protect, and, most recently, resilience-building. We argue that the
   language of normalization, hidden behind these narratives of
   interventions, has also contributed to structure the intervention
   landscape, albeit in less obvious and overt ways than other competing
   narratives of intervention. This article disentangles the different
   practices of normalization in order to highlight their ramifications. It
   introduces the concept of normal peace-a new conceptual reference to
   understand interventions undertaken by the international community to
   impose, restore or accept normalcy in turbulent societies. The article
   argues that the optimization of interventions entails selective
   responses to govern risk and adapt to the transitional international
   order. The art of what is politically possible underlines the choice of
   optimal intervention, be that to impose an external order of normalcy,
   restore the previous order of normalcy, or accept the existing order of
   normalcy.},

Abstract = {Since the October Revolution in Russia in 1917, debates on its role as
   well as its advantages and disadvantages have been unceasing. At a time
   when the one-hundredth anniversary of the October Revolution is
   approaching, it is necessary to sum up its experience, review the
   development of world socialism, and learn from the collapse of the
   former Soviet Union, which is of great significance to the promotion of
   China's sustainable development, the implementation of the government's
   harmonious development strategies, the enforcement of strict party
   disciplines, and the realization of China's all round prosperity. The
   October Revolution was firmly based on theory; the October Revolution
   created a powerful former Soviet Union which developed rapidly; the
   reflection of Russian people from all walks of life in recent years has
   demonstrated convincingly that the October Revolution was correct. A
   series of facts reveal that the October Revolution ushered in a new
   epoch in world history.},

Abstract = {Revolution is in principle negative, while tradition - including Soviet
   tradition - is positive. The parties close to the state - particularly
   the ``president's party{''}, One Russia - share this position and
   re-interpret the Revolution as being a preliminary stage to state
   consolidation. The Russian nationalist LDPR goes one step further and
   represents a monarchist view. The CPRF, which regards itself as the
   protector of the legacy of the revolution, has to perform clever
   manoeuvers in order to attract voters whose world view is shaped by the
   resurgent Orthodox church. Only Yabloko, the liberal party, regards the
   February Revolution as having left a positive legacy that was then
   destroyed by the October Revolution.},

Title = {MODERNIZATION OF TRADITIONAL SOCIETIES: A WAY TO PROSPERITY OR A ROAD TO
   NOWHERE?},
Journal = {POLIS-POLITICHESKIYE ISSLEDOVANIYA},
Year = {2017},
Number = {4},
Pages = {118-137},
Abstract = {Modernization is a process of renovation of traditional societies. It
   has two different modes. The first is the mode of renovation - so-called
   ``modernization in a classical sense{''} - deemed to be connected with a
   deep change in a style of exercise of political power. Political actors
   try to avoid using violence to achieve dominance over other individuals
   and to use mainly law methods as tools for managing social interactions.
   This change became possible due to a relevant replacement of behavior
   patterns in the political class of society. As a result, traditional
   society has been transformed into a modern society. There are a few
   features typical to modern societies: industrial development,
   urbanization, secularization, rationalism, decreasing rates of birth and
   death, total literacy and culture revolution. These features have been
   naturally caused by a change of political institutions. The second mode
   of renovation is so-called ``modernization that is bypassing the
   Modern{''}. In these cases, political class tried to give some features
   of a modern society to a traditional one artificially, without any
   change in a style of exercise of political power and in its behavior
   patterns. As a result, social hybrids were born, which are a virtual
   blend of new and ancient features. We argue that the second mode of
   modernization has no future due to the fact that traditional societies
   are closed and rigid; they have no room for evolutional searching of new
   approach to managing of social life. In the absence of a source of new
   knowledge, they are bound to become obsolete.},

   on identity patterns within clusters of countries. It uses different
   quantitative techniques and the European Values Study 2008 data release.
   First, clusters of countries are formed using identity variables. Next,
   country-level variables dealing with economic performance, politics,
   history and ethnic-cultural traits are operationalized and tested
   through categorical regression and discriminant analysis. Results
   confirm that there are clusters of countries with particular
   configurations of identity patterns and that country-level variables
   influence identity.},

Abstract = {Recent years have seen significant interest among scholars of
   International Relations (IR) in ideological analysis. By treating
   international theories as international ideologies, this trend entails
   both a radical reconceptualization of IR's disciplinary foundations as
   well as the emergence of important new lines of inquiry for scholars of
   ideology. And yet, as a research programme, ideological analysis in IR
   has failed to establish a significant foothold in the discipline. This
   article locates the source of this weakness in the fractious nature of
   IR as a discipline, which has contributed to the emergence of five
   distinct paradigms of ideological analysis: analytical, historical,
   philosophical, critical and reflexive. Reviewing these five distinct
   bodies of scholarship, this article demonstrates that ideological
   analysis is `alive and well' in IR, but argues that greater engagement
   between divergent paradigms will be required in order to fully
   understand the complexities of international ideologies.},

Abstract = {Cambodian leaders have confounded the efforts of the international
   community to promote rule of law. Over the past decade the Cambodian
   government has introduced a series of legal reforms and overseen an
   increase in the use of legal proceedings including defamation lawsuits
   against opposition politicians and members of civil society. These
   reforms and practices, as well as the role of the judiciary in relation
   to each, may be better understood through elite perceptions of the rule
   of law in Cambodia. Comprehending the rule of law as it is understood by
   the ruling elites offers better insight into the trajectory of legal
   development and the obstacles to Western ideals for legal reform. This
   article situates Cambodia within the context of illiberal democracy and
   examines how a thin rule of law has evolved, focusing on defamation law
   as a legal and political strategy of control. While the international
   community has pressed Cambodia to carry out liberal legal reforms for
   some time, the article will outline the obstacles facing reformers and
   the competing desires of Cambodian leaders embedded in the patronage
   based political order.},

Journal = {DEMOCRATIZATION},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {24},
Number = {6},
Pages = {929-950},
Abstract = {Which political parties grow more or less statically nationalized in the
   immediate aftermath of a democratic transition? What accounts for these
   changes? This is the first broadly cross-national analysis of this
   dimension of stabilization of the democratic regime. It uses a sample of
   64 moderate and large political parties from 19 countries in South
   Europe and Latin America. In the first stage of the analysis, I use
   growth curve models on panels of district-level, lower house, election
   results to test each party for changes in static nationalization.
   Results show that 41\% of the cases grow more nationalized, about 22\%
   grow less nationalized, and the rest show no evidence of change. Then, I
   test explanations of increasing static nationalization derived from (a)
   the competitive context; (b) the institutional context; and (c) the
   social structural context. I find that parties become more nationalized
   when (a) they are jointly programmatic and in government, and the party
   system is less fragmented; (b) the political system is centralized and a
   presidential election is concurrent; and (c) society is less ethnically
   fragmented. Finally, I confirm that more statically nationalized parties
   are associated with a higher quality of democracy.},

Abstract = {Guatemala's political system has been shaken by corruption scandals over
   the past two years. In large part, the country's political system has
   been consumed by efforts to fight impunity for corruption and human
   rights abuses. In 2015 voters elected Jimmy Morales to the presidency on
   an anti-corruption platform, hopeful for change from a political
   outsider. Throughout 2016 some advances were achieved in the fight
   against corruption, and prosecutors won several high-profile convictions
   for human rights violations that occurred during the country's civil
   war. But organized criminal networks continued to operate in the
   country, posing serious challenges to the rule of law, and both the
   Morales administration and the new Congress displayed some of the same
   shortcomings as previous governments.},

Abstract = {The gradual abandoning of the `socialism in one country' doctrine during
   the post-war period and the intensive transformation of European social
   democracy in the 1990s pushed social democratic politicians and
   intellectuals into the front line of advocates of a unified and powerful
   Europe. They contributed to the inclusion of social democratic and
   environmentalist values in the EU's official narrative. The success of
   European integration and George W. Bush's presidency created the
   narrative of the Promethean role of Europe. Scholars with a social
   democratic or environmentalist background created this narrative and it
   was also shaped by authors' national contexts.},

Abstract = {The present work presents the data of the project of research of thesis
   doctoral entitled: ``Social memory and geography of women in Rio de
   Contas-Brazil: the female participation in the process of the
   construction of a society{''}, that sought to perform an scientific
   analysis based in a theoretical vision of memory as a media for the
   reconstruction of the memory of women. The empirically study it is
   realized based on testimonies and documents from a social geography
   point of view, specifically from the standpoint of human geography
   centered in space as a category of analysis of social and geographical
   science. The research focuses on public space and the private space of
   Rio de Contas, small town in the State of Bahia in Brazil, including
   three communities of this municipality, analyzing the relationships and
   the social practice of women in the family, at work and in social space.
   The research and the analysis start from a epistemological vision of
   critical theory of knowledge, that brings the bases for understand the
   appropriation of the historical and social context that contributes to
   the origin to knowledge of women and the (re) construction of memories
   of women workers of metal, women communist, female speakers and
   educators that remained during centuries invisible for the official
   history. As result of the work it can be underline that the social
   memory of Rio de Contas and their communities, contrary to the defended
   for a long time by most of the feminist theoreticians, that these women
   developed, in part, male activities and they had a important social
   paper that has been a reference for the society in the economic, social
   and political aspects.},

Abstract = {The 2014 European Parliament (EP) election in Germany was marked by the
   success of the Alternative fur Deutschland (AfD), a new eurosceptic
   party that gained 7 percent of the vote. The party had been founded in
   protest against the government's euro policies, calling for the end of
   the common currency. Its electoral performance might thus be attributed
   to critical views of the European Union (EU) in Germany. However, the
   AfD also advocated stricter immigration policies. Moreover, its success
   might have been at least partly due to voters' desire to signal
   government disenchantment. While AfD supporters were indeed strongly
   opposed to immigration and critical of the political establishment and
   the government, analyses of survey data reveal that it was in fact
   euroscepticism that drove their vote choice.},

Abstract = {In light of increasing globalization and denationalization, the
   organization of the world into nation-states is more and more
   questioned. This article contributes to this debate by developing a
   novel and normatively relevant concept of statehood that conceives of
   states as bearers of second order responsibilities. According to this
   conceptualization, states have two types of second order
   responsibilities that arise from their monopoly of authority and their
   role as public actors: A meta-responsibility to create a fair and
   effective societal system of first order responsibilities and ultimate
   accountability for incomplete, unjust or ineffective first order
   systems. The paper develops this account through detailed discussions},

Title = {BETWEEN THE STATE AND THE NATION: DILEMMAS OF IDENTITY POLITICS IN
   POST-SOVIET SOCIETIES},
Journal = {POLIS-POLITICHESKIYE ISSLEDOVANIYA},
Year = {2017},
Number = {5},
Pages = {54-78},
Abstract = {Two closely related but essentially divergent political projects coexist
   on the post-Soviet states current political agenda: the formation of a
   modern civic nation and the consolidation of state institutions and
   national (nation-state) identity. The search for effective instruments
   to bridge the deep social and ethno-cultural cleavages their societies
   confront while promoting these projects brings identity issues to the
   forefront of political discourse. The article presents the results of a
   comparative analysis of identity politics strategies and practices
   pursued by political elites in three post-Soviet republics - Kazakhstan,
   Armenia and Belarus - cases that demonstrate a diversity of ethnic and
   cultural composition and of social and economic development resources.
   The research is based on in-depth interviews taken in research and
   expert institutions in these countries and is preceded by a critical
   overview of the concepts of the nation and nation-building in the
   post-Soviet context. The authors argue that there is a consistent
   divergence in the trajectories of the state and nation-building
   projects, and demonstrate that the potential of civic identity is often
   used to different ends in political and intellectual discourses. The
   political elites give a clear priority to the state-building agenda,
   while identity politics promoted by the state focus on the
   legitimization of the existing political regimes. An assessment of the
   prospects in post-Soviet societies for nation-building questions the
   universal appraisal of the ``nation state{''} project in a transforming
   world order.},

Title = {IN SEARCH FOR TRANSREGIONAL ALTERNATIVES IN EURASIA: THE PHENOMENON OF
   MIKTA},
Journal = {SRAVNITELNAYA POLITIKA-COMPARATIVE POLITICS},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {8},
Number = {4},
Pages = {127-144},
Abstract = {The papers analyses new integration initiative of the middle powers
   namely MIKTA (Mexico, Indonesia, South Korea, Turkey, Australia) against
   the background of evolution of trans-regional integration processes in
   Asia and Europe. The phenomenon of MIKTA is analyzed in comparison with
   other most successful trans-regional integration projects like G20,
   BRICS and IBSA (Dialogue forum of India, Brazil and South Africa). MIKTA
   represents a very interesting pattern of middle powers' aspiration to
   create multilateral international institutions which they can use to
   produce much stronger influence on the global politics in comparison
   with a simple sum of these countries' individual efforts outside the
   framework of such trans-regional institutions. The key question is how
   trans-regional integration initiatives similar to MIKTA could influence
   political and economic processes on the regional and macro-regional
   levels and whether it is possible to speak about new format of
   trans-regional integration models. Unlike other integration projects of
   middle powers MIKTA is not a formal association of different countries
   according to some common features (like N-11 or the Next Eleven Group or
   MIST/MIKT). On the contrary MIKTA represents a joint voluntary
   initiative for creation of multilateral trans-regional institution
   fostering financial, economic, political and diplomatic cooperation. For
   South Korea MIKTA should have become a mechanism for increasing its
   influence in the international organizations, Indonesia expected MIKTA
   to make it stronger politically and diplomatically in the world affairs,
   both Turkey and Mexico wanted MIKTA to perform an instrument for solving
   their economic problems (increase international trade volume, attract
   foreign investments etc.). Special political, diplomatic, trade and
   economical potential of MIKTA is based on the fact that its member
   countries claim to play a role of regional pivots which are located as
   bridges among various continents and geographies like Turkey (between
   Europe and Asia) and Mexico (between North and South America) or serve
   as a sort of a portal for the West to the region of Southeast Asia,
   specifically to its Muslim populated part, (Indonesia) and Asia-Pacific
   (Australia).},

Abstract = {Since the 1960s, the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) has
   implemented an extensive governance project in Lebanon that is often
   regarded as contributing to the weakness of the Lebanese state.
   Challenging such zero-sum logic, this article explores the institutional
   interdependencies between the PLO and the Lebanese state and their
   different yet mutual interests in governance coordination. It
   conceptualises the relations between the PLO and the Lebanese state
   along a continuum of mediated stateness and thereby contributes to both
   the operationalisation of the notion of the mediated state and our
   understanding of the diverse empirical manifestations of the PLO's
   governance in Lebanon.},

Abstract = {Why has the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) proved so
   durable as a regional organisation given the many challenges it has
   faced since its inception in 1967? This analysis makes use of an
   historical institutionalist approach. It shows how the global political
   economy, through the injection of aid and investment and the development
   of production networks and increased trade, generated a generally
   positive regional economic environment that encouraged cooperation. It
   also provided the resources for the gradual institutionalisation of
   ASEAN and the expansion of its reach through the establishment of
   associated regional organisations. The result was that these factors, in
   combination, contributed to ASEAN's staying power.},

Abstract = {Social capital is considered to be crucial for democratic politics. Its
   benevolent consequences can be attributed to two substantively different
   modes of social capital. Understood as an individual property the impact
   of social capital will be mainly restricted to those who command these
   resources. A much less researched approach depicts social capital as a
   collective good; that is, as a property of distinct societies whose
   impact everybody will feel. The main question of this study is: How do
   these individual and collective modes of social capital influence
   democratic citizenship in Western democracies? Multilevel modeling is
   used to test the impact of the two distinct modes of social capital, as
   well as their interactions using survey data for 28 democracies extended
   with indicators for collective social capital. The analyses show that
   living in a country rich on social capital contributes to democratic
   citizenship beyond the positive effects of individual social capital.
   Moreover, especially environments richer on collective social capital
   activate citizens with high levels of individual social capital are more
   to be politically active than less equipped environments. Apparently,
   those who are already privileged in terms of individual social capital
   will profit most from a social capital rich environment.},

Abstract = {Feelings of commonality are central to the formation of multiracial
   political coalitions. Despite a fairly voluminous literature on where
   these feelings come from, however, relatively little is known about how
   elite messages influence individual-level perceptions of intergroup
   relations. This oversight is surprising given that so-called elite
   opinion theory has become virtually orthodoxy within political science.
   In order to explore the potential for opinion leadership on perceptions
   of commonality, this paper employs a survey experiment embedded in the
   2010 Cooperative Congressional Election Study. Testing hypotheses
   derived from elite opinion theory, this paper finds that no one
   interpretation of elite opinion theory can fully account for perceptions
   of commonality across racial groups. Scholars of race and ethnic
   politics would do well in the future, therefore, to acknowledge the
   complex ways that racial and partisan characteristics condition an
   individual's response to elite messages.},

Abstract = {The crisis places the Law before litmus tests. Precisely, the economic
   and financial crisis can be counted from all points of view as a type of
   story about the existing federal level of tension, which will be
   reflected in the pronouncements of the highest judicial spokesmen, who
   play here a leading role. A clear example of this tension is analyzed in
   this paper, where, having as background the controversy that arose
   between the German Federal Constitutional Court and the Court of Justice
   of the European Union in the thread of analyzing the legitimacy of a
   Programm of the Central Bank of European Union to combat the crisis,
   questions are raised regarding the effectiveness of national
   constitutional checks in times of European crisis.},

   Responsibility},
Journal = {GERMAN POLITICS},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {26},
Number = {4, SI},
Pages = {574-590},
Abstract = {Unification has had a catalytic effect on discursive justifications for
   Germany's involvement in the European Union at two levels: first,
   through the Federal Republic's more exposed leadership role in an
   enlarged EU; and second, through the rise of the Left Party as a
   predominantly East German, but also the first consistently Eurosceptic
   party with parliamentary representation at the federal level.
   Investigating plenary debates in the Bundestag regarding the Lisbon
   Treaty and the management of the Eurozone crisis, the article
   investigates the adaptation of political discourse to these new
   circumstances in the contention between Chancellor Merkel on the one
   hand, and speakers of the Left Party, on the other. While both sides
   refer to two sources of normative justification - the appraisal of
   European integration as a project for prosperity and peace, and the
   norms of the Basic Law as the foundation for Germany's involvement in
   the EU - the main dispute centres on how these justifications must be
   applied to changed external circumstances. It is shown that the
   normative concept of responsibility plays a key role for the way in
   which entrenched norms are used either for the justification or the
   critical contestation of Germany's political leadership in the European
   Union.},

   since many of them opposed the social democracy of the Labour government
   they were indeed unsuitable candidates to publicize it. One critic
   called Orwell a ``collaborator{''}-which meant that he worked with a
   government run by his own Labour Party rather than a foreign Communist
   one. The actual list is attached.},

Title = {An Ideological Critique of Neo-liberalism: A Case Study of Hayek},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL CRITICAL THOUGHT},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {7},
Number = {4},
Pages = {493-506},
Abstract = {Neo-liberalism can be described as the most influential economic-social
   ideological trend in the world today, with Hayek as one of the two
   prominent representatives. He advocates individual liberty, private
   property rights and spontaneous expansion of order, opposes state
   regulation, over-welfare, public ownership, and collectivism, etc. These
   constitute the main contents of his thought. Hayek's idea can be summed
   up as economic ``liberalization,{''} ``privatization,{''} and
   ``marketization{''} based on methodological individualism. No matter
   whether it is from the angles of political stance, philosophical
   methodology, value, or policy, the above-mentioned thought embodies
   super-ideological essence of serving the ``narrow interest{''} and
   ``liberal democracy{''} of the bourgeoisie. This article seeks to pose a
   deep ideological criticism of neo-liberalism represented by Hayek with a
   historical materialism methodology, in order to dispel the ideological
   fog of contemporary neo-liberalism and prevent the errors possible in
   our theory or practice.},

   crime of smuggling goods is one of the most important economic crime
   factors causing irreparable damage to the country's economic system and
   also is seriously threatened social and cultural principles and values
   that govern the society. Other studies have determined the emergence of
   smuggling goods due to multiple factors of economic, social, and
   cultural, which are surveyed in this research as the most important
   effective factors on occurrence of smuggling goods. The aim of this
   research is to focus on economic and cultural factors existing in this
   field. In this study, we will conclude how cultural factors and
   consumption patterns cause the phenomenon of smuggled goods.},

Abstract = {Studies on people with custodial sentences have traditionally excluded
   in the analysis the group of women imprisoned under the argument of
   their limited number. This exclusion has motivated the development of
   the present study that as an objective wants to create a social and
   legal profile of women in one of the Ecuadorian Centers of Social
   Rehabilitation. This will help understand their daily life while in
   prison, which in major cases includes their life with their children.
   The emphasis of this investigation allows to define a diagnose that
   consists with the approaches of the theory of development of criminal
   activity by women. The results allowed to emphasise that the lack of
   education, employment, the destruction of families and the poverty is
   part of the social reality of the majority of women who break the law.
   The adversary effects of the jail sentences transcends prison walls and
   reaches the families of the women who are in prison.},

Volume = {50},
Pages = {142-156},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Volatility is a widely used term in political science, but even the most
   widely used measure of volatility, Pedersen's index, can mask as much as
   it reveals. His simple and elegant calculation has become part of the
   political science toolbox, but scholars employing this tool have tended
   to produce distinctly different results thanks to a series of decisions
   about measurement and classification. Using examples from Central Europe
   the critical role of decisions related to party continuity and threshold
   of inclusion are identified. The article not only unpacks the underlying
   questions addressed by different uses of Pedersen's index, but offers
   standards for choosing particular methods over others and outlines steps
   that should be followed in creating a more accurate measure of
   volatility. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Politicians' dual responsibilities to respect their party and also be
   responsive to their constituents is surprisingly lacking in studies of
   representation. How do politiciansespecially those who function in
   strong-party systemsindividually respond to their constituents'
   preferences? We make use of an original, large-scale survey of
   politicians and the recent success of the Sweden Democrats in the
   elections in Sweden to show that important adaptation takes place within
   the party structure. Individual politicians are responsive to signals
   about voters' preferences, and they act on these signals by internally
   lobbying their party leaders to change the party's positions in the
   direction of their constituents' preferences. These results provide a
   rationale for why niche parties invest in elections even if they are
   unlikely to enter government: Their electoral successes can cause change
   in other parties. The results also add a new angle to the discussion of
   how anti-immigration parties affect mainstream parties, a hotly debated
   issue in many advanced democracies.},

Abstract = {Imposed since 2006, the comprehensive multilateral economic sanctions
   against North Korea appear to have had little effect on the regime's
   pursuance of nuclear programs. Under the increasingly strict measures,
   Pyongyang has been demonstrating ever greater resolves to stick to its
   way of nuclear buildup. This study explores the reasons behind the
   failed economic sanctions from the international community. It argues
   that economic sanctions usually follow a two-step working mechanism,
   which is informed by multiple causal pathways. Accordingly, the
   effectiveness of sanctions is largely subject to the dynamic contexts of
   the target, senders and international community. Considering the causal
   logic from different aspects, this article identifies several obstacles.
   The most important one is that owing to North Korea's political
   structure and history, there is almost no constituency that may respond
   to the sanction pressure; on the contrary, economic sanctions seem to
   only increase domestic resistance against exogenous hostilities. In
   other words, it is not a regime that is likely to yield to coercive
   policies. Therefore, tougher sanctions may only generate pressure, but
   they can hardly change North Korea's nuclear policy.},

Abstract = {Development and new lectures regarding world's current risks compel us
   to reconfigure the role of military institutions and, therefore, their
   purpose regarding intelligence. The transition from modernity to new
   forms that would exceed its postulates, in which societies are summited
   to the logics of market and bureaucracy, as well as the analysis about
   risks and security are not always related to the conditions that could
   be considered a threat to human life, but also to governability,
   economic stability, public opinion, among other problems. From the
   perspective of Anthony Giddens and Ulrich Beck, there will be a
   reflection about the dimensions that must be considered by military
   intelligence of contemporary army forces, adjusted to realities where
   the ``abstract systems{''} dominate and demand the development of a
   strategic intelligence that doesn't constrict itself to cover national
   and territorial sovereignty issues only. In order to achieve this there
   will be an examination of nowadays priorities for the military
   intelligence of Ecuador and the necessity to reinvent itself during the
   transition from a traditional to a global outline, moreover, when they
   have to act in this risk context, with sources that do not adjust to
   this reality, since the scientific-technological capacity and,
   therefore, the intelligence doctrinal conceptions, are not still
   inscribed in the globalizing dynamics.},

Abstract = {Energy relations between Turkey and Russia provide an excellent example
   of how energy and politics interrelate in countries with a historically
   up-and-down relationship. Having started in the 1960s, the two
   countries' energy relations gained a new dimension after 1991 with the
   intensification of pipeline politics. In the 2000s, energy relations
   gained impetus owing to the leadership of Erdogan and Putin, and reached
   an apex with the establishment of a cooperation council in 2010. Since
   2011, Turkey's demands for gas price reduction and volume increase have
   dominated the agenda of the countries' energy talks. While
   Turkish-Russian relations have remained on shaky ground lately, the
   signing of the Turkish Stream agreement in 2016 might be perceived as a
   positive step for closer energy relations.},

Abstract = {In the 1936 case of United States v. Curtiss-Wright Export Corp., the
   U.S. Supreme Court reasoned that the president is the sole organ of
   foreign affairs given implicitly through the commander-in- chief clause.
   With over 10,000 citations (Code of Federal Regulations) and 145
   Curtiss-Wright references by attorney generals and the Department of
   Justice justifying presidential prerogatives, the imperial president is
   enshrined in law. Even with recent challenges, the Court remains
   steadfast to unilateral executive decision making. However, few studies
   identify when the executive branch first adopts the Court's newly
   constituted constitutional order, and few provide a systematic analysis
   of how presidents advance the sole-organ doctrine. Building on this
   scholarship I show that President Truman's cohesive narrative of
   asserted unilateral powers redirects development for future executives
   to claim unfettered discretion.},

Abstract = {The political culture of the Gujarat Congress has been traditionally
   characterized by a conservative overtone that contrasted with the
   progressive ethos of party units of other provinces. This specificity
   comes not only from the Gujarati asmita, but also from the attitude of
   Mahatma Gandhi who did not fully support progressive elements, such as
   Indulal Yagnik, against more conservative leaders, including Vallabhbhai
   Patel, K.M. Munshi, G. Nanda and M. Desai. These leaders, whoall of
   themeventually exerted power in New Delhi, had affinities with the Sangh
   parivar, a phenomenon suggesting a unique, regional porosity between the
   Congress and the Hindutva forces.},

Abstract = {Given the finding that the marginalized are less politically engaged, we
   examine those who are arguably the most marginalized-the
   undocumented-and ask: what underwrites recent cases where the
   undocumented have been politically engaged in meaningful and substantive
   ways? Additionally, how does this compare with the existing literature
   on the practice of citizenship for those with formal rights? And what
   are the implications for our understanding of political participation in
   the contemporary USA? We seek to address these questions by examining
   cases where undocumented immigrants act like citizens even though they
   lack formal political rights. Our cases deviate from previous literature
   which argues that more marginalized people participate less and that
   those without formal rights engage in contentious politics in lieu of
   ``normal{''} institutional politics. Our analysis of the DREAMers and of
   immigrant worker centers helps us rethink this traditional distinction
   between ``normal{''} and contentious politics. Moving beyond a focus on
   the specific actions that fall into each category, we instead emphasize
   how the context for these actions is crucial to understanding the
   foundations of political participation. In particular, we argue that the
   same ``normal{''} political actions taken by citizens versus noncitizens
   reveals different foundations underneath; for those without formal
   rights, what underwrites participation in ``normal{''} and contentious
   politics alike is what we call grassroots citizenship. We examine how
   the political participation of undocumented workers and DREAMers takes
   place within immigrant organizations and how it relies on three pillars:
   solidarity, critical analysis, and collective action. While previous
   literature has emphasized the urban and local nature of active,
   alternative citizenships, our cases operate at multiple scales,
   demonstrating how grassroot citizenship can be leveraged and ``scaled
   up{''} to state and national levels. Additionally, through an analysis
   of grassroots citizenship, we get some purchase on the question of why
   politicians sometimes listen to people who cannot vote.},

Abstract = {Despite the growing literature on polarization, students of comparative
   politics have not yet been able to reach much assured understanding of
   how party polarization influences voter turnout in multiparty settings,
   which often put on offer both centrist, and divergent mainstream and
   niche party policies. I evaluate how politically sophisticated and
   unsophisticated citizens with different ideological preferences respond
   to high and increasing party polarization by employing individual- and
   party system-level data from 17 European multiparty democracies. I
   hypothesize that high levels of actual and perceived party polarization
   increase voter turnout, and policy seeking, sophisticated citizens are
   more likely to turn out when polarization in party policy offerings in
   the short run increases their utility from voting. The empirical
   analyses show that high party polarization increases both politically
   sophisticated and unsophisticated citizens' propensities to turn out.
   However, such positive effect for the most part comes from the between-
   and within-party systems differences in actual party polarization,
   rather than how individual citizens perceive that. The implications of
   these findings with respect to strategic position taking incentives of
   political parties and the effects of the knowledge gap between
   sophisticated and unsophisticated citizens on political participation
   and democratic representation are discussed in the concluding section.},

Abstract = {This paper will discuss the changing role of the military in criminal
   activity during the Reform Era which was affected by strict regulations,
   the supervision of institutions and the government's commitment to meet
   the welfare of the soldiers, with criminal activities referring to
   activities such as illegal economic activities, extortion, as well as
   drug and human trafficking. This paper will also analyze the ongoing
   criminal activity in the military, which mostly originates from personal
   interest rather than in the interest of the institution. This paper also
   describes the competition between military and police increasing
   criminal activities in order to seize illegal financial income
   potential. This paper will also analyze the methods of Post-Suharto
   military involvement in criminal activities.},

Abstract = {This article provides context for the recent round of Cyprus
   negotiations by giving a historical overview of the Cyprus problem - the
   political landscape after the Turkish invasion in 1974, EU involvement,
   the UN initiatives, and the rejection of the Annan Plan. The author
   argues that the current negotiations are unlikely to lead to a
   comprehensive agreement in 2017 as there are still some major stumbling
   blocks. Furthermore, he notes that consociational federal models based
   on ethnonationalist pillars lead, more often than not, to tensions,
   frustration, and even conflict. Consequently, the author suggests that
   an evolutionary approach may create some mutual benefits and also build
   trust; this will facilitate a comprehensive settlement utilizing an
   integrationalist federal model which will encourage common objectives.
   Such an outcome will serve multiple interests.},

Abstract = {Vigilante justice challenges the state's monopoly over the use of
   violence and as such has come to the attention of a growing body of
   political scholars. However, still little is known about the
   circumstances that foster support for citizens circumventing the state
   to confront crime directly. I argue that citizens' perceptions of a
   trusting community, on the one hand, and an untrustworthy law
   enforcement, on the other, jointly influence their support for this kind
   of behavior. I test these hypotheses using a lab-in-the-field experiment
   in Mexico, a case in which the expansion of vigilante organizations has
   posed a serious challenge to the state. I find that participants are
   more supportive of a vigilante action when those considering said action
   are described to be inserted within a trustworthy community.
   Furthermore, I find that this effect is moderated by the described
   trustworthiness of law enforcement. These results contribute to our
   understanding of the emergence of vigilantism, and how trust in
   authorities can moderate the normative expression of social capital.},

Abstract = {Issue congruence between citizens and policy makers should be one of the
   central aspects of a democratic process. This study uses the 2009
   European Election Study to compare the views of citizens and party
   elites on a diverse set of domestic policy issues and overall Left-Right
   identities. We find very high levels of congruence for Left-Right
   positions and socio-economic issues. Parties are less representative of
   their supporters on the newer cultural issues of immigration and
   authority, as well as gender issues. National political contexts have
   limited influence on congruence levels, although some party
   characteristics such as political extremism or party family are linked
   to citizen-voter agreement. On the whole, citizens and like-minded
   parties do connect through the electoral process to a high degree.
   However, the results also argue for a multidimensional approach to
   assessing representation to recognize where parties agree and deviate
   from their supporters.},

Abstract = {The trial and execution of Louis XVI served as a founding act of French
   republican democracy. It was also a scene of irregular justice: no legal
   warrants or procedural precedents existed for bringing a king to justice
   before the law. This essay describes how Jacobins crafted a new language
   of popular agency to overcome that obstaclethe language of redemptive
   violence. Although redemptive violence had roots in prerevolutionary
   notions of penal justice and social cohesion, its philosophical
   ambitions were revolutionary and modern. Analyzing that language
   illuminates how republican democracy weaponized a distinctive ideology
   of extralegal violence at its origins. It also helps explain redemptive
   violence's enduring appeal during and after the French Revolution.},

   this new regulatory and political landscape is that it creates scope for
   new form of democratic deficit to arise from the absence of effective
   accountability of EU economic and fiscal governance as well as
   undermining the Treaty principle of solidarity between Member States.},

Abstract = {The American lobbying information processing system is woefully
   outdated. The mechanisms by which citizen, interest group, and business
   concerns are incorporated into the policymaking process have largely not
   been updated in over 200 years. Lobbyists set up meetings with staffers
   and members of Congress and share position papers with them about their
   arguments on a given policy issue. There is no central location where
   staffers can find out who is lobbying on a given bill and what they are
   arguing. In this paper, we make the case for a new information
   processing system that would provide Congress with a more efficient and
   effective way to manage the information flooding the Hill, and which
   would ensure more transparency about who is lobbying on any given bill
   and what they are saying. If used effectively by Congress, watchdog
   groups, and journalists, this system could result in better
   representation for a more diverse group of citizens.},

Abstract = {The institution of citizen suits is a decentralized form of public
   participation that allows citizens to influence the implementation of
   public laws in courts. How does this institution influence policymaking?
   This article proposes a model of citizen suits. It then analyzes how
   this institution influences legislative decisions. The legislature
   bargains to choose the budget, distributive spending, and spending on an
   ideologically contested public good (e.g., health care or environmental
   protection). I find that citizen suits enable courts to forge a
   compromise between opponents and proponents of the public good by
   responding to the diverse claims of citizens. Anticipating the
   mobilization of citizens in courts, legislators in turn craft more
   socially efficient bills, with less distributive spending, which better
   represent the distribution of preferences for the public good compared
   to when citizens have no role in the implementation of legislation.},

Abstract = {This article explores the contentious and dynamic relationship between
   Woodrow Wilson and a nascent, diverse civil rights movement from 1912 to
   1919. The pivotal relationship between Wilson and the early civil rights
   movement emerged out of two concurrent and related political
   developments: the increasing centrality of presidential administration
   in the constitutional order and the growing national aspirations of
   political strategies and goals among reform activists. Not only do we
   illustrate an early form of social movement politics that was largely
   antithetical to the administration's objectives, but we also trace how
   the strategies adopted by civil rights leaders were contingent on an
   early, still-to-be institutionalized administrative presidency. We
   highlight Wilson's involvement in the racial unrest that emerged from
   the debut of the film The Birth of a Nation and in the race riots that
   accompanied the Great Migration and World War I in his second term.
   These early twentieth-century episodes legitimized a form of collective
   action and helped to recast the modern presidency as an institution that
   both collaborated and competed with social movement organizations to
   control the timing and conditions of change.},

Abstract = {The clean shipping concept emerged in a bid to make maritime
   transportation green and environmentally friendly. This mandate is being
   accomplished through improved conducts, actions and technology in the
   maritime industry. One of such measures was the creation of the Sulphur
   Emission Control Areas (SECA) in 2005 and 2012 to reduce the rate of
   sulphur emissions from shipping. Sustainable growth-an EU 2020
   priority-is strategically linked to the SECA regulation in that it
   promotes resource efficiency, greener environment and a competitive
   economy.
   Thus, the International Maritime Organisation (IMO) and, as adopted by
   the European Parliament (EP), SECA regulation stipulated that from 2015
   all ships in SECA are under the obligation to use low sulphur marine
   fuel that must not exceed 0.1\% (IMO, 2011). This regulation has incited
   rigorous arguments on the economic disadvantage it would subject
   affected maritime stakeholders who are made to comply with stringent
   regulation their counterparts in non-SECA are not subjected to.
   Two years of 0.1\% sulphur regulations have witnessed many changes in
   the maritime industry and most of the first responses were realised with
   vessels that ply along the Baltic Sea. This work presents an account of
   European maritime industry's approaches towards SECA regulations and the
   stakeholders' thoughts on the economic impact of SECA. This contribution
   brings a clearer picture to the status quo as well as highlighting a
   needed future focus.},

Abstract = {In this reflection, we assess the theoretical faultline running through
   the contested current of Corbynist thought and politics at present. On
   one hand, we find a techno-utopian strand preoccupied with automation
   and the end of work. On the other hand, a nascent politics of social
   reproduction with a foreshortened potential to realise the promise of a
   continental-style solidarity economics in the United Kingdom. Both
   represent the latest in a series of left attempts to confront the crisis
   of social democracy that rages across Europe, a crisis to which the
   British Labour Party has not been alone in succumbing despite recent
   appearances otherwise. Deindustrialisation collapsed labour's role in
   everyday life, and a crisis in the society of work eventually passed
   over into its representative party's electoral decline. Subsequent
   financial crisis and subsequent austerity have only made things worse. A
   poverty of ideas prevails that all sides of social democracy's unsteady
   compromise seek desperately to solve. However, the recent UK General
   Election shows evidence that Corbynism has renewed Labour's fortunes to
   some extent. Surveying the competing intellectual currents behind its
   rise, we suggest that the politics of social reproduction offer a better
   route forward for the Labour Party than the popular siren call of
   postcapitalism, and reflect on what the recent general election result
   suggests for their future development.},

Abstract = {This paper extends understanding of the relationship between media use
   and attitudes toward democratic values. We employ the two-step
   estimation approach to examine the relationship between media use and
   attitudes toward democratic values as well as consequential association
   with political participation. The empirical results show that media use
   to obtain news information is positively related to attitudes toward
   democratic values. The findings also note that attitudes toward
   democratic values are positively associated with engagement in politics.
   The results support the argument that media use is significant for
   shaping citizens' attitudes toward democratic values by providing
   information about public affairs and expanding citizens' understanding
   about democratic politics. As such, media use facilitates democratic
   socialization and leads to more involvement in political behaviors.},

Abstract = {Turkey and Russia developed very close relations throughout the 2000s.
   Yet, their growing differences about the Syrian civil war dragged the
   two countries into a serious crisis on November 24, 2015, when the
   Turkish armed forces shot down a Russian SU-24 fighter jet violating
   Turkey's airspace near the Syrian border. In the following seven months,
   political, economic and cultural links between the two countries were
   almost completely frozen within the framework of Russia's sanctions
   against Turkey. This article aims to discuss the impacts of the fighter
   jet crisis on Turkish-Russian relations. Although Ankara and Moscow
   normalized relations following President Erdogan's letter to President
   Putin in June 2016, it is important to understand the main factors that
   led to the crisis in order to make sound predictions about the future of
   the Turkish-Russian rapprochement process.},

Abstract = {The Council of Ministers rarely records negative individual votes, much
   less rejected proposals. The literature explains this high level of
   support by the Council's culture of consensus' and the few negative
   votes are explained as signalling to the domestic audience. I introduce
   an alternative explanation for ministers' explicit disagreement: during
   the negotiations preceding the final vote, ministers issue veto threats.
   To remain credible in the future, they must be prepared to carry through
   with their threats if their demands are not met. To test this argument,
   I specify domestic level conditions that enable the minister to issue
   credible, strategic threats in the first place. Furthermore, I introduce
   domestic level scrutiny as a proxy for the transparency of EU level
   negotiations. I find that the effect of strategic threats is strong for
   those cases which are not under domestic level scrutiny (low
   transparency). By contrast, I find no effect of strategic threats for
   cases which are under domestic level scrutiny (high transparency).},

Abstract = {Populist politics have become more prominent in Indonesia. On the one
   hand, this is indicated by the presidential elections of 2014, when two
   rival candidates brandished somewhat different nationalist populist
   ideas. On the other hand, historically rooted secular nationalist and
   Islamic-oriented forms of populism have become entangled within elite
   conflicts. The context is discontent about perceived systemic injustices
   unaddressed in nearly two decades of decentralised democracy after a
   prior three decades of centralised authoritarian rule. In the absence of
   liberal and Leftist challenges to the entrenched oligarchy, politics is
   becoming characterised by competition between different populisms. But
   rather than being transformative, these populisms are harnessed to the
   maintenance of oligarchic domination.},

   this threat was transformed into an opportunity. In this article, the
   author argues that Iranian intervention in both countries provided Iran
   with more leverage in the region and the ability to maintain its status
   as a regional power with international reach.},

Abstract = {Political marketing is an inter-disciplinary study. Goods which are
   produced in politics is a power. In marketing, power is presented in
   various classifications (promises) via politician signs (brand/mark) to
   political market. In a political market, the advertisement is considered
   as the basic element due to powerful controls dominating on public media
   is subjected to suspicion. As power realizing needs attention to
   internal funds of human experience, and individuals communicate through
   interchanging signs in harmful relationships, it is necessary to pay
   attention toward creation process and applying signs and meaning in
   every social relationship. The author believes that political marketing
   could result in a better choice merely in an abstract competitive
   market, while when there is no competitive market, marketing techniques
   makes a cheat on people. Therefore, how it is possible to prevent from
   tempting in a non-competitive market? The author believes that rival
   producers can prevent from marketing monopolized through focusing on the
   lifestyle of voters. This hypothesis will be tested in the realized
   sociology framework.},

   Harassment},
Journal = {POLITICAL BEHAVIOR},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {39},

Pages = {629-649},

Abstract = {I conduct an experiment which examines the impact of group norm
   promotion and social sanctioning on racist online harassment. Racist
   online harassment de-mobilizes the minorities it targets, and the open,
   unopposed expression of racism in a public forum can legitimize racist
   viewpoints and prime ethnocentrism. I employ an intervention designed to
   reduce the use of anti-black racist slurs by white men on Twitter. I
   collect a sample of Twitter users who have harassed other users and use
   accounts I control ({''}bots{''}) to sanction the harassers. By varying
   the identity of the bots between in-group (white man) and out-group
   (black man) and by varying the number of Twitter followers each bot has,
   I find that subjects who were sanctioned by a high-follower white male
   significantly reduced their use of a racist slur. This paper extends
   findings from lab experiments to a naturalistic setting using an
   objective, behavioral outcome measure and a continuous 2-month data
   collection period. This represents an advance in the study of prejudiced
   behavior.},

Abstract = {There seems to be a consensus within both Russian and European analytic
   communities as to the ultimate reason behind the dramatic deterioration
   of Russia-EU relations over the last three years. This reason boils down
   to a single word: Ukraine. This essay intends to investigate a
   two-pronged question: 1) how the differing, quasi-imperial natures of
   Russia and the EU make it hard for them to find an accommodation in
   their shared neighborhood and 2) how the recent EU-Russia dynamics
   prompted Moscow's policy elite to re-conceptualize Russia as a distinct
   civilization, apart from Europe. While exploring these issues, the essay
   will maintain a special focus on Ukraine whose role in the Russia-Europe
   relationship has historically been and continues to be pivotal.},

Abstract = {This article presents a conception of imagination that emerges from
   Hannah Arendt's writings on action, judgment, and responsibility.
   Imagination, for Arendt, is central to the processes of action and
   judgment, as it enables political actors and spectators to imagine a new
   world that could look differently from the world that exists.
   Importantly, though, this imagined world needs to bear some resemblance
   to the world that actually exists to avoid losing touch with reality and
   factual truth. The loss of reality and factual truth risks judgments
   that are inattentive and actions that are destructive and tyrannical.
   Imagination must be bounded, for Arendt, to ensure that action and
   judgment remain tied to reality. The article first offers this novel
   interpretation of Arendtian imagination before discussing its
   relationship to contemporary research on political participation, moral
   conviction, and attitude certainty.},

   Presidential Elections (1972-2000)},
Journal = {POLITICS \& POLICY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {45},
Number = {4},
Pages = {571-593},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {This article examines the influence of policy salience on election
   outcomes using aggregate U. S. presidential election data and the
   American National Election Studies poll data from 1972 to 2000. It finds
   that salience influences election outcomes consistent with the
   Schattschneider-Lowi thesis that policy determines politics. While
   salience levels are typically low, relatively higher salience yields
   more popular votes for Republicans than Democrats. Consequently,
   Republicans typically win by higher margins and lose by smaller margins
   compared to Democrats. Moreover, an incumbent is likely to be reelected
   if his party's salience levels remain higher than the challenger's.
   Finally, the policy salience thesis provides useful clues in the quest
   for a unified voting theory. It suggests that voters rely on rationality
   and self-interest to obtain answers to two pertinent questions, whose
   answers determine how they vote: (1) what is the most important problem;
   and (2) who can address it? These questions also undergird other voting
   theories.},

Abstract = {The relationship between international linkages and the nature and
   survival of political regimes has gained increasing attention in recent
   years, but remains one that is poorly understood. In this article, we
   make three central contributions to our understanding of international
   linkage politics and autocratic regime survival. First, we introduce and
   develop the concept of autocratic linkage, and highlight its importance
   for understanding the international politics of autocratic survival.
   Second, we use event history analysis to demonstrate that autocratic
   linkage has a systematic effect on the duration of authoritarian
   regimes. Finally, we complement our quantitative analysis with a focused
   comparison of autocratic linkage politics in the Middle East. We show
   that variation in Saudi Arabian support for autocratic incumbents in the
   wake of the Arab Spring protests can be explained in significant part by
   variation in linkage relationships.},

Abstract = {ICT and the Internet are frequently seen as a viable solution for
   achieving better government, increasing citizens' political
   participation and improving service quality and the quality and delivery
   of government services. This article explores the systematisation and
   services of the Slovenian e-government through a citizen-centred lens.
   The development and current systematisation and functioning of
   e-government is analysed in two respects. First, the article assesses
   and interprets the (historical) formation of Slovenian e-government from
   its early beginnings, especially focusing on key documents such as
   strategies, action plans and certain Internet-based tools intended for
   wide citizen use. The aim is to disclose how citizens as end-users have
   been perceived and encouraged to actively participate in (e-)government.
   Second, the Slovenian e-government is analysed via an interpretation of
   available statistical data with an emphasis on how citizens use
   e-government, how efficient and effective it is, and whether it can be
   considered a participatory platform for citizens to become engaged in
   political matters.},

Abstract = {Various strands of literature in comparative politics suggest that there
   is a differential impact of the type of government and their supporting
   legislative coalitions in parliamentary democracies, for example, in
   terms of their size and ideological heterogeneity, and on their
   potential to induce policy change. Most studies in this area focus on
   governments as agenda-setters, possibly neglecting the role of
   parliaments as a further key actor in policy making. In this article, we
   address the broader question as to how patterns of conflict within
   parliament effect legislative activity of governments and parliamentary
   actors. Through a simultaneous analysis of the success and event history
   of over 12,000 legislative bills in three parliamentary systems and one
   semi-presidential system from 1986 until 2003, we show how the interplay
   of actor motivations and institutional settings has a discriminating
   impact on the potential of both the government and parliament to induce
   policy change.},

Month = {JUL-SEP},
Abstract = {There has been a great deal of discussion about the large volumes of
   foreign fighters involved in civil conflicts in Syria and Iraq over
   recent years. Yet, there remains little systematic evidence about the
   effect, if any, that foreign fighters have upon the conflicts they join.
   Existing literature distinguishes between the resources fighters bring
   to rebel groups and the liability they represent in regards to campaign
   cohesion. We seek to establish preliminary evidence as to whether or not
   foreign fighters contribute to the success of the campaigns they join.
   Our multinomial logistic and competing risks regression analyses of
   civil conflicts between 1946 and 2013 suggest that foreign fighters are
   associated with a decreased likelihood of government victory.
   Furthermore, we offer partial evidence to suggest that foreign fighters
   from non-contiguous countries are more likely to help rebels achieve a
   negotiated settlement or to continue their struggle against the
   government, but not to directly help them achieve victory.},

Abstract = {Do participatory processes produce democratic change as envisaged in
   normative accounts? Or, on the contrary, do they have negative effects
   or produce politically innocuous results, as some empirical research
   suggests? These are critical questions that remain largely unanswered.
   The potential effects associated with these processes seem boundless.
   This work seeks to clarify (part of) this vast forest of effects and
   articulate an analytical framework for empirical analysis. In addition
   to a literature review, the analytical framework proposed also rests on
   the discourse of academic scholars and public participation
   professionals. The resulting framework is developed around three
   research questions: Do participatory processes foster social capital? Do
   they empower social groups as political actors? Do they democratize
   patterns of interaction with political authorities? The paper addresses
   these questions from a theoretical point of view. It provides a
   classification of potential effects, mechanisms, and forms of evidence
   for thinking about the consequences of participatory processes in civil
   society and their interactions with the State.},

   universities-by students and faculty led by philosopher Alejandro Korn's
   teachings, between 1918 and his death in1936. The group of academics who
   followed Korn got identified with ideas and proposals of the University
   Reform movement and with the phylsophical thought of spiritualism and
   idealism currents proposed by him which promoted on their members
   cultural practices and innovative ways for organizing their intellectual
   work. Among them, there were the discipleship group of socratic
   influence, the publishing of magazines, the editorial venture and the
   theater. That intellectual practice allowed them to project their action
   in the cultural life of the city participating in its literary and
   artistic space as well as in the political life of the country with
   unique aesthetic proposals.},

Abstract = {Why are some people willing to initiate protest against authoritarian
   regimes? How does repression affect their willingness to act? Drawing on
   data from the Arab Spring protests in Morocco, this article argues first
   that activism is passed down from one generation to the next: first
   movers often came from families that had been punished for opposing the
   regime in the past. Secondly, repression during the Arab Spring was also
   counterproductive: those connected to first movers via Facebook
   supported renewed prodemocracy protests when informed of the regime's
   use of repression in 2011. A regime that jails and beats political
   dissidents creates incentives for its citizens to oppose it; these
   abuses can come back to haunt the regime long after repression occurs.},

Abstract = {This rejoinder responds to Kenneth Roberts's criticisms of my review
   published in these pages in August 2016. Roberts's book, Changing
   Course, is a major contribution to scholarship on Latin American party
   systems, but Roberts and I disagree about three key issues. Firstly,
   because Roberts measured the economic effects of different kinds of
   party systems beginning in 1980, his coding of party systems must be
   immediately prior to that. Secondly, Roberts and I agree that many Latin
   American party systems exhibited deep change during the long era of
   important substitution industrialization (roughly 1940-80). In my
   judgement, the coding of party systems should reflect these changes more
   than Changing Course does. Thirdly, following principles for
   understanding causation, I argue that Changing Course does not
   conclusively show that labour-mobilizing party systems caused deeper
   economic crises and greater party system instability than elitist party
   systems.},

Volume = {45},
Number = {4},
Pages = {648-672},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Here, I report the results of two randomized, posttest only, control
   group, survey experiments in which respondents were exposed to factual
   information about celebrity support for Hillary Clinton during the 2016
   presidential election campaign. Based on previous research, I
   hypothesize that celebrity endorsements will affect the emotions of
   enthusiasm, anger, and anxiety vis-a-vis Secretary Clinton. My results
   provide support for the general notion that celebrity endorsements can
   affect voter emotions. Specifically, I find that celebrity endorsements
   profoundly decreased the negative emotions of anger and anxiety
   vis-a-vis Secretary Clinton. My research suggests that a broad range of
   stimuli may affect voter emotions, which in turn affect political
   attitudes and behavior.},

Abstract = {Empirical studies have demonstrated that compared to almost all other
   parties, populist radical right (PRR) parties draw more votes from men
   than from women. However, the two dominant explanations that are
   generally advanced to explain this disparity - gender differences
   regarding socio-economic position and lower perceptions regarding the
   threat of immigrants - cannot fully explain the difference. The article
   contends that it might actually be gender differences regarding the
   conceptualisation of society and politics - populist attitudes - that
   explain the gender gap. Thus, the gap may be due, in part, to
   differences in socialisation. The article analyses EES 2014 data on
   voting for the populist radical right and the populist radical left in
   nine European countries. Across countries, the gender gap in voting for
   the PRR is indeed partly explained by populist attitudes. For populist
   radical left parties, the results are less clear, suggesting that
   populism has different meanings to voters on the left and on the right.},

Abstract = {Though many scholars study the formation of policy, less attention is
   given to its endurance. In this article, I seek to determine what
   contributes to the longevity of policy by examining the case of
   presidential unilateralism. While scholars widely recognize presidents'
   ability to unilaterally make policy with executive orders, they largely
   do not account for how these same orders can be easily changed by
   subsequent administrations. To address this deficiency, I develop a
   theory of executive order duration based on both time-invariant
   characteristics of the order and time-variant changes in the political
   climate it faces. Using survival analysis to examine all orders revoked
   between 1937 and 2013, I find support for the theory. This study has
   implications for understanding the endurance of executive orders and
   other policy instruments as part of the law as well as understanding the
   strategic actions of policy makers given the transient nature of these
   tools.},

Abstract = {Cybercrime has significantly increased worldwide in the last decades.
   There has been very little research done regarding cybercrimes in
   Venezuela in comparison to other places, more specifically in regards to
   the factors related to online victimization. Thus, this study aims to
   encourage the analysis on the factors of crime and online victimization
   in the region. Therefore, a group of variables derived from the routine
   activity theory (Cohen and Felson 1979), is analyzed. The purpose is to
   observe its relation to hacking and online harassment in a sample of 308
   individuals. This study found a group of variables that could be related
   to the likelihood of cyber victimization, which will be discussed in
   empirical, theoretical and practical terms.},

Title = {How the Flattened Costs of Grassroots Lobbying Affect Legislator
   Responsiveness},

Abstract = {Leading theories of grassroots lobbying assert that legislators should
   respond positively to the volume of grassroots lobbying messages because
   volume indicates the salience of an issue among constituents. This
   notion rests on the idea that the costs of producing a large volume of
   grassroots lobbying signals the value of the information to legislators.
   Advances in technology and strategy, however, have flattened the costs
   associated with producing such informationit costs much less to generate
   one additional e-mail message than before. In this environment, the
   volume of grassroots lobbying no longer signals the value of the
   information it contains. Instead, I believe trust becomes the critical
   factor in evaluating grassroots lobbying. I test this theory using a
   survey of state legislators. I find that lobbying message volume has no
   effect on legislator responses to higher salience issues, and a negative
   effect on lower salience issues.},

Abstract = {The article analyzes the place and how cyberdefense was developed within
   the defense system of Republica Argentina. To this end, the norms that
   have been produced on the subject during 2006 - 2015 are relieved and
   analyzed. The study shows that two institutions have been the most
   active: on one hand, stand out the regulations of the Ministerio de
   Defensa, and, on the other, the regulations of the Jefatura de Gabinete
   de Ministros. The research has a double purpose. Firstly, to favor a
   greater level of legislative systemacy in cyberdefense. Second, to
   produce substantive information for the elaboration of public policies
   and regional collaboration activities. The article is part of a larger
   investigation focused on the analysis of the different ways of
   regulating cyberspace.},

Title = {Citizens in the Making: The Inclusion of Racialized Subjects in Labour
   Market Projects in Sweden},
Journal = {SCANDINAVIAN POLITICAL STUDIES},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {40},
Number = {2},
Pages = {228-246},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {This article analyzes the formation of citizenship in today's
   multi-ethnic Sweden in light of the inclusion of `people with foreign
   background'. Particular focus is put on how ethnicity and migration
   renders visible existing citizenship ideals, defined in terms of
   similarity and difference on the basis of ethno-cultural background. The
   formation of citizenship is analyzed in the case of labour market
   projects targeting racialized migrants. The point of departure is an
   understanding of citizenship as an ongoing process of citizen formation,
   highlighting the formation of citizens as rights-bearing subjects,
   belonging to the societal community - in contrast to those not bearing
   these rights and not belonging to the societal community. The analysis
   illustrates how norms of Swedish-ness condition the membership in the
   Swedish societal community, forming a particular kind of racialized
   citizenship, including certain subjects, under certain conditions, while
   excluding others. One conclusion is that in addition to the formal
   dimensions of citizenship, the ability and willingness to adapt to norms
   of Swedish-ness is essential for accessing and using social rights -
   that is, for becoming employable and included on the labour market. In
   the projects analyzed, racialized migrants have the duty of becoming
   employable by embracing certain values - the good, working citizen, the
   free, independent individual, able to make choices - all constituted as
   being part of an ideal Swedish citizenship.},

Abstract = {The historian Sir Lewis Namier, born Ludwik Bernstein in Russian Poland
   in 1888 and brought up in east Galicia, was an unusual figure amongst
   Jewish theorists of nationalism. His father's family were assimilated
   Jews, and Namier grew up in a household that was thoroughly Polonised.
   Though registered as Jewish, he was not circumcised and was brought up
   in ignorance of Jewish traditions; his parents and sister subsequently
   converted to Catholicism. Unlike other Jewish intellectuals, he had no
   love for the Austro-Hungarian monarchy nor for German culture in
   general, and as a young man was an ardent pan-Slavist. Education at
   Oxford also imprinted in him a lifelong admiration for the British
   Empire, which he regarded as a force for good because it embodied the
   libertarian ethos inherent in Britain's national traditions. In his
   early writings, he defined nationality principally by race, and took
   religion, and attachment to a particular territory, as the principal
   markers of racial identity. This analysis derived chiefly from his
   observation of the history and geopolitics of central and eastern
   Europe, but he was also able to apply the same calculus to the
   `'Anglo-Saxon'' empires of the Atlantic world. These ideas, which he
   refined in later life but never abandoned, also fuelled a growing
   attachment to Zionism, accelerated by his own experiences of
   anti-Semitism, and his observation of the maltreatment of Jews in
   eastern Europe, of which he became increasingly aware through his role
   as an expert adviser in the British Foreign Office in 1916-1920.},

Abstract = {On 19 December 2012, Park Geun-Hye won the presidential election in
   Korea. How should we understand the surprising comeback of the strong
   man's daughter' in a country that has been touted as having experienced
   a successful transition from dictatorship to democratization? To answer
   this question, it is necessary to reformulate modernization theory, of
   which Korea has been cited as a dream case'. Modernization theory is
   overly process-oriented; a process of economic growth leads to a
   successful democratization with a temporal gap. However, when we take
   into account the question of agency, which was missing in modernization
   theory, a series of interesting questions arise. First, who led the
   process of modernization in the Korean case? Second, who led the process
   of democratization? Finally, what happens if the temporal gap between
   modernization and democratization is relatively short so that
   modernizers' and democratizers' occupy the same political landscape? In
   such a scenario, we should expect a society deeply divided between the
   two agencies of modernization theory. The recent return of the strong
   man's daughter' is the latest symptom of increasing social divisions
   between modernizers and democratizers in contemporary Korean society.},

Abstract = {Many factors are discussed regarding authoritarian regimes' sources of
   legitimacy, but law plays only a minor role in these discussions.
   Dictatorships and the rule of law may be difficult to reconcile, as a
   state that follows the rule of law always binds political power to the
   corresponding qualified rights. And yet, all authoritarian regimes are
   structured by legal systems, which they need in order to rule. Until the
   present, however, two aspects have remained unclear: the conditions
   under which law can act as a source of legitimacy for authoritarian
   regimes and the types of law that might give rise to this legitimising
   function. Because we cannot assume one single relationship between law
   and authoritarian regimes, a typology of legal systems is presented that
   integrates the formal and informal legal systems. These legal forms are
   then linked to various types of authoritarian regimes to illustrate
   their compatibility and inherent conflicts from a theoretical
   perspective. The analysis reveals that the different subtypes of
   authoritarian regimes correspond to various legal systems. It also
   becomes clear that specific combinations are linked to different
   expectations regarding stability. The exploratory character of this
   contribution allows for the formulation of theses and hypotheses which
   could contribute to structuring future empirical studies.
   In the conclusion, the question is raised whether legal systems that
   follow the rule of law in authoritarian regimes show similarly
   ambivalent effects as in the case of elections. In elections, the more
   they resemble democratic elections, the more the authoritarian regime's
   survival is in question. Does an analogous interpretation then mean that
   a strong orientation toward the rule of law endangers the legitimacy and
   survival of authoritarian regimes?.},

Abstract = {The article analyzes the structuration of Brazil's cybersecurity policy
   between the years of 2003 and 2016 as a component of its strategy of
   international insertion and projection of leadership in the Global
   South. The Internet governance field, of which cybersecurity is a part,
   offers the country a relatively low-cost opportunity of protagonism in
   the elaboration of international norms. It analyzes cornerstone
   documents of this policy and argues that it is a part of the country's
   efforts to project its soft power in the field of international
   security, but that its incoherencies can affect and even compromise the
   strategy. Finally, it draws brief projections to this policy in face of
   political changes in Brazil.},

Abstract = {Since the early 1990s the European Union (EU) has been the largest donor
   to the post-Soviet states. In the last decade it more than doubled
   development assistance to the region. One of the major purposes of
   assistance is human rights promotion. At the same time, it is still an
   open question whether, and under what conditions, assistance can improve
   human rights in recipient countries. This study applies time-series
   cross-section (TSCS) analysis to identify effects of external
   assistance. Using data from 12 post-Soviet states over 20 years, I show
   that conditions under which states are more likely to display a positive
   effect are high state capacity and political conditionality attached to
   economic cooperation agreements. Whereas, when state capacity is lower,
   assistance might cause a slight deterioration of the human rights
   situation. In hybrid regimes, assistance is associated with negative
   effects, indicating that external assistance might induce deterioration
   of human rights in such regimes.},

Abstract = {Following democracy's global proliferation, authoritarian governments
   widely use promises of democracy as a legitimation strategy. This
   article argues that this strategy is facilitated by the existence of
   varying notions of democracy. In authoritarian contexts, democracy is
   generally framed in narrow terms, such as holding elections. This
   renders it compatible with political practices of electoral or
   liberalized authoritarian regimes. As a result, citizens may perceive
   their authoritarian regime as democratic and, in extension, legitimate.
   I show that perceptions of regime democraticness are significantly
   influenced by attitudes towards and participation in elections and
   related political institutions, using original survey data from Morocco.
   By contrast, subjective assessments of individual freedoms had no
   consistent impact on respondents' regime perception. A major conclusion
   from these findings is that authoritarian regimes may seek to justify
   and strengthen their rule by attempting to induce constituents'
   perception of living in a democracy.},

Abstract = {This article examines and explains child rights mainstreaming in
   European Union (EU) external affairs. It provides a within-case
   comparison of how children's rights have been mainstreamed in
   development aid, common foreign and security policy (CFSP) and external
   trade policy. While most mainstreaming research have studied
   mainstreaming as a process of norm socialization, this article draws on
   hypotheses concerning bureaucratic self-interest that have thus far not
   been tested in the EU mainstreaming literature. The article finds
   support for rational functionalist assumptions that actor preferences,
   external policy competences and resource exchanges between EU
   institutions and child rights organizations together help explain
   variations in child rights mainstreaming across sectors and over time.
   Rationalist functionalism is found useful in explaining under which
   conditions at sector level mainstreaming is likely to succeed or fail.},

Title = {Public spending, corruption, and income inequality: A comparative

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW},

Abstract = {Based on data from 16 Asian and 18 Latin American countries from 1996 to
   2009, this article argues that corruption does indeed affect the
   distributive outcomes of government spending, but not necessarily in the
   expected direction. The incentives for bureaucrats and politicians to
   abuse their power during the budgetary process suggests that corruption
   should concentrate public funds in the hands of elites, exacerbating
   inequality. However, this should only be expected when corruption takes
   the form of looting (embezzlement). When it takes the form of cheating
   (vote-buying), it may actually reduce inequality as it involves resource
   distribution and building of clientelistic linkages. It is the level of
   political competition rather than regional differences that determines
   the distributional effects of corruption in Asia and Latin America. This
   article has profound implications for the study of corruption and policy
   outcomes, suggesting that the level of political competition is a key
   factor in determining the outcomes of corruption.},

Abstract = {The literature on the U.S. Supreme Court has paid substantial attention
   to the perceived legitimacy of the Court's decisions. However, much less
   attention has been paid to the perceived legitimacy of the reasons the
   Court provides for its opinions. We design two experiments to understand
   how the public perceives opinion content. Unlike prior studies, we take
   it as a given that the Court uses legal reasons in its decisions. This
   offers us a baseline by which to compare departures from these legal
   reasons. We find that extralegal reasons, when paired with legal
   reasons, do nothing to harm the legitimacy of the Court. Furthermore, we
   find that even with a lack of legal reasons, the use of extralegal
   reasons does not harm the legitimacy of the Court, even among those who
   find that these reasons are inappropriate for the Court to use.},

Journal = {WEST EUROPEAN POLITICS},

Volume = {40},
Number = {3, SI},
Pages = {534-559},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Institutions are thought to matter for vote choice, and work on economic
   voting is exemplary in this regard. The strength of the economic vote
   varies considerably cross-nationally and this seems to emanate from
   differences in the clarity of responsibility. Still, this conceptual
   frame, dominant in the field, appears to have some cracks. First, almost
   all work presents analyses of the economic vote in smaller, split
   samples of low- and high-clarity contexts separately. Second, the
   literature appears rather dispersed when the conceptual and empirical
   indicators are examined. The article attempts to overcome these
   limitations by analysing a large pool of democratic elections with a
   series of objective indicators. It investigates these indicators
   separately, and as components within two cumulative indices
   (institutional rules and power patterns). The results indicate that,
   even though there are indications of differences in the strength of the
   economic vote in high- and low-clarity contexts respectively,
   institutional rules or power patterns fail to significantly deflect the
   overall electoral impact of economic growth.},

Abstract = {This article brings into conversation two important literatures in
   contemporary political theory that have, for the most part, failed to
   engage one another: work spanning more than two decades on
   multiculturalism and identity politics, and neo-republican work on
   nondomination. The authors take as their starting-point two widely
   endorsed claims: that identities are constructs and that state actors
   play a crucial role in their construction. Their question is how
   democratic states should shape identity, and their central claim is that
   states should do so in ways that promote what they call democratic
   nondomination. This ideal, they stress, is multifaceted. It has both an
   action-level and a system-level component. In addition, it has both an
   inter-agentive and an impersonal dimension. Attending to democratic
   nondomination in its complexity is crucial to the project of evaluating
   alternative possible forms of state identity construction.},

Abstract = {We offer a novel theory on Supreme Court impact that makes several key
   contributions beyond existing accounts. We argue that policy-oriented
   justices are particularly attentive to the impact of their precedents
   within the U.S. Courts of Appeals. We provide a framework in which both
   Supreme Court and circuit-level influences drive U.S. Courts of Appeals
   responses to the Supreme Court's precedents. Principally, we argue that
   the Supreme Court's use of its summary decisions, which explicitly
   reference its formally argued decisions, increase circuit court utility
   of the High Court's precedents. We test our predictions using new data
   on appeals court responses to the Supreme Court's precedents. The
   empirical results support our account and shed new light on the
   hierarchical dynamic within the American federal judiciary.},

Abstract = {In modern societies, the media functions as the most important source of
   information about current political or societal events. Given this media
   power, political organizations are eager to participate in the public
   discourse. In addition to political parties, interest groups also seem
   to rely more and more on media exposure to strengthen their position
   within the political decision-making process, to inform their members or
   even to court new members. The limited capacity of the media, however,
   does not allow for every interest group to be heard. The purpose of the
   present study is to identify and explain the amount of interest groups'
   media exposure. The results mainly indicate that the quantity and the
   quality of the public relations activities of an interest group can
   account for a large part of the amount of media exposure; the more
   frequent and the more professional their communications, the more likely
   they are to be covered.},

Abstract = {In what is known as the ``prologue{''} or introduction of its On the
   Improvement of the Understanding, Spinoza explains - in the first
   person-his decision to look for the philosophical life, to inquire if
   there is some real good having the power to communicate itself, and
   which would affect the mind singly. To do this, he considers it
   essential to establish what the true Method in Philosophy consists of
   and how it can direct the Understanding towards the end sought. Spinoza
   then does not begin his meditation with the cogito, but neither, as is
   traditionally believed, with the idea of God. Its starting point, both
   theoretical and practical, is the experience of having ideas, and the
   need to amend them. In this article our porpose is to study some aspects
   of the relation of Spinoza's philosophy (which is essentialy an ethics)
   to the problem of the amendment of the intellect, to show that the
   endeavour of our author is in the antipodes of the Cartesian
   philosophical project.},

Abstract = {Case law on cross-border patient mobility of the Court of Justice of the
   European Union (CJEU) is part of a larger process of liberalization of
   cross-border healthcare in the EU's internal market. It led to
   discussions about the end of territoriality in healthcare. If narrowly
   understood as territorial sovereignty, the internal market resulted in
   the end of territoriality in healthcare. However, the CJEU case law and
   its codification in the Patients' Rights Directive (PRD) have also
   resulted in the creation of a new EU territory in which EU citizens have
   the right to cross-border healthcare under certain conditions.
   Furthermore, Member States have up-scaled territorial control of the
   access of cross-border healthcare and its reimbursement to the European
   level through the restricted codification of case law in the PRD. In
   addition, Member States have maintained territorial control of their
   healthcare systems by the way they have implemented the case law and the
   PRD, as demonstrated here by the Dutch and Belgian cases, founding
   members with considerable experience with cross-border healthcare. Thus,
   territoriality as a strategy of control is still alive in publicly
   insured healthcare, foremost at the national scale, as is also reflected
   by the limited centrifugal tendencies among potentially mobile patients
   and border regions.},

Abstract = {Political participation is far from being a trivial issue. The focus of
   this paper will be on two dissimilar acts of political participation in
   the context of the Arab Spring: revolution and elections. In detail, I
   will first describe participants in revolution and elections - who they
   are and why they do participate - to then analyse the link (if any)
   between revolution and electoral participation. This study will develop
   a comparison between the cases of Tunisia and Egypt. The findings will
   illustrate that Tunisian insurgents are more likely to vote in
   post-revolution elections when compared to their Egyptian fellows, and
   that this is consistent with the events in the aftermath of the two
   revolutions.},

Abstract = {This article examines the presidentialisation thesis through the lens of
   the Parliamentary Budget Office (PBO). It considers the origins of the
   PBO in the American presidential system, where it has served to
   challenge the fiscal power of the president, and finds that PBOs perform
   an analogous function in parliamentary settings. The article then
   explores the PBO's logic in parliamentary systems that exhibit evidence
   of presidentialisation, specifically examining the case of Canada. It
   finds that such budget offices mitigate the budgetary power of
   presidents, as well as prime ministers who are becoming more like
   presidents. They thereby offer a counterweight to the assertive fiscal
   tendencies of executives in presidentialising parliamentary systems.},

Abstract = {Political parties in US politics are becoming increasingly polarized,
   with a growing number of extreme candidates entering electoral races.
   Why would extremists challenge more moderate opponents, since their
   chances of winning are supposedly very slim? I develop a model of
   electoral competition and endogenous entry to show that extremists rely
   on the possibility that the campaign might reveal information about the
   opponents' quality that can induce some voters to change their electoral
   decision. The weight voters place on candidates' valence determines the
   incidence of uncontested elections and the degree of asymmetry in
   polarization of the candidates' policy positions in contested elections.
   Finally, I extend the model to consider asymmetric information about
   individual valence levels. I show that uncontested races are still
   possible in equilibrium, that in contested races at least one candidate
   has high valence, and the valence-advantaged candidate can be the one
   with the more extreme policy stance.},

Abstract = {The OSCE commitments agreed during several meetings held in the past
   years address economic, political and social aspects of migration. As
   far as Italy, while the national legal framework is almost in line with
   international standards, the adoption of practical measures, their
   implementation and the promotion of projects prove difficult. Moreover,
   the increased exposure that Italy faces as a country lying on the
   external maritime border of the European Union makes it more difficult
   to manage migration flows via the sea.},

Abstract = {Drawing on data from the Parliamentary Candidates UK project, we profile
   the socio-demographic characteristics of parliamentary candidates
   standing in 2015 and compare elected MPs to previous cohorts since 1979.
   We argue that the 2015 cohort of candidates largely resembles the
   archetypal candidate identified by Durose et al. (2013, Parliamentary
   Affairs, 66, 246-267). Despite smaller parties' campaign rhetoric of a
   `new kind of politics', parties across the spectrum offer up very
   similar candidate profiles. We find a narrowing of occupational
   backgrounds, with fewer candidates and MPs from manual occupations, and
   an increasing percentage of candidates and MPs with a university
   education. Competition across the parties, particularly in terms of the
   selection of women and black and minority ethnic (BME) candidates, has
   positive consequences for the representativeness of Parliament. However,
   despite a record number of women and BME MPs elected, Parliament remains
   disproportionately white and male.},

Journal = {ELECTORAL STUDIES},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {46},
Pages = {48-63},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Ambiguity whereby candidates make deliberately unclear position
   statements on key issues has long been touted by pundits and political
   scientists as a smart campaign strategy. In this manuscript, two
   experiments suggest the usefulness of ambiguous rhetoric on salient
   issues is overstated. Voters rely on well-publicized partisan positions
   on political issues as heuristics, a factor that has often been
   overlooked by the existing literature. This means that an issue will
   inform a voter's decision even if the candidate speaks ambiguously on
   it. Further, while ambiguity does not change the voters' perceptions of
   the candidate's position relative to silence, it does raise the salience
   of the issue that candidate is attempting to minimize. Hence, for
   candidates who wish to hide unfavorable positions, silence is a better
   rhetorical strategy than ambiguity. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {There have been different conflict mapping approaches to understand the
   complex and chaotic nature of ethnic conflicts. Sandole's three pillar
   approach (1998) can be applied to capture the complexity of the Burundi
   conflict in terms of causes and conditions perspective. In this paper,
   the Burundi conflict is examined within the time frame of until the
   1990s by the conflict analysis of Sandole's conflict mapping. First, the
   conflict parties are investigated with the emphasis on conflict issues,
   objectives, means, orientation and environment. This paper explains how
   the Burundi conflict between the Hutu and the Tutsi involves factors at
   each of the four levels of analysis. The suggested conflict mapping
   addresses the underlying causes and conditions of the conflict at each
   of these levels and captures the complexity of the conflict in order to
   affect negative and positive peace. It is important to note that
   Sandole's conflict mapping can provide an important tool to shed light
   on the deep-rooted and protracted nature of the Burundi conflict to be
   understood by the conflict resolution and peace science theorists and
   practitioners.},

Abstract = {After a protracted national discussion about racial mixture in the early
   1990s, the Office of Management and Budget made the unprecedented
   decision in 1997 to allow Americans to ``mark one or more{''} racial
   categories on the 2000 census. A small ``multiracial movement{''}
   provoked this fundamental change in the way the government collects
   racial data. This case study shows that even very small and modest
   social movements can have profound effects on public policy through
   their unintended consequences. In winning a redefinition of how the U.S.
   government defines and counts by race, the multiracial movement of the
   1990s set in motion a process that has both amplified and been amplified
   by broader structural and cultural changes in how Americans perceive
   race. The modest impact of a small social movement can ultimately
   produce very big consequences.},

Abstract = {Models of voting behavior typically specify that all voters employ
   identical criteria to evaluate candidates. We argue that moderate voters
   weigh candidates' policy/ideological positions far less than
   non-moderate voters, and we report analyses of survey data from the 2010
   Cooperative Congressional Election Study that substantiate these
   arguments. Across a wide range of models and measurement strategies, we
   find consistent evidence that liberal and conservative voters are
   substantially more responsive to candidate ideology than more centrist
   voters. Simply put, moderate voters appear qualitatively different from
   liberals and conservatives, a finding that has important implications
   for candidate strategies and for political representation.},

Abstract = {Is sisterhood global? This study investigates if women in Congress are
   representing women worldwide by extending their surrogate representation
   of American women to women in foreign countries. Congressional research
   shows that race affects surrogate representation across borders via
   transnationalism. I test whether this also applies to gender when no
   shared mother country unites women, there are divisions over how to
   represent women, and American foreign policy is considered a
   stereotypically masculine policy domain. With an original dataset of
   three Congresses (2005-2010), I test if female House Representatives are
   more likely to introduce foreign policy legislation that targets foreign
   women and girls by applying regression analysis. Controlling for likely
   individual, electoral, and institutional incentives, I find that gender
   matters and that women in Congress are more likely to introduce
   legislation on behalf of women worldwide, acting as global surrogates.
   These findings offer new insights into the boundaries of surrogate
   representation, congressional foreign policy decision making, the
   influence of gender on international relations, and the impact of women
   in Congress.},

Abstract = {Research on the gender gap in American politics has focused on average
   differences between male and female voters. This has led to an
   underdeveloped understanding of sources of heterogeneity among women
   and, in particular, a poor understanding of the political preferences of
   Republican women. We argue that although theories of ideological sorting
   suggest gender gaps should exist primarily between political parties,
   gender socialization theories contend that critical differences lie at
   the intersection of gender and party such that gender differences likely
   persist within political parties. Using survey data from the 2012
   American National Election Study, we evaluate how party and gender
   intersect to shape policy attitudes. We find that gender differences in
   policy attitudes are more pronounced in the Republican Party than in the
   Democratic Party, with Republican women reporting significantly more
   moderate views than their male counterparts. Mediation analysis reveals
   that the gender gaps within the Republican Party are largely
   attributable to gender differences in beliefs about the appropriate
   scope of government and attitudes toward gender-based inequality. These
   results afford new insight into the joint influence of gender and
   partisanship on policy preferences and raise important questions about
   the quality of representation Republican women receive from their own
   party.},

Abstract = {While previous research on interest groups' (IGs) relations to MPs has
   mainly focused on informal lobbying strategies or interorganizational
   linkages, the analysis of formal ties between MPs and IGs has remained
   neglected. Such formal ties can be conceptualized as an exchange
   relationship between individual MPs and IGs. The latter benefit from
   access to parliament while the former benefit from the expertise and
   support provided by IGs. We investigate whether committee members'
   formal ties to IGs reflect committees' responsibilities. Our results
   show that there is a strong topical match between committee members'
   ties to IGs and committees' area of competence. However, this congruence
   is less due to the background of MPs than to the ties developed after
   committee assignment. Formal ties are, to a large extent, the
   consequence of IGs recruiting MPs who can give them access to relevant
   committees. Empirical evidence comes from Swiss MPs' ties to IGs between
   2000 and 2015.},

Title = {All Politics Is Local? County Sheriffs and Localized Policies of
   Immigration Enforcement},

Year = {2017},
Volume = {70},
Number = {1},
Pages = {142-154},

Abstract = {Immigration enforcement and policy making has increasingly devolved to
   the local level in the United States. American sheriffs present a unique
   opportunity to evaluate decisions made about immigration policies in the
   local context. In dealing with immigration concerns in their counties,
   sheriffs act both within the confines of federal and state mandates and
   as local policymakers. However, little research comprehensively assesses
   the role sheriffs play in immigration policy making. Using data from an
   original, national survey of more than five hundred elected sheriffs in
   the United States, we provide a broad account of sheriffs' roles in
   immigration enforcement and policy making. Our research demonstrates
   that sheriffs' ideology and personal characteristics shape their
   personal attitudes about immigrants. In turn, these attitudes play a key
   role in influencing local enforcement decisions. Sheriffs' immigration
   attitudes relate strongest to checks of the immigration status of
   witnesses and victims and those stopped for traffic violations or
   arrested for non-violent crimes. Our results demonstrate the important
   role of the sheriff in understanding local variation in immigration
   policy and the connection between the personal preferences of
   representatives and policy making that can emerge across policy
   environments and levels of government.},

Abstract = {We theorize that the ``long campaign{''} provides the impetus to
   motivate people to engage in campaign politics. We rely on panel survey
   data from the Cooperative Campaign Analysis Project to evaluate the
   impact of a long presidential campaign on citizens' political
   engagement. The panel provides us unique leverage to render the analysis
   fully dynamic and to minimize endogeneity issues because we determine
   temporal order for key concepts. We find that campaign contacts
   occurring during the primary significantly increase participation in the
   general election. We also find that exposure to advertisements during
   primaries translates to higher levels of voter engagement in the fall
   campaign. We demonstrate that attitudes toward primary and general
   election candidates are strongly related to voters' engagement in the
   fall campaign. Finally, we are able to explain how contacts, campaign
   information, and citizen attitudes toward candidates shape changes in
   levels of engagement across the primary and general election campaigns.},

Abstract = {This article reviews the place of Indigenous politics in the last 50
   years of Canadian political science. Focusing on the CJPS, it looks at
   broad themes and clusters in the literature over time, while also trying
   to explain how the roots of the discipline continue to impact the
   development of political science in Canada and thus CJPS. I argue that
   while at least 43 articles have dealt with Indigenous politics (solely
   or as a significant focus) and at least 18 have had some significant
   discussion thereof, there nonetheless remains a disconnect between
   Indigenous politics and the discipline. This disconnect exists because
   of the methodological and epistemological foundations of the discipline
   which have resulted in a focus limited to the Westphalian state. While
   the disconnect between Indigenous politics and the discipline has waned
   considerably (43 of 61 articles have been published since 2000) as there
   has been an awakening of sorts, a disconnect nevertheless still exists.
   Resume Cet article examine la place de la politique autochtone au cours
   des 50 dernieres annees de science politique canadienne. En se
   concentrant sur la CJPS/RCSP, il se penche sur les grands themes et
   regroupements dans la documentation au fil du temps, tout en essayant
   egalement d'expliquer comment les fondements de la discipline continuent
   d'avoir une incidence sur le developpement de la science politique au
   Canada, et partant, sur la CJPS/RCSP. J'avance que tandis qu'au moins 43
   articles ont traite de la politique autochtone (exclusivement ou en
   grande partie) et au moins 18 ont fait l'objet d'une large discussion,
   il subsiste neanmoins un decalage entre la politique autochtone et la
   discipline. Ce decalage existe en raison des fondements methodologiques
   et epistemologiques de la discipline qui se sont traduits par un accent
   limite a l'Etat westphalien. Bien que le decalage entre la politique
   autochtone et la discipline se soit nettement reduit (43 articles sur 61
   ont ete publies depuis l'an 2000), car un eveil s'est en quelque sorte
   produit, un ecart continue d'exister.},

Title = {The Relevance of Emotions in Presidential Public Appeals: Anger's
   Conditional Effect on Perceived Risk and Support for Military
   Interventions},
Journal = {PRESIDENTIAL STUDIES QUARTERLY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {47},

Abstract = {This study investigates whether and to what extent the thematic
   relevance of emotive stimuli embedded in presidential speeches affects
   people's risk perceptions and policy support regarding military
   interventions in civil conflict. Conducting an experimental study with a
   total of 1,187 participants, we find the induction of anger via
   thematically relevant emotive triggers leads to higher levels of support
   for military interventions in civil conflict even though people's risk
   perceptionswhich were high across all conditionsremain unaffected. By
   comparison, the effects of anger on policy support observed in the
   thematically irrelevant condition do not differ significantly from the
   emotion-neutral control condition. Thus, although members of the public
   are highly sensitive to the risks of military interventions in civil
   conflict and can compartmentalize their feelings within the relevant
   policy sphere (thereby negating a spillover effect), stimulated anger
   can nevertheless generate greater public support for military
   interventions. Still, the potential for such opinion movement to help
   justify and facilitate policy action depends highly on the president's
   strategic positioning.},

Abstract = {One of the main problems in the current economic, social and political
   crisis has been financial corruption. The most recent reform of the
   General Tax Law has been presented as a flagship measure against this
   type of corruption since its Article 95. bis allows the publication of
   an annual list of certain taxpayers with outstanding debts to the Public
   Treasury which can be viewed by anyone online. Along with this measure,
   which will also be included in the Basque Country, other instruments
   have been proposed such as the publication of certain information about
   people who have been convicted by a final ruling of the commission of
   certain offences such as tax offences. These measures have been received
   and accepted by the general public and the media in particular without
   further discussion, giving the impression that they are not up for
   debate. However, whether the measure provided for in the General Tax Law
   can be questioned from the legal standpoint needs to be addressed. Such
   a measure may adversely affect a number of fundamental rights, notably
   privacy, reputation and informational self-determination. This has led
   to the issue of numerous reports by a number of administrations and
   public bodies questioning some aspects of the instrument envisaged in
   the Law. The possibility of publishing a list of debtors poses numerous
   questions that have yet to be thoroughly investigated. What is the
   purpose of publication? Can transparency be cited as an objective to
   pursue with this list? Does it disproportionately affect fundamental
   rights such as the right to the protection of personal data?},

Abstract = {The twists and turns of Turkish foreign policy under Justice and

   the scholarly literature, but also in common discourse. This article
   traces the unfolding of this policy in Turkey's neighbourhood and in
   relation to its quest for EU membership, particularly since 2006, and
   also discusses the milestones that have been shaping it. Drawing upon
   the categories of change Charles Hermann identified, this article
   illustrates the magnitude and direction of change in Turkish foreign
   policy during this period and critically evaluates its implications for
   this policy today.},

Abstract = {This article explains the empirical connection between dyadic capability
   differences and international conflict as a consequence of how, when,
   and where states enter the international system. State capabilities are
   largely static, and, since states enter the system in geographic
   clusters, the processes of state maturation affect contiguous and
   regionally proximate states similarly. This makes dyadic capability
   differences static as well. The lack of change in capability differences
   over time suggests that the parity-conflict relationship is largely a
   product of the factors associated with state system entry. Indeed, as I
   demonstrate, several different proxies for the conditions of state
   system entry separately eliminate any statistical relationship between
   parity and militarized dispute onset, 1816-2001. I also find no
   relationship between parity and the wars that have occurred during that
   same time period. These results have a number of implications for the
   role of power and capabilities in explaining international conflict.},

Abstract = {While a number of scholars argue that classical realism is conspicuously
   similar to critical international relations, this article takes an issue
   with such an interpretation. It does not challenge the observation that
   both approaches are comparable when it comes to ethical concerns and a
   related critique of modernity, but it puts forth an argument that they
   differ fundamentally when it comes to their basic intellectual
   motivation and purpose. This also makes classical realism more ready to
   formulate normative judgment. To articulate what provides for the
   ethical impetus in classical realism, the study turns to the work of
   Stephen Turner and his collaborators who illuminate Weberian sources of
   classical realist social science. Adopting the category of analyticism
   from Patrick Jackson, it further puts forth that normative judgment is
   linked to classical realism's inherent ontological doubt, a feature it
   compensates for by focusing on epistemology necessitating constant
   engagement with empirical reality as a source of its (weak) ontological
   orientation. As a result, classical realism is reinforced here as an
   approach to international relations worth reviving and further
   developing.},

   vertical{''} is also becoming less monolithic, turning into a set of
   competing structures that drift along the uncoordinated trajectories. As
   a consequence, the regional divisions of the security forces are moving
   to the forefront of the regional socio-economic and political life. For
   now it is hard to tell who will assume the role the main enforcer. This
   will depend on the relative size and strength of the legal vs.
   ``shadow{''} segments of the economy. According to L.Bliakher's
   conclusion, the struggle between the candidates for the role of the main
   enforcer and its results will determine not only the future of this or
   the other region, but also the overall configuration of the ``political
   class{''} in Russia.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF GENOCIDE RESEARCH},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {19},
Number = {1},
Pages = {61-87},
Abstract = {This article assesses the risk factors of genocide. Drawing upon
   previous research on genocide and the United Nations' Atrocity
   Prevention Framework, it employs an event history analysis of over 150
   countries between 1955 and 2005. While existing frameworks emphasize
   general upheaval, this article disaggregates the type of upheaval,
   finding that economic upheaval-such as resource scarcity or population
   pressure-does not influence the odds of genocide. Instead, political
   upheaval that enables a repressive leader to come to power (including
   coups, assassinations, civil wars and successful revolutions) and
   political upheaval that directly threatens those in power (including
   coup attempts, campaigns against the state, unsuccessful revolutions and
   civil wars that do not coincide with regime change) have the strongest
   influence on the onset of genocide. These findings are consistent with
   previous findings that emphasize political upheaval and threat but
   specify numerous indicators of these broad phenomena. This article also
   highlights the role of discrimination and exclusion, although it casts
   doubt on many other risk factors included in recent case studies and in
   the United Nations' Atrocity Prevention Framework.},

Abstract = {The article discusses the relations between mobility and citizenship' in
   two Italian cities, in the frame of two chronological contexts: early
   modern Rome and contemporary Turin and Marseille. The article's aim is
   twofold: on the one hand, it explores the role of transient individuals
   in shaping urban space; on the other hand, it discusses individuals'
   spatial practices as forms of citadinite and being part of the city. The
   long-term, interdisciplinary approach that we adopt in the article aims
   to address the question of settledness/unsettledness in contemporary
   cities through the prism of urban societies of the past, where
   citizenship and most of the institutions operated at the scale of the
   city. The final aim of this article is to reinsert' the presence of
   transient inhabitants into the framework of forms of urban belonging and
   unseat the dichotomy between settled and unsettled, formal and informal,
   legal and illegal citadins'.},

   climate characterized by a volatile economy with low oil prices, a
   depreciating peso, and the victory of Donald Trump in the US
   presidential elections. Consequently, the year ended with presidential
   approval ratings at an all-time low, widespread and unchecked
   corruption, and increasing concerns about the government's legitimacy

Title = {(De) constructing difference: a qualitative review of the `othering' of
   UK Muslim communities, extremism, soft harms, and Twitter analytics},
Journal = {BEHAVIORAL SCIENCES OF TERRORISM AND POLITICAL AGGRESSION},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {9},

Pages = {21-36},
Abstract = {There is some evidence that, in the UK, current counter terrorism
   initiatives reproduce and amplify both real and imagined differences
   between Muslim and anti-Muslim groups, leading in turn to social and
   community polarisation and isolation. It is far from clear whether these
   changing perceptions always lead to increased ethnic and religious
   violence or increased radicalisation. However, more worrying is the
   potential for the development of `soft harms' among those ` suspect
   communities'; for example, reduced social integration, withdrawal from
   British cultural life, hate crime, forced marriage and domestic
   violence. There has to date been little interrogation of the scale of
   `soft harm' among Muslim communities. Within this paper, the author
   offers a qualitative review of how the Muslim `other' has become an
   ascribed category reproduced through an endemic `Muslim common sense'.
   Following that the author suggests that Twitter analytics may be
   harnessed to analyse the attitudes, current condition and reactions of
   suspect other communities through the tweeting of everyday events. The
   aim in doing so is to develop a series of proposals to counter the
   ideological underpinnings of difference and contribute to current
   debates on counter terrorism policy in the UK.},

Abstract = {Analyses of the Spanish mobilization cycle between 2011 and 2013 concur
   with considering the critiques of corruption (and the growing discredit
   of traditional parties), one of the two key factors that has been
   determining in the emergence of the 15-M movement (the Indignados), the
   other being the economic crisis. This article investigates the link
   between anti-corruption from below and the claim for popular sovereignty
   in the Spanish case. In Spain movements' requests and discourses have
   found a clear translation on the electoral plan. Podemos, a party
   founded in 2014, considers itself the electoral expression of 15-M. For
   these reasons, the analysis focuses on Podemos and its anti-corruption
   discourse as well. The analysis is conducted in a historical
   perspective. Popular sovereignty has been the fundamental claim of the
   first social movements born in Europe in the second half of the
   eighteenth century. A historical comparison is carried out between the
   anti-corruption frames of democratic movements between 1760 and 1848 and
   the present ones, giving particular attention to their nexus with the
   claim for popular sovereignty.},

Abstract = {The twentieth century starts with a rediscovery of the collective
   dimension that legal modernity had compressed. The vivid debate that
   came with the fascist corporatist experiment is an interesting
   observatory that lets us read this process against the light. According
   to the major part of Italian legal culture the corporatist cultural
   project seems to forewarn a new framework of the connections between
   public and private spheres, state and society, law and economics,
   statism and pluralism. Corporatism, which did not intend to build a
   non-statual model of authority, was an answer to the need to attribute
   legal value and legal autonomy to economic and social actors that
   weren't adequately represented in the political and normative circuit.
   The paper is aimed at retracing some of the discursive strategies that
   characterized the corporatist experiment and the different
   legitimization models that were proposed by legal theory in order to
   rebuild the dichotomy between public and private spheres.},

Abstract = {Although Europe is not a superpower, but it is a great world power, at
   least in the economic dimension and it has a decisive effect on many
   international issues. Means it has much to say in relation to trade, the
   environment, drug control, natural disasters, and serious illnesses and
   so on. But in the field of policy passing the restrictive measures that
   puts on its agenda, in the major and basic issues it inevitably should
   cooperate with US and follow it. Europe on these types of subjects,
   considers inevitably a complementary role of America for itself at least
   for some time. So a sense that at the time was applied in Germany is
   also true about the current Union: European Union is an economic giant
   and a political dwarf that lacks the characteristics of a great and
   perfect power. It seems that no issue had been raised as the importance
   of exit of Britain from the European Union and the effects that it will
   leave from the end of the Second World War up to now means more than 70
   years. Location and history of Britain add to the importance of this
   issue. The exit of Britain apart from the business and economic
   consequences can create a political and psychological shock in European
   developments. As entering of Great Britain took place loudly within a
   decade (Eventually, in 1973), leaving this country is associated with a
   lot of coverage in 4 recent years. This issue has been become one of the
   concerns of circles of Britain and Europe. America and Canada have also
   repeatedly warned about the negative consequences of this exit that we
   will discuss it in this paper.},

   available evaluation studies, however, do not allow us to determine what
   kind of approach can be considered as a best practice for schools and
   education systems. In this article, we rely on the results of a 5-year
   panel study to investigate the long-term effects of various forms of
   citizenship education. Using the Belgian Political Panel Survey (n =
   3,025), a three-wave longitudinal panel survey of 16-, 18- and
   21-year-old Belgian late adolescents and young adults, we determine
   which citizenship education effort (i.e., classroom instruction, being a
   member of a school council, and an open-classroom climate) has a
   long-term effect on political trust and political interest. The results
   suggest that classroom instruction, the presence of an open-classroom
   climate, and being a member of a school board are positively related to
   political trust. We also find that classroom instruction and being a
   member of a school board are significantly associated with higher levels
   of political interest. We close with some observations on what these
   findings imply for citizenship education policies.},

   of 1971 and 2011 in Colombia. Try to answer: why, despite the
   similarities in the organizations that promoted, there are marked
   differences in their repertoires and collective action frames? In the
   first part the political contention that led to the movilizations are
   rebuilt. Then, the similarities that both situations occur in mobilizing
   structures that supported the protests are analyzed. In the third part,
   differences in the frames of collective action and repertories of action
   that characterized the protest are analyzed. Finally, we compare the
   social and political contexts in which the two cycles of protest
   develop.},

Abstract = {This text has as an objective the accomplishment of a comparative
   reflection regarding the processes of consolidation of rights and
   citizenship in Brazil, Argentina and Chile from their conformation as a
   Nation State until the respective redemocratization processes by the end
   of the 20th Century. In order to do so, a debate will be executed among
   the papers and works that have looked over the matter in the countries
   in question, in line with the historical reconstruction of this process.
   It is adopted here Jose Murilo de Carvalho's hypothesis, according to
   whom the manner in which States are constituted conditions the very
   construction of citizenship, in a way that, given the importance assumed
   by the political centralization and the rejection of liberalism in the
   construction of the Brazilian State, the advancement of social rights in
   here coincided with the periods of regime closure, while in Argentina
   and Chile (to a greater or lesser degree) the periods of regime closure
   are contemporaneous to regression in social rights.},

Abstract = {Autocratic regimes have developed a new strategy to overcome the high
   costs of either fully complying or not complying with the international
   norm of external election observation. This article explains how many
   dictators and dominant parties deploy shadow' election observation
   groups over professional observation groups as part of a mock compliance
   strategy. By supplanting the identity of the group judging elections and
   displacing the normative standard being applied, autocratic regimes have
   sought to gain democratic-procedural legitimation via flawed elections.
   This argument is evidenced using case studies of parliamentary and
   presidential elections in Cambodia, Zimbabwe and Egypt, which show that
   legitimation driven by shadow observation groups has become a globally
   applied strategy. The conclusion offers policy proscriptions for how to
   counteract the deployment of these groups and what the emergence of this
   phenomenon means for the study of autocratic legitimation.},

Title = {There is No Debriefing Without Prior Briefing: Writing a Briefing Memo
   as a Preparatory Activity to Make the Most of the Pedagogical Potential
   of Simulations},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE EDUCATION},

Volume = {13},

Abstract = {Simulations are traditionally divided into three phases, namely
   preparation, interaction, and debriefing. This article argues that the
   first phase has been neglected. The preparation phase is indeed widely
   seen as necessary but merely instrumental to the interaction phase of
   simulations rather than as a self-contained activity that may also
   provide an opportunity to make the most of their pedagogical potential.
   This article explains how writing a briefing memo to prepare a
   simulation challenges this taken-for-granted view. After outlining the
   reasons why I asked the students of my Introduction to International
   Relations module to write a briefing memo about the conflict in South
   Sudan in preparation for a simulation of the negotiation of a peace
   agreement, the article explains how it can be used to generate a
   stimulating class discussion. It then emphasizes how the three phases of
   the simulation fruitfully complement each other and allow teachers to go
   beyond the instrumentalist conception of the preparatory phase. Finally,
   the conclusion reflects about the ``portability{''} (Kollars and Rosen
   2016) of the briefing-negotiation-debriefing format outlined in this
   article.},

Abstract = {This article reviews the electoral accountability dimension as a
   constitutive mechanism of Paraguayan democracy since 1989, analyzing the
   factors that limit the representation contained in the administration of
   the Paraguayan government as a result of the electoral process. We
   provide an analytic contrast between the democratic principles that
   guide the Paraguayan electoral institutions and the way their designs
   are enforced, identifying the gap between formal and informal rules as
   determinants of political representation. We also describe the barriers
   that prevent effective access of the population to political
   participation and competition, the advantages possessed by traditional
   political parties and interest groups, as well as their implications for
   democracy. We also review the degree to which elected officials are
   representative of historically excluded social groups as a result,
   emphasizing the way women, indigenous and peasant communities have
   potentially limited power to exercise political influence due to
   limitations to participation by structural and institutional factors.},

Title = {A shameful debate? A critical reassessment of the `Torossian debate'},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF GENOCIDE RESEARCH},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {19},
Number = {2, SI},
Pages = {258-273},
Abstract = {For years now, a debate has been going on concerning the memoirs of
   Sarkis Torossian, published in 1947, and republished in a commented
   Turkish version in 2012. This latter publication sparked a debate among
   a number of Turkish historians, divided over the reliability or not of
   Torossian's account of his participation in the Ottoman war effort as an
   officer, and his subsequent desertion following the realization that
   most of his family had fallen victim to deportation and mass murder.
   Some challenged Torossian's narrative and evidence, based on
   inconsistencies and errors, coming to the conclusion that his story was
   largely fictionalized and his documents forged. Others, on the contrary,
   took Torossian's defence, trying to reject or to justify these
   inconsistencies, and suggesting that this criticism was likely to stem
   from a nationalist, or even denialist stand regarding the genocide of
   the Armenians. The debate has to a large extent remained contained
   within Turkey, and its rare international repercussions, including an
   article by Taner Akcam in the Journal of Genocide Research, have more or
   less systematically sided with the `pro-Torossian' side. The present
   article aims to set the record straight by showing that the criticism
   levelled against Torossian's memoirs is extremely serious and solid, and
   that the debate has been corrupted by a gradual slipping of what should
   have remained a scholarly discussion into an uncontrolled conflict based
   on ad hominem attacks and political allegations. It is my contention
   that the authenticity or not of Torossian's narrative and documents is
   of very secondary importance, compared to the much more problematic
   issue of the way in which ideological, political and moral concerns have
   ended up hijacking the debate. The ultimate relevance of the so-called
   Torossian debate may well be its capacity to reveal some crucial
   weaknesses of genocide research in a late Ottoman context.},

Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Due to quantitative expansion and evolution in committing the crime at
   the international level, the scope of criminal proceedings has been
   widened significantly. Tolerance and forgiveness towards crimes that
   happen at international level not only is a double oppression on the
   victims, but also provide a fertile context for others to commit crimes
   more daringly. Thus, it is essential that international criminals are
   held accountable to the law and competent institution, and the
   realization of this issue leads to the victim satisfaction in
   international law. Not only in international law, but also in domestic
   law, show respect and protection of human rights is effective only when
   there is an effective justice system to guarantee the rights. Although
   some international crimes practically occur by the government or at
   least high-ranking government officials, the Statute of the
   International Criminal Court has reiterated this point that they only
   have jurisdiction over the crimes committed by natural persons rather
   than legal entities, which one good example is governments, and although
   the real victims of these crimes have been human beings, in the case of
   action and referring the case to the competent international courts,
   these are the states (rather than the victims) that actually have the
   right of access to the authorities and not beneficiaries. Thus, at the
   first step, we should see whether the Court has jurisdiction over the
   crime committed by the government and whether people can file an action
   independently in the International Criminal Court or not? When people,
   rather than governments, are beneficiaries in some international crimes,
   why only the government and not the people is the plaintiff? And what is
   the right of the victim in such category of crimes? Accordingly, the
   current research seeks to examine these rights and restrictions, and
   relevant limitations.},

Abstract = {Drawing on the Marxist notion of commodity value, this article seeks to
   establish the difference between national space and global space. The
   idea of national space is anchored in the notion of use-value, whereas
   the idea of global space is bound to the exchange of commodities
   (exchange -use). Alternating between protectionism and free market, the
   cyclical nature of capitalism introduces a tendency to accentuate either
   the national space or the global space. Linked to cyclical crises in the
   free market dynamics, the crisis of neoliberalism enables the
   development of effective resistances to the system in the weak areas of
   the capitalist system such as Latin America.},

Journal = {POLITISCHE VIERTELJAHRESSCHRIFT},
Year = {2017},
Number = {52},
Pages = {218+},
Abstract = {This article analyzes the participatory process ``Review 2014 -
   Aussenpolitik weiter den ken{''} which was initiated by the German
   Federal Foreign Office in May 2014. Drawing on Iris Marion Young's works
   on deliberative democracy and political responsibility, we point to the
   tensions that emerge between the attempt to politicize foreign policy on
   the one hand, and the political elites' strive for a more active German
   role in global politics. If processes of self-reflection in the field of
   foreign policy are taken seriously, they do not necessarily end up in an
   enhanced commitment of Germany in world politics, nor in a normatively
   demanding program of political responsibility. Moreover, failing
   attempts at politicization which are initiated top-down by political
   elites, such as the ``Review{''} process, may indeed contribute to a
   fake legitimization of a foreign policy agenda which had ``more
   responsibility{''} as its preassigned goal.},

   future is uncertain. The initial expectation that the WTO would be the
   fulcrum for future international trade agreements has not been met. At
   best, its tenure has had mixed results. This review addresses the
   political consequences of WTO membership, focusing on the rules and
   norms of the regime and why they have become less functional over time;
   looks at the effectiveness of the WTO and the dispute settlement system
   in encouraging trade and compliance with agreements; and offers some
   general thoughts on the impact of shifting mass opinion on the virtue of
   trade agreements and other stumbling blocks the WTO faces.},

Abstract = {Coverage of philanthropy in Britain during the First World War is
   generally somewhat superficial, mentioning a few high profile
   organisations and suggesting they had little impact. The reality was
   very different. The numbers of people involved on a regular basis in
   charities (one-and-a-half to two million) were comparable to the numbers
   who volunteered to fight. The sums they raised were huge (at least 150
   pound million, worth around 7.5 pound billion today) and their impact on
   Britain's war effort considerable. In addition a very large number of
   Britain's approximately 20,000 war charities were run by ordinary
   working class people for the benefit of local troops or local causes.
   Their actions cemented social capital in the UK whereas, ultimately, it
   did not in Germany. The chapter also examines the establishment of the
   post of Director General of Voluntary Organizations, the highly
   innovative and effective Sir Edward Ward.},

Title = {DELIBERATIVE DEMOCRACY AND THE SYSTEMIC TURN: REPLY TO KUYPER},
Journal = {CRITICAL REVIEW},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {29},
Number = {1},
Pages = {88-119},
Abstract = {According to Jonathan Kuyper, deliberative democratic theory, having
   taken a ``systemic turn,{''} is now better able to deal with the
   complexity of the real world. Central to this development is the
   democratic `` division of epistemic labor,{''} under which experts,
   public servants, and the politically engaged may compensate for the
   relative ignorance of democratic citizens at large. However, the
   systemic turn raises the question of whether deliberation has been
   reconstituted as a means to the end of citizens' interests, or whether
   it remains an end in itself. To the extent that deliberation has been
   accepted as a means to the realization of common interests, the systemic
   turn begs the question of why we should expect the epistemic division of
   labor to be effective in identifying public policies that serve those
   interests. To the extent that deliberative democrats seek to avoid this
   problem by retaining an a priori commitment to deliberative inclusion,
   it is more than conceivable that the systemic turn will descend into a
   simplistic and unedifying form of functionalism.},

Title = {Environmental advocacy: insights from East Asia},
Journal = {ASIAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {25},
Number = {3},
Pages = {401-419},
Abstract = {Environmental advocacy in East Asia takes place in a context where there
   are few well-funded professional advocacy organizations, no viable green
   parties, and governments that are highly pro-business. In this
   advocacy-hostile environment, what strategies are environmental
   organizations using to promote better environmental outcomes? Using an
   original database of environmental organizations and interviews with
   activists and officials throughout the region, this paper investigates
   which strategies are most common, and compares them to the advocacy
   strategies found in the United States. It finds, perhaps surprisingly,
   that (a) environmental organizations across East Asia employ similar
   advocacy strategies, even though they are operating in very different
   political conditions, and (b) the strategies most favoured in East Asia
   are also the strategies most often utilized in the United States. It
   then argues that new theories of advocacy should be developed to pay
   closer attention to certain actors (academics and artists), and
   particular processes (organizational networking, government
   collaboration, and culture-making), that appear to play important roles
   in advocacy in countries around the world, irrespective of political

Title = {Ethics, morality and the case for realist political theory},
Journal = {CRITICAL REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL SOCIAL AND POLITICAL PHILOSOPHY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {20},
Number = {3},
Pages = {278-295},
Abstract = {A common trait of all realistic political theories is the rejection of a
   conception of political theory as applied moral philosophy and an
   attempt to preserve some form of distinctively political thinking. Yet
   the reasons for favouring such an account of political theory can vary,
   a point that has often been overlooked in recent discussions by
   realism's friends and critics alike. While a picture of realism as
   first-and-foremost an attempt to develop a more practical political
   theory which does not reduce morality to politics is often cited, in
   this paper we present an alternative understanding in which the
   motivation to embrace realism is grounded in a set of critiques of or
   attitudes towards moral philosophy which then feed into a series of
   political positions. Political realism, on this account, is driven by a
   set of philosophical concerns about the nature of ethics and the place
   of ethical thinking in our lives. This impulse is precisely what
   motivated Bernard Williams and Raymond Geuss to their versions of
   distinctively realist political thought and is important to emphasise
   because it demonstrates that realism does not set politics against
   ethics (a misunderstanding typically endorsed by realism's critics) but
   is rather an attempt to philosophise about politics without relying on
   understandings of morality which we have little reason to endorse.},

Abstract = {The political science profession, like other social sciences, is under
   pressure from many quarters to demonstrate its relevance'. This need
   arises primarily from requirements for universities to justify public
   investment in their teaching and research. Competition across the full
   range of science and humanities disciplines for public and private
   funding makes this an important challenge for all. This article reflects
   on how political scientists have seen the public value of their
   professional work. It concludes by suggesting some alternative ways of
   thinking about relevance, value and impact.},

Abstract = {This paper presents the concept of ``genocide discourses{''}, defined as
   a type of strategic narrative that shapes the way individuals and groups
   position themselves and others and act, playing a critical role in the
   production of violence and efforts to reduce it. Genocide discourses
   tend to present genocide as fundamentally a-political, and hold that
   genocidal systems are dislodged only when they are swept away through
   external violence. Secondly, genocide discourses are built on an
   assumption that the victims of genocide are necessarily moral innocents,
   not parties in conflict. These two factors make genocide discourses
   highly effective in conferring moral capital upon certain actors in a
   conflict. The two principles converge to produce strategic narratives
   that direct political and military actions in certain ways in the
   context of contentious conflicts and political violence, motivating
   humanitarian responses in defense of certain groups, or sustaining
   popular support for foreign wars. The paper illustrates the argument by
   examining two case studies between 2014 and 2017: the debates in the
   United States over Islamic State genocides, and the conflict between
   Ukraine and Russia.},

Title = {Quasi-citizenship as a category of practice: analyzing engagement with
   Russia's Compatriot policy in Crimea},
Journal = {CITIZENSHIP STUDIES},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {21},
Number = {1},
Pages = {116-135},
Abstract = {This article analyzes engagement with Russia's Compatriot policy, as an
   example of ethnizenship-type of quasi-citizenship, in Crimea, as the
   most likely case of Compatriot engagement. The article focuses on
   unpacking the lived experience of Compatriot identification and
   engagement and the rationale for this engagement. The article finds a
   narrow and niche engagement with the Compatriot policy in Crimea where
   only the most politicized and discriminated individuals, alongside
   beneficiaries of the Compatriot policy, identify as Compatriots.
   However, the article also finds dissatisfaction with the Compatriot
   policy because it fails to offer the kind of status, and rights and
   benefits, of full' citizenship. Thus, while citizenship might be
   becoming fractured, via quasi-citizenship policies, citizenship remains
   the key point of entry to the kin-state. Focusing on the lived
   experience of quasi-citizenship, and examining quasi-citizenship as a
   category of practice, is crucial for developing understanding of the
   social and political impacts of quasi-citizenship policies.},

Journal = {CITIZENSHIP STUDIES},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {21},
Number = {5},
Pages = {570-586},
Abstract = {This article argues for the relevance of a rhetorical approach to the
   study of citizenship, proposing the concept of rhetorical citizenship as
   a term for a fourth dimension of citizenship and as a scholarly approach
   to the topic in addition to the dimensions of status, rights, and
   identity commonly recognized in the literature. We show how this view
   aligns with current views of the multidi Citizenship Studies
   mensionality of citizenship, explain our use of the term rhetoric, and
   illustrate the usefulness of a rhetorical approach in two examples. In
   close textual readings both examples - one vernacular, one elite - are
   shown to discursively craft and enact different notions of citizenship
   vis-a-vis the European refugee crisis. We conclude that a rhetorical
   perspective on public civic discourse is useful in virtue of its close
   attention to discursive creativity as well as to textual properties that
   may significantly, but often implicitly, affect citizens' understanding
   of their own role in the polity, and further because it recognizes deep
   differences as inevitable while valorizing discourse across them.},

Abstract = {The large influx of refugees into Germany in late 2015 gave rise to a
   period of intensified party competition over a single issue: refugees.
   This paper examines German parties' reactions to this issue suddenly
   becoming highly important and voter preferences shifting to a more
   restrictive stance. It does so by analysing the parties' positions on
   the issue from August to November 2015 based on statements from more
   than 1000 quality newspaper articles. The analysis shows that there was
   no uniform shift in line with the change in public opinion but a pattern
   of polarisation. Moreover, converging party position changes sparked
   intra-party criticism that was in turn followed by divergence - a
   pattern observable for the Green Party as well as for the Christian
   Democrats. Altogether, these findings suggest that policy motives, which
   induce intra-party dissent, impede parties opportunistically trying to
   follow shifts in public opinion in the short term.},

Title = {A Hint at Entrepreneurial Parties? The Case of Four New Successful

Journal = {POLITOLOGICKY CASOPIS-CZECH JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2017},

Pages = {158-178},
Abstract = {Since the 2011 elections several new Slovenian parties have recorded
   exceptional results and two newcomers even received a plurality vote in
   the 2011 and 2014 elections. Some scholars believe that, along with the
   successful new parties, a new party model has also developed. Therefore,
   we employed several key dimensions to find out whether four Slovenian
   new successful parties (List of Zoran Jankovic - Positive Slovenia,
   Citizen List of Gregor Virant - Citizen List, Party of Miro Cerar -
   Party of Modern Centre, and Alliance of Alenka Bratusek - Alliance of
   Social-Liberal Democrats) have exhibited elements of entrepreneurial
   parties. Analysis of several dimensions (party origin, resources in
   election campaign, party organisation and electoral appeals) reveals
   many similarities among the four parties but also that they can be
   classified as entrepreneurial parties (mainly when the minimal
   conceptualisation of this party model is used) only in some fragments
   and with some important reservations.},

Abstract = {The author of this article shows that many Russian and foreign
   sociologists believe the main function of sociology is the diagnostics
   of the society and offer tools for its analysis. In this context, the
   exclusive theoretical and methodological tools of sociological diagnosis
   developed by Mikhail Gorshkov, a full member of RAS, occupy a special
   place and combine interdisciplinary and contextual approaches. Their
   application made it possible to obtain valid results of real conditions
   of Russia over the past quarter of a century, on the basis of which a
   forecast of its future is given taking into account the current global
   and national realities. M. Gorshkov proposes a rethinking of the Russian
   development strategy along with its reorientation on the realization of
   socio-economic tasks and on the achievement of the humanitarian goals of
   social development. Accordingly, new management is in demand including
   an essential social and humanitarian component of the development and
   the reproduction of social and human capital on the basis of highly
   developed areas of science, culture, and education. The diagnostics
   tools identify and justify the means of optimizing the social life of
   Russians. These means include: socio-humanitarian expertise; the
   conditions for free activity of individuals; national version of the
   democratic system ensuring the reproduction of social trust in political
   institutions; the establishment of education as a means to meet the
   challenges of Russia; humanization of the economy aimed at building
   social and human capital. According to the M. Gorshkov's sociological
   diagnostics, the Russian society has become complex, more differentiated
   and multi-layered with a permanent process of technological and
   socio-cultural renewal; actually, the Russians formed their awareness of
   belonging to the European and the Eurasian worlds.},

Abstract = {The current research assessed whether political satire viewing could
   indirectly promote interpersonal talk about politics by eliciting
   emotions. The theoretical model was tested utilizing both experimental
   and survey designs. The findings indicated good agreement, demonstrating
   that negative emotions significantly mediate and reinforce the effect of
   political satire viewing on interpersonal talk. Conversely, the process
   wherein traditional news sources motivate interpersonal talk is mostly
   direct, with little development of affective responses. The results
   suggest that political satire can help to paint a sanguine picture of a
   healthy deliberative democracy mainly through an affective rather than
   cognitive route.},

Abstract = {The Europeans' perception of China has been investigated mainly from
   four perspectives, including the impression of China, China's
   responsibility, China's threat and the future development of China. The
   surveys show that the European public's views towards China are
   contradictory, and are pessimistic and passive in their attitudes
   concerning the impression of China, China's responsibility and threat,
   and China-EU cooperation in the future. In the past 10 years, this
   negative mood of the European public towards China is increasing while
   the positive one is decreasing. However, regarding China's future
   development, the European public generally ``has confidence{''} in
   China. The European people's perception of China is influenced by a
   number of complex factors including globalization and the European
   sovereign debt crisis, the poor image of the Chinese people abroad and
   the survey agencies' methodology. In addition, the opinion survey
   agencies in the USA have played a very important role in shaping the
   Europeans' views towards China.},

Title = {The paradoxes of Maori-state inclusion: the case study of the hiwa
   Harbour Strategy},
Journal = {POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {69},
Number = {3},
Pages = {195-213},
Abstract = {This article analyses the politics of policy engagement in a
   postcolonial society. In 2002, the local government in the Eastern Bay
   of Plenty region of New Zealand entered into an engagement process with
   local maori tribes (iwi) and subtribes (hapu) to develop a conservation
   plan for their local water resources. The 4years of highly successful
   engagement with three iwi and one hapu culminated in a long-term plan,
   the Ohiwa Harbour Strategy (2008), to manage and conserve the Ohiwa
   Harbour built on shared values for joint action. Using the concept of
   procedural inclusion' adapted from critical feminist political theory,
   this paper evaluates the paradoxes and politics underlying the inclusion
   of Maori into the processes of inclusive state policymaking, especially
   when those processes have been specifically designed to be culturally
   sensitive. The analysis highlights the contradictions of Maori
   inclusion, particularly around issues of representation of iwi or who is
   legitimately included, and the discursive politics of partnerships in
   light of historical considerations.},

Abstract = {Exemplified by the informal participation of citizens in urban planning
   projects we address the question of whether and how the implementation
   of participatory events contribute to the diffusion of political
   responsibility. Although the citizens hope to directly take part in the
   political decision-making, their experiences in urban planning projects
   show that a delegation of political responsibility by means of
   deliberative techniques almost never occurs. Instead, investors and
   other private-sector stakeholders nowadays often turn out to be the
   decisive partners of the authorities. From citizen's perspective, those
   kinds of partnership impede the accountability of political
   responsibility.},

Abstract = {Professionalization process of women shellfish gatherers in Galicia is
   an example of governance with a gender perspective. This initiative is
   defined by women participation at all stages of the policy, horizontal
   relationships between them and expert and political teams, and a
   positive impact in the inequality of female situation. In this regard,
   work and experiences of these workers are located in fisheries
   communities, where the sex-gender system logics are reproduced. These
   societies are constructed on the basis of sea and land pair, that embody
   the hierarchical dualities of public-private space and
   production-reproduction. However, their participation in the
   professionalization policy, promoted by Galician government in the
   nineties, causes some changes in material and social issues, in addition
   to individual and collective empowerment. The methodology of this
   article is based on a compilation of reports, press analysis and
   in-depth interviews to technicians and workers. This information is used
   to reconstruct this process and to examine how a gender perspective
   impacts results, design, management and organization of this
   participation process. Thus, this governance experience democratizes
   fisheries structures in inclusiveness terms. However, this experience is
   not transformative because it does not challenge androcentric rules of
   such communities.},
