Abstract = {This research examines the part played by the United States and Russia
   in the prolonged catastrophe in Syria. Syria (a strategic ally of
   Russia) has been enveloped by civil hostilities since 2011. Inspired by
   the `Arab Spring' that swept through the region in 2011, what started as
   a fundamental challenge and strong opposition to Bashir al-Assad's
   over-lordship has exploded into a full blown internal warfare, pitting
   government forces and their foreign allies led by Russia against a range
   of anti-government rebels and their overseas sponsors spearheaded by the
   United States. As the war rages on, the role being played by the two key
   external forces (US and Russia) has come under serious scrutiny. Pulling
   from qualitative data collected through secondary sources, this paper
   argues that the supremacy struggle between US and Russia has contributed
   in exacerbating rather than ameliorating the situation. The study
   recommends that there is every and urgent need for the Syrian people
   themselves especially the leadership to look inwards with a view to
   finding a lasting solution to the unrest as continued reliance on
   external forces will spell doom to the prospects of peace in Syria.},

Abstract = {Can public deliberation improve the way police treat people of color?
   The imbalance of power between state officials and historically
   oppressed communities makes many theorists skeptical of deliberative
   approaches. Our case study of police-community forums in a mid-sized
   Southern city suggests that efforts to ensure the legitimacy of such
   approaches in settings of inequality may be enhanced by intertwining,
   and even blurring, understanding-oriented dialogue and more agonistic
   interventions. Any legitimacy generated by the deliberative process in
   such settings is likely to be tentative, because the full force of
   mutual confidence arising from that dialogue will come into being only
   if talking is followed by clear accountability in the form of concrete
   reforms taken by the police. Even so, such deliberative attempts may
   open up the constitution of reforms in ways that are advantageous to the
   community.},

Abstract = {Modern presidencies are characterized by the coherent White House staff
   that seamlessly move from the campaign into the White House to implement
   the new president's agenda. Campaign staff built the policy agenda
   during the months-long if not years-long campaign, revised it to meet
   political demands at every juncture, and entered their White House
   offices with a clear view of how to achieve the campaign's goals. In
   contrast, few members of the Trump White House staff moved from the
   campaign into the White House which soon became plagued by multiple
   power centers and limited agreement on the president's broad agenda. In
   general, the Trump staff were unknown to each other and held quite
   different world visions, varying from extreme nationalists to
   globalists. This research examines the multiple power centers, the power
   voids, and the tools of power exercised in the White House. By the end
   of the first 7 months, the decision process had moved from groupthink to
   multiple advocacy to the coalition presidency.},

Abstract = {We show how symbolic politics condition public opinion on federal
   spending and how this helps to explain an important puzzle in
   contemporary American politics. Using multilevel regression and
   poststratification to estimate state-level opinion on federal spending,
   we show that, curiously, opposition to federal spending is higher in
   states receiving more federal money, per tax dollar paid. Belying the
   popular narrative surrounding so-called red state socialism, we find
   that simple hypocrisy does not explain this paradoxindividuals who are
   likely to benefit from spending tend to support it. But, income is a
   more powerful predictor of opinion on spending in taker states than
   giver states, heightening state-level opposition in the former. There is
   also more to the story than economic self-interest. Symbolic racism is
   four times more powerful than income in explaining opposition to
   spending, and there are more people with such attitudes in states
   receiving more federal money.},

Abstract = {Because insurgent group formation typically occurs in secrecy and in
   poorly monitored areas, the empirical record on conflicts' start is
   spare and systematically omits rebels who fail before committing
   substantial violence. This article argues that this presents a
   fundamental challenge for the study of conflict onset and demonstrates
   the theoretical and empirical problems it causes in studying a
   controversial relationship: how ethnicity influences armed conflicts'
   start. Unusual evidence on all armed groups that formed in Uganda since
   1986 indicates that ethnic mobilization was unimportant to the initial
   formation of rebel groupsbut mattered after nascent groups had already
   formed. Contrasting evidence from Uganda with a prominent argument that
   ethnic marginalization induces rebellion shows why lack of evidence
   about how insurgencies begin can lead to broader inferential pitfalls.},

Abstract = {In recent decades, observers of Congress have devoted increasing
   attention to the phenomenon of the revolving door, whereby members of
   Congress and staffers go on to careers in lobbying. This practice raises
   a number of normative concerns that are perhaps most heightened when it
   comes to the lobbying activities of members of Congress themselves. In
   this article, I examine the factors determining which former members go
   through the revolving door, and find that members with central network
   positions and highly effective legislators are more likely to become
   lobbyists. I then examine the extent to which members-turned-lobbyists
   have an impact on bills in Congress. I find evidence that lobbying by
   former members increases a bill's probability of progressing and some
   evidence that highly effective legislators also go on to become more
   effective lobbyists. Taken together, these findings support conventional
   wisdom that former members become some of the most influential
   lobbyists.},

Abstract = {Literature ruling current documents in resolutions of the UN in coping
   with violence and extremism is based on the ``Action{''} after violence.
   Although the UN has considered the issue ``Fundamental Prevention{''} in
   case of extremism and violence over recent years, it seems that there is
   not any agreement on it among the UN members, in particular permanent
   members of the Security Council. Resolution against Violence and
   Extremism, which was submitted to General Assembly, emphasizes on
   initial prevention from violence and extremism criticizing use of force.
   According to this Resolution, if the reflected slogans are realized and
   if countries are adherent to law sovereignty in practice, it will be
   possible to cope with violence and extremism internationally. Otherwise,
   violence would change to extremism and ``terrorism{''} gradually so that
   not only a country but also world community will be affected. Reliance
   of countries just on Security Council regardless of regional mechanisms
   against violence is a criticism against the UN. In this regard, regional
   organizations can better react to crises compared to trans-regional
   organizations in accordance with their knowledge about neighboring
   countries' governments and people. The results of this study show there
   are some potential capacities in some countries, in Particular Islamic
   Republic of Iran, to persuade pacifist countries to cope with violence
   and extremism.},

Abstract = {The global ascendancy that populism has gained in recent years resulted
   in two major developments: (a) the geographical spread of populism to an
   increasing number of countries, to the extent that in regions such as
   the Americas and Europe populism appears as the main contender of
   mainstream politics; (b) populism shifting from the margins to the
   center stage of politics, a development that resulted in the passage of
   populism as a movement to populism as government. A central hypothesis
   guiding this article is that populism in government is likely to promote
   a specific path to regime change: one consisting of the gradual
   hybridization of the structure of liberal democracy through the
   selective removal of some of the latter's defining features. The
   contemporary proliferation of populist administrations in Europe and the
   Americas should consequently not be taken lightly: they might be
   announcing political processes that can ultimately result in a drastic
   redefinition of the landscape of current democratic politics in an
   illiberal direction.},

Abstract = {Moving from a discussion of the liberal interpretations of Jeremy
   Bentham's political thought, this paper analyses the role played by the
   public opinion Tribunal within his constitutional project. It is argued
   that in Bentham's view this institution should perform a societal
   function and affect not only the governors, but also the governed, who
   are supposed to be its ``functionaries{''}. The paper provides a reading
   of Bentham's theory of public opinion and its constitutional role within
   the frames of the American and the French Revolution. Bentham's
   conception of opinion is compared with those articulated by some of his
   main theoretical sources, such as Hobbes, Locke, Hume, De Lolme, and
   Necker. Through this comparison, Bentham's science of opinion will be
   exposed as the effect of his understanding of society as a space
   characterized by an immanent normativity, that must be incorporated and
   institutionalized by legislation and the constitutional code.},

Abstract = {It is traditionally argued that the topic of European integration is
   rather absent or under-discussed in French political debate. In this
   context, it came as a surprise that the 2017 French presidential
   election turned into a `referendum sur l'appartenance a l'Union' (Costa
   2017). This article argues that after many presidential campaigns where
   Europe remained `the elephant in the room', 2017 saw its settling as a
   clear line of cleavage between political parties, relegating the
   traditional left/right cleavage to a secondary position. The
   politicisation of socio-economic questions at European level also
   signalled a move away from the traditional value-based Eurosceptic
   grounds towards a will to shape the debate in the direction of a more
   social Europe.},

Abstract = {Article II(b) of the UN Genocide Convention is rarely applied to a
   specific case in genocide studies. The Australian Aboriginal experience
   illustrates Article II(a) physical killing and II(e) child removal well
   enough. But in the longer term, II(b)causing serious bodily or mental
   harmhas been the major process in destroying Aboriginal life and culture
   since the start of the twentieth century. The physical harm is readily
   detectable, but it is essentially the serious mental harm aspect that is
   examined here.},

Abstract = {In addition to global and national labor migration policies,
   regional-level strategies can contribute to the protection of
   Association of Southeast Asian Nations' (ASEAN's) low and unskilled
   migrant workers. However, there is a need for ASEAN and its partners to
   work with contextual specificities, including ASEAN's normative
   framework, conditions within its member-states, and civil society, while
   at the same time also complement global initiatives. ASEAN is
   well-placed to promote and protect the rights of migrant workers in the
   region, despite current shortcomings. However, this can only be done if
   ASEAN integrates itself within national and international institutions
   and standards, rather than be a separate level of governance squeezed in
   between the domestic and the global. In essence, ASEAN must move from
   being a disjointed to a complementary actor.},

Abstract = {How does political change occur in subnational units of federal systems?
   Long under conservative rule, Brazil's state of Bahia has experienced
   the recent electoral rise of the Workers' Party (PT). How has the left
   party wrested control from the right? Challenging previous studies,
   which focus on establishing new organizational networks, we emphasize
   the traditional leveraging of linkages to higher levels of government
   and forging of pragmatic alliances. Marked parallels between PT
   strategies in contemporary Bahia and those of the old political machine
   suggest the pursuit of a territorially segmented strategy to penetrate
   different subnational units. The PT, which had hoped to transform the
   existing system, was instead changed by it. Segmentation allowed the PT
   to win office but at the cost of its transformational project.},

Abstract = {The persistence of the debate between living constitutionalists and
   originalists in the United States is often attributed to motives of
   political expediency on one or both sides. Without denying the influence
   of such motives, this article maintains that the debate persists also
   because of an inevitable fraying of the connection between the written
   Constitution and the popular consent that is meant to underpin it. In
   order to clarify the problem, I turn to Thomas Jefferson's earth belongs
   to the living letter, which is less idiosyncratic and perhaps also less
   idealistic than generally believed, and which shows how written
   constitutionalism might have been better combined with the consent of
   the people over the long term. In sum, this article offers a revised
   view of a controversial aspect of Jefferson's thought and, with it, a
   revised view of a central debate in contemporary American politics.},

Abstract = {The impeachment of President Park Gyeun-hye on 10 March 2017 saw South
   Korean politics enter a period of crisis. Her removal from office, the
   result of an unprecedented mass movement of citizen protests, provided a
   springboard for the subsequent success of the liberal candidate, Moon
   Jae-in, in the presidential election of 9 May 2017. This article
   suggests that political change in South Korea is only possible if actors
   move beyond the politics of personality, and tackle the structural
   reasons for the policy failures of recent times. Further, if democracy,
   a humane economic system and responsive political institutions are going
   to be developed and nourished, the country's imperial presidency' needs
   to be reformed. In particular, the current winner-takes-all' politics,
   with the presidency as the main locus of power, needs to be reformed in
   ways that promote a more balanced political system, increasing the
   influence of other actors and institutions.},

   3) innovation system and 4) information infrastructure. The pillars
   comprise 16 variables, plus two that refer to performance: The average
   annual rate of GDP growth and Human Development Index. The 18 variables
   were measured using the methodology provided by the World Bank, known as
   KAM. Knowledge Assessment Methodology. Of the selected countries, Mexico
   ranked in the last place regarding the institutional regime and in some
   indicators of education and innovation systems. In terms of information
   and communications infrastructure, China was the worst positioned

Journal = {JOURNAL OF THEORETICAL POLITICS},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {29},
Number = {3},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {This paper focuses on the introduction of higher re-election bars for
   office-holders. In particular, we assess which re-election bars are
   optimal when incumbents gain socially valuable experience in office. We
   develop a two-period model in which the output of a public good depends
   on an office-holder's effort, ability and experience. When campaigning
   for election to an open seat in the first period, candidates can make
   binding offers of the minimum share of the votes they must obtain to be
   re-elected in the second period, should they win in the first. We prove
   that, in equilibrium, both candidates offer the same vote-share
   threshold, that it exceeds 50\%, and that it is socially optimal. The
   higher threshold increases the expected effort over both periods and
   tends to raise the expected level of ability of office-holders in the
   second. Together, these effects outweigh the expected loss of
   incumbents' acquired experience, which results from their reduced
   chances of getting re-elected with the higher bar. The socially optimal
   vote threshold is increasing in the value of experience. All of the
   above conclusions would hold if the optimal threshold were set instead
   by law.},

Abstract = {The study of party system institutionalization in Latin America is
   complicated by the fact that political development in the region has
   been indelibly marked by period-specific stages and challenges of
   capitalist development. These periods are associated with distinct
   patterns of social mobilization, class conflict and political
   incorporation or exclusion of labour and popular constituencies. These
   patterns heavily condition the programmatic structuring of partisan
   competition and its impact on party system institutionalization.
   Important theoretical insights can be derived from the study of
   intra-regional variation in period-specific challenges and effects, but
   this requires careful attention to the factors that differentiate cases.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF POLITICS},

Abstract = {Previous studies suggest that women's access to political power often
   increases following the termination of civil conflicts, particularly
   those ending in negotiated settlement. However, the effect of these
   changes has received limited attention. We argue that the proportion of
   female representatives in a national legislature prolongs peace
   following a negotiated settlement. Moreover, we highlight two mechanisms
   through which greater female representation reduces the risk of conflict
   recurrence: (1) by prioritizing social welfare spending over military
   spending and (2) by improving public perceptions of good governance and
   the credibility of political elites. We further argue that legislative
   independence and authority conditions this relationship, implying that
   greater female representation is more likely to promote peace in states
   with nominally democratic political institutions. Our empirical analyses
   of peace duration following negotiated settlements between 1946 and 2011
   provide robust support for our general argument and the underlying
   mechanisms we believe drive this relationship.},

Abstract = {This article analyses the drivers of individual dissent in floor voting
   in parliamentary regimes. It focuses on the effect of ideological
   heterogeneity in legislative parties on individual MPs' voting
   behaviour, as well as the different incentives caused by the differing
   consequences of defection and abstention. Combining individual-level
   survey and voting data from the Swedish Riksdag, neither of which is
   subject to selection bias, the study overcomes several limitations of
   previous research. It shows that MPs' decisions to dissent are partly
   driven by ideological differences with their party, but also by the
   imperatives of maintaining a government majority in a parliamentary
   regime, along with the level of influence MPs exert on legislation. It
   also highlights the importance of distinguishing between abstaining from
   voting and defecting. Merely pooling the two oversimplifies the
   behaviour of MPs.},

Abstract = {The work deals with the case of the resignation of vice-president,
   Carlos Alvarez in October 2000, as an example in which a clear
   divergence between the forms and the individual intervention strategies
   (with dynamic and perfectly rational incentives) and the produced
   results to which end this led and collectively involving a high cost. To
   achieve this objective, this work is divided into six parts. A first one
   in which the dynamics of the formation of the Alliance and its
   individual leaders is analyzed; then it will lead to explain the
   constraints and tensions both group and individual who found the members
   of the Alliance to come to power; in the third section positions and
   strategies of the three top leaders of the Alliance will be addressed to
   explain how they structured a field of action close to the collision; in
   the fourth part will discuss the escalating confrontation between the
   president and his vice president; the sixth will be explained under what
   logic of action came the resignation of the vice president. Finally,
   this paper closes with some conclusions.},

Abstract = {Isaiah Berlin contributed significantly to the study of the history of
   nationalist ideas in modern Europe, to the revival among political
   theorists (and others) of interest in nationalism as a theory, and to
   the articulation of theories of `'liberal nationalism'' in the 1990s.
   Berlin was also a life-long Zionist, whose reflections on the impulses
   behind nationalism owed much to his reflection on the condition of Jews
   in the diaspora. While Berlin's views on nationalism have long claimed
   attention, and while there has more recently been excellent work done on
   his Jewish identity and commitment to Zionism, the connection between
   both his liberalism and his views on nationalism, and his personal
   background and experiences, remains to be more fully explored. Deploying
   biographical reconstruction and textual analysis, I here undertake to
   draw such connections, emphasizing how Berlin's personal condition and
   the response to nationalism that it influenced in turn shaped his
   liberalism. I conclude that Berlin's experiences coming from a
   specifically Russian-Jewish background, as well as his position in
   British society, his wartime service in the British government, and his
   intellectual formation, significantly shaped his views on nationalism. I
   also suggest that both his response to nationalism and his advocacy of a
   distinctive liberalism reflect Berlin's commitment (never made fully
   explicit) to a pluralistic ethos, which itself may be seen as a response
   to the condition of Jews (and other minorities and migrants) in the
   modern world.},

Abstract = {This study seeks to determine whether subjects in two dynamic process
   tracing experiments react differently to information related to a
   candidate's competence when that candidate is a woman, vs. when he is a
   man. I find that subjects evaluate a candidate whose competence is in
   doubt less favorably, and are less likely to vote for the candidate,
   when she is a woman. In general, evaluations of women seem to be
   influenced much more by information related to their competence than are
   evaluations of men. I also find that competence as portrayed by the
   composition of a candidate's facial features does not alter this
   relationship. My findings suggest that gender-based stereotypes may have
   an indirect effect on candidate evaluations and vote choice by
   influencing how voters react to information about them.},

Abstract = {Australian exceptionalism has long been claimed in diverse fields. This
   essay reconsiders claims for Australian exceptionalism first discussing
   its nature. Exceptionalism cannot simply be uniqueness since everywhere
   is unique at some level of granularity, thus the level of detail at
   which countries or places are compared must be equivalent. One mistake
   is to take one country as the exception whilst lumping everywhere else
   together. It argues exceptionalism requires a rule systematically
   explaining difference. The best bet for such a rule is the Australia's
   political institutions. It argues Australian exceptionalism has not been
   demonstrated, however, the claim is not of that nature, is a declaration
   made by Australians to distinguish their subject from the dominion of
   British commentators on Australian affairs.},

Abstract = {The mainstreaming of climate change through processes of media
   communication and political advocacy carries with it an imagined public.
   Drawing on qualitative data from 11 focus groups and 19 life history
   interviews carried out in the Republic of Ireland(1) in 2010, the paper
   reveals a significant mismatch between the perceived characteristics of
   this imagined audience, and the practices and experiences of a socially
   embedded Irish public. Moreover, we observe the emergence of restrictive
   forms of discourse around climate change that leave little room for
   connecting with the topic, thereby serving to delegitimise it as a
   matter of public interest. Given the necessity for climate action and
   decarbonisation efforts that reach across diverse social and cultural
   arenas, we see potential for a broadening of public debate in line with
   key principles of deliberative democracy, with a view to achieving a
   more open and inclusive politics of climate change. Although we
   recognise the limitations of mainstream deliberative democracy thinking,
   including its inherent rationalism, we believe that its explicit
   commitment to inclusiveness and transparency offers a viable alternative
   to current disengagement and exclusion of citizens from meaningful
   climate change debate and action.},

Abstract = {The European Commission has proposed a refugee distribution key, which
   yields respective quotas for European Union/European Free Trade
   Association member states. It is based on four quantities: GDP,
   population, asylum applications per capita in the past, and unemployment
   rates. I show that the given distribution key has properties which
   contradict the European Commission's intentions. Exemplarily, states
   with low (high) unemployment may experience a lower (higher) quota when
   unemployment is taken into account compared to when it is not. These
   deviations are single-digit percentages. As a remedy, I propose an
   alternative distribution key, which avoids the undesired properties. It
   is modeled in the spirit of the European Commission's proposal and is
   based on the same four quantities. Deviations between the two
   distribution keys are up to two-digit percentages.},

Abstract = {Political communication sets the context for a conversation between the
   political leaders and masses. A productive strategy of political
   communication would be one that successfully mobilizes its recipients
   for the purpose at hand which could be for a protest or for electoral
   support. One such strategy of communication and mobilization typical to
   democratic politics in India is the `padayatra', which while being
   traditional also has a spiritual lineage. The padayatra was effectively
   used by Mahatma Gandhi to rally together the masses during the freedom
   movement, and it continues to be a politically relevant strategy used
   not only for mobilization but also for partisan gains that capitalize on
   its imagery. Electoral padayatras provide an opportunity to the
   politician to interact with voters in a substantive manner, understand
   their weltanschauung and enable its achievement. The purpose of this
   article is to map the changing nature of the padayatra and its
   appropriation by political parties as a tool of political communication.},

Title = {Does Conditionality Still Work? China's Development Assistance and
   Democracy in Africa},
Journal = {CHINESE POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {2},
Number = {2},
Pages = {201-220},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Previous studies have found that the democratizing effect of conditional
   aid is temporally contingent: the collapse of the Soviet Union as an
   alternative source of aid enhanced the effectiveness of Western aid
   conditionality with respect to democratic reforms being adopted in
   Africa. Does conditionality still work with China's rise as a major
   donor since the early 2000s? This article examines this question by
   leveraging the first Forum on China-Africa Cooperation (FOCAC) as the
   temporal dividing point and new measures of Chinese aid to Africa, based
   on expert opinions and media reports. The results show that the
   democratizing effects of the OECD's development aid in Sub-Saharan
   Africa have indeed diminished. Furthermore, results from a synthetic
   control analysis suggest that major recipients of Chinese economic
   assistance did not achieve higher levels of political freedom than other
   comparable countries in the post-FOCAC period. These findings support
   the thesis that the democratizing effect of aid conditionality works
   only during a period when recipient countries do not have other
   alternative sources of aid, allowing donors to more credibly commit to
   enforcing conditionality.},

Abstract = {The provision of high-quality feedback is crucial to student experience,
   but it is increasingly challenging for academic staff to fully meet
   student expectations. One response is to use simple, freely available
   screen capture technology to offer individual video assessment feedback
   at no extra cost to staff time. This article will outline exactly how
   this relatively new technology can be harnessed and how students have
   responded to feedback delivery in this form at the University of
   Reading. The article will argue that screen capture software has
   significant potential to enhance the student experience of feedback
   provision but is currently highly underutilised in UK Higher Education.},

Volume = {39},

Abstract = {Why do some individuals prefer to be governed in an authoritarian
   political system? One intuitive answer is that citizens prefer
   authoritarian rule when the economy and society are in turmoil. These
   are common explanations for democratic backsliding, and the emergence
   and success of authoritarian leaders in the twentieth century. Which of
   these explanations better explains preferences for authoritarian rule?
   Both types of threat coincide in small samples and high-profile cases,
   creating inferential problems. I address this by using three waves of
   World Values Survey data to look at individual-level preferences for
   different forms of authoritarian government. Using multiple
   macroeconomic and societal indicators, I find that economic threats,
   especially increasing income inequality, better explain preferences for
   authoritarian government. I conclude with implications for understanding
   the emergence of support for authoritarianism in fledgling democracies.},

Abstract = {Most inequality researchers in Mexico have concluded that although
   income inequality is very high, there is a downward trend in this
   inequality. They have come to this conclusion because they have used
   official income figures from household surveys without making any
   correction. In contrast, this study proposes an adjustment to income
   data from household income and expenditure surveys, based on national
   accounts. Adjusted figures show that inequality is high and increasing,
   due to public policies implemented since the mid-1980s. Therefore, we
   must dare to think differently and change the economic course of the
   country.},

Journal = {PARTY POLITICS},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {23},
Number = {3},
Pages = {181-192},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {The minimal effect theory of campaign studies stipulates that intense
   political competition during campaigns assures and reinforces the
   initial party choice of the electorate. We find that this reinforcement
   is two-fold. During the campaign, the party preference of the voters'
   in-group party increases while the party preference of the voters'
   out-group parties decreases. Voters' preference for their most preferred
   party (MPP) increases during the election campaign, while their
   preference for their least liked party decreases during the campaign
   (LPP). Across parties voters experience an increase in their preference
   for their most preferred party and a decrease for their least liked
   party as the campaign progresses. These trends show that the political
   campaign polarizes the electorate by increasing the affective distance
   between in-group party and out-group party preferences, thereby
   resulting in stronger political polarization after the campaign than
   before the campaign. The data utilized in this study is a large six-wave
   panel-study of Danish voters' party preferences during the Danish
   parliamentary election of 2011. Thus, the analysis provides evidence of
   the minimal effect theory and of political polarization within a
   multi-party context.},

Abstract = {Whether elected representatives should be responsive to the wishes of
   the majority of citizens has been an issue often discussed from a
   normative perspective. This article shifts the focus by looking at the
   determinants of support for responsiveness among citizens. Its core
   argument is that attitudes toward responsiveness vary systematically
   depending on the policy gains an individual can expect from a government
   that is responsive to the preferences of the majority of citizens. The
   analysis of data from the European Social Survey and 21 countries
   confirms these expectations. Individuals whose ideological stances are
   reflected well by the incumbent government are less favorable to the
   idea that governments should be responsive to the preferences of the
   majority, while one's proximity to the ideological location of the
   median citizen increases the odds of support for majority
   responsiveness. Our findings are stable across a large variety of
   European democracies.},

Abstract = {Approaches to depoliticisation have tended to focus on its use as a
   domestic strategy. Where the literature tends to be lacking is in
   consideration of its international role. This article examines the way
   in which imperialist policies have been depoliticized through
   technically managed or apparently economic institutions. It explores the
   way in which British imperial strategy was depoliticised by the use of
   the Sterling Area, analysing an episode in British-Malayan relations in
   which the apolitical character of the Sterling Area was brought into
   question.},

Abstract = {In Argentina, since December 2015 and in the postkirchnerista scenario,
   there have been massive dismissals of state employees throughout the
   country, this shows a growing conflict that in the discursive practices
   positions the public employee facing officials, media and sectors of
   society in The use of terms that link and identify negatively both
   ``militancy{''} and ``state worker.{''} Faced with this use, the
   strategy of recovery and resignification of the organizations of state
   workers is a form of resistance and is done from the key of identity as
   a working class to rebuild the militant dimension and reject the biased
   look that positions them in a zone of suspicion and rejection. `We are
   not gnocchi, we are workers{''} is the response of the guilds and
   spontaneous associations of dismissed employees in this new conflict and
   confrontation scenario. In the scenario of conflict between the workers
   and Cambiemos, this strategy of stigmatization marks a new stage of the
   attempt to close the militancy in the field of public and state and
   against which unions like ATE (State Workers Association) in Argentina,
   develop micro-strategies of discursive resistance.},

Abstract = {This article provides the first systematic cross-country analysis of
   interest group appearances in the news media. The analysis included
   three countries - the UK, Spain and Denmark - each representing one of
   Hallin and Mancini's(1) three overall models of media and politics: the
   liberal system, the polarized pluralist system and the democratic
   corporatist system. It finds important similarities across countries
   with high levels of concentration in media coverage of groups, more
   extensive coverage of economic groups than citizen groups, and
   differential patterns of group appearances across policy areas and
   between right-and left-leaning papers. It also identifies country
   variation, with the highest degree of concentration among group
   appearances in Spanish newspapers and the most attention to economic
   groups in Danish newspapers.},

Abstract = {We propose a new standard for evaluating the performance of electoral
   democracies: the correspondence between citizens' party preferences and
   the party composition of governments that are formed after elections. We
   develop three criteria for assessing such correspondence: the proportion
   of citizens whose most preferred party is in government, whether the
   party that is most liked overall is in government, and how much more
   positively governing parties are rated than non-governing parties. We
   pay particular attention to the last criterion, which takes into account
   how each citizen feels about each of the parties as well as the
   intensity of their preferences. We find that proportional representation
   systems perform better on the first criterion. Majoritarian systems do
   better on the other two.},

Abstract = {This comparative international case study of cyber warfare provides a
   context for considering the evolution of cyber technologies as elements
   of hybrid warfare capable of creating confusion, disrupting
   communications, and impacting physical infrastructure (such as power
   grids and satellite-based communications and weapons systems). Expanding
   an unpublished paper recognized by the ASIS Foundation in its 2012
   international student writing competition concerning global security,
   which compared the cyberattacks against Estonia in 2007 and the United
   States in 2012, this study re-examines and updates the original data in
   a broader analysis that primarily includes the cyberattacks against
   Ukraine during the 2013-2015 conflict, but also considers other
   incidents on the timeline of digitization. The study shows how cyber
   warfare, first reported in the 1990s, has become an integral component
   of war today for both state and non-state actors who use zombies and
   robot armies to penetrate national boundaries and firewalls via
   satellites.},

Volume = {17},

Abstract = {Fragile states constitute a challenging operating environment. Yet, the
   role of development partner engagement on issues of social inclusion,
   identity politics, or horizontal inequalities in such fragile
   environments has not received the attention these complex issues
   warrant. The attitudes of development actors, their level of commitment,
   bias, risk management, and understanding of the political settlement can
   have a real bearing on the effectiveness of such efforts to promote
   inclusion. In Nepal, certain development partners have faced elite

Abstract = {In international relations small states are either discarded as
   irrelevant, unimportant, or weak; held in high regard as potential
   movers and shakers in especially smart or niche diplomacy areas;
   powerful in blocs; or as a non-classification, that is undeserving of a
   unique type separate from the world body of states. Regardless of
   varying perceptions, small states exist and more so, they exist with
   foreign policies. This study examines what drives the foreign policies
   of the southern African small states of Botswana, the Comoros, Lesotho,
   Mauritius, Namibia, the Seychelles and Swaziland. It finds that state
   size is important in shaping the foreign policies of these southern
   African small states, but that it is not mutually exclusive from other
   typical domestic and international determinants that play a role in
   conditioning most states' foreign policies. Moreover, defence of
   national interest features as a common and undeniable primary foreign
   policy objective of these states.},

Abstract = {Populism has often been described as a great challenge and threat to
   Western democracies. Not surprisingly, at a time in which we are
   witnessing a significant rise in populist actors in Europe and the US,
   scientific analyses and commentary regarding populism have become
   particularly popular and, indeed, necessary. My aim in this article is
   to offer a brief yet comprehensive overview of the ongoing debates in a
   bid to problematise the supposed imminent threat' of populism in light
   of recent developments within the political systems and societies of
   established democracies, especially under conditions of crisis. I
   understand populism as a specific type of discourse, and thus as a
   wayamong othersof doing politics and appealing to groups of people.
   Thus, I highlight the varying orientations that populist movements might
   take, depending on the ideological traditions with which they are
   closely articulated and the sociopolitical environment in which they
   manifest. Last, I relate the populist surge' to discussions regarding
   post-democracy.},

Abstract = {While the phenomenon of selfie photographs in the media has been
   extensively analysed by academics, Selfie Journalism was recently
   introduced and constitutes one of the most notable phenomena within the
   digital media environment, raising a number of issues relating to
   notions of infotainment and impartial reporting, especially in
   `difficult' sectors, such as politics. This paper identifies the
   specific characteristics of Selfie Journalism in political reporting.
   Based on both quantitative and qualitative research, the study analyses
   these characteristics in the period of parliamentary elections of 2016
   in Cyprus. The aim of the study is dual: first, to examine the extensive
   use of Selfie Journalism by candidates themselves in political
   campaigning and, secondly, to examine the impact of this phenomenon upon
   the media and, in turn, media engagement in such political tactics. The
   greater scope of this study evolves around the argument that Selfie
   Journalism, as a new species of participatory journalism, has penetrated
   the media in an effort to attract larger audiences.},

Abstract = {Perhaps no variable in political science has received more attention
   than electoral participation. Despite, or because of, the great amount
   of research on this topic, significant new determinants for electoral
   participation have not been recently forthcoming. Here we offer a
   significant new determinant - patrimony. For theoretical reasons, we
   expect a voter's wealth portfolio to influence their turnout. We test
   these ideas using a battery of asset items asked in French election
   surveys. Our finding is that voters who possess more patrimony are more
   likely to vote. The strength of this patrimonial effect rivals the
   influence of the strongest traditional predictors, such as political
   interest. Finally, patrimonial effects seem able to subsume, even
   replace, the traditional class effects from income, occupation, and
   education. This pivotal empirical, as well as theoretical, role of
   patrimony suggests serious revision in the explanation of how
   socioeconomic forces shape electoral participation.},

   President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, in contrast, has seized this opportunity
   to court Trump and his administration with the prospect of renewing vows
   between the two strategic NATO allies after a falling out with the US
   towards the end of the Obama administration. However, while Erdogan and
   his presidential palace have probed Trump's White House for answers to
   several questions critical to bilateral relations, 100 days into the new
   administration - the initial point of reflection on the actions of the
   US president many key issues remain between the US and Turkey.},

Abstract = {This essay examines the 1939 decision by Time, Inc., publisher of LIFE
   magazine, to reject Schlegelkeller, an eyewitness account of early
   pre-Holocaust violence by German artist Karl Schwesig. While scholars
   have suggested a number of reasons why the American press minimized or
   failed to report the Nazi decimation of Jews and other marginalized
   groups, we borrow from two influential works by sociologist C. Wright
   Mills to suggest that an intricate intersection of social statuses,
   along with ideological perspectives, institutional norms, and personal
   temperament, may explain why LIFE rejected Schlegelkeller. We discuss
   the implications of this decision in light of both the magazine's
   internal metrics and the response of the American news media to prewar
   violence in Europe.},

Abstract = {After the 9/11 terrorist attacks more restrictive security legislation
   severely curtailed civil liberties in several western democracies.
   During the following decade, there were efforts to restore them, albeit
   to a different extent across countries. Using data from the democracy
   barometer, we seek to determine the factors that explain the variation
   in the restoration of civil liberties in 22 OECD countries between 2002
   and 2012. We find that a strong and independent judiciary and a liberal
   political culture are conducive to the restoration of civil liberties.
   Being subject to terrorist attacks has no significant effect on the
   restoration of civil rights. The results suggest that democratic regimes
   are capable of correcting their security legislation if they are
   constrained by rule of law institutions that are embedded in a liberal
   political culture.},

Abstract = {When the Cold War ended, many non-democratic regimes across the globe
   embarked on a course of controlled political liberalization, hoping to
   stabilize their autocratic rule by mitigating popular demands for
   democratization and increasing regime legitimacy. But does this strategy
   actually work? This article uses multi-level analyses to examine how the
   degree of political liberalization affects regime support in
   non-democratic political systems and to ascertain which mechanisms
   underlie this effect. Drawing on aggregate measures of political
   liberalization and comparative survey data from four regional survey
   projects and 31 non-democracies, the study's results indicate that the
   degree of liberalization has no decisively positive effect on regime
   support, suggesting controlled political liberalization might not be an
   effective legitimizing strategy after all.},

Abstract = {This paper seeks to draw attention to the narcissistic dimensions of the
   reconciliation movement in Australia and, more specifically, to the way
   in which the desire to make innocent' compromises the attempt to make
   amends' and construct a just polity. Building upon some early work by
   Anthony Moran (1998) and Elizabeth Povinelli (1998), it sets out to
   defend two claims: firstly, that the intensity of the desire for
   reconciliation in Australia (and conceivably in other settler colonial
   states as well) is attributable to the sense of shame arising from the
   collapse of the national ego ideal; and secondly, that the real target
   of the reparative efforts undertaken under the auspices of
   reconciliation is the healing of the narcissistic injury' inflicted by
   the failure of the assimilation project and the assertion of Aboriginal
   separateness.},

Abstract = {Drawing on the CPSA's archival records, this article explores the
   origins of CPSA and the patterns of representation in its founding
   decades. We focus on the pre-World War II years, when disciplinary
   boundaries were fluid and scholars sought to shift policy discussion
   from moral reform to reform guided by science and professionalism. The
   CPSA's founding vision aspired to engage typical citizens in discussion
   of current issues. Despite the ambitious vision, a much narrower range
   of citizens participated. The CPSA's powerful melding of academic,
   corporate, state and political elites, in turn, shaped the CPSA's
   reflections on the development of the Canadian state and public policy.
   This historical legacy encourages us to reflect on the contemporary
   challenges of fostering independent scholarship on public issues.
   Resume S'appuyant sur les documents d'archives de l'ACSP, cet article
   explore les origines de l'organisme et les structures de representation
   dans les premieres decennies de sa fondation. Nous nous concentrons sur
   les annees precedant la Deuxieme Guerre mondiale, lorsque les frontieres
   disciplinaires etaient mouvantes et les chercheurs cherchaient a
   reorienter le debat politique de la reforme morale a une reforme guidee
   par la science et le professionnalisme. La vision fondatrice de l'ACSP
   aspirait a engager le << citoyen moyen >> a la discussion au sujet des
   enjeux actuels. En depit de cette vision ambitieuse, un nombre beaucoup
   plus restreint de citoyens s'y sont engages. C'est le regroupement
   puissant des elites universitaires, corporatives, politiques et
   etatiques qui a marque, a son tour, les reflexions de l'ACSP sur le
   developpement de l'Etat canadien et des politiques publiques. Cet
   heritage historique nous encourage a reflechir sur les defis
   contemporains lies a la promotion d'un savoir independant sur des
   questions publiques.},

Abstract = {This manuscript analyzes the changes in Brazilian public administration
   and its relation with governance and development trends in the country.
   The case of the environmental agencies is used to exemplify those
   changes in the last decades. There are three main modes in the Brazilian
   public administration: patrimonialism, bureaucratic, and managerial.
   Even though reforms have taken some effect along the decades, all three
   modes subsist in different forms in the public organizations. After the
   democratization of the country, there is a growing influence of civil
   society in public affairs, but accountability is low. Reforms were
   carried out by authoritarian and democratic governments from different
   political spectrums, but the quality of public administration and
   governance still suffers with components of ineffectiveness in the
   delivery of public services and patrimonialism, resulting in many recent
   cases of corruption and mismanagement, as well as the increasing
   discontent of the population, as shown in the recent protests in Brazil.},

Abstract = {Resume Cette etude presente les resultats d'un sondage realise aupres
   des politologues francophones du Canada portant sur la langue de
   diffusion des connaissances en science politique. Meme si la
   quasi-totalite des politologues francophones est d'accord avec l'enonce
   voulant que l'anglais soit devenu la lingua franca de la science
   politique, le francais continue a occuper une place importante dans la
   diffusion des connaissances. Toutefois, il existe plusieurs variations
   en fonction de la langue dans laquelle la these de doctorat a ete
   redigee, du sous-champ disciplinaire dans lequel s'inscrivent les
   travaux et du rang professoral. Les choix linguistiques sont largement
   motives par la volonte de rejoindre le plus vaste auditoire possible
   tout en obtenant la reconnaissance aupres des pairs.
   Summary This study presents the results of a survey of Canada's
   francophone political scientists on the language of knowledge
   dissemination in political science. Although almost all francophone
   political scientists agreed with the statement that English has become
   the lingua franca of political science, French continues to be a
   significant part of the dissemination of knowledge. However, there are
   important variations in language usage depending on the language in
   which the dissertation was written, the disciplinary sub-field within
   the discipline, and academic rank. Language choices are largely
   motivated by the desire to reach the widest possible audience while
   garnering recognition from peers.},

Abstract = {While it is well understood that policy suggestions outside the range of
   mainstream debate are prevalent in various policy domains of American
   politics, their effects remain unexplored. In this paper, we suggest
   that proposing policies far from the political mainstream can
   re-structure voter perceptions of where alternatives lie in the
   ideological space. We provide support for this hypothesis using results
   from six survey experiments. We find that the introduction of extreme
   alternatives into the public discourse makes mainstream policies on the
   same side of the spectrum look more centrist in the public eye, thus
   increasing support for these moderate alternatives.},

Abstract = {The two books reviewed in this article engage with `participatory art',
   in which artists mobilise people as the central medium of their work.
   Grant Kester argues that such works have the potential to generate new
   communal forms that challenge neoliberal hegemony, while Claire Bishop
   argues that in dispensing with the negating praxis of the avant-garde
   they all too frequently end up reproducing its logics. The article
   suggests that if the binary that structures both their arguments is
   overcome, a productive synthesis of their arguments can be made -
   although this still leaves unanswered a number of questions about the
   role that art might play in social change.},

Volume = {111},
Number = {1},

Abstract = {The article compares analytically populism and technocracy as
   alternative forms of political representation to party government. It
   argues that populist and technocratic principles of representation
   challenge fundamental features of party democracy. The two alternative
   forms of representation are addressed theoretically from the perspective
   of political representation. First, the article identifies the
   commonalities between the two forms of representation: both populism and
   technocracy are based on a unitary, nonpluralist, unmediated, and
   unaccountable vision of society's general interest. Second, it
   highlights their differences. Technocracy stresses responsibility and
   requires voters to entrust authority to experts who identify the general
   interest from rational speculation. Populism stresses responsiveness and
   requires voters to delegate authority to leaders who equate the general
   interest with a putative will of the people. While the populist form of
   representation has received considerable attention, the technocratic one
   has been neglected. The article presents a more complete picture of the
   analytical relationship between them.},

Abstract = {In light of gender disparities in political involvement, extant research
   has examined mechanisms for incorporating ordinary women into politics.
   We complement this literature by exploring the effect of an overlooked
   institution theorized to promote political equality by maximizing voter
   turnout: compulsory voting. We theorize that in enforced compulsory
   voting systems, women are more likely to receive and seek information
   about electoral choices than their counterparts in voluntary voting
   systems. Consequently, compulsory voting helps narrow the gender gap
   beyond voting by creating opportunities and motivations for women to
   engage with the electoral process and its main actors. Our multilevel
   analysis based on cross-national survey data lends strong support to our
   hypotheses. Countries with enforced mandatory voting laws display a much
   smaller gender gap not only in voting, but also in several other forms
   of electoral engagement, including political party information, campaign
   attentiveness, party attachment, and campaign participation.},

Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Why are some people more responsive to campaign mobilization than
   others? I argue that the composition of a person's core personality
   makes some people more responsive to mobilization cues than others.
   However, the degree to which personality alters the effectiveness of
   mobilization also depends on the type of political participation for
   which people are being mobilized. I explore the determinants of
   political participation by looking at the interaction between the Big-5
   traits of agreeableness, conscientiousness, and emotional stability and
   the intensity of campaign environments. This paper demonstrates that
   despite the possible ameliorative effect mobilization has on unequal
   patterns of political participation, an enduring source of participatory
   inequality may very well be rooted in a person's core psychological
   structure. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Veto player theory is a powerful approach to comparative politics. This
   article argues that the debate about its explanatory success would
   benefit from more systematic distinctions. The theory not only comes in
   different theoretical variants, it is also used in radically different
   ways empirically. Starting from recent debates about the `testing' of
   theoretical models, the article distinguishes five ways in which
   theoretical models can be used empirically: contrastive, axiomatic,
   exploratory, presumptive and modular. The typology is applied to veto
   player theory and illustrated with exemplary studies and debates. The
   article concludes that each type raises different questions that should
   be answered in individual studies. Moreover, while veto player theory
   has an excellent track record on four empirical uses, the picture on its
   contrastive use is far more nuanced. More explicitly contrastive testing
   of the theory is desirable.},

Title = {Europeanization in the shadow of the financial crisis: disruptive
   effects on the Spanish party system},
Journal = {IDP-INTERNET LAW AND POLITICS},
Year = {2017},
Number = {24},
Pages = {21-36},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {It is a widely held view that Europeanization is a gradual process of
   adaptation of domestic policies, institutions or political actors to
   European Union (EU) regulation or norms, frequently linked to
   democratization processes. There are, however, potential applications of
   the concept of Europeanization to situations of crisis when domestic
   agents have little room for manoeuvre; on these occasions, gradual
   adaptation may turn into pressures to implement EU norms or regulations
   and this may have disruptive effects on domestic political systems. This
   paper aims at illuminating these processes in Spain during the years of
   the Great Recession and evaluating their putative impact on the Spanish
   party system. The primary concern of this study is, therefore, to
   identify crucial steps in the processes of Europeanization of Spanish
   politics during the years 2010-2012; in a second step it analyses the
   articulation of a response to these processes by protest movements, and
   especially by the political party Podemos in its initial phase. A
   case-study approach is used to gain deeper insight into the context of
   Spanish politics in times of crisis. Official documents of domestic or
   EU institutions and various speeches of the political party Podemos are
   collected and examined. The results of this study suggest connections
   between Europeanization processes and changes in domestic party
   competition in Spain; additionally, it identifies Europeanization in
   Spain as a disruptive process favouring the emergence of
   anti-establishment discourses.},

Abstract = {Many ethnic minorities demand (adequate) descriptive representation in
   parliament because they expect it to affect the responsiveness of
   governments towards their demands. However, the mechanism of how
   minority representatives affect policy outcomes remains unclear. I argue
   that descriptive representation mainly has an effect if representatives
   possess additional leverage to influence policy outcomes. The argument
   is tested with hierarchical time-series models from 88 minority groups
   in 47 countries multi-ethnic democracies. The analysis shows that
   descriptive representatives are most successful in influencing policy
   outcomes if they are included in the government, the legislature is
   powerful, and a group is comparatively large.},

Abstract = {Inter-state preventive diplomacy (PD) has mostly been regarded as
   successful in Southeast Asia as evidenced by the absence of interstate
   armed conflict. This success has generally been credited to the
   Association of Southeast Asian Nations. Yet, in terms of addressing
   specific crises, the paper argues that three factors are critical to the
   success of inter-state PD in Southeast Asia: the level of great power
   interest in particular disputes, the perceived legitimacy of the PD
   actor, and the nature of the agreement being sought. Great power
   interference complicates strategic calculations and is therefore likely
   to make it harder for PD attempts to succeed. Reversely, the critical
   involvement of the United Nations as a PD-doer and negotiator helps
   de-escalate violence in interstate disputes in Southeast Asia. The paper
   applies these factors to understand why the East Timor and the Preah
   Vihear Temple cases were successful exercises of PD while PD, in regard
   to the South China Sea dialogue, has so far only produced limited
   results.},

Title = {To have or not to have: Effects of economic inequality on turnout in
   European democracies},
Journal = {ELECTORAL STUDIES},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {45},
Pages = {24-28},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {The effect of economic inequality on turnout has received considerable
   interest recently. Some studies suggest that inequality depresses
   turnout, others that the relationship is either the other way around or
   simply non-existent. Employing a large dataset with some 80,000
   respondents from 30 European democracies, we show that great care is
   required when exploring inequality and turnout. On average, there is
   indeed a negative/positive effect of being below/above the median income
   in a country but it is conditioned by inequality (measured as the Gini
   coefficient) and national wealth (measured as GDP per capita). Moreover,
   the two country-level factors interact in surprising ways. Based on our
   results we warn against claims of mono-causal relationships between the
   economic situation of voters and turnout. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All

Title = {Memory and heritage of 1848 in Milan from The Five Days to the end of
   the century},
Journal = {LABORATOIRE ITALIEN-POLITIQUE ET SOCIETE},
Year = {2017},
Number = {19},
Abstract = {1848 in Milan occupy a prominent place in the historiographical debate
   on the two revolutionary years in Italy (1848-1849). Not only the
   exceptional nature of the most famous and most celebrated event (the
   Five Days of Milan insurrection that led the General Radetzky to flee
   from the town in March 1848), but also the course of the political
   struggle during the months following the Piedmontese response and the
   capitulation of Milan (August), represented a turning point in debates
   after the events. The article presents the conflicting memory of the
   1848 Revolution in Milan by identifying - through the analysis of texts
   - some key moments (the two years from 1848 to 1849, the eighties and
   the crisis at the end of the century) during which were examined all
   main thematic nodes which occupy the historiography of the twentieth
   century.},

Title = {Two Types of Trusteeship in South Africa: From Subjugation to Separate
   Development},
Journal = {POLITIKON},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {44},
Number = {2},
Pages = {265-285},
Abstract = {The basic motivation for trusteeship is the expropriation of land from
   indigenous inhabitants, for the exploitation of its resources. Yet, the
   moral, political and epistemic authority of trusteeship is based on the
   promise of self-determination for such inhabitants. The South African
   colonial experience is very much part of this narrative and
   trusteeship's chief legitimating pretention, of the higher level of
   rational and technological development reached by the white man, was
   embraced and consolidated both by liberals and nationalists. Though
   initially deriving from foundations of covering law universalism, we
   argue that trusteeship evolved conceptually in colonial South Africa
   from explicitly moral, integrationist Cape Liberal ideal into a
   pragmatic, positivistic foundation for apartheid, expressed in
   progressive, pluralist, humanitarian terms of cultural adaptation' and
   adapted education'. Our study shows up and explains a seemingly
   anomalous contradiction that transpired in South Africa during events
   leading up to apartheid, involving the logically illicit miscegenation
   of cultural relativist pluralism and covering law universalism that
   begat trusteeship's disgrace: the Bantustan. Our exploration of this
   historic incorporation of difference uncovers systematic forces of power
   and ideology that continue to haunt democratic independence after
   apartheid.},

Abstract = {Almost 45 years after joining the European Communities, the United
   Kingdom has decided to leave the European Union following the referendum
   of June 2016. Throughout its membership, the two have shared a difficult
   relationship and despite there having been a very positive dimension for
   both sides, it is impossible to ignore the negative dimension. This
   article intends to describe and analyse how this process has taken place
   and how the relationship of the U.K. with the EECC and the E.U., evolved
   since the U.K.'s first application to join the EECC was submitted, in
   1961, until the starting of the negotiations for the withdrawal in June
   2017.},

Abstract = {This article analyzes the evolution of Consensualism within the
   contemporary administrative management. The administrative structure of
   the State, based on the conception of the Welfare State, has over time
   endured some conceptual inclusions that, far from its providentialist
   feature, add up its content and makes its definition increasingly
   complex and impregnated with various distinctive concepts. It is thus,
   that, after verified the evolution of the State, it is suggested the
   necessary distinction between the burocratic and the responsible
   ({''}managerial{''}) models, determining its application within the
   current structure of administrative management and organizing its
   concept. What is intended with this analysis of the consensualism is the
   demonstration of the possibilities of the manager's decisions in order
   to reach the public interest, exalting its performance ruled for its
   results and for the effectiveness of the efficiency principle.},

   This is followed by identifying major problem areas of contemporary
   democracies. A concluding section then points to some of the remaining
   challenges of empirical research on democracy, both with regard to a

Abstract = {Although party system change has been widely explored, it is less so for
   the regional level. The article provides the first systematic attempt to
   discuss party system change at the regional level in Italy. Through a
   comprehensive overview of the five 1995-2015 regional elections,
   indicators of party system change, based on an original database, are
   explored. It will be showed that in the 2013-15 election cycle while
   party system fragmentation, volatility and recomposition reached their
   maximum high - parallel to what happened in 1995 - the level of
   bipolarism, one of the main features of Italian party system since the
   mid-1990s, dramatically dropped replaced by a three-pole configuration.
   These results, and their consistency with the relevant junctures at the
   national level in 1994 and 2013, may allow to state that a party system
   change at the regional level occurred and thus to consider 2013-15
   elections as critical.},

Abstract = {This article examines the reappropriation of an abandoned village in
   Upper Galilee (Northern Israel) since 2013 by a group of young Israeli
   Arabs, descendants of the third generation of Palestinian refugees,
   thereby transforming the space. This irregular collective action is a
   form of activism consisting of discreetly occupying contested places,
   such as a village destroyed during the war of 1948, without seeking any
   political visibility. It highlights an aspect of a discreet struggle
   against instituted totalities such as the Israeli State and its
   political frame. The first aspect of the analysis concerns the
   resentment of young Palestinians-descendants of refugees-towards
   national policies. The second aspect concerns the style of the spatial
   contestation, analyzed pragmatically here, and valorizing the living
   environments. Finally, the political scope of the collective action of
   the reappropriation of a territory is examined, insofar as it puts the
   State of Israel to the test, with regard not only to a denunciation of
   the national level model, but also in terms of how it aims to break away
   from it. It interrogates the hypothesis of autonomy or secession in such
   a project, embodied in a defined territory, referring to the discourses
   and practices of the occupiers.},

Journal = {REVISTA ESTUDOS POLITICOS},

Volume = {8},

Pages = {140-162},
Abstract = {Recently, Jurgen Habermas has dedicated many of his works to the
   discussion of the relationship between religion and the public sphere,
   in light of democratic possibilities of mutual learning. He contends
   that even though religious contents can inspire motions of solidarity,
   constitutional and legal arrangements should reflect universal, secular
   reasons only. Drawing on the sociology of religion, I will demonstrate
   that religious narratives contribute to shape moral views and
   self-perceptions, impacting on the ways societies define political
   norms. Assessing the flaws of deontological theories, I resort to an
   Aristotelian view of democratic justice, whereby historical traditions
   and religious narratives come to inform the contents of evaluative moral
   discourses. Analyzing the case of South Africa, where communitarian
   notions of forgiveness prevailed over retributive justice, I argue that
   principles of public morality stem from contextual struggles,
   negotiations and exchange of aesthetic-cognitive meanings. With this in
   mind, I finalize with a formulation of the concept of religion as a
   communicative system, affirming the capacity of religious traditions to
   impart reasons that can be generally accessed and apprehended by
   participants in historical processes of learning.},

Abstract = {While the Europeanisation of national interest groups is an important
   research agenda in the EU, very little research examines their
   Europeanisation outside the EU, and during the EU accession process. The
   article fills this gap by focusing on Europeanisation of interest groups
   in Macedonia, Montenegro and Serbia. Using new survey data, the article
   looks at interest groups' involvement in the national pre-accession
   process, and their activity at the EU level. The main argument of the
   paper stresses the absence of significant differences between the levels
   of Europeanisation of business and other types of interest groups
   (especially NGOs) in the current phase of EU accession. The regression
   analyses provide support to this argument, showing that access to
   national institutions, resources, the Europeanisation of policy areas
   and dependence on EU funding account for interest groups' levels of
   Europeanisation, while variations across group types are not very
   significant.},

Abstract = {The Normative Power Europe literature has spent considerable attention
   on how the European Union (EU) has influence outside its borders. Few
   studies examine how EU `messages' are being received in third (non-EU)
   countries. This article examines how EU energy policy is `received' in
   Russian media. Through a detailed media analysis of five snapshots of 1
   month of articles in two leading Russian newspapers over 5 years
   (2009-2013), we argue that the Russian media does not receive EU
   messages quite the way the EU intends them to be received, even though
   Russia does respond to the so-called Third Energy Package. This article
   contributes to our overall understanding of EU-Russia relations by
   offering a Russian perspective and thereby contributes to our general
   understanding of how EU external influence works in countries outside
   the EU.},

Abstract = {The United Nations Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in
   Mali (MINUSMA) was established in 2013 to support Mali's peace process.
   It represents an emerging practice of deploying UN peacekeeping missions
   in asymmetrical conflict environments where there is no peace to keep.
   While MINUSMA represents Europe's return to peacekeeping, the largest
   troop contributors by a wide margin are African countries. Through
   exploring the task of securing mission convoys to the northern regions
   of the country, Signe Cold-Ravnkilde, Peter Albrecht and Rikke
   Haugegaard show how inequalities between European and African soldiers
   shape the distribution of death, danger and supplies in what has been
   named the world's deadliest UN mission.},

Title = {Empowering the Party-Crasher: Donald J. Trump, the First 2016 GOP
   Presidential Debate, and the Twitter Marketplace for Political Campaigns},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF POLITICAL MARKETING},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {16},
Number = {3-4},
Pages = {212-243},
Abstract = {This article argues that an important political marketplace of keywords
   expands in social media around campaign events such as a debate; that
   rhetorical efforts to define the situation in which a campaign event
   occurs are met in this marketplace by user responses that more or less
   echo the keywords, thereby enhancing or diminishing the political power
   of their ``caller{''} or speaker; and that social media monitoring
   platforms can enhance our understanding of public opinion influence
   competitions among candidates through the careful selection, tabulation,
   and inspection of words and phrases being voiced. In the case at hand,
   an analysis of Twitter volume data and a reading of a sample of 1200
   tweets between July 30 and August 15, 2015, a period enveloping the
   first 2016 Republican presidential candidate debate on August 6, 2015,
   helps us understand how Donald J. Trump escaped political punishment
   from party and media elites for subverting Republican and U.S. norms of
   candidate behavior. Elite voices greatly disapproved of Trump's debate
   performance and conduct, a traditional augury of declining public
   support. But the presence of social media voices enhanced Trump's
   capacity to succeed with an insurgent marketing strategy, one he would
   continue into his election as president fifteen months later.
   Specifically, comparatively high user volume on a debate-oriented
   section of Twitter (i.e., posts with the hashtag \#GOPDebate) for
   Trump's name, slogan, and Twitter address, and for such advantageous
   keywords as ``political correctness,{''} ``MegynKelly,{''} and ``illegal
   immigration{''} relative to terms and phrases favoring other candidates
   and Republicans as a whole indicates the presence of heavy and active
   popular support for Trump. The contents of the corresponding tweet
   sample exhibit Twitter-savvy techniques and populist stances by which
   the Trump campaign solicited that support: celebrity feuding, callouts
   to legacy media allies, featured fan comments, a blunt vernacular, and
   confrontational branding. The contents also illustrate ways in which
   users manifested their support: from the aforementioned high keyword
   volume to imitative behavior and the supplying of evidence to verify
   Trump's contested claims during the debate.},

Abstract = {Labour won fewer seats in 2015 than in 2010, even though its share of
   the vote increased. The decline in representation was occasioned by
   three features of the electoral geography of the 2015 contesta collapse
   in Labour support in Scotland, a particularly strong Conservative
   advance in marginal seats and the fact that in England and Wales
   Labour's vote rose most strongly in seats that the party already held.
   As a result, Labour's vote became markedly less efficiently distributed
   than that of the Conservativesa development that could make it very
   difficult for the party to win an overall majority at the next election.
   Meanwhile, the redrawing of constituency boundaries that is currently in
   train will make winning a majority even more difficult. However, the
   next election could well produce a hung parliament, and the party should
   be prepared for that eventuality.},

Title = {Politics, Institutions and Social Struggles: Beyond Pure Normativism and
   Strong Institutionalism in Political Theory},
Journal = {REVISTA ESTUDOS POLITICOS},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {8},
Number = {1},
Pages = {49-80},
Abstract = {In this article, I criticize the tendency in contemporary
   philosophical-political theory to affirm both pure normativism and
   strong institutionalism as the heart of democracy, denying a political
   core not only to social classes, but also to social struggles, which
   define the main social, cultural and political dynamics,
   institutionalized and non-institutionalized. The association between
   pure normativism and strong institutionalism leads, on the one hand, to
   the separation and opposition between normative foundations and social
   classes and social struggles, as well as, on the other hand, to the
   institutional monopolization both of political legitimation and social
   evolution, because institutions exclusively assume the guard, the
   legitimation and the public boosting of social normativism. Pure
   normativism and strong institutionalism, in other words, reduce politics
   to institutional and systemic politics, as they reduce political
   subjects to institutional legal staffs, as political parties and
   technical elites, attributing a peripheral role to social classes and
   social struggles, a peripheral role also to the politicity of social and
   institutional life. I argue that this harmful tendency of many
   philosophical-political theories, fundamentally in the spectrum of
   liberalism and social democracy, which suffer from a
   historical-sociological blindness, must be substituted with the
   affirmation of the centrality of social classes as the real political
   subjects of social evolution, as well as of the centrality of social
   struggles as the political-normative basis to the definition of
   institutional designs, social evolution and economic structures.},

Journal = {CRITICAL STUDIES ON TERRORISM},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {10},
Number = {2, SI},
Pages = {253-273},
Abstract = {This article discusses the importance of including the voices of violent
   state actors in critical research about security and terrorism. Critical
   Studies tend to avoid narrative research about such actors or to give
   them ``face{''} and place. However, to understand violence, scholars
   should listen to, and explore, the narratives of those who are
   committing violence. The article seeks ways to produce emancipatory
   knowledge and to be critical without being exclusionary. It discusses
   the difficulties in deciding who merits the researchers' listening and
   research focus, and who does not. These issues are explored and
   contested by presenting an analysis of women combatants' experiences.},

   Revisiting regionalism and redistributive preferences in Canada},

Abstract = {The maintenance of welfare state policies requires citizen support for
   the provision of a social safety net through taxation and
   redistribution. Research has shown that a diverse political polity
   presents a risk to the welfare state; however, Canada bucks the trend
   and does not see citizen support for economic redistribution decline in
   response to immigration-based population diversity. Using Canada as our
   case, we argue that scholars of welfare state politics and
   redistribution should turn their attention to other sources of
   population heterogeneity in an effort to better understand how different
   political cleavages affect citizens' redistributive preferences. We use
   an online experimental survey to manipulate the in-group identity of 500
   Canadians. The survey enables respondents to identify with other
   in-group identities along regional, linguistic, income-group, and
   urban/rural characteristics. Our results find that while Canadians do
   have a strong baseline preference for redistributive behaviour, regional
   and linguistic cleavages moderate this outcome.},

Abstract = {Despite the close ties between tax-generated revenue and government
   policies, little is known about how political institutions shape the
   structure of tax choices across income levels. We propose and test a
   model based on the selectorate perspective, which predicts that leader
   choices regarding taxing and spending are driven by their desire to
   maximize their survival prospects against domestic challengers. The
   empirical tests investigate the conditions under which income taxes are
   non-existent, flat, more regressive or more progressive, and the degree
   of heterogeneity in tax systems as a function of governance
   institutions. The empirical results strongly and robustly support the
   theoretical predictions while also shedding light on how tax structures
   implemented in large coalition systems reduce income inequality.},

   only studied institutions, but also was instrumental in building them.
   As dean of social science at NYU, he helped to forge a strong commitment

   human behavior. He will be sorely missed. We are grateful to Michael

Title = {Do intergovernmental transfers affect the distribution of manufacturing
   production across regions in federal countries? Theory and evidence for
   Argentina},
Journal = {REGIONAL AND FEDERAL STUDIES},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {27},
Number = {4},
Pages = {359-392},
Abstract = {The effect of changes in the distribution of top-to-bottom
   intergovernmental transfers on the location of manufacturing production
   is analysed using a modified version of the footloose capital model. An
   increase in the share of transfers received by a region increases its
   share of manufacturing production the larger are transaction costs; the
   larger is the share of transfers going directly to consumers; the larger
   is the share of manufacturing consumption vis-a-vis non-tradable
   consumption; and the easier consumers can substitute among manufacturing
   varieties. Using data for Argentina for 1983-2005, the empirical
   analysis appears to support the existence of two distinctive regimes,
   with smaller/poorer provinces benefiting in terms of the location of
   manufacturing production as a response to an increase in transfers.
   Also, for these provinces, the benefits are greater if they are
   politically aligned with the federal government, especially through the
   receipt of discretionary transfers. For large/rich provinces, the
   evidence is less conclusive.},

Abstract = {The European Union (EU) and South Africa have a long-standing
   relationship, which includes political and economic partnerships, thus
   providing a critical test case for norms diffusion. In the past few
   years, however, this relationship has changed and new powers have come
   into the picture, especially the other BRICS countries, Brazil, Russia,
   India and China, affording new opportunities for agency to South Africa
   in dealing with norms emanating from Europe. The field of energy
   governance, with its crucial impact on both climate change and
   sustainable development, is likely to become a critical terrain of
   policy cooperation in the near future. This article discusses pioneering
   research on how South Africa perceives the EU's role in energy
   governance against the backdrop of the growing influence of the BRICS.
   It reviews media images and uses them as a proxy of public discourse in
   South Africa. Our data shows that while the EU is a critical partner for
   South Africa, its public image in the country is in decline in the field
   of energy governance, with growing relevance occupied by the BRICS
   countries.},

Abstract = {Since gaining full independence in 1905, Norway has experienced more
   than a century of democratic elections, and has reformed its electoral
   system three times, most notably with the switch from a two-round runoff
   system to proportional representation in 1919. This research note
   introduces a new dataset featuring all candidates running for
   parliamentary (Storting) elections from 1906 to 2013, and documents the
   patterns over time and across electoral systems in the development of
   the party system; candidates' gender, age, occupation, and geographic
   ties; and voter turnout. Scholars interested in using the dataset can
   gain access to it through the Norwegian Centre for Research Data.},

Journal = {NEW POLITICAL SCIENCE},

Number = {4, SI},
Pages = {670-686},
Abstract = {This article provides empirical evidence for the hypothesis that Donald
   Trump distinctively attracted unprecedented levels of support from
   ``low-information voters.{''} The findings suggest that his campaign
   exploited a void of facts and reasoning among these voters that made
   them more vulnerable to relying on emotions about Mexican immigrants,
   Muslim refugees, and African-American citizens, as well as their disdain
   for the first African-American President Barack Obama. As a result,
   these Trump supporters were less in a position to want or be able to
   question Trump's seemingly unprecedented campaign of misstatements,
   untruths, and lies. The article discusses the implications for US
   politics in the Trump era and beyond.},

Journal = {POLITICS GROUPS AND IDENTITIES},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {5},
Number = {3},
Pages = {488-493},
Abstract = {Women's presence in cabinets around the world has expanded considerably
   in the past two decades. All male cabinets are all but unthinkable in
   most democracies today. Yet existing studies of cabinet formation pay
   little systematic attention to the representative dimensions of
   cabinets. We argue that the concept of symbolic representation is useful
   for analyzing ministerial recruitment because cabinets are not mere
   collections of individuals with political skills or policy expertise.
   Cabinets are sites of representation, and ministers are often chosen in
   light of informal rules about which groups must be represented in
   cabinet. The concept of symbolic representation draws attention to both
   the symbol maker (in this case, the chief executive who selects
   ministers) and the multiple audiences to whom the symbol is directed. As
   such, the concept is well suited to reveal how gender plays out in
   cabinet formation, particularly when symbolic representation is
   contested by audiences.},

Abstract = {The management of conflicts with a strong cultural component has a long
   tradition in peace studies. The current situation in Syria, exiled
   Muslims and not Muslims, Islam and the high immigration wave across
   Europe constitute a hot issue. There are national and international
   seminaries, which under the title of intercultural mediation, pretend to
   sort these issues out, and also, we can see daily news concerning these
   topics. Hence, we can reflect for a moment and ask ourselves: what we
   are talking about when we talk about these issues?
   We need to admit that the values in which Human rights are based on,
   though declared universal, are far from being immutable. I would like to
   assess whether the multiple and different situations that conflicts with
   a strong cultural component could generate are being analyzed properly.
   For that purpose, I will make use of a methodological analysis which
   starts with the theory of conflicts, continues with the analysis or
   mapping conflict and finishes with the design of intervention
   strategies. This article will show not only that the diagnosis being
   performed incorrectly, but also that the proposed intervention
   methodology is wrong.},

Abstract = {This research is based upon three interrelated elements: the European
   crisis, Italian Fascism and the analysis of the two carried out by
   Antonio Gramsci in the Prison Notebooks, that is, the notes he wrote
   during his detention in Fascist prisons from 1929 to 1935. However, the
   aim of this contribution is to shed light not on Gramsci's analysis of
   the European crisis and the regime in Italy as such, but on the way in
   which this analysis interacts with the constellations of political power
   and of hegemonic social forces existing in Italy and in Europe at the
   time. Gramsci's Prison Notebooks are in fact not reflections on a
   defeat, made far awayboth physically and mentally-from the on-going
   struggle (as they have often been interpreted in the past), but a
   strategic analysis of opportunities for communist political initiative
   presented by the new European and Italian situation of the late 1920s
   and early 1930s.},

Title = {Different Ways of Institutionalising Entrepreneurial Parties: Czech
   Public Affairs Party and ANO},
Journal = {POLITOLOGICKY CASOPIS-CZECH JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2017},
Number = {2},
Pages = {92-115},
Abstract = {This article analyses and compares two Czech entrepreneurial parties,
   Public Affairs (VV) and ANO (meaning `yes' in Czech). Both parties
   achieved great success in the first parliamentary elections in which
   they contested; however, whereas VV quickly collapsed, the success of
   ANO proved to be sustainable. The theoretical framework of the article
   is the development model of institutionalisation proposed by Robert
   Harmel and Lars Svasand, which has three phases: identification,
   organisation and stabilisation. We show that in the identification phase
   the leaders of both parties, Vit Barta (VV) and Andrej Babis (ANO),
   proved to exploit the crisis in traditional political representation and
   the hunger for new parties and personalities effectively, while
   successfully developing their protest appeals. The differences were
   visible during the organisation phase. On the one hand, Barta's strategy
   of dual leadership (formal and actual) of his party caused conflicts,
   defections and undesirable media attention. On the other hand, Babis's
   leading role in the new party was clear. He also constructed the party's
   internal mechanisms, and as such was able to control intraparty dissent.
   The problems of Barta's VV deepened in the stabilisation phase. The
   combination of unmanaged government engagement and growing scandals
   discredited the party. By contrast, Babis was able to gradually
   transform ANO into a competent and credible government party. This
   successful stabilisation greatly helped to facilitate an efficient and
   disciplined party organisation, `accommodating the neutrality' of some
   important media, effective communication with voters and improvement of
   the economic situation.},

Abstract = {Leo Panitch and Sam Gindin's article ``The Integration of China into
   Global Capitalism{''} argues that China will follow the pattern of
   postwar Japan to become a supplemental, junior partner in supporting US
   hegemony. They claim that due to the close trade and financial ties
   between the United States and China, there is no question of China
   challenging America's dominance of the global system (Panitch and Gindin
   2013). This article will critically examine the premises of this claim,
   taking account of the postwar history of Japan; the measure of
   transition to market forms in China's economy; the role of trade;
   China's overall level of development; and the growth of the country's
   domestic corporations. The article focuses particularly on the level of
   China's domestic technology measured through Patents in Force (PiFs). It
   argues against Panitch and Gindin that China is poised to challenge
   Western dominance of the world economy.},

Abstract = {This analysis investigates the role of historical analogies in the
   influence that parliaments have in foreign policy. Our empirical focus
   is the UK Parliament's unusual opposition to the Prime Minister on UK
   involvement in Syria in 2013. The vote challenges many conventional
   expectations about the role of parliament in security affairs. Important
   in this vote were lessons learned and strategically used from UK
   participation in the intervention of Iraq in 2003. This argument is
   developed theoretically based on research on historical analogies:
   parliaments, `learn' (primarily negative) lessons about past foreign
   policy events which guide parliamentary preferences and procedures and
   can enhance parliaments' role in subsequent foreign policy. The article
   contributes to research on analogies by extending the logic to lessons
   on process. This use of precedents can offer more structurally oriented
   perspectives that translate critical junctures into reforms in
   procedures and policy-making practices.},

Abstract = {Party members across European democracies exercise increasing influence
   on parties' policy platforms or personnel choices. This article
   investigates ideological (in)congruence on the left-right spectrum
   between members and their parties by drawing on a party membership
   survey of more than 10,000 individuals across seven political parties in
   Sweden. The results show that around two-thirds of members are not
   perfectly congruent with their party. In a two-step analysis, the
   article argues that emancipated members, with higher political interest
   and with a more independent self-conception, are more comfortable being
   ideologically incongruent with their party. We also provide evidence
   that ideological incongruence matters for members' exit, voice and
   loyalty behaviour. It is associated with a more negative evaluation of
   the party leader (voice) and with a higher probability to either vote
   for another party (loyalty) or even to leave the current one (exit). The
   findings indicate that ideological incongruence within parties is not a
   trivial matter, but is rather substantial in size with potentially
   important consequences for party competition.},

Abstract = {In the years immediately following the end of the Napoleonic Empire
   (1814-1823), constitutionalism, one of the main legacies of the Age of
   Revolution, did not disappear as many of the reactionaries of the
   Restoration wanted. Rather, it became for many Europeans of diverse
   political tendencies - including liberals of various persuasions, but
   also royalists and conservatives - the necessary instrument for the
   organization of new states. This article analyzes the evolution of
   constitutional government in Restoration Europe, emphasizing the
   international context in which the debate about its various forms
   developed, using as analytic tools the concepts of constitutional
   culture and emulation.},

   it is of key importance to the survival of his empire. However, Moscow
   is unable to provide any convincing legitimisation for its imperial

   Russia oscillates to and fro between extortion and bribery. Therefore
   the relationship between the centre and the periphery is marked by deep

   intellectuals (with regard to other social classes) in the fields of
   ethics and political practice. The intellectuals tend to a behaviour
   determined by conventional values (like money, power, prestige), but
   they continuously produce a rhetorical routine stressing
   equalitarianism, although in the reality they belong to hierarchical and

Abstract = {The controversial duty to promote British values in Schools and Further
   Education Colleges in England, Scotland and Wales was introduced in the
   Counter-Terrorism and Security Act 2015. This duty is described by some
   as the introduction of securitising mechanism into British Schools, for
   others it is a symptom of the UK Government's further retreat from
   Multiculturalism. In this article, we present the duty as the most
   recent reconstructive intervention designed to remedy alleged failings
   in the education system to produce liberal British citizens and to
   counter the growth of extremism. In the article, we will explore how
   local institutions such as schools and colleges have implemented the
   duty in a way that defuses some of the securitising aspects of the
   Statutory Duty through celebrating the UK as a multi-racial, multi-faith
   and multi-cultural society and through ensuring that their promotion of
   British values is consistent with their existing value system and ethos
   which includes the promotion of pupils' Spiritual, Moral, Social and
   Cultural Development.},

   have claimed that the economic benefits of the relationship with the US
   prevail over imperialistic concerns as a result of the asymmetry of
   power between the two countries. Empirical research shows that Latin
   American public opinion is indeed more supportive of the US than theory
   indicates. However, we identify two gaps in this literature. First,
   scholars have explored the determinants of generic expressions of
   sentiment toward the US, overlooking more concrete instances of
   cooperation between the two countries. Second, scholars have focused on
   trade and investment and have ignored how the material gains of
   emigration shape attitudes toward the US. The present paper fills these
   two gaps by using novel survey data on the bilateral relationship
   between Mexico and the US. On one hand, we find that while the reception
   of remittances correlates positively with good sentiments toward the US,
   the recipients of remittances are consistently more opposed to
   cooperation with the US in the fight against drug trafficking. We argue
   that this finding can be explained by the different nature of the
   migratory phenomenon, and the connection between anti-drug trafficking
   policies and the close scrutiny of illegal flows of money and people.},

Title = {Water Supply and neoliberal restructuring of rural areas in Mexico: the
   case of the El Zapotillo dam},
Journal = {PROVINCIA},
Year = {2017},
Number = {37},
Pages = {11-28},
Month = {JAN-JUN},
Abstract = {In general, metropolitan cities are experiencing an increased need for
   water consumption and consequently a rise in the processes of
   collection, treatment and distribution. This has led the Mexican state
   to implement a series of actions modernizing court in rural areas by
   investing hydraulic character grounded in the cost-benefit; with
   balances in favor of some and deterioration of the quality of life of
   others.
   This paper makes a review of the literature and analyzes the actions in
   terms of territorial intervention hydraulic project called ``El
   Zapotillo Dam{''}. Meanwhile, once again, towards the benefit of the
   urban majority has decided to sacrifice the cultural built heritage and
   three populations of western Mexico: Temacapulin, Acasico and Palmarejo
   versus the needs of water consumption of 14 municipalities in Jalisco;
   City of Leon, Guanajuato and Conurbation of Guadalajara. It is concluded
   that the construction of these grand-projects are no longer an
   alternative to the problems of urban water supply and little contribute
   to sustainability in rural regions.},

   from Poland},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CIVIL SOCIETY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {13},
Number = {4},
Pages = {426-442},
Abstract = {This article presents a typology of meanings which Polish activists
   attribute to their roles in Polish organizations of civil society. The
   main object of interest is the social identity of activists which
   emerges through the process of engagement in an organization. After
   analysing interviews with members of organizations, six ways of playing
   the role of an activist were distinguished. First of all, it turns out
   that most activists understand their role as a particular job. However,
   it is also equated with being an expert. Further meanings emerging from
   the interviews link such activism with being a representative and having
   a task to fulfil. Finally, there is also a definition which is shared by
   those who treat their activism as an inherent part of their lives. It is
   often connected with perceiving it as a particular kind of sociability.

Abstract = {American higher-education institutions are under increasing pressure to
   prepare their students with practical skills for the workplace, and the
   social sciences-including political science-are not immune. Political
   figures have suggested-sometimes seconded by academics themselves-that
   research distracts academics from imparting practical skills to
   undergraduate students. Using a survey of international relations (IR)
   scholars, this article shows that this is not the case. Those who spend
   more time on research actually devote more time to policy-relevant
   research in their courses than more abstract and theoretical work, and
   they incorporate more contemporary issues. Research seems to encourage
   academics to teach their students to fish.},

   Eurozone Crisis},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CIVIL SOCIETY},

Abstract = {Protest and social movements are drivers for the Europeanization of
   national public spheres. This is suggested by the literature on the
   emergence of Europeanized public spheres and the Europeanization of
   social movements as well as the discussion about the politicization of
   the European polity. The article tests this assumption in a standardized
   content analysis for newspaper reporting on the Eurozone crisis in
   Greece and Germany. Focusing on the public attribution of
   responsibility, the analysis looks for horizontal Europeanization
   (senders/addressees from other EU countries), vertical Europeanization
   (senders/addressees from the EU level), and discursive Europeanization
   (similar topics discussed at the same time). The findings do not
   identify protest as a strong driving force towards vertical or
   horizontal Europeanization of the public spheres in Greece and Germany.
   There is a weak tendency towards discussing similar topics at the same
   time in German and Greek media reports on protest. Consequences for
   European democracy and crisis politics are discussed.},

Abstract = {This article reviews and analyzes recent research on regional
   integration. The review is structured along a political economy
   framework and proceeds in three steps. After analyzing the development
   of regional integration agreements (RIAs) from a historical perspective,
   I first discuss regional integration as a consequence of the
   decision-making calculus of office-motivated political leaders who find
   themselves under pressure from different societal groups interested in
   promoting or hindering regional integration. These pressures are
   conveyed, constrained, and calibrated by domestic institutions, which
   provide an important context for policy making, and in particular for
   the choice to enter RIAs. The analysis also highlights the importance of
   international pressures for regional integration. Second, I summarize
   the determinants and consequences of variations in regional
   institutional design. Third, I analyze the normative and strategic
   consequences of regional integration. The article concludes by outlining
   opportunities for future research, with emphasis on the domestic
   politics of regional integration, the causes and consequences of
   institutional design beyond trade agreements, and the consequences of
   the increasing number of often overlapping regional agreements.},

Title = {Eroding Germany's Commitment to Data Protection: Policy Entrepreneurs
   and Coalition Politics in EU Passenger Name Records},
Journal = {GERMAN POLITICS},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {26},
Number = {3},
Pages = {398-413},
Abstract = {A history of totalitarian governments and state surveillance appear to
   have made Germans sensitive towards the uses of personal data. Because
   of such concerns, Germany often acted as an obstacle to security
   measures requiring personal data at the EU level. However, there has
   been a recent sea-change in Germany over EU Passenger Name Records
   (EU-PNR), a measure that requires the personal data of airline
   passengers for security purposes. Many in Berlin have moved from
   lukewarm at the time of the first EU-PNR proposal in 2007 to advocating
   it in 2014. The article draws on Kingdon's Multiple Streams Framework
   (MSF) to examine this change in position, comparing two government
   coalitions - the CDU/CSU-FDP (2009-13) with the CDU/CSU-SPD (2013-) - to
   show how actors within the CDU/CSU have acted as policy entrepreneurs to
   ensure agreement on EU-PNR. It is argued that the composition of
   governmental coalitions can act as a central condition that facilitates
   or hinders the success of policy entrepreneurs. While the position of
   the FDP blocked any progress on EU-PNR in the former coalition, policy
   entrepreneurs used the willingness of the SPD to show voters their
   support for tougher security measures, thereby ensuring Germany's
   support for EU-PNR.},

Abstract = {When considering the jurisprudence despite the apparent integrity in the
   whole structure and nature, from the perspective of subject-internal
   divisions, differences can be seen that cannot be denied. Classification
   of different sectors of jurisprudence on issues involving, apart from a
   facility that creates for the visit and study is the evidence for the
   existence of differences in the divider. Attention to these differences
   is underlying of some today's theories. For example, facing with
   increasing developments of social phenomena and the need for flexibility
   and dynamic of jurisprudence, a theory is partly accepted that refers to
   the existence and attention to constant and variable domains in the
   jurisprudence provisions. The result of this approach generally
   introduces the domain of changes as transactions jurisprudence that when
   necessary has the ability to change, while constants are worshiping
   jurisprudence that stability is considered a fundamental pillar of their
   validity. That jurisprudence in the area of variable transactions can be
   seen transform and synchronize with changes is originating from nature
   that is the distinction of this part from other areas of juridical. In
   other words, the other property of transactions jurisprudence that
   originates from features such as the guidance of the commandments in
   this passage, arguing the provisions for the detention of worship
   section, religious orders and, ultimately, the possibility of
   understanding Sari materials for concealment of worship materials on
   human intellects causes that jurisprudent not considered its structure
   far from the availability of human reason and by understanding its
   materials provides the extended field and at the time of considered
   non-interest permit to change easily. This article briefly from these
   special privileges of transactions jurisprudence as the principles of
   development provides an analytical report.},

Abstract = {What determined the strong euroscepticism voiced at the 2014 European
   Parliament (EP) election in Denmark, Finland, and Sweden? This chapter
   argues that there is no such thing as a uniform Nordic model. Across the
   three countries, there is pronounced sovereignty-based euroscepticism
   and a weak democratic euroscepticism, but notable differences concerning
   perceptions of the European Union's (EU's) economic utility and
   expectations as to its level of social engagement. Yet, Nordic voters do
   not reject the idea of EU cooperation: no widespread hard euroscepticism
   exists. In fact, Nordic hard euroscepticism was at one of its historic
   lowest levels in 2014. A content analysis of eurosceptic party
   manifestos shows considerable alignment between the eurosceptic profiles
   of Nordic citizens and the policy stances of the parties they voted for.},

Title = {Unusual Bedfellows? PRI-PVEM Electoral Alliances in Mexican Legislative
   Elections},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF POLITICS IN LATIN AMERICA},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {9},
Number = {2},
Pages = {63-92},
Abstract = {We examine the electoral alliances between two Mexican political parties
   - the Partido Revolucionario Institucional (PRI) and the Partido Verde
   Ecologista de Mexico (PVEM). Despite the PRI's electoral dominance, it
   has entered into preelection agreements with the PVEM since 2003. These
   electoral pacts are unusual for several reasons: the parties do not
   share an ideology; their bases of support come from different social
   sectors; and the PRI's survival as a party does not depend on these
   pacts. Using electoral data from 2006 to 2015, we examine the electoral
   districts in which the PRI and the PVEM ran joint candidates in federal
   legislative elections. We find that the ultimate goals of each party,
   their past electoral performances at the legislative district level, and
   the presence of PRI-PVEM alliances in gubernatorial elections explain
   the parties' choices to collaborate in certain districts. Our findings
   have important implications for understanding the behavior of parties in
   newer democracies.},

Abstract = {Typically, when analysing contemporary Russian-Chechen conflicts, the
   relegation of the nationalist struggle to a secondary role by the
   religious battle waged by the North Caucasus insurgency is pinpointed as
   one of the fundamental differences between the First and Second War in
   Chechnya. This article discusses how it was reflected in one of the most
   important media of the Chechen Islamist insurgency: the Kavkaz Center.
   To this end, 2859 English language news items posted on the website
   during 2001-04 were reviewed using media frame analysis.},

Abstract = {Since the 1980s the Scottish National Party has presented its political
   project in progressive terms, but this created a twin dilemma: in order
   to achieve independence, the SNP needed to win political power, and in
   order to achieve political power it had to win an election, and
   orthodoxy dictated that winning elections in Scotland involved a
   centre-left platform. But the two have often been in conflict, as is
   clear as the SNP approaches its tenth anniversary in devolvedgovernment
   and agitates for another referendum.},

   formalization). The objective is to contribute to the understanding of
   the scope and limitations of Kirchner's government policies in terms of

Abstract = {The lion's share of policy in the United States is made by
   administrative agencies. Agencies not only make policy choices, they
   must also implement policy effectively. Oversight institutions play an
   integral role in the policymaking process by monitoring, through review
   of agency policy actions, both policymaking tasks. Through analysis of a
   formal model I develop a theory of policymaking between agencies and
   courts and show that review can impact agency effort choices even when
   bureaucratic subversion is not a concern. At times the court has no
   impact on this effort and the agency is unconstrained. However, when the
   agency's effort dictates whether or not the court defers to the agency's
   actions judicial review does affect effort decisions. In this setting,
   review can either strengthen or, counter-intuitively, weaken agency
   effort incentives. Implications for executive and congressional
   oversight are discussed in light of these results.},

Title = {Intraparty Hostility: Social Identity, Subidentity, and the Hostile
   Media Effect in a Contested Primary},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF POLITICAL MARKETING},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {16},
Number = {3-4},
Pages = {365-385},
Abstract = {The hostile media effect (HME) has generally been tested in terms of
   in-groups and out-groups, with a ``neutral{''} story in between. This
   ignores the nature of many social groups as comprising subgroups, often
   but not always sharing feelings of connectedness and purpose. In cases
   when bounded subgroups are at odds with one another, HME provides little
   guidance. A contested partisan primary provides such a case. This study
   takes identity centrality, candidate favorability, and perceived social
   network homogeneity as measures of partisanship and involvement,
   hypothesizing relationships between each and perceived bias against
   one's candidate and party. Findings show that markers of
   candidate-focused social identity predict greater perceived bias against
   one's candidate during the 2016 primary season, while party-focused
   identity fails to predict perceived bias against one's party. This
   suggests that candidate support identity overrides plain partisanship
   during primaries, supporting concern that a heated primary might damage
   general election party unity. Subsequent postconvention findings suggest
   that the salience of candidate-focused identity fades, while homogeneity
   of one's network regarding party support helps to make perceived
   hostility toward one's party identity more salient. However, as
   campaigns become more candidate-centered, the contestation between
   nested candidate and party identities may grow fiercer.},

Abstract = {How significant of a factor is race in minority candidate evaluation? I
   present theory of race and minority candidate evaluation which argues
   that candidate race acts as an informational heuristic that affects
   perceptions of a candidate's ideological leaning and competence but that
   this effect is dependent on contextual factors, including the racial
   group and candidate partisanship. Using the 2010 and 2012 Cooperative
   Congressional Elections Study, I provide an observational look at Latino
   and Asian candidates in addition to black candidates for the first time,
   as well as minority candidates of both partisan stripes. I examine voter
   perceptions about candidates that might drive their vote choice, namely
   ideological assessments and competence assessments. I find that white
   voters are less likely to support Latino and black Democrats because
   they are viewed as less competent and more ideologically extreme. I find
   that Asian candidates and minority Republicans are largely unaffected by
   these biases.},

Pages = {11-31},
Abstract = {The economic crisis in Europe has resulted in an unprecedented narrative
   battle in the traditionally consensus-driven Finland. National
   stereotypes and prejudices have been employed to situate Finland on the
   shifting political and moral map of Europe with the North-South division
   taking an important role in the narrative battle. Using a narrative
   approach to policy debates and following Erik Ringmar's work, this
   article analyses how Finland's European role has been narratively
   constructed with romantic, tragic, and satirical interpretations
   featuring in the debate.},

Abstract = {The 2018 expiration of the Atomic Energy Agreement between the United
   States and Japan marks a critical juncture for the longstanding
   alliance, one that extends well beyond the nuclear arena. This article
   argues that a strengthened nuclear foundation that bolsters the
   U.S.-Japan alliance could have significant ramifications, even forming a
   cornerstone for further security institutionalization across the whole
   of the Northeast Asian region. It makes the case for revisiting and
   reshaping all aspects of U.S.-Japan bilateral nuclear cooperation, from
   civilian nuclear energy to the U.S. nuclear deterrent and the safety and
   security structures. The unique standing and resources of both countries
   on the nuclear issue make both key actors in strengthening regional and
   global nuclear governance, and in addressing the myriad challenges
   across the current landscape.},

Pages = {35-48},
Abstract = {New Zealand has experienced a plethora of political corruption scandals
   over the past several years. Newspapers have increasingly featured the
   term corruption' to describe a wide range of allegedly ostensibly
   scandalous activities. Are corruption and corruption scandals related?
   Is New Zealand developing a culture of political scandals? What are the
   long-term political implications of this trend, given that New Zealand
   has arguably been one of the perceived least corrupt country in the
   world, according to such measures as Transparency International's
   Corruption Perceptions Index? This necessarily impressionistic study
   examines the role of the media and the public presentation of specific
   corruption' scandals on the potentially changing receptivity of the New
   Zealand public to such scandals, with a view to clarifying the starting
   point of this complex relationship between public perceptions and
   political behaviour.},

Number = {4, SI},
Pages = {404-422},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {This paper conducts an experimental test of the theory of ideational
   populism in a most-likely case: a well-known Chilean populist
   presidential candidate, Roxana Miranda. At the time of our study, Chile
   had the necessary conditions for ideational populism: corruption
   scandals and a crisis of political representation that lowered citizens'
   trust in establishment elites. The stimulus was a speech that included
   the core elements of ideational populist discourse. Despite the careful
   experimental design and a ripe political atmosphere, we found no effects
   of populist discourse on voting intentions or evaluations of Miranda
   among the research participants. We discuss the possible reasons for
   these null findings. Rather than disqualifying the theory of ideational
   populism, we conclude that our research calls theorists to incorporate
   other elements - ideology, gender, issue positions, strategic voting -
   into their models of ideational populism.},

Abstract = {This descriptive article presents a case study of the effects of policy
   change on the public higher-education system in Brazil, highlighting the
   significant differences in the system after President Lula's election in
   the mid-2000s. The data collected show changes to higher-education
   policy in the number of institutions, the number of spots offered,
   racial-quota policies, access, and the offer of public services through
   the adoption of electronic-government tools. The article also considers
   how these changes to the Brazilian system fit into studies carried out
   with two public-policy analysis models, multiple streams, and punctuated
   equilibrium.},

Abstract = {This article examines whether the Citizens' Initiative (CI) in Finland
   has enhanced inclusion in processes of political agenda-setting.
   Democratic innovations such as CIs have been proposed as a solution to
   the challenges facing Western democracies. CIs are expected to increase
   political inclusion by allowing citizens to set the political agenda and
   by mobilising otherwise marginalised or passive citizens. However, the
   empirical evidence on this proposition remains scarce. This study
   examines the impact of the CI in Finland on political inclusion. It
   relies on the Civic Voluntarism Model (CVM) to determine whether the CI
   mobilises citizens who otherwise tend to be less involved in political
   matters and thereby enhances inclusiveness. The data come from the
   Finnish National Election Study 2015 (FNES2015), which is a
   cross-sectional representative survey conducted in the wake of the
   national parliamentary elections in April 2015. Logistic regression
   models are used in the article to examine the relative importance of
   socioeconomic resources and civic skills, psychological political
   engagement and recruitment networks. The results show that while users
   have many of the familiar traits of political activists, the CI also
   activates marginalised groups. Most importantly, young citizens are
   likely to support CIs and the Internet constitutes a central recruitment
   network. In this sense, the CI has helped increase democratic
   inclusiveness.},

Abstract = {Negotiations on a settlement of the Cyprus problem, which has a history
   of about 50 years, are still in progress. In 2014, a new period of
   negotiations started under the leadership of Akinci and Anastasiadis. In
   2017, discussions were held in Geneva with the aim of achieving peace
   and an ultimate resolution to the Cyprus problem. However, the Geneva
   talks failed due to the parties' disagreements on a number of matters.
   In this article, the authors provide a brief history of Cyprus
   negotiations, followed by an assessment of the 2016-2017 Geneva talks as
   part of the new negotiation period. In this context, the key points of
   the Geneva talks, which were agreed upon by the parties, are discussed.},

Abstract = {Belief in electoral fraud has received heightened attention due to elite
   rhetoric and controversial voter identification (ID) laws. Using a
   two-wave national survey administered before and after the 2012
   election, we examine the individual-level correlates of belief in a
   range of election-related conspiracy theories. Our data show that
   partisanship affects the timing and content of belief in
   election-related conspiracy theories, but a general disposition toward
   conspiratorial thinking strongly influences those beliefs. Support for
   voter ID laws, in contrast, appears to be driven largely by party
   identification through elite-mass linkages. Our analysis suggests that
   belief in election fraud is a common and predictable consequence of both
   underlying conspiratorial thinking and motivated partisan reasoning.},

Abstract = {We propose viewing precariousness as the outcome of 11 contradictions,
   that is, spanning blockades, crisis points, ruptures, the opening of new
   planes and vanishing points immanent to the new configuration of
   Post-Fordist employment. In each of these contradictions it is possible
   to recognize many of the means that allow us to articulate capital
   liberalization projects, to set up institutions and institutionalities
   which enable what we believe is (Post-) Operaist Theory's greatest
   legacy: the possibility of knowledge becoming autonomous.},

Abstract = {Initially, cronyism was considered to be specific to Asian countries.
   Further analyses recognized characteristics of crony capitalism all over
   the world. According to the model presented in the paper, crony
   capitalism emerges in circumstances of political instability as a
   solution for the problem of economic growth. The model enables the
   analysis of cronyism in Croatia and an investigation into the question
   whether features of crony capitalism were a consequence of privatisation
   and the transition from socialism. The paper concludes that cronyism is
   primarily a political phenomenon and that crony capitalism cannot be
   reduced to its economic effects. Growth serves as a justification for
   the system of privileges. The collapse of Agrokor, the largest Croatian
   conglomerate, illustrates the development of crony capitalism in Croatia
   and its relation to the privatisation process.},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Gender-based differences in political knowledge are pervasive in the
   United States and abroad. Previous research on the source of these
   differences has focused on resource differentials or instrumentation,
   with scholars arguing either that the gender gap is real and
   intractable, or that it is an artifact of the way the concept is
   measured. Our study differs from past work by showing that (1)
   male-female differences in political knowledge persist even when
   knowledge is measured with recommended practices, but that (2) knowledge
   gaps can be ameliorated. Across laboratory, survey, and natural
   experiments, we document how exposure to information diminishes
   gender-based differences in political knowledge. The provision of facts
   reduces-and often eliminates-the gender gap in political knowledge on
   questions covering a range of topics.},

Abstract = {Several U.S. cities have turned control of their schools from elected
   boards to the mayor. Advocates of mayoral control have argued that this
   structure allows voters to hold the mayor directly accountable for the
   performance of local schools. Now that public schools have to report
   their test scores each year, it is possible for voters to attribute
   responsibility for test scores. This article analyzes survey data from
   16 cities in the United States that have been matched with data on test
   scores. We find that, in general, test score changes are not associated
   with support for incumbent mayors, except in districts with mayoral
   control, where voters reward incumbents when test scores rise. Further,
   voters' beliefs about local schools condition their support for the
   incumbent. In cities with mayoral control, voters who evaluate schools
   positively reward mayors while voters who believe their schools are poor
   are not swayed by this positive information.},

Abstract = {Legislative committees rely on the expertise and experience of their
   members, but instability in committee systems threatens the enhancements
   in productivity associated with specialization. This can occur in two
   ways, both of which are more common in state legislative committees than
   they are in Congress. First, membership retention on committees is
   generally lower, even after accounting for differing levels of
   legislative turnover across legislatures. Second, many state legislative
   committee systems undergo reorganization between sessions, changing the
   policy jurisdictions, and, therefore, the applicability of members'
   previously developed expertise. In this article, I examine the
   consequences of these two sources of committee instability on
   legislative output in 14 state legislatures. I find that both membership
   retention and jurisdictional reorganization significantly affect the
   number of bills processed through committees and the number of bills
   ultimately enacted. These linkages are also conditioned on several
   committee and institutional factors, particularly legislative turnover.
   Last, I find a weaker but discernible effect of membership retention on
   committees' propensity to perform their gatekeeping role.},

Abstract = {Kathy Ferguson's anarchist women enact walking as freedom's pose. In my
   response, I ask how the way we imagine poses and postures, comporting
   our bodies this way or that, alone or together, shapes the way we
   practice freedom. I worry that the focus on walking, a dominant and
   frequent metaphor for freedom in many diverse political registers,
   occludes our ability to see freedom in other poses, registers, and
   spaces. I argue that highlighting walking as freedom's preferred pose
   hovers too close to the replication of the posture (and maybe the
   perspective too?) of the masculine self. These moves, and this movement,
   make it harder to discover other sites and kinds of freedom, and to
   fully appreciate contingency, non-necessity, and the unexpected
   possibilities available in every encounter. Drawing on the work of
   Adriana Cavarero, Simone de Beauvoir, and Hannah Arendt, I explore
   postures of inclinationBeauvoir's housewives stooped over pots and
   pansand consciously chosen inactivityArendt lying on her daybed
   thinking. These postures and poses open up our ability to see freedom in
   the encounter, an affective and agonistic freedom enacted only with
   others, and too easily hidden or missed.},

Abstract = {The Turkey-Russia relationship was significantly ruptured in November
   2015 after Turkey shot down a Russian Su-24 fighter jet. After a
   seven-month diplomatic rift and an apology by Turkish President Recep
   Tayyip Erdogan, both sides committed to opening a new chapter. The
   parties started a multi-dimensional dialogue in the summer of 2016 by
   reviving cooperation in the energy sphere and coordinating their
   policies over Syria. In this article, the author argues that wider
   political conjuncture was important in restarting the dialogue, but it
   is still mainly actordriven and the institutional underpinning of the
   relationship is underdeveloped. Current dynamics indicate that there is
   significant momentum to normalize relations - signs of cooperation in
   the spheres of politics and energy - however, the same fragilities that
   caused the breakdown in November 2015 still linger.},

Abstract = {The left-right line of conflict has been the dominant dimension of
   decision-making in the European Parliament since 1979. A
   pro-/anti-European Union integration dimension is of secondary
   importance. Limited evidence exists on the conditions under which these
   different dimensions matter. This study examines parliamentary
   decision-making about the so-called Two-Pack, which moved
   responsibilities about budgetary decision-making to the European
   Commission. The article uses in-depth interviews, textual analysis of
   committee debates and roll call voting analysis in order to determine
   which lines of conflict matter at which stage of decision-making. The
   evidence indicates that left-right division is dominant in the informal
   stage preceding committee debates, while both the pro-/anti-European
   Union and the left/right dimensions matter during the committee stage,
   whereas for plenary votes, the pro-/anti-European Union dimension is
   crucial.},

Abstract = {The scope, complexity, and interconnectedness of modern society should
   prompt us to develop dynamic understandings of democratic modes of
   inclusion and exclusion. In particular, democratic theory is becoming
   more attentive to the mismatch between those who make decisions and
   those who are affected by them as well as to the need to account for the
   voice of the latter. In this article I build on James Bohman's
   understanding of democracy as a rule by multiple demoi to develop a
   framework for studying and evaluating modes of democratic inclusion that
   are based on being affected. To develop this framework I turn to law and
   public administration and examine the democratic properties of different
   institutions and procedures that give a voice to those who are affected
   by a decision.},

Abstract = {Whereas the European Commission officially intends to periodically
   evaluate all major European Union legislation in force, in practice it
   only evaluates a minority of major regulations and directives. This
   article tries to explain the variation in the initiation of such ex-post
   legislative evaluations by the Commission with the help of two
   theoretical motives: an enforcement motive and a strategic motive. Based
   on two novel datasets and binary logistic regression analysis, the
   results show that the type and complexity of the legislation, the
   presence of an evaluation clause and the evaluation capacity of the
   responsible Directorates-General enhance the chances of evaluation.
   These findings indicate that ex-post legislative evaluations are at
   least partly driven by the Commission's need to enforce legislation.},

Abstract = {This study aims to contribute new insights into the way political
   labour' is divided in the household. I use data from a large-scale panel
   study, the Parent-Child Socialization Study 2012-2013, conducted among
   adolescents and both their parents in Belgium, to analyse the different
   ways in which family members engage in politics and influence each
   other's political preferences. First, I analyse differences in political
   engagement between fathers, mothers and adolescents. Second, I present a
   full triadic structural equation model to measure the political
   influence that fathers, mothers and adolescent children exert on one
   another. The findings suggest that fathers are (still) more engaged in
   politics, but when it comes to preferences for political parties, both
   parents influence their partners and their adolescent children in equal
   measure.},

Abstract = {This article explores the prominence of different types of sources in
   the coverage of the 2014 Scottish independence referendum on BBC
   Scotland's regional news bulletin. It combines the most commonly used
   classifications of news sources in the literature and proposes an
   integrated taxonomy, in which official, unofficial, elite and nonelite
   sources may take on news-shaper or news-maker roles. This taxonomy is
   used to analyse the referendum coverage on BBC's Reporting Scotland in
   the final month of the campaign. Findings suggest that, despite the
   presence of many types of sources, male-dominated political elites were
   the main focus in the news. Although the inclusion of some grassroots
   and citizen sources is encouraging, the coverage more broadly manifests
   a liberal democratic logic whereby the media represent the views of
   politicians and political organisations to the public, whose role is to
   make an informed choice between them, with comparatively limited
   opportunities to participate in the mediated political debate.},

Journal = {RESEARCH \& POLITICS},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {4},
Number = {4},
Month = {NOV 1},
Abstract = {Citizens' economic perceptions can shape their political and economic
   behavior, making the origins of those perceptions an important question.
   Research commonly posits that media coverage is a central source. Here,
   we test that prospect while considering the alternative hypothesis that
   media coverage instead echoes public perceptions. This paper applies a
   straightforward automated measure of the tone of economic coverage to
   490,039 articles from 24 national and local media outlets over more than
   three decades. By matching the 245,947 survey respondents in the Survey
   of Consumer Attitudes and Behavior to measures of contemporaneous media
   coverage, we can assess the sequencing of changes in media coverage and
   public perceptions. Together, these data illustrate that newspaper
   coverage does not systematically precede public perceptions of the
   economy, a finding which analyses of television transcripts reinforce.
   Neither national nor local newspapers appear to strongly influence
   economic perceptions.},

Abstract = {This study investigates the impact of emigration on the political
   behavior of citizens in Egypt. In particular, it argues that emigrants'
   family members are more likely to vote for Salafi parties for several
   reasons, including the transfer of religious remittances by Egyptian
   emigrants to the Gulf and the influence of transnational Salafi
   networks. In order to test our argument, we conducted an original public
   opinion survey with around 1100 individuals between January 12, 2012 and
   January 25, 2012, just after the Egyptian parliamentary election. We
   find that individuals with family members who had emigrated to the Gulf
   voted heavily for Islamist parties, particularly the Freedom and Justice
   Party and the Nour Party. Further analysis shows that there is no
   statistical difference between individuals with and without emigrant
   family members in voting for the Muslim Brotherhood, while the Nour's
   popularity among voters with emigrant family members is substantial and
   statistically significant. In particular, we find that the strongest
   support for the Nour came from individuals whose family members had
   immigrated to Saudi Arabia, whereas those whose family members had
   immigrated to other countries, including other Gulf countries, do not
   differ significantly from non-emigrant family members in their party
   preferences.},

Abstract = {This article focuses on the agonistic account of renewal and discusses
   its place within the broader horizon of radical democracy. It suggests
   that while the emphasis which agonistic theorists place on difference
   and popular struggles (particularly social movement politics) ensures
   some common ground with other theories of radical democracy, their
   account of renewal also displays some marked differences. The article
   explores these differences and discusses whether agonism is sufficient
   to address the limits of the current neoliberal order.},

Abstract = {In the present article I propose an approach to the problem of the
   theological-political within Spinoza's work. To begin with, I will
   attempt to reconstruct the concept of imagination in order to account
   for its theoretical specificity within the Dutch philosopher's thinking.
   Two forms of imagination will be described: a negative one (inadequate
   knowledge) and a positive one (potentia imaginandi). From these
   developments, in the second part of the paper, I will analyze the
   theological-political problem as an imaginary operation. The
   theological-political will be shown to us as a passive form of the
   imagination that produces a confinement of men on their own marks. By
   way of conclusion, I will finish the work with a reflection on the tools
   Spinoza's philosophy provides to break with the theological-political
   imagination. There, the concept of ``democratic imagination{''} will
   appear as a possible antidote to this rupture.},

Abstract = {The Daily Mail's coverage of the 1993 race murder of Stephen Lawrence
   has been held up as an example of newspaper journalism at its best. It
   is a cause of pride to the paper, which has asserted that its 1997 front
   page accusing five men of the murder, and the comment and reporting that
   followed, brought about significant social and policy changes and helped
   achieve justice. The coverage has also been cited by the paper to rebut
   critics who accuse it of intolerance. Examined in detail here and set in
   their context, the paper's claims about its role in the case prove to be
   either exaggerated or not supported by evidence. The Mail's engagement
   in the Lawrence case involved a famous instance of editorial brilliance,
   but insofar as its campaign brought about or contributed to changes,
   they were not usually changes sought by the paper and they were
   sometimes contrary to its aims.},

Title = {Mobilizing the Public Against the President: Congress and the Political
   Costs of Unilateral Action},
Journal = {AMERICAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {61},
Number = {4},
Pages = {769-785},

Abstract = {Prior scholarship overlooks the capacity of other actors to raise the
   political costs of unilateral action by turning public opinion against
   the president. Through a series of five experiments embedded in
   nationally representative surveys, we demonstrate Congress's ability to
   erode support for unilateral actions by raising both constitutional and
   policy-based objections to the exercise of unilateral power.
   Congressional challenges to the unilateral president diminish support
   for executive action across a range of policy areas in both the foreign
   and domestic realm and are particularly influential when they explicitly
   argue that presidents are treading on congressional prerogatives. We
   also find evidence that constitutional challenges are more effective
   when levied by members of Congress than by other actors. The results
   resolve a debate in the literature and suggest a mechanism through which
   Congress might exercise a constraint on the president, even when it is
   unable to check him legislatively.},

Abstract = {Ethnic diversity has been shown to play a significant role in public
   goods provision, economic growth and government quality, to mention a
   few. However, we do not know which is the impact of ethnic diversity on
   turnout. In this article, we determine which dimensions of ethnic
   diversity affects turnout. To do so, we have gathered data from over 650
   parliamentary elections in 102 democracies covering over a fifty-year
   period. Our models and seven complementary robustness checks show that
   elections in countries with more fractionalised, more polarised and more
   concentrated ethnic groups have a significantly and substantially lower
   turnout. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {The European response to the sovereign debt crisis has exposed a tension
   between the national and the supranational in a multilevel polity while
   opening up new political cleavages between the north and south of the
   Economic and Monetary Union (EMU). This dilemma has become particularly
   acute for programme countries that were either directly or indirectly in
   receipt of non-market financial fundingfrom the troika. Drawing upon a
   new international political economy approach to comparative political
   economy, this article argues that joining together two distinct
   macroeconomic growth regimes is the real source of the euro crisis:
   domestic demand-led models, which predominate in southern Europe, and
   export-led models, which dominate the landscape of northern Europe.
   European policymakers assume that all member states can converge on an
   export-led model of growth. This vision of convergence is exacerbating
   rather than resolving the imbalance of capitalisms at the heart of the
   Eurozone.},

Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {By concluding any sale, its results works are swiped salesperson and the
   buyer. The origin of these commitments and traces should be considered
   the will rule in the conclusion. The contract parties are obliged to do
   something or refuse to take the current. The commitments of the parties
   to perform the contract content is interpreted ``contractual
   liability{''}. Contract terms and principles and its loss compensation
   remedies in international sales conventions of goods and rights of Iran
   and some countries such as France, Egypt, Lebanon don't have the
   greatest difference and hasn't seen any major hurdle in the way of Iran
   to join the Convention. Because of the methods of loss calendar and the
   conditions of its time and site setting in the Convention is workable in
   the Rights of Iran. But some of the ways to compensate for damages
   caused by contract defects that are not predicted in the International
   Convention such as paying the interest are not accepted in Iranian laws.
   Compensation for damages arising from the breach of contractual
   obligations needs to be injured in a position that if the obligation was
   done under the contract, have been fixed in that situation. In the
   international commercial contracts, principles of the private law
   unification institute, this attitude is acceptable and based on this,
   the theory of full compensation of damage is accepted. In this article,
   collecting information is done using the library method and going
   directly to the applied resources and obtained data have been studied
   using analytical-description method of loss compensation.},

Abstract = {A paradox in the comparative literature on electoral systems is that one
   of the most common systems in Europe - flexible-list proportional
   representation systems - may be the least understood. Any study of
   flexible-list systems must start by acknowledging a puzzle: why
   candidates spend time and effort striving to win preference votes when
   typically these votes make no difference between election and defeat.
   Offering the first comprehensive multi-country test of this key puzzle,
   we provide evidence from Belgium, the Czech Republic, and Slovakia that
   parties will promote to better list ranks in the next election those
   candidates who are successful at winning preference votes, thereby
   improving their prospects of election in the longer term and
   incentivizing them to cultivate personal reputations. Our findings have
   important implications for party scholars and practitioners when
   designing, or reforming, political institutions.},

Abstract = {Sub-federal governments have played a prominent role in the development
   of climate change policies in North America. In Canada, four provinces
   in particular, British Columbia, Manitoba, Ontario, and Quebec, worked
   with each other and U.S. states, and engaged at the international level,
   when choosing policy instruments to reduce their greenhouse gas
   emissions. How did interjurisdictional dynamics influence the
   instruments these provinces selected and has there been convergence in
   their policy responses? The article finds that policy transfer,
   information sharing, and emulation among jurisdictions, was more likely
   to overcome competitiveness concerns and lead to policy adoption when it
   was driven by technical learning or the desire to conform to external
   norms, than when jurisdictions compared themselves to others or
   attempted to influence broader policies through political benchmarking
   and bandwagoning. Despite continued variation in some areas, there has
   been limited convergence on some provincial instruments.},

Abstract = {We study the personalization of voting behaviour in European Parliament
   elections. We argue that information from the media is crucial for
   providing linkages between candidates and voters. Moreover, we contend
   that candidates can serve as information short-cuts given the complexity
   of European Union politics. We use a four-wave Dutch panel survey and a
   media study that enable us to link evaluations of lead candidates, party
   preferences, and vote choice to exposure to news about these candidates.
   We show, firstly, that exposure to candidate news is a strong
   explanatory factor for candidate recognition. Secondly, we find that
   candidate evaluations positively affect party choice, albeit mainly for
   those voters who tend to be politically aware. Our research has
   implications for debates about the European Union's accountability
   deficit.},

Abstract = {Poor public service provision and government accountability is
   commonplace in low-income countries. Although mobile phone-based
   platforms have emerged to allow constituents to report service
   deficiencies to government officials, they have been plagued by low
   citizen participation. We question whether low participation may root in
   low political efficacy to politically participate. In the context of a
   text message-reporting platform in Uganda, we investigate the impact of
   adding efficacy-boosting language to mobilization texts(a) citizen name
   personalization and (b) politician encouragementon citizens' willingness
   to report service deficiencies to politicians via text messages. Both
   treatments, designed to increase internal and external efficacy,
   respectively, have a large, positive effect on participation. The
   results are driven by traditionally less internally efficacious
   constituents (females) and less externally efficacious constituents
   (those represented by opposition party members), respectively.},

Abstract = {Almost all popular and academic assessments of Thaksin Shinawatra label
   him a populist, with his time in power characterized by populism.
   Through an assessment of conceptual accounts of populism and a
   discussion of Thaksin's political campaigning and his prime
   ministership, it is argued that this characterization is inaccurate.
   While electorally popular, Thaksin's populism was slow to develop.
   Thaksin's emergence as a populist reflected a configuration of political
   circumstances that forced him to rely increasingly on the support of an
   electoral base made up of the relatively less well-off. In failing to
   account for the development of Thaksin as a populist, an important
   element of Thaksin's politics and of populism as a form of politics is
   missed. Thaksin was made a populist by elite opposition, military coup
   and the political demands by the red shirt mass movement wanting social
   and economic equality underpinned by electoral representation.},

Abstract = {The article focuses on the strategic evolution of the Italian Five Star
   Movement (Movimento 5 Stelle-M5S). The party was born in 2009 as a local
   and civic experience and it represents a new example of populism
   characterized by unprecedented traits. In 2010 the M5S obtained its
   first representatives during regional elections and in 2012 it achieved
   its first Major in a big town (Parma, in the heart of Italy). This path
   from the ``people'' to the political institutions has been completed
   between 2013 and 2014 with entry into National and European Parliament.
   The same process caused a lot of changes in party strategies and a
   strong debate inside the party in regards to its organisation and
   structure. The local case of Parma will work as an example of
   ``overpromising populism'' accused by the central office of a
   compromise-collusion with the ``old'' power. An analysis of national and
   sub-national context will serve as a verification of the idea that power
   participation leads to ``moderation'' of populists. In the final section
   we will hazard some hypothesis about the future of the party and its
   possible ``government role'' in a more comparative perspective.},

Abstract = {Over the last twenty years, there has been a tremendous amount written
   on negativity in political campaigns. Yet, there is a conceptual
   disconnect between the definition of negativity used by researchers and
   how citizens define negativity. In this article, we show how large this
   disparity is and what its consequences are. Using a nationally
   representative online survey of 17,400 Americans and nearly 100 scholars
   of American politics who viewed presidential ads from the 2012 general
   election, we show that citizen perceptions of negativity are much
   stronger predictors of political participation than scholar codings of
   negativity. This means researchers need to give serious thought to how
   they operationalize negativity in their work. If we have any interest in
   understanding how voters are affected by campaign information that they
   perceive as being negative, then we must collect data consistent with
   the public's understanding of negativity. Otherwise, we risk the
   continuation of this conceptual disconnect.},

Abstract = {The rupturing of diplomatic relations between Qatar and four regional
   states Bahrain, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates (UAE)
   in June 2017 brought to a head a long-simmering dispute about Qatar's
   distinctive approach to regional affairs. Six months into the crisis, it
   remains unclear what the Saudi and Emirati endgame is and what, if any,
   concessions Qatar could make that would be enough for policymakers in
   Riyadh and Abu Dhabi. In this article, the author argues that the lack
   of US support for overt sanctions on Qatar makes it likely that the
   anti-Qatar bloc will continue to pressure the country through informal
   measures. This includes meddling in tribal and ruling family politics,
   designed to apply indirect pressure on the Qatari government, in ways
   that threaten to do lasting damage to the social fabric and ties of
   trust in the Gulf.},

Abstract = {This article asks to what extent the European Commission's use of
   consultation depends on policy characteristics of the proposal being
   formulated. It examines all consultations organized during a formulation
   process and looks at the number of open consultations (online
   consultations) as well as the number of repeat consultations (expert
   groups, policy fora) by the total number of consultations. Three types
   of use of consultation are conceptualized. A multinomial logistic
   regression is performed on a cross-sectional sample of 150 policy
   proposals adopted between 2010 and 2014. Data are triangulated from
   official documents. The empirical analysis indicates that the
   Commission's use of consultation depends on the complexity, newness, and
   salience of a proposal. These findings are also discussed in view of the
   2015 reform of Better Regulation.},

Abstract = {Understanding public preferences for governing processes is an
   understudied area of research. In this paper, I evaluate a set of
   critical assumptions relating to process preferences that the literature
   has thus far not addressed. I specifically address the claims made by
   John Hibbing and Elizabeth Theiss-Morse in their seminal book, Stealth
   Democracy, which suggests that people prefer political decisions to be
   made via expert-based governing arrangements to promote a level of
   efficiency and effectiveness within the government that elected
   officials cannot provide. Using original questions from the 2014
   Cooperative Congressional Election Study, I find concurring evidence
   that citizens are not strongly attached to standard participatory
   processes found in democracy. However, upon using more precise
   measurements and placing expert processes into contemporary context,
   preferences weaken and appear to be shallow in nature. In an era where
   process preferences are receiving more attention as trust in government
   wanes, it is important to understand the depth of these preferences and
   their potential to change politics. These results suggest it is
   imperative for future scholars to approach the study of process
   preferences with care.},

Abstract = {The cardinal role of complexity in Friedrich Hayek's theory of the
   market has hardly gone unnoticed. Indeed, there is now a considerable
   corpus of literature that has established the importance of spontaneity
   as a central concept around which neoliberal economic theory revolves.
   However, as William Connolly analyzes, its closed conception of economic
   processes simplifies real economic volatilities and ignores both modes
   of self-organization and creativity found in democracy and social
   movements that periodically irrupt into market processes. This article
   builds upon this critique of neoliberalism and employs Karl Polanyi's
   genealogy of modern capitalism to understand historical imbrications
   between the market and the social and their contribution to the
   fragility of capitalism. Polanyi's notions of (dis-)embeddedness and the
   double movement not only show us a more complex view of modern political
   economy but also provide us with important lessons for political
   responses to the recent crisis of neoliberal capitalism. Connolly WE

Abstract = {We claim that, in presidential democracies, the effect of increasing
   fragmentation on government spending should be conditional on
   polarization, defined as the ideological distance between the
   government's party and other parties in Congress. We build a model where
   this result follows from negotiations between the legislature and an
   independent government seeking the approval of its initiativesas in
   presidential democracies. Using cross-country data over time, we test
   the empirical validity of our claim finding that, in presidential
   democracies, there is indeed a positive effect of fragmentation only
   when polarization is sufficiently high. The same is not true for
   parliamentary democracies.},

Abstract = {While there has been much debate on Singapore's migration policies, a
   `black box' continues to surround policymaking decisions. This article
   examines the dynamics of migration policy reforms in Singapore, using
   the case study of the mandatory weekly day off policy for migrant
   domestic workers. Designing our analysis around the three `Is' - ideas,
   interests and institutions - we argue that the inclusion and
   formalisation of migrant rights in the policy sphere entails the framing
   of migrant rights in a manner that appeals to Singapore's institutional
   logics and cultural repertoire; prioritising the needs and interests of
   citizens in the policy calculus; and institutional readiness and
   conviction to the cause.},

Abstract = {Advocating more repressive law and order policies along the slogan tough
   on crime, tough on the causes of crime' in their election manifesto,
   Tony Blair in the United Kingdom and Gerhard Schroder in Germany were
   elected in the late 1990s. Once in power, however, only New Labour
   substantially toughened law and order policies, whereas the German
   Social Democrats did not change the legal status quo, to a similar
   extent, during their mandate. This article tackles this puzzle, arguing
   that the preferences of the ministers and the formal and informal rules
   shaping the balance of power in government are crucial to understanding
   why two governments that initially advocated similar policies adopted a
   rather different policy stance. The results are based on meticulous
   process tracing and a series of elite interviews concerning two major
   topics in the realm of law and order during the 1990s: policies directed
   at sexual offenders, and policies responding to the terrorist attacks of
   9/11.},

Journal = {WEST EUROPEAN POLITICS},

Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Corrupt governments are not always punished by voters. Under certain
   circumstances citizens consider voting for the incumbent party even if
   the party is perceived as corrupt. Using survey data for Spain, this
   article analyses what makes citizens reject (or not) the idea of voting
   for a corrupt party. Previous research has shown that party
   identification, ideology and political information play a role in
   voters' reactions to corruption. The article argues that voters judge
   corruption in relative terms; what matters is not how corrupt the
   incumbent party is perceived to be but whether it is deemed to be more
   corrupt than the other parties.},

   analyze the indicators that must be taken into account to measure human
   capital, as a variable that, when is developed, promotes the efficiency,
   productivity and growth of micro, small and medium enterprises
   (MIPYMES), which promote in their environments local and regional
   economic dynamics that impacts on a better quality of life of the people
   who make up the same local or regional society, and that from this
   reflects the generation of what can be called local development. As a
   result, a list of indicators, which from different perspectives are
   frequently used to measure human capital, is shown.},

Title = {Request Fulfilling: When Citizens Demand Clientelist Benefits},
Journal = {COMPARATIVE POLITICAL STUDIES},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {50},

Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Traditional accounts of clientelism typically focused on patron-client
   relations with minimal scope for citizen autonomy. Despite the
   heightened agency of many contemporary citizens, most studies continue
   to depict clientelism as a phenomenon that is firmly under elite
   control. The prevailing tendency is to view clientelism as a top-down
   process in which machines target citizens with offers of material
   benefits. Without denying the importance of elites, we emphasize the
   role of citizen demands in clientelism. Citizens often approach machines
   of their own volition to ask for help and may vote for a competitor if
   requests are unfulfilled. In response to these citizens, machines often
   engage in what we call request fulfilling. Interviews with citizens and
   politicians, coupled with cross-national survey data from Africa and
   Latin America, suggest the importance of this phenomenon. In addition,
   Argentine survey data in studies by Stokes and Nichter are better
   explained by request fulfilling than alternative explanations.},

Abstract = {It is increasingly common for social scientists to describe political
   processes as ``path dependent{''}. The concept, however, is often
   employed without careful elaboration. This article conceptualizes path
   dependence as a social process grounded in a dynamic of ``increasing
   returns{''}. Reviewing recent literature in economics and suggesting
   extensions to the world of politics, the article demonstrates that
   increasing returns processes are likely to be prevalent, and that good
   analytical foundations exist for exploring their causes and
   consequences. The investigation of increasing returns can provide a more
   rigorous framework for developing some of the key claims of recent
   scholarship in historical institutionalism: Specific patterns of timing
   and sequence matter; a wide range of social outcomes may be possible;
   large consequences may result from relatively small or contingent
   events; particular courses of action, once introduced, can be almost
   impossible to reverse; and consequently, political development is
   punctuated by critical moments or junctures that shape the basic
   contours of social life.},

Abstract = {Debates about presidential greatness have been with us for decades,
   facilitated in part by numerous systematic surveys of scholars with
   expertise in American history and politics. Nevertheless, the voice of
   political scientists in this debate has been relatively muted when
   compared particularly with the role that historians have had in making
   these determinations. This article introduces and assesses results of a
   recent effort to capture the attitudes of political science presidency
   experts about presidential greatness. By surveying the membership of the
   APSA Presidents and Executive Politics section, we could identify and
   then compare specifically the attitudes of political scientists against
   the growing body of ratings and rankings of a phenomenon with
   long-standing interest and importance.},

Abstract = {Scholars in comparative politics often assume that political parties are
   the primary instruments for translating citizens' preferences into
   specific policy outcomes. However, the crucial but often forgotten link
   between preferences, parties, and outcomes is the bureaucracy. Are
   bureaucrats able to affect policy outside of parties' control? And, if
   so, how does this bureaucratic policy drift differ across institutional
   contexts? I argue that institutions that regulate the nomination process
   by which parties in government select bureaucrats (meritocratic versus
   partisan recruitment) determine the levels of bureaucratic influence on
   the policy making process, specifically in terms of policy change. I
   test my theoretical argument using two large cross-national datasets on
   budget allocations and policy stability. I find that bureaucratic
   professionalism partially explains changes in allocation to the
   ideological budgetary categories and is positively correlated with
   policy stability around the world.},

Abstract = {The fifth election to the Welsh Assembly was held in May 2016. This
   article first outlines the political background to the election, before
   going on to assess the content and conduct of the election campaign. The
   results are then examined in detail: these show that while Labour's vote
   share fell considerably, it comfortably retained its position as the
   largest party in the Assembly. None of Labour's traditional rivals made
   significant ground, while United Kingdom Independence Party (UKIP)
   replaced the Liberal Democrats as the fourth party in the Assembly.
   Welsh Election Study data is then used to model the main factors shaping
   patterns of party support in the election. Modelling of vote choice in
   Wales in 2016 points to the continuing importance relevance of factors
   associated with `valence politics' models, in particular leadership.
   Finally, the conclusion assesses the implications of the election for
   the future of party politics in Wales.},

Abstract = {At a recent major political science conference, Tamara (not her real
   name) presented an in-depth qualitative study several years in the
   making, only to have the panelist speaking after her begin his remarks
   by saying, ``And now back to the hard-core data.{''} By this, he meant
   quantitative, large-n data, which his work utilized. This moment
   highlights a series of tensions in our field relating to gender and
   methodology, and their effects, which this article explores and
   elucidates.},

Abstract = {This paper tries to differentiate cultural trauma from political taboo,
   as well as to show the manifestations of both in Croatia. By capturing
   the recent tendencies of political tabooization and de-tabooization of
   the main national identity signifiers, it is possible to discern several
   clear lines of collective relationships towards the country's cultural
   traumas. First, the cultural victim trauma related to the Homeland War
   is sanctified and frozen. Furthermore, narratives built from that period
   have been increasingly applied to the Second World War, in order to
   represent the quisling Independent State of Croatia in a more positive
   light. Such attempts of making an ideological continuity are a clear
   falsification of history. Second, the cultural perpetrator trauma from
   both periods is denied and silenced. There have been several attempts to
   question both forms of cultural trauma in the fields of arts and civil
   society, but they are of limited reach and influence, especially because
   the mainstream media, political and religious actors promote the
   relativization and revision of the past. At the end of the paper, the
   author gives several pieces of advice for public action in order to
   change this mainstream condition of silencing and the tabooization of
   troubling traces from the past.},

Abstract = {The Energy and Commerce Committee in the U.S. House of Representatives
   developed the 21st Century Cures Act through a fact-finding process that
   involved many different stakeholders in the biotechnology field. This
   effort can be viewed as an example of policy entrepreneurship in that
   the committee was trying to accelerate the development of new drugs and
   treatments. Some members of the committee were very active in this
   process, while others were less engaged. This article investigates what
   factors influenced individual legislators' participation level in the
   initiative. We consider whether there is evidence that legislator
   characteristics and the types of groups actively involved in the
   initiative contributed to some important viewpoints going unaddressed.
   The evidence supports a contention in the literature that legislators
   approach biotechnology with a promotional focus as opposed to placing an
   emphasis on protecting the public from harm, which may have led to
   potentially problematic changes in areas such as informed consent.},

Abstract = {This article considers whether the international legal human rights
   system founded on liberal individualism, as endorsed by liberal
   theorists, can function as a fair universal legal regime. This question
   is examined in relation to the collective right to self-determination
   demanded by indigenous peoples, who are paradigmatic decent nonliberal
   peoples. Indigenous peoples' collective right to self-determination has
   been internationally recognized in the Declaration on the Rights of
   Indigenous Peoples, which was adopted by the United Nations in 2007.
   This historic event may seem to exemplify the international legal human
   rights system's ability to function as a truly global legal regime
   applicable cross-culturally to all well-ordered societies, whether
   liberal or nonliberal. The article argues, however, that the collective
   right to self-determination advocated by indigenous peoples for the sake
   of cultural integrity is inconsistent with the international legal human
   rights system founded on liberal individualism. By showing the
   plausibility of indigenous peoples' defense of their cultural integrity,
   this article suggests that the international legal human rights system
   ought to be reconceptualized to reflect a genuine international
   consensus on human rights among all well-ordered societies if it is to
   function as a just mechanism for global governance.},

Abstract = {Is the social development of an autocracy linked to its claim of
   legitimation? This question is examined in the article with regard to
   infant mortality. Taking into account 321 autocracies from 120 countries
   in the period from 1960 to 2010, we find distinct patterns of social
   development for six types of autocracy with different legitimation
   strategies: electoral autocracies, communist ideocracies, monarchies,
   one-party autocracies, military autocracies, and personalist
   autocracies. In particular, because communist ideocracies are better off
   than (non-ideocratic) one-party autocracies it seems that legitimation
   strategies affect social development. However, the influence of
   legitimation strategies on social development should not be
   overestimated, most notably as the results of our growth curve models
   prove to be provisional.},

Abstract = {As China emerges as a global power, it has showed great willingness to
   remake global development finance by setting up new multilateral
   financial institutions. The creation of those new institutions
   represents a marked departure from the existing multilateral development
   bank (MDB) system. For the first time, the new institutions do not
   depend on the financial largess of the West. To understand the
   circumstances that have led China to create these new institutions and
   the likely consequences, the article first examines the Bretton Woods
   institutional architecture that was created by the United States when it
   emerged as the principal global economic superpower in the aftermath
   ofWorldWar II. In the second part, it analyzes the competition between
   China and the United States in global financial governance given
   Beijing's expanding interests and Washington's declining influence. The
   article further explores in the third section new opportunities and
   challenges that the new financial institutions could bring to China, and
   finally proposes how China could better leverage those new institutions
   to play a transformative role in promoting its global leadership.},

Title = {Who Votes for the Future? Information, Expectations, and Endogeneity in
   Economic Voting},
Journal = {POLITICAL BEHAVIOR},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {39},
Number = {2},
Pages = {347-375},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Voters' four primary evaluations of the economy-retrospective national,
   retrospective pocketbook, prospective national, and prospective
   pocketbook-vary in the cognitive steps necessary to link economic
   outcomes to candidates in elections. We hypothesize that the effects of
   the different economic evaluations on vote choice vary with a voter's
   ability to acquire information and anticipate the election outcome.
   Using data from the 1980 through 2004 US presidential elections, we
   estimate a model of vote choice that includes all four economic
   evaluations as well as information and uncertainty moderators. The
   effects of retrospective evaluations on vote choice do not vary by voter
   information. Prospective economic evaluations weigh in the decisions of
   the most informed voters, who rely on prospective national evaluations
   when they believe the incumbent party will win and on prospective
   pocketbook evaluations when they are uncertain about the election
   outcome or believe that the challenger will win. Voters who have
   accurate expectations about who will win the election show the strongest
   relationship between their vote choice and sociotropic evaluations of
   the economy, both retrospective and prospective. Voters whose economic
   evaluations are most likely to be endogenous to vote choice show a
   weaker relationship between economic evaluations and their votes than
   the voters who appear to be more objective in their assessments of the
   election. Economic voting is broader and more prospective than
   previously accepted, and concerns about endogeneity in economic
   evaluations are overstated.},

Title = {How to Engage ``Democratic Natives{''}? Political Sophistication as
   Important Determinant of Civic Activity of Young Citizens in New
   Democracies (the Case of Poland)},

Abstract = {The article describes the roles of democratic institutions (using the
   example of political parties) in new European democracies (with emphasis
   on Poland) during the formation and consolidation of civic political
   culture. The main assumption of the article is that youth is the key
   phase of life for political socialization, especially in terms of
   patterns of political participation. The problem is considered from two
   perspectives. The first theoretical perspective assumes that democratic
   institutions can fulfill crucial educational and socialization functions
   for the first generation of citizens to have been brought up in
   democratic states and who are referred to by the author as democratic
   natives. The second empirical perspective searches for answers to the
   following questions: ``How and where can democratic institutions (not
   only parties) stimulate the civic activity of young, politically
   inexperienced citizens?{''} and ``How can they practically invest in
   youth participation and good citizenship?{''} The analysis of data
   collected during a survey of Polish students makes it possible to
   identify three areas in which institutions can fulfill their social
   functions: personal efficacy, identification with political parties and
   the interest of young people in politics. The author develops a logistic
   regression model and concludes that stimulation of these three
   indicators (political sophistication) can help create positive social
   phenomena (civic activity) for citizens, who - unlike their parents'
   generation - have grown up in a democratic state. It becomes clear that
   an interest in politics is less important than the other two constructs,
   and therefore the civic activity of young people (who are usually less
   interested in politics) can be more effectively determined by social
   leaders or politicians in their constituencies. The findings can
   contribute to the discussion on how to encourage young citizens to
   participate in politics for the public good.},

Abstract = {Over the last 15 years, there has been a steady erosion of women's
   freedoms and rights in Turkey. While the ruling Justice and Development
   Party (AKP) rose to power by advocating for women's rights - through
   legislations on child custody, divorce, and protections against violence
   - the political discourse throughout much of the AKP era has been
   characterized by gender inequality and patriarchal norms. In this
   article, the author examines the status of women in Turkey from two
   perspectives: the family and the workplace. According to the author, the
   government's rhetoric encourages women to fulfill traditional roles by
   enshrining the duty of motherhood over the pursuit of a career. In the
   workforce, women face a myriad of obstacles including harassment,
   unequal pay, and sexist stereotypes.},

Title = {Critical Election in the Wake of an Economic and Political Crisis:
   Realignment of Icelandic Party Voters?},
Journal = {SCANDINAVIAN POLITICAL STUDIES},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {40},
Number = {2},
Pages = {157-181},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {A critical election is generally defined as one in which the decisive
   results of voting reveal a sharp alternation of pre-existing cleavage(s)
   and voting patterns, and the dealignment or realignment made between
   parties is lasting. A critical election can be caused by various factors
   and in this article the authors analyse whether the global credit crunch
   in 2008 set things in motion in Iceland, resulting in the 2009 election
   as a critical election. In that election, the electoral relevance of
   voters' psychological attachment to parties and of ideological distances
   to them weakened, whereas party competence perceptions increased in
   importance for vote choices. Attachment to parties and ideological
   distances are factors that are generally stable and change slowly over
   time, while party competence is influenced by which issues are of
   importance at the time of the election. This indicates that, in 2009, a
   restructuring of the determinants of the vote occurred; a pattern of
   changes that is typical for a critical election. Evidence is found that
   the importance of party sympathy increases again in the 2013 election,
   indicating a realignment, rather than a dealignment, occurring in the
   wake of the 2009 election.},

Abstract = {The last three election cycles suggest that we may be experiencing a
   surge in black political ambition. Barack Obama's historic election is
   sandwiched between the failed efforts of people such as Denise Majette,
   Harold Ford Jr., Artur Davis, and Kendrick Meek. Combined with Cory
   Booker's senatorial run, scholars have argued that there is a need for a
   reevaluation of black political ambition and a new classification for
   black politics itself. If we are experiencing a genuine emergence of a
   new ambitious breed of black politicians, then the paradox of
   ambitionthat black electoral success is detrimental to black agenda
   settingwould suggest that we may also be experiencing a major
   abandonment of black politics. This paper begins to investigate this
   possibility in terms of individual bill sponsorship for black members of
   Congress from 1947 to 2010.},

Abstract = {Critics have denied the egalitarian credentials of Michael Walzer's
   theory of complex equality. This article locates the disagreement in
   differing conceptions of equality. By situating Walzer's theory in
   historical context, I argue that, via the influence of the Dissent
   circle and the narrative social science of Samuel Beer and Clifford
   Geertz, Walzer developed a view of equality as a political relationship
   that overcomes oppression, not a set of distributive holdings. Walzer
   holds that an egalitarian theory must leave scope for democratic
   decision-making because a society of equals must develop out of
   collective political action, not an abstract theory. Noting that these
   arguments anticipate the new realist approach to political theory, I
   suggest that the dispute about the importance of politics to the
   discipline must extend to the debate about the meaning of equality.},

Abstract = {Students of `conventional' academic disciplines can struggle to
   determine the extent of their employability. Work-based modules offer a
   potential solution to this issue. That these type of modules give
   students the opportunity to apply their knowledge and realise the scope
   of possible employment opportunities afforded by their degree is
   commonly accepted, but real issues arise in tackling the assessment of
   `on the job' experiential learning, particularly in the area of
   politics. This article outlines an integrated and iterative approach to
   assessment, starting with the design of the component parts of the
   module, moving on consider the role played by simple tools such as the
   framing of key narratives, the development of placement diaries
   incorporating SWOT analysis and the use of the Politics and
   International Relations Subject Benchmark Statement. The importance of
   integrating the module design with the final assessment processes is
   described, and some examples are offered of how students have described
   the ways in which the module has enabled them to bridge the gap between
   theory and practice, and scholarship and employability.},

Abstract = {This study introduces a population-ecological approach to the entry and
   exit of political parties. A primary proposition of population ecology
   is that organizational entry and exit depends on the number of
   organizations already present: that is, density. We propose that
   political parties mainly experience competition from parties in the same
   ideological niche (left, centre, right). Pooled time-series analyses of
   410 parties, 263 elections and 18 West-European countries largely
   support our expectations. We find that political parties are more likely
   to exit when density within their niche increases. Also there is
   competition between adjacent ideological niches, i.e. between centrist
   and right-wing niches. In contrast to our expectations, neither density
   nor institutional rules impact party entry. This raises important
   questions about the rationale of prospective entrants.},

Abstract = {This study examines how anti-immigrant policies affect the physical
   health of Latina/os in the United States. Merging two unique datasets:
   sum of anti-immigrant policies by state from 2005 to 2011 and a 2011
   Robert Wood Johnson Center for Health Policy nationally representative
   sample of Latina/os (n=1,200), we estimate a series of logistic
   regressions to understand how anti-immigrant legislations are affecting
   the health of Latina/os. Our modeling approach takes into consideration
   Latinos' diverse experience, a context that is widely overlooked in
   datasets that treat Latina/os as a homogeneous ethnic group. Our
   findings suggest that an increase in anti-immigrant laws enacted by a
   state decreases the probability of respondents reporting optimal health,
   even when controlling for other relevant factors, such as citizenship
   status, language of interview, and interethnic variation. The
   implication and significance of this work has tremendous impacts for
   scholars, policy makers, health service providers, and applied
   researchers interested in reducing health disparities among minority
   populations.},

Year = {2017},
Volume = {111},
Number = {2},
Pages = {295-307},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Distrust of public authorities is a mainstay of democratic politics. In
   recent decades, however, concern with surging civic suspicion has led
   political scientists to emphasize the value of trust for good
   government. This article advances a novel reading of Jeremy Bentham's
   political theory to shed light on the promise and perils of these two
   dispositions. Trust and distrust go together, in Bentham's account.
   Inmaking this case, I reexamine Bentham's reflections on publicity, and
   distinguish between two perspectives implicit in his theory-the
   perspective of institutional design, and the perspective of popular
   oversight. This distinction brings clarity to Bentham's surprising
   recommendation: sober distrust toward public authorities generally,
   together with particularized trust in those (and only those)
   institutions or officials who prove themselves worthy of it.},

Abstract = {The article considers the relationship between the abstractions of
   consciousness, knowing and labor within the philosophical transition
   from Hegel to Marx. In pursuit of this aim, I focus first on Remo
   Bodei's interpretation, which is attentive to the meaning of ``absolute
   knowing{''} within the Hegelian system, and Roberto Finelli's, which
   examines the forms of the relationship between abstract labor,
   capitalism and modernity. In the last part of the article, I draw on
   Daniel Brudney's argument in Marx's Attempt to Leave Philosophy, showing
   that its alternative interpretation leads to an impasse. Brudney
   correctly grasps that the young Marx is hostile to philosophical method,
   but this abandonment of philosophical thought does not coincide with the
   refusal of any form of abstraction.},

Abstract = {This article examines the impact of judicialisation on the right to
   cross border healthcare in Denmark and Spain, that is, the national
   impact of legal integration as spurred by the Court of Justice of the
   European Union. We expect the national impact of judicialisation to be
   conditioned by the ex-post judicial, administrative and political
   responses, particularly the national courts' activation of EU law. By
   using new data, a compilation of national court cases, quasi-judicial
   proceedings and research interviews with key respondents, we examine the
   process of judicialisation in the two member states. The findings
   demonstrate that the national courts hardly played a role in Denmark and
   that although the courts were more active in Spain, the rulings remained
   largely unobserved by the political and administrative elite and the
   courts were thus unable to push for change. The administrative and
   political responses were found to be quite similar in the two member
   states, adapting to EU-induced changes in a protectionist and defensive
   manner. We conclude that the two universalistic healthcare models have
   so far proved resistant to judicialisation and that the discrepancy
   between what emerges de jure at the supranational level and the de facto
   rights produced at the national level is still a wide one.},

Abstract = {This study evaluates contradictory theoretical predictions concerning
   the relationship between the candidate-centredness of electoral systems
   and voter turnout. Candidate-centredness has been proposed to both
   stimulate and depress turnout. Cross-sectional time-series data from 36
   democracies between 1990 and 2014 are used to test the competing
   assumptions made about the impact of the personal vote on turnout. Three
   measures assessing the extent to which electoral systems create
   incentives to cultivate a personal vote are employed. The results show
   that turnout is the lowest in candidate-centred systems and the highest
   in party-centred systems with closed and ordered lists, while
   controlling for a host of contextual factors that have been linked to
   aggregate turnout. In addition, the finding that candidate-centredness
   is negatively related to turnout holds up even when taking into account
   district magnitude, electoral disproportionality and effective number of
   parties.},

Abstract = {This article analyses the visibility of European Union (EU) citizens in
   EU news during the 2009 European Parliament election. It argues that the
   presence of EU citizens in EU news is vital for responsiveness of
   European governance. First, the theoretical notion of EU citizens is
   considered. Next, a new way of defining EU citizens is proposed: EU
   citizens are divided into national and supranational EU citizens. The
   visibility of EU citizens in EU news of 27 EU member states is analysed
   aiming to explain cross-country differences. The paper is based on a
   large-scale content analysis of TV and newspaper articles gathered
   during the 2009 European Parliament election. To explain different
   levels of visibility, a multi-level analysis is carried out. The results
   suggest that EU citizens are visible in the EU news, yet, their presence
   strongly varies across countries. The findings indicate that
   explanations for different levels of visibility can be found at both the
   media and country level.},

Abstract = {Comparative studies of capitalist political economies have settled on a
   new understanding of how historical choices about electoral rules were
   constitutive of the current varieties of capitalism that are
   distinguished by their strategies of growth and adjustment to
   competitive conditions. The countries that have ``coordinated market
   economies{''} typically have well-organized unions and employers with
   distinct partisan representation under multiparty electoral rules, and
   they have more egalitarian outcomes. The countries that have ``liberal
   market economies{''} have arms-length market-based relationships under
   the plurality rule that are more conflictual, and they have
   inegalitarian outcomes. This article develops the analysis of electoral
   rules and industrial order by taking another look at the United States,
   which has always been taken as a case of plurality and liberal market
   economy. In contrast, New York had multiparty politics for most of the
   twentieth century, in part because of its cross-endorsement fusion rule
   of nominations. This article argues that fusion operated in a similar
   way to proportional representation to enable labor-management
   collaboration and social regulation. Collaboration in New York City was
   a constitutive element of the New Deal's laboristic politics. The later
   disruption of this American version of coordination transformed the U.S.
   political economy into a liberal market economy.},

Abstract = {Social scientists are commonly advised to deduce and test all observable
   implications of their theories. We describe a principled framework for
   testing such elaborate theories: nonparametric combination.
   Nonparametric combination (NPC) assesses the joint probability of
   observing the theoretically predicted pattern of results under the sharp
   null of no effects. NPC accounts for the dependence among the component
   tests without relying on modeling assumptions or asymptotic
   approximations. Multiple-testing corrections are also easily implemented
   with NPC. As we demonstrate with four applications, NPC leverages
   theoretical knowledge into greater statistical power, which is
   particularly valuable for studies with strong research designs but small
   sample sizes. We implement these methods in a new R package, NPC.},

Journal = {RESEARCH \& POLITICS},

Month = {APR-JUN},
Abstract = {Does increased militarization of law enforcement agencies (LEAs) lead to
   an increase in violent behavior among officers? We theorize that the
   receipt of military equipment increases multiple dimensions of LEA
   militarization (material, cultural, organizational, and operational) and
   that such increases lead to more violent behavior. The US Department of
   Defense 1033 program makes excess military equipment, including weapons
   and vehicles, available to local LEAs. The variation in the amount of
   transferred equipment allows us to probe the relationship between
   military transfers and police violence. We estimate a series of
   regressions that test the effect of 1033 transfers on three dependent
   variables meant to capture police violence: the number of civilian
   casualties; the change in the number of civilian casualties; and the
   number of dogs killed by police. We find a positive and statistically
   significant relationship between 1033 transfers and fatalities from
   officer-involved shootings across all models.},

Abstract = {Active research on a wide range of political contexts centers on
   ethnicity's role in collective action. Many theories posit that
   information flows more easily in ethnically homogeneous areas,
   facilitating collective action, because social networks among coethnics
   are denser. Although this characterization is ubiquitous, little
   empirical work assesses it. Through a novel field experiment in a
   matched pair of villages in rural Uganda, this article directly examines
   word-of-mouth information spread and its relationship to ethnic
   diversity and networks. As expected, information spread more widely in
   the homogeneous village. However, unexpectedly, the more diverse
   village's network is significantly denser. Using unusually detailed
   network data, we offer an explanation for why network density may hamper
   information dissemination in heterogeneous areas, showing why even
   slight hesitation to share information with people from other groups can
   have large aggregate effects.},

Abstract = {The euro crisis brought back a widening gap in prosperity between the
   eurozone's core and periphery members, but also revealed a divergence in
   the strength of its national democracies. This article examines the
   amplified tension between progressively uprooted national markets
   governed by a supranational technocracy and nationally organized
   democratic politics in the eurozone's periphery. Building on Dani
   Rodrik's globalization trilemma', this article explains the weakening of
   national democratic institutions in Greece, Ireland, Portugal, Spain and
   Italy since 2008. While the periphery states were forced to choose
   monetary integration at the expense of both democracy and sovereignty,
   this trade-off was mostly absent in the core. The eurozone's policy
   solutions to the crisis did not allow for any democratic input, were
   implemented through opaque and often-undemocratic throughput processes,
   and resulted in deteriorating output. The article concludes that the EU
   crisis response made euro membership in the periphery less compatible
   with national democratic principles.},

Abstract = {Human rights organizations (HROs) frame advocacy campaigns in order to
   shape individuals' values and mobilize them to act. While previous work
   has examined some commonly used HRO frames, we know little about how
   they work as most often utilized-in combination. In this experiment,
   participants were randomly assigned either to a control group or to
   treatment groups shown campaigns against sleep deprivation during
   interrogation featuring frames used alone or in combination. We find
   that effects of personal frames on action mobilization are not mitigated
   by the inclusion of other frames, and that human rights campaigns with
   multiple frames yield outcomes that are neither better nor worse than a
   single personal narrative of human suffering. HROs should be able to use
   multiple frames in combination as needed without concern.},

Volume = {70},
Number = {2},

Abstract = {This article argues that the root of recent crises and political
   stalemate in Northern Ireland lies in a constitutional failure. The Good
   Friday Agreement of 1998 played an innovative constitutional role in
   Northern Ireland, and this was central to peace and stability. Yet, its
   own principles were underspecified and disputed. Strong convergent
   action by the British and Irish states functioned as an informal mode of
   constitutional adjudication and it stabilised the settlement. It failed,
   however, to emphasise constitutional principles or to embed them within
   the politics of Northern Ireland. British and Irish interests and
   capacities have changed and with them also the role the states play in
   Northern Ireland; the result from 2012 has been recurrent political
   crisis. If the informal British-Irish approach cannot be sustained, the
   likely alternative-a narrower form of British sovereigntism-carries
   still greater dangers to stability.},

Abstract = {In this article I outline two divergent visions of a post-carbon future
   which I label `climate capitalism' and `ecological democracy.' These
   models are necessarily simplified and incomplete, serving as rough ideal
   types that can help us make sense of policy choices with regard to
   climate change as decisions laying the foundations of our future
   societal development. Decisions taken now direct us along one path,
   often making other directions more obscure, inaccessible, or
   unthinkable. The outcome of each junction in the interplay of social
   forces opens and forecloses future possibilities for action within a
   given time frame. Some outcomes are easily overturned, others are
   `definitive' for a generation or more. In the context of global warming
   and related ecological crises, what we humans choose to do within the
   next ten years can be expected to have irreversible consequences for
   many future generations.
   Notwithstanding the potential for capitalists to invent and commodify
   new `post-carbon' technologies or to invent eco-system service-based
   commodities, questions are posed about the ecological sustainability of
   a mode of production that relies upon ever-expanding growth in material
   and energy through-puts. Is capitalism, ultimately, unthinkable in a
   steady-state system of production and consumption? Can capitalism
   dematerialize while wage-labour continues to define the mode of
   production? Or, as many in the global climate justice movement believe,
   will a just solution to global warming require far-reaching
   transformations of the global capitalist economic and social order? Will
   the properties of the renewable energy technologies that we are
   currently able to envisage (solar, wind, geothermal, tidal,
   hydro-electric, conservation, etc.) resist monopoly ownership and
   control and underpin more decentralized and democratic communities?
   These are questions with which the left is grappling in every context,
   including in Alberta, where an unprecedented opportunity for change
   opened up with the election of the New Democratic Party in May 2015
   following many decades of government by conservative parties. In the
   first part of this article I outline, in general terms, emerging
   post-carbon visions or models of development. In the second part, I
   shift the focus of analysis to the observable sign-posts and
   possibilities for post-carbon transition in the Alberta context.},

Abstract = {This paper examines patterns of intra-organisational evolution and
   reform of Fianna Fail as a party organisation before and after the 2011
   Dail election, widely considered an earthquake election' that
   fundamentally undermined Fianna Fail's status as the dominant party in
   the Irish party system. Electoral losses had triggered reform in Fianna
   Fail prior to 2011, but such reforms tended to be minor, as the party
   expected its opposition status to be temporary. This orientation changed
   after 2011, as the party's very foundation seemed threatened, having
   suffered a historic decline of its electoral support and membership. We
   argue that the post-2011 re-orientation can be usefully characterised as
   a movement away from organisational characteristics associated with the
   cartel model of party organisation' towards characteristics echoing more
   traditional mass party structures', an organisational model less
   dependent on state resources, and more able to generate loyalty through
   organisational means. Whether the 2011 reforms will lead to lasting
   change is likely to depend on whether, and if so how quickly, Fianna
   Fail can reclaim its position as the major party of government.},

Abstract = {Although Martha Derthick has received most recognition for her
   contributions to political science and government, we argue that her
   astute accounts of federalism in action offer precisely what historians
   of American governance need at this moment. This essay highlights
   several of her contributions: her insistence on seeing the United States
   as a ``compound republic{''} comprised of multiple levels of authority
   rather than equating government with the national government; her focus
   on federalism's shifting dynamics and concern with demonstrating those
   dynamics empirically; her dedication to studying ``the middle tier{''}
   and showing that states gained real power during the nineteenth and
   twentieth centuries as they took on functions previously performed by
   localities; and her attentiveness to the endurance of localism in
   American politics and policy. Drawing on case studies and recent
   scholarship, we explain why these insights are vital to historians and
   suggest how historians' more thorough incorporation of them could enrich
   our understanding of key aspects of the American past.},

Abstract = {There is conceptual confusion in academic scholarship regarding
   Indigenous research methodologies and decolonising research
   methodologies. Scholars view these paradigms as similar yet distinct,
   but very few seek to define that distinction. In this article, I explore
   the relationship between these approaches to academic research. Both
   paradigms emphasise the need to transform the academy because of its
   tendency to marginalise non-Western epistemologies. Transformation
   requires the interconnection and co-ordination of many paradigms
   including Indigenous, feminist, and antiracist approaches to research. I
   propose viewing Indigenous and decolonising research methodologies as a
   relationship, and suggest both are dynamic practices that do not exist
   outside of the people who use them. What they look like and how they
   relate to one another will depend upon who uses them, why they are used,
   and where they are practiced.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this work is to provide the means for a better
   understanding of the new and multifaceted conceptualizations of
   environmental sustainability. The projection extends from insights
   gathered from a renewal of ancient cosmological views that have become
   prominent in contemporary political understandings, coupled with the
   similarities of the unique cultures of Indigenous Peoples, with their
   distinctive manners of perceiving the necessity of environmental
   sustainability. Indigenous Peoples have always sought to retain their
   cultural, economic, and political characteristics distinct from the
   dominant societies. Yet they are included as well within the UN in one
   the primary concerns generated by the ``International Community,{''} as
   a motivating factor of global governance. The goal of environmental
   sustainability is within contemporary global governance. It is directed
   towards the present day through the use of concepts that have persisted
   in Indigenous histories for centuries. Contemporary understandings of
   global governance and the earthly-view of Indigenous Peoples strive
   together toward environmental sustainability.},

Abstract = {Democratic transitions in Asia have received widespread interest in the
   political science literature since the 1990s. The Thein Sein-led
   government that came into power in 2010 in Myanmar has undertaken wide
   ranging reforms that has altered the country's political landscape. They
   include evolving a working relationship with the political opposition,
   freeing political prisoners, and the granting of amnesty to political
   exiles to encourage their return, the negotiation of ceasefire
   agreements with almost all of the ethnic insurgent armies and the
   inauguration of the Myanmar Peace Centre. Nonetheless, the county
   continues to suffer from ongoing developments that retard the process of
   democratization as well. A confluence of interest between the NLD,
   ethnic groups, and civil society organizations also prompted attempts to
   change the 2008 Constitution and its by-laws that prevented Aung San Suu
   Kyi from running for the country's presidency. That attempt and the
   potential for reform were scuttled by the August 2015 coup' against
   Thura Shwe Mann. The NLD's overwhelming victory in the November
   elections has significantly strengthened Suu Kyi's position and all
   major political actors including those from the military have been
   conciliatory towards the election outcome and there is cause for
   cautious optimism. After 6 months in power, the policy priorities of the
   new government are also clearer.},

Abstract = {The EU's European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP) was launched in 2004 as an
   external strategy to bind and harmonize the larger neighborhood. This
   external governance approach includes hierarchical and network elements
   with the goal of maintaining external and internal stability and
   security. As a replacement for the enlargement policy with the prospect
   of future membership, this foreign policy approach is perceived
   differently by the Eastern neighbors and the level of participation
   differs depending on the country involved. While Ukraine has pursued a
   clear pro-EU course since the events of the Euromaidan in 2014, Belarus,
   which is a member of the Eurasian Union, cooperates with the EU on a
   loose basis, which can be interpreted as a strategy to counterbalance
   Russia's influence. A close look at an EU-funded waste management
   project carried out in Belarus and Ukraine reveals a discrepancy between
   rule adoption and application as fostered by the ENP and its perception
   by local and international experts.},

Abstract = {Scholars interested in bargaining over political appointments typically
   analyze the duration between the candidate's nomination and eventual
   disposition, ignoring the prior period between vacancy and nomination.
   Using a dataset of vacancies reported to the Government Accountability
   Office, we instead examine the nomination stage. We uncover both
   commonalities and differences between the dynamics of nomination and
   those of confirmation. Ideological divergence between the President and
   the Senate filibuster pivot tends to delay nominations but only under
   divided government. Presidents not only move more quickly on more
   important positions, but are also influenced by the ideological leanings
   of the agencies.},

Abstract = {Throughout U.S. history, the two major political parties have switched
   positions many times on a variety of issues, including whether the
   United States should intervene more or less in foreign affairs. Are
   these changes simply the product of historical contingency, or are there
   structural factors at work that can help explain these developments?
   This article finds that change in party control of the presidency can
   help explain change in party ideologies with respect to foreign policy.
   Parties in long-term control of the presidency tend to change their
   ideology in ways that call for more foreign intervention, while parties
   in opposition to the presidency tend to change their ideology in ways
   that call for less foreign intervention.},

Abstract = {`Informational lobbying' is the provision of information to policymakers
   with the intent of influencing debate and policy. However, influence is
   more likely when groups make strategic choices about what (relevant and
   timely) information to provide, when, and to whom. To do this, groups
   need `process information,' or knowledge about current policymaking. In
   contrast to extant theories of informational lobbying, I argue that we
   cannot assume process information is automatically available to groups,
   nor that access to it is solely dependent on group-level characteristics
   like resource endowments. Instead, each policymaking system releases
   process information differently. Using interviews with forestry-related
   groups in France and Sweden, I show that policymaking systems matter
   more than group type for these groups' perceptions of process
   information. Acknowledging process information as a systemic variable in
   its own right opens up new avenues of inquiry about lobbying and group
   behavior.},

Abstract = {Based on the viewpoint shared by Shiite jurisprudents, the second source
   of jurisprudence is ``Sire''. The Holy Prophet (PBUH) and Imams' (AS)
   words and deeds that are called ``Sire'' are considered as religious
   justification used as a reason for inferring from religious orders. In
   order to infer from religious orders, jurisprudents refer to the Holy
   Prophet (PBUH) and Imams' (AS) practical Sire which aimed at explaining
   an issue or removing its ambiguity as an independently supportive reason
   to prove their claim.
   The intention of investigating this subject was to gain an understanding
   of the Shiite jurisprudents' approach to dealing with the Holy Prophet
   (PBUH) and Imams' (AS) deeds as well as discovering the jurisprudents'
   position to their deeds, i. e. to find out if they deal with the deeds
   the same way as they deal with the words or not. In this study, it was
   tried to investigate types of Shiite jurisprudents' reference to the
   practical Sire of the Holy Prophet (PBUH) and Imams (AS) and explain the
   viewpoints shared by the jurisprudents. Authentic sources of Islamic
   jurisprudence were benefitted from in this study.
   Types of jurisprudents' reference to obligation, recommendation, etc.
   were mentioned in this study. Also, the difference between words and
   deeds of the Holy Prophet (PBUH) and Imams (AS) and the domain of their
   practical reasonability as well were discussed. Types of jurisprudents'
   reference to the practical Sire of the Holy Prophet (PBUH) and Imams
   (AS) were discussed, too.},

Abstract = {Citizens in Ghana have a host of options when it comes to local
   governance provision as a result of the government's decentralization
   policies. We undertake to explore and understand how Ghanaians navigate
   the constellation of local institutions, both formal and traditional, to
   solve an array of common problems. A four-constituency survey was
   administered during the summer of 2009 and asked respondents about their
   experiences interacting with four formal institutions and one
   traditional institution. We find that formal institutions are by and
   large working effectively and are enhanced by the presence of a
   traditional institution. We consider the implications of our results
   with respect to both democratization and decentralization.},

Abstract = {Active learning techniques tend to emphasize simulations, research
   projects, and the use of popular media to the relative neglect of
   problem-based approaches. This paper introduces a new problem-based
   exercise specifically for teaching international relations (IR) theories
   that builds on existing problem-based approaches by incorporating
   analogies and an exemplar-based approach to concept learning. Teaching
   complex IR theories to students, who are often early in their academic
   careers, can be a challenge for many academic staff. Our approach uses a
   carefully structured analogy, based on a dating scenario, to challenge
   students to explain and theorize the behaviour of the key actors in a
   way that is transferable to an IR analysis of state behaviour. The
   exercise yields an intuitive understanding of core theories that
   facilitates subsequent learning and application.},

Abstract = {This article argues that the dominant democratic model of political
   accountability is shown to have been unduly centred on rights,
   institutionalisation, and punishment. Drawing inspiration from Confucian
   classics, this article proposes an alternative model of political
   accountability in which ethical norms and moral sentiments play crucial
   roles. Based on a structural analysis of accountability, the comparison
   between democratic accountability and Confucian accountability
   demonstrates two implications: first, recognition of the ample resource
   of accountability in Confucian tradition challenges the idea that the
   notion of accountability is simply a Western or democratic concept which
   has no root in Confucian societies; second, as an intellectual tradition
   and practical wisdom, some of the Confucian insights, reconstructed and
   applied to modern society, may well have the capacity to address
   contemporary issues more productively, especially in the domain of
   democratic deficits, than the dominant liberal approach.},

Abstract = {This study reviews the development of Chinese regulation against the
   history of the development of the regulatory state in the West. Section
   One discusses the rise of the regulatory state in western democracies in
   an age of concern about state expansion. It notes that, generally
   speaking, the regulatory state in a liberal democratic setting has
   become accepted as enabling liberal democracies to combine democratic
   legitimacy with the independence and professionalism of unelected
   regulatory bodies. Section Two offers a quick overview of the
   establishment and proliferation of regulatory institutions in China in
   the context of continued single-Party rule and strong state dominance.
   Section Three delineates the politics of changes to the regulatory
   regime from the perspective of political risk and points to dynamics
   that are animating regulatory state building with Chinese
   characteristics, with special reference to environmental regulation.
   Section Four concludes.},

Title = {Do political budget cycles work? A micro-level investigation of
   pre-electoral budgeting and its electoral consequences},
Journal = {ELECTORAL STUDIES},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {45},
Pages = {29-43},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {One of the most puzzling empirical patterns in political economy is the
   disconnect between the regular use of fiscal instruments for re-election
   purposes by incumbents (otherwise known as political budget cycles) on
   the one hand and their relative electoral ineffectiveness on the other.
   This article engages with this puzzle by shifting the analysis from the
   macro to the micro-level. It shows that when taking into account
   individual-level heterogeneity in the electoral response, one can gain a
   more nuanced understanding of the political consequences of
   pre-electoral budgeting. By relying on a set of multi-level
   random-effects regressions using data from the Comparative Study of
   Electoral System surveys, it points to two such sources of
   heterogeneity: social status and ideology. In particular, higher status
   individuals are considerably less responsive to pre-electoral deficits,
   though the effects depend on the composition of fiscal measures. Results
   for ideology are somewhat less consistent across different
   operationalizations of ideology as well as model specification. (C) 2016

Title = {Why don't people vote in US primary elections? Assessing theoretical
   explanations for reduced participation},
Journal = {ELECTORAL STUDIES},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {45},

Abstract = {Primary election participation in the United States is consistently
   lower than general election turnout. Despite this well-documented voting
   gap, our knowledge is limited as to the individual-level factors that
   explain why some general election voters do not show up for primary
   contests. We provide important insights into this question, using a
   novel new survey to examine three theoretical perspectives on
   participation never before empirically applied to primary races.
   Compared to general elections, we find that for U.S. House primary
   elections sizable segments of the electorate consider the stakes lower
   and the costs of voting greater, feel less social pressure to turn out
   and hold exclusionary beliefs about who should participate, and are more
   willing to defer to those who know and care more about the contests.
   Multivariate analysis reveals that these attitudes explain validated
   primary election participation. These findings point to new directions
   for future research. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Can experience overcome stereotypes in times of terror threat?},
Journal = {RESEARCH \& POLITICS},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {4},
Number = {1},
Month = {FEB 1},
Abstract = {Research on evaluations of leaders has frequently found that female
   leaders receive lower ratings in times of national security crisis.
   However, less is known about countervailing factors. We contend that
   partisanship and leadership experience in relevant domains are two
   factors that can counteract the negative effects of terrorist threat on
   evaluations of female political leaders. To test this expectation, we
   implemented a national study in 2012 containing terrorist threat and
   non-threat conditions, and then asked participants to evaluate political
   leaders. The results show that Republican leaders, including women, are
   unaffected by terrorist threat; in contrast, Democratic leaders are
   punished during times of terrorist threat, but this negative effect is
   smaller for then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton compared to Nancy
   Pelosi, who lacks similar experience. In short, Republican partisanship
   is a strong countervailing factor, while leadership experience in

Abstract = {Over the last few decades, democratic theory has grown dramatically in
   its power and sophistication, fueled by debates among models of
   democracy. But these debates are increasingly unproductive. Model-based
   strategies encourage theorists to overgeneralize the place and functions
   of ideal typical features of democracy, such as deliberation or
   elections. Here I sketch an alternative strategy based on the question:
   What kinds of problems does a political system need to solve to count as
   democratic? I suggest three general kinds: it should empower inclusions,
   form collective agendas and wills, and have capacities to make
   collective decisions. We can view common practices such as voting and
   deliberating as means for addressing these problems, and theorize
   institutional mixes of practices that would maximize a political
   system's democratic problem-solving capacities. The resulting theories
   will be both normatively robust and sufficiently fine-grained to frame
   democratic problems, possibilities, and deficits in complex polities.},

Abstract = {The European Union (EU) has long sought to play a normative role in
   global energy governance, a role that requires a coherent,
   comprehensible and memorable image. Yet within its borders, there are
   divisions and discrepancies on energy, which may have an impact on the
   external reception of EU actions. France, Germany and the United Kingdom
   (UK), commonly referred to as `the EU's big 3', seem to have little in
   common on issues of energy policy. EU rhetoric on external energy
   matters places firm emphasis on three key `frames' of understanding:
   sustainability, competitiveness and security of supply, yet the domestic
   rhetorics of France, Germany and the UK variously appear to place
   priority on one or more of these frames. This article explores media
   representations of the EU's external energy relations from within the
   `Big 3' EU member states and asks whether the EU's normative agenda on
   external energy drives these media representations, or whether domestic
   member state interests dominate.},

Title = {INTEGRATION OF IMMIGRANTS WITH DIFFERENT CULTURAL BACKGROUND: THE GERMAN
   EXPERIENCE},
Journal = {POLIS-POLITICHESKIYE ISSLEDOVANIYA},
Year = {2017},
Number = {6},
Pages = {169-177},
Abstract = {The article deals with the German integration policy toward the refugees
   that arrived in the country since 2013, including on the wave of the
   2015 migration crisis. Analysis includes such aspects of integration
   policy as its discursive design, education (language and integration
   courses), refugees' access to the labor market, social integration and
   the identity of immigrants. The ``bottlenecks{''} and the most urgent
   problems of German integration policy are shown, along with the possible
   ways of solving some of them. Among the key problems of the integration
   policy are the lack of inclusivity of integration and language courses,
   which can be attended only by the refugees with a recognition index
   (Anerkennungsquote) above 50\%. A lot of course participants are unable
   to complete their studies, and afterwards, demonstrate a low level of
   knowledge. Integration of refugees on the labor market is generally
   assessed as positive; however, there is a number of administrative
   barriers in this sphere, such as a ban on work in particular German
   territories for refugees with low recognition indexes, as well as
   restrictions on the change of residence. A number of pressing problems
   of integration policy lie in the field of psychology: the key of them
   are the search for refugees of a new identity and their difficult
   psychological condition (almost one in every three refugees is
   susceptible to one or another psychological disorder). However, in the
   situation of uncertainty, while the refugee has to wait for a long time
   for a decision on his application, the therapy is virtually useless, and
   the problem of refugees' search for identity doesn't have any efficient
   solution. The value basis of integration policy remains limited: without
   a full solution to this problem, the fundamental positive changes in its
   implementation are still questionable. A significant contribution to the
   integration of refugees is made by volunteers who receive refugees to
   their families, provide mentoring and other types of support. All in
   all, successful integration happens most often, if an individual
   approach to refugees is combined with their adoption of local practices,
   formal and informal settings. Despite the fact that civil society
   greatly contributes to integration of refugees, the interaction between
   the state and the civil society is not always effective. Thus, two of
   the three German citizens who provided assistance to refugees (both
   professionally and voluntarily) faced regulatory and legislative
   problems. In general, despite a number of difficulties, Germany
   demonstrates considerable success in the field of integration policy,
   which is in line with the generally optimistic attitude of the Germans
   regarding the prospects for the integration of refugees.},

Abstract = {Over the last decade, France has put in place a series of measures to
   reinforce laicite and Republican values. While these notions have never
   clearly been defined, they have been used as a justification to
   scrutinize and interfere in the bodies, sensibilities and practices of
   Muslim' citizens. In the aftermath of the Charlie Hebdo attacks in
   January 2015 and the November 13th terrorist attacks that same year,
   these policies have become ever more important, and are buttressed by
   new extraordinary' measures, such as the State of Emergency'. This
   article explores these different measures, and analyzes their
   consequences for French citizens, especially citizens of Muslim faith.
   It also pays attention to political and legal strategies put forth by
   activists to denounce these recent shifts, and to propose a more
   inclusive and equal understanding of citizenship.},

   Argument for the Political Science Major},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE EDUCATION},

Volume = {13},
Number = {2},
Pages = {200-210},
Abstract = {For many political science programs, research methods courses are a
   fundamental component of the recommended undergraduate curriculum.
   However, instructors and students often see these courses as the most
   challenging. This study explores when it is most appropriate for
   political science majors to enroll and pass a research methods course.
   The hypothesis posits that the number of prior introductory-level
   political science courses can be a strong precursor to research methods
   success, even for those who are upper-class students and majors. This
   hypothesis is tested by analyzing data from six sections of an
   undergraduate research course offered at a midsized public university.
   The results demonstrate that students are most likely to succeed in
   their research methods course if they are majors with at least five
   previous political sciences courses completed. Recommendations for
   course prerequisites and specific curriculum mapping are offered in
   light of these findings.},

   institutionalisation and democracy},
Journal = {WEST EUROPEAN POLITICS},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {40},

Pages = {402-429},
Abstract = {No matter the region of the world under study, party (system)
   institutionalisation has been traditionally considered to be a
   necessary, but not sufficient, condition for the survival of democracy.
   Despite being one of the most quoted statements in the democratisation
   literature, the few studies looking at the relationship between
   institutionalisation and democratic endurance have found no evidence of
   the almost magical' powers of the former. This article revisits the
   abovementioned research question by making use of an original dataset
   covering all European democracies between 1848 and 2014. The main
   findings are threefold: (1) it is not the institutionalisation of
   political parties but the institutionalisation of party systems as a
   whole that has fostered the prospects for democratic survival in Europe;
   (2) there is a threshold of systemic institutionalisation which, once
   reached, will avoid democratic collapse; and (3) systemic
   over-institutionalisation does not seem to be so perilous for the
   survival of democracy.},

Journal = {CRITICAL REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL SOCIAL AND POLITICAL PHILOSOPHY},

Abstract = {In his last works, John Rawls explicitly argued for an overlapping
   consensus on a family of reasonable liberal political conceptions of
   justice, rather than just one. This `Deep Version' of political
   liberalism opens up new questions about the relationship between
   citizens' political conceptions, from which they must draw and offer
   public reasons in their political advocacy, and their comprehensive
   doctrines. These questions centre on whether a reasonable citizen's
   choice of political conception can be influenced by her comprehensive
   doctrine. In this paper I present two models of the relationship, which
   give contrasting answers to these questions, and defend the model that
   is more permissive with regard to the influence of comprehensive
   doctrines. This has important implications for our understanding of
   Rawlsian political liberalism, and reduces the force of objections that
   have been offered by theorists sympathetic to religion.},

   EU to build a digital single market affects the mobilisation strategies
   of two associations of French writers' representatives. The article
   identifies a double phenomenon: the conservation of previous modes of
   action due to a path dependency logic and a lack of European social
   capital; and a transnationalisation of the action as a resistance to a
   possible supranationalisation, which is the result of the refraction of
   the Eurocracy field's logics upon the French literary field.},

Abstract = {In spring 2014, an interdisciplinary media project titled ``Troubled
   Waters: Tracing Waste in the Delaware River{''} was organized at
   Haverford College. This project brought together more than 50 students
   from four courses comprising introductory political science, chemistry,
   and documentary film students, as well as a community media artist and
   community partners. The aim was to explore the causes, impacts, and
   meanings of different types of waste that are polluting the Delaware
   River. Chemistry students collected samples to determine the presence of
   chemicals from various waste products, political science students traced
   the waste to globalized production processes, and documentary students
   explored diverse ways of representing the theme of waste on screen. This
   article describes the project and how it might serve as a pedagogical
   model for multicourse interdisciplinary collaboration and community
   engagement.},

Title = {IS CHINA A REVISIONIST POWER? ANALYSIS OF MILITARY SECTOR},
Journal = {POLITICKE VEDY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {20},
Number = {3},
Pages = {168-187},
Abstract = {Where does the growth of Chinese power lead to? Although this question
   has been raised quite often, the debate remains inconclusive. For one,
   it is labeled as classical revisionist state. If they are correct, we
   have there is good reason to belive, that peace and stability in East
   Asia are under threat. For other, however, China is typical status quo
   power. If they are right, we do not have to be afraid of the future. Or,
   some might say, China is somewhere between these two categories.
   Inconclusive debate is partly problem of the generally accepted
   definition of revisionism/status quo power. In order to move the ongoing
   debate further, we have decided to focus purely on realist perspective
   and military power (military expenditures, strategy, relations with the
   dominant power United States). The article aims to answer the question
   whether China can be regarded as a revisionist power. None of the
   analyzed items give us clear-cut answers. We came to conclusion that
   China is not typical revisionist state, but rather unsatisfied. China
   has its ambitions and wants to increase its influence in the region,
   however it does not necessary make it predatory state that would seek to
   change the rules of the game.},

Abstract = {Metaphorically speaking the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the
   European Union (CFR) is the venous system through which the culture of
   fundamental rights circulate nowadays in the constitutional space of the
   Union. This emerging strategic condition of the CFR is not to be read as
   the sole and direct consequence of Union Law as interpreted by the ECJ.
   Member States apex courts are also playing a crucial role in
   consolidating the place value of the CFR. The present contribution
   examines the dual functionality of the CFR both in the legal order of
   the Union and that of the member States. Thereby it pays particular
   attention to the ruling of the Austrian Constitutional Court dated March
   14th 2012, better known as ``the Charter decision{''}, as well as the
   ensuing case law.},

Title = {The Gezi Protests and the Europeanization of the Turkish Public Sphere},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CIVIL SOCIETY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {13},
Number = {3},
Pages = {307-322},
Abstract = {This article investigates the extent to which Turkish civil society
   organizations (CSOs) represented at the 2013 Gezi Park protests reflect
   a Europeanization of the Turkish public sphere. The methodology consists
   of 14 semi-structured interviews conducted with leaders of CSOs that
   participated in the protests and one questionnaire sent to a member of
   the Justice and Development Party (AKP) Istanbul Youth board (and member
   of the Istanbul Bar Association). The findings of our research reveal

Abstract = {The article investigates the formal models as a method of analysis in
   international studies. The importance of this type of models in writing
   articles for world leading high-ranking journals from Scopus list is
   shown. The author reveals the main challenges of interdisciplinary
   synthesis related to the construction of formal models. The problem of
   identifying the actors of international relations is revealed, including
   the assessment of actor's involvement in a concrete international
   conflict (or process) in the context of the concepts of defensive and
   offensive realism, as well as of real and of latent (potential) power.
   The decrease in the influence of the state as the primary actor in
   international relations, and the increase of influence of new types of
   actors are shown, including international terrorist networks (led by
   IS), political parties, media and NGOs in the context of post-modernism,
   global business structures. At the national level, the main actors are
   illustrated both by the example of countries with a developed civil
   society and a market economy, and by that of the traditional non-Western
   society. The question of levels of analysis in international relations,
   as well as agent-structure problem are illustrated by concrete cases
   from modern international relations. The author describes a model of
   ``nested{''} politics. The main types of models used in international
   studies (game theoretic, econometric, network analysis, simulation) are
   indicated as well as their shortcomings. Two kinds of simulation models
   - system dynamics and agent-based modeling are described. It is noted
   that the agent-based modeling is carried out mainly in the framework of
   the constructivist paradigm of international relations theory.},

Abstract = {This article considers contemporary class inequalities and how they
   might shape a progressive politics in the UK. Drawing on findings from
   the BBC Class Survey, it outlines changes in the class structure, class
   mobility and class identities. It is argued that the class structure is
   increasingly polarised and fragmented, with a wealthy elite, a
   vulnerable precariat and fragmented middle and working classes in
   between. Declining upward social mobility is a source of anxiety for
   middle-class and working-class parents alike. Class identification,
   especially working-class identification, has weakened over time,
   although class snobbery is far from dead. Class has changed and the
   class basis of politics is changing now too. A progressive politics is
   possible if the political parties of the centre-left appeal to the
   majority of the electorate rather than one class, acknowledge common
   concerns and worries and appeal to shared hopes and dreams that straddle
   class boundaries.},

   commission (IFE) to political parties at the national level when
   auditing their annual reports and campaign spending violations.
   Nevertheless, a percentage of vacates and remands ruled by the TEPJF is
   related to political factors. Although Mexico's electoral auditing of
   political parties' expenditures was essentially related to decisions
   based on the law between 1996 and 2006, the other part of the
   explanation lies on politically oriented decisions.},

Journal = {REVISTA DE CIENCIA POLITICA},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {37},
Number = {2},
Pages = {255-279},
Abstract = {On 21 February 2016, an absolute majority of Bolivian voters (51.3\%)
   voted against a constitutional revision that would clear the way for
   President Morales to assume a fourth term in office. Evaluating the
   municipal level change in pro-MAS vote share over previous elections, I
   find that the pro-government vote share declined most dramatically in
   traditional MAS electoral strongholds, particularly those with high
   concentrations of mine workers or indigenous voters. This, along with
   numerous other challenges to the MAS institutional hegemony, begs larger
   questions about the future of the MAS as a political coalition, and
   about Bolivia's ``democracy in transition.{''}},

Title = {`Secondary foreign policy' through the prism of cross-border governance
   in the US-Canada Pacific Northwest border region},
Journal = {REGIONAL AND FEDERAL STUDIES},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {27},
Number = {3, SI},
Pages = {321-340},
Abstract = {This paper seeks to revisit the notion of `secondary foreign policy'
   through the analysis of cross-border governance in the US-Canada Pacific
   Northwest border region. Although pro-open border organizations in this
   borderland support secondary foreign policy principles, they
   collectively need to adjust them, due to the increasing border
   securitization on the Canada-US border. In other words, the
   militarization of the border should not affect mutually beneficial
   cross-border interactions and relations. Using Neil Fligstein and Doug
   McAdam's `field theory', this paper analyses how the field of
   cross-border governance in the Pacific Northwest tends to evolve in a
   new geopolitical context after 9/11, in which free trade and
   cross-border flows are subjected to growing `primary foreign policy'
   security imperatives. The specific focus on two cross-border
   organizations reveals how primary and secondary foreign policy actors
   seek to work on joint cross-border projects, in spite of contrasting
   interests and steady blind spots.},

Abstract = {Pro-democracy movements have recently emerged in various places
   worldwide. The Pots and Pans Revolution (Iceland), Arab Spring, 15M and
   the Occupy movement, Yo Soy132, and the Gezi Park, Hong Kong, and Nuit
   Debout protests are all movements which, despite their differences,
   share a number of dynamics, links, frames, and repertoires.
   Paradoxically, in the academic field, we have witnessed a strong
   critical positioning against the concept `global civil society'. The
   objective of this article is to reflect on the utility of this concept
   once again in light of recent developments and to respond to some
   sceptical positions. To meet this objective, a dialogue is established
   between civil society theories and progress made in the study of social
   movements. The public sphere notion (particularly its transnational
   dimension) becomes especially relevant for our discussion.},

Abstract = {In Strangers in Our Midst, David Miller develops a `realist' political
   philosophy of immigration, which takes as its point of departure `the
   world as it is' and considers what legitimate immigration policies would
   look like `under these circumstances'. Here I focus on Miller's
   self-described realist methodology. First, I ask whether Miller actually
   does start from the `world as it is'. I note that he orients his
   argument around a particular vision of national communities and that, in
   so doing, he deviates from a description of `the real world'. In
   shifting between the descriptive and prescriptive without clearly
   acknowledging it, Miller undermines his claim to be outlining legitimate
   policies `under these circumstances'. I also question whether Miller's
   picture of `the real world' takes sufficient account of past injustice
   and its ongoing relationship to migration regimes. I maintain that there
   is a fundamental tension between Miller's commitments to his brand of
   nationalism on the one hand, and his version of realism on the other
   hand.},

Title = {Western Perception of Socialist Democracy with Chinese Characteristics:
   The Viewpoints of the French Left Wing Intellectuals and the French
   Communist Party},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL CRITICAL THOUGHT},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {7},
Number = {1},
Pages = {51-71},
Abstract = {This article presents and analyzes the various viewpoints shared by
   several representative French left wing intellectuals and by the French
   Communist Party (FCP) about socialist democracy with Chinese
   characteristics. It determines two main approaches concerning their
   analysis of Chinese democracy: a procedural approach and a substantive
   approach. The first approach stresses more the form and procedure. The
   second approach stresses more the content and results. One aspect that
   is often neglected is the nature of the state, which is determined by
   the relations of production, the class structure and the socio-economic
   basis of a given society. Therefore it leads to a misunderstanding of
   socialist democracy with Chinese characteristics. Indeed, democracy is
   not neutral, but directly related to the socio- economic basis and class
   nature of the state. The author believes that, even if in some aspects
   Chinese democracy is currently less developed than in some capitalist
   developed countries, it is more democratic by its orientation,
   objectives and nature. Socialist democracy with Chinese characteristics
   is a transition leading to communism. Only socialism can lead to a
   society profoundly democratic in all its aspects, a communist society,
   while it is in contradiction with the profound nature of capitalism.},

   individual work of the police of proximity in Mexico City. Piloted in
   one of the 70 sectors of the corporation. Its advantages include its

Number = {1},
Pages = {116-141},
Abstract = {This article contends that the logic of the regime of the Fifth Republic
   influenced France's European policy, especially towards the European
   Parliament. This argument is illustrated by two case studies: the 1965
   Empty Chair crisis and the 1986 Single European Act. In both cases,
   France's position was defined by the executive, which sought to
   transpose to the European level its practice of subordinating the French
   Parliament, giving Council powers priority over those of the European
   Parliament.},

Journal = {GLOBAL CHANGE PEACE \& SECURITY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {29},
Number = {3},
Pages = {209-227},
Abstract = {The multiplicity of sources of security and justice in post-colonial
   states are often categorized according to a series of fixed analytical
   binaries. Such reductive dichotomies often mask the fluid and
   evolutionary ecology of these highly networked actors. As a result, the
   ways in which they co-produce social order are seldom well-understood
   and the ramifications for peacebuilding remain underexplored. This
   article examines the relationships between myriad providers of security
   and justice. Using examples from fieldwork in West Africa, it presents a
   case for a relational approach to peacebuilding that introduces the
   concept of symbiosis to develop a framework for evaluating these
   relations. It argues that the framework and conceptual steps involved
   create important opportunities for both new research and emerging
   practices of peacebuilding.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this essay is to provide the reader with basic terms and
   conceptual ideas in the literature of protest mobilization, as protests
   are the more tangible expressions of a social movement. The essay opens
   with a discussion about cycles and waves of protests. After identifying
   the differences between these two, I explore more specific concepts like
   framing and diffusion of protests, their timing, scale shift, and
   repertoires of contention to finally end by proposing what can be
   considered as successes and failures of the protest movement. For each
   concept I provide a concise definition and an applied example. Most of
   the concepts' illustrations come from the Zapatista cycle of protests.
   However, I also incorporate examples from more recent protest movements
   in order to show the reader that while the study of social movements
   tend to adapt itself constantly to the events that shape the subfield,
   some concepts survive as useful tools in the discipline.},

Abstract = {The breakup of the Soviet Union in 1991 is strongly reminiscent of the
   disintegration of the European colonial empires. Many of the problems
   that Russia faces today are related to the country's colonial past: the
   loss of territories conquered during the 19th century, the precarious
   state of the few remaining dependencies, and the explosive population
   and administrative structure in the Russian Federation. The greatest
   challenges lie in the North Caucasus and in Russia's relationship with
   Siberia and Ukraine. For Russia, the latter is both a breakaway colony
   and a former centre of colonisation. The economic significance of
   Siberia, meanwhile, is reflected neither in the living standards of the
   local population, nor in the political importance of the region.
   Russia's future will be decided by developments in the socio-economic
   conditions in Siberia.},

Abstract = {This paper analyzes a complete information model of preventive war where
   shifts in the distribution of power play out over an arbitrary number of
   time periods. This analysis leads to a sufficient condition that implies
   war under a broader set of conditions than previously shown in the
   literature. This sufficient condition leads to two substantive
   implications: (1) preventive war can be caused by relatively slow, but
   persistent shifts in the distribution of power; and (2) a power shift
   that causes war may do so only after some delay. These insights serve to
   connect the long-term shifts emphasized in Power Transition Theory with
   the commitment problem explanation for preventive war analyzed in
   bargaining models of war.},

Pages = {34-46},
Abstract = {The author analyses the development stages of political parties stemming
   from the theory of cleavages that has its justification especially in
   the European traditions. The perception of fundamental and long-lasting
   problems has split the society on the basis of ideological and value
   orientation. Afterwards, the theory of cleavages was further enriched
   consequently to the transformation of Eastern European states. At the
   same time, the author distinguishes between six types of political
   parties in regard to historical development. This classification
   reflects itself in the internal organisational structures of the parties
   and their functioning as institutions. The aim of the article is to
   point out to the transformation process of political parties and their
   classification. The author does not perceive their transformation as a
   game or failure of individuals and groups, but rather as the objective
   eternally changing process. In regard to the contemporary trends he
   concludes that the political sciences face the challenge to analyse
   objectively the increasing influence of the so called non-standard
   political parties.},

Number = {3},
Pages = {328-350},
Abstract = {This rejoinder represents a final installment in a debate between myself
   and Paul Gunn over the feasibility and desirability of deliberative
   democracy. Here I argue that our debate has helped clarify an
   ambivalence in the literature surrounding the ends and means of
   deliberative democracy. I specify two ways to understand both ends and
   means, establish their importance in deliberative theory, and show how
   they can be combined. I conclude by showing how this systemic view
   incorporates and overcomes several challenges facing modern democracy,
   such as the necessity of expert authority, the role of partisanship, and
   the problem of social complexity.},

Abstract = {Cross-border cooperation seeks to contribute towards the development of
   cross-border regions, being a practice enacted by specific institutions
   and entities. These institutions are territorial actors who have an
   increasingly fundamental role in the effort towards abating regional
   asymmetries and in territorial decisions themselves. This article
   focuses on a cross between the hard and soft cross-border cooperation
   that these institutions promote. A sketch of the cross-border
   institutional thickness - understood as the grouping of cross-border
   cooperation structures active on the border, their interactions and the
   resulting cooperation ambiance - is attempted. Both institutional
   capital as well as relational capital will be considered in three
   contexts: national (Iberian Raia), regional (North of Portugal -
   Galicia) and local (Chaves-Verin). Using quantitative and qualitative
   empirical data, a first conclusion is surmised: the cross-border
   institutional thickness in the Iberian Raia is not homo-geneous across
   this border. Overall, it is thin but under construction. The relational
   aspects are harder to promote and study, and therefore lacking in
   attention on behalf of the academic community, but also of the actors
   that invest and promote cross-border cooperation.},

Abstract = {Political rights provided to immigrants by host countries have received
   much attention in the literature. Less attention, however, has been paid
   to the extension of extraterritorial rights by home countries. In this
   article, I focus on a common type of right provided by home countries to
   their expatriatesthe right of dual citizenship. Dual citizenship rights,
   I argue, help home countries leverage the financial and human resources
   of their diasporas, encouraging both remittances and return migration. I
   test this argument using migrant surveys performed in six host countries
   and find that migrants from homelands that extend dual citizenship are
   more likely to both remit and express a desire to return home. The micro
   finding regarding remittances is confirmed using aggregate panel data
   for a large sample of homelands over the period 1980-2009. The results
   point to the importance of political rights and policies as extended by
   the migrant's homeland.},

Abstract = {There are more and more actors involved in the implementation of
   European public policies at a local level. This article aims at
   describing all the ressources and professional roles mobilized by this
   process. On the basis of the EU cohesion policy example, we will be
   seeking to find how European policies are implemented. In this
   perspective, we will pay particular attention to the pratices of
   stakeholders and how they contribute to the stabilization of new
   professional roles in local administrations. Such a review will also
   highlight how the European Union has actually managed to influence the
   promotion of conditions for the exercise of political power in member
   states. We will discuss in more details the questions of the emergence
   of the neo-liberal State and the incrasing role of private experts in
   the conduct of European public policies.},

Abstract = {Over the years, many suggestions have been made on how to reduce the
   importance of family background in political recruitment. In this study,
   we examine the effectiveness of one such proposal: the expansion of mass
   education. We utilize a difference-in-difference strategy to analyze how
   a large school reform launched in Sweden in the 1950s, which lengthened
   schooling and postponed tracking, affected the likelihood of individuals
   with different family backgrounds to run for public office. The data
   come from public registers and pertain to the entire Swedish population
   born between 1943 and 1955. The empirical analysis provides strong
   support for the view that improved educational opportunities for
   individuals from disadvantaged backgrounds can be an effective means to
   reduce the social bias of elected assemblies.},

Title = {Pluralism and consensus in deliberative democracy},
Journal = {CRITICAL REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL SOCIAL AND POLITICAL PHILOSOPHY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {20},
Number = {5, SI},
Pages = {556-579},
Abstract = {A central discussion in the theory of deliberative democracy in recent
   decades has focused on whether democratic deliberation, and consequently
   those participating in it, should aim, at least ideally, for political
   consensus. Thus, pluralist deliberative democrats have criticized the
   consensualist approach to deliberative democracy for neglecting the
   moral importance of political disagreement because of their fixation
   with reaching consensus. The debate between these two positions,
   initiated in the 1990s, has evolved in recent years toward more
   precision and sophistication. However, some vagueness and ambiguities
   remain in many of the contributions and prevent us from getting an exact
   idea of the object of discussion. This article starts making further
   distinctions about several types of agreement and disagreement in order
   to clarify much more precisely the exact niche of dispute between these
   two views. They do not need to disagree on the value of many forms of
   disagreement and consensus. Their dispute consists only in a controversy
   about the relative value of post-deliberative, operative, substantive,
   legislative, regulatory, or adjudicative reason-based consensus as
   opposed to the corresponding reason-based disagreement. Finally, the
   article argues that this relatively small niche is made smaller by
   certain considerations. The most important of them is that this
   controversy remains at a high theoretical level and lacks practical
   importance: it only affects the kind of personal ideal commitment or
   aspiration that virtuous deliberators should have when entering into a
   deliberative process, and has no concrete consequent institutional
   implications.},

Journal = {NEW POLITICAL SCIENCE},

Volume = {39},

Pages = {511-522},
Abstract = {In the famous early theoretical manifesto of the Frankfurt School,
   ``Traditional and Critical Theory{''} (1937), Max Horkheimer proclaimed
   the necessity of rethinking the direction in which theory was moving in
   the context of the circulating intellectual traditions of phenomenology,
   sociology of knowledge, neo-Kantianism, and positivism. For Horkheimer,
   while the theoretical terrain associated with 1930s Europe seemed
   diverse and possibly open to radical directions and progressive
   articulations, it ultimately conspired to reinforce the socio-economic
   status quo in which human beings were controlled by the very practices
   they created and continue to recreate. Drawing on the spirit and
   concepts of Horkheimer's opening salvo for critical theory published
   eighty years ago, I argue that it is time to reinvest in the commitments
   heralded in the problematic of critical theory and continue to promote a
   critical political science that takes seriously the importance of
   critique and human emancipation.},

Abstract = {In this critical review of the issue of the almanac Essays on
   Conservatism (Institute of Socio-economic and Political Research,
   ISEPR), which offers a deep insight in the contemporary history of
   conservatism, the author analyzes the current state of conservatism as a
   political movement in the United States on the basis of the Essays
   devoted to this subject, and of the recent presidential elections in the
   USA. The author proceeds from the fact that, existing in a competitive
   political environment, conservatism faces challenges of a changing
   public demand for policies, due to both the socio-economic situation and
   changing demographic composition of the population. The author shows how
   radicalism increased in response to frustration of the society and
   analyzes the roots of the radical and powerful demand for right populism
   in the United States in general. For decades, democratic political
   regimes provided stability both in politics and economics: population of
   these counties profited from integration, globalization, ``open
   economy{''}: therefore, dominant position of establishment - the
   political ``center{''}, left- and center-right parties was accepted
   without doubt. However, the last decades changed this trend. American
   conservatism, on the one hand, found a new base of support that helped
   Republican candidates win in the elections; on the other hand,
   conservatism deepened the divisions and contradictions in American
   society, and thus came into a conflict with a number of other
   traditional settings of conservatism. The author concludes that after
   the presidential elections of 2016, American conservatism faces serious
   top-down redefinition.},

Abstract = {The article analyses the process of discursive construction of the image
   of ``liberalism{''} in post-Soviet Russia. In accordance with the
   reputational approach, liberals are defined as those who call themselves
   liberal or cast as such by contemporaries. Based on the analysis of
   texts written by ``liberals{''} and their critics, O.Malinova proves
   that the crisis that liberalism faces today is partly a consequence of
   its original mould of the 1990s. In the modern Russia liberalism is
   strongly associated with Westernism, obsession with the market economic
   reforms, paternalist approach to the illiberal majority, criticism of
   the authoritarian regime and renunciation of imperial ambitions. In the
   context of the political and ideological shifts of the 2000s and
   especially 2010s, this configuration of ``initial{''} constructions
   played a fatal role in the formation of a negative image of liberalism
   in the eyes of Russians.},

Abstract = {This paper critically examines the claim made by Canadian Conservative
   politicians that prison expansion is likely to produce economic gains
   for Canadian prison towns. Such claims raise many questions about the
   actual beneficiaries of prison construction, and the depiction of
   prisons as ``infrastructure{''} serving some public good or even
   promoting social justice. After reviewing relevant literature from
   American debates on this topic, I focus on more specific Canadian
   conditions, and use public tendering data to trace the path of prison
   spending. The evidence suggests that prison expansion is unlikely to
   benefit surrounding communities, although interests elsewhere tend to
   reap major gains.},

Title = {Exposing Impunity: Memory and Human Rights Activism in Indonesia and
   Argentina},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF GENOCIDE RESEARCH},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {19},
Number = {4},
Pages = {551-573},
Abstract = {This article examines the impact of a new sustained focus in Indonesian
   human rights activism on connecting historical experiences of violence
   to ongoing impunity, in order to assess what forms of memory activism
   are effective in breaking a justice impasse. It does so by using the
   much more successful case of Argentinian human rights activism for
   justice for the 1976-83 repression as a point of comparison. Soon after
   the end of authoritarian rule, Argentinians held a truth commission and
   trials of key military leaders. Then, following a period of stalled
   justice, activists were able to create a new societal consensus on the
   need for further redress including extended trials. In Indonesia,
   meanwhile, a proposed truth commission was abandoned and there have been
   no trials of military leaders, and no other forms of redress initiated
   by the government for this case. Despite the limitations of almost all
   justice measures in fully addressing past human rights crimes, the lack
   of use of any measures acceptable to victims of the violence signals
   that the Indonesian government does not consider such cases pressing
   enough. In order to assess how activists might move such cases back onto
   a national agenda, my analysis focuses on the Argentinian group
   H.I.J.O.S. (Hijos por la Identidad y la Justicia contra el Olvido y el
   Silencio/Children for Identity and Justice against Forgetting and
   Silence), whose members led a successful campaign for a resumption of
   trials. I compare the similar emphasis in their activism on exposing
   impunity to that in the work of the Indonesian group KKPK (Koalisi
   Keadilan dan Pengungkapan Kebenaran/Coalition for Justice and Truth). I
   assess their efforts alongside the different political contexts of both
   countries, arguing that a focus on impunity may be crucial in cracking
   impasses in justice measures.},

Abstract = {Matthias Dembinski and Hans-Joachim Spanger fail to understand the
   nature of the Putin system. In their call for dissociation between the
   West and Russia, the peace researchers, referring to John Rawls, promote
   the acknowledgement of the principles of justice and order. However,
   Russia's leadership refuses to recognise the sovereignty of Ukraine or
   Georgia, intervenes militarily in those countries, violates
   international treaties and agreements such as the Charter of Paris or
   the Budapest Memorandum, rejects fundamental human rights and restricts
   basic civic rights. It is na ve to expect that Russia's leadership will
   act according to international law when it is given the right of veto in
   European affairs and the zone of influence it claims is recognised.},

Pages = {413-447},
Abstract = {In many respects, 2016 was a complex year for Ecuador. On the economic
   front, the country officially fell into recession. The earthquake that
   took place in April exacerbated the economic emergency. In the political
   realm, presidential approval declined due to the recession. In this
   context, the electoral campaign for the succession of Rafael Correa
   started: pro-government forces considered several options for their
   presidential bid and the opposition did not forge a united candidacy.
   Considering the imminent presidential change, some initial assessments
   of Correa's tenure were anticipated. This article highlights Ecuadorian
   hyper-presidentialism -both in its institutional design and in its
   authoritarian practice-as well as the deterioration of the quality of
   democracy and its legitimacy.},

Abstract = {In this article, I elaborate the basis for thinking about the human
   subject in a way that entails biology while leaving room for political
   action in an effort to free the study of the human from the two opposed
   extremes of biologism and social constructivism. As the environment
   affects biological activity at all levels, who we are will always be
   connected to what we experience. However, while the human subject, as a
   self-contained entity has dissolved, subjectivity, or a point of view
   that is mine, has not. Put differently, the mutual constitution of
   nature and nurture is sufficiently under determined such that the
   individual subject is not straightforwardly coterminous with its
   environment-or its biology. Through the use of different literatures in
   the study of biology and politics, I explore this by unravelling some of
   the processes through which the environment becomes an inner world. I
   end with a consideration of the relationship between disgust sensitivity
   and anti-immigrant views to illustrate how a flexible theory of the
   biosocial helps to illuminate political reality today.},

Abstract = {In this work of normative political philosophy, I consider the ethical
   status of the South African government's responses to the Marikana
   massacre, where police shot and killed more than 30 striking miners, in
   light of a moral principle grounded on values associated with ubuntu. I
   argue that there are several respects in which the government's
   reactions have been unethical from an ubuntu-oriented perspective, and
   also make positive suggestions about what it instead should have been
   doing. Much of what I recommend amounts to contending that the
   government should have taken resolute steps towards seeking
   reconciliation of a specific sort that I show follows from ubuntu
   interpreted as an ethical theory.},

Abstract = {After the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks on the United States, a
   new phenomenon, fear of terrorism, was found to affect many Americans.
   Almost 15 years later, with few exceptions, the US homeland has enjoyed
   an environment free of major terrorist attacks. However, fear of
   terrorism remains high among Americans. Using a sample of 524
   undergraduate students from a major regional university in the Midwest
   region of the United States, researchers distributed a survey to
   investigate levels of fear of terrorism and perceptions about the
   likelihood of a terrorist attack happening on American soil. The
   findings of this study indicated that respondents were moderately
   fearful of terrorism and moderately certain than an attack would happen
   in the near future. Many of the measures previously identified in the
   research continue to influence fears and concerns about the risk and
   fear of an attack.},

Abstract = {Attempts at a Labour-Liberal Democrat ProgressiveAlliance came to
   nothing prior to the 1997 general election. The original idea of
   progressivism, first mooted in Britain in 1896, was an American one.
   Suggestions for a progressive alliance in the UK came from Lloyd George
   in 1914, and then again in 1931, each time with little effect. Nothing
   emerged after 1945 until the Lib-Lab pact negotiated by Callaghan and
   Steel in 1977, which led to electoral misfortune for both and the rise
   and fall of the SDP. In 2010 a coalition between the Lib Dems (under
   Clegg) and the Conservatives was always much the more likely option.
   Most Labour people no longer saw the Lib Dems as a party of the left.
   The Coalition Agreement in 2010 showed the idea of an alliance to be a
   centrist, elitist one with little grass-roots support. Such an alliance
   would flourish through abstract pressure groups rather than popular
   democracy, especially with a Labour party led by Corbyn. In the US and
   the UK, progressivism went badly wrong in its politics: Theodore
   Roosevelt's New Nationalist campaign of 1912 divided American reformers
   fatally, as did Lloyd George's postwar Coalition in Britain after 1918.
   Now, even after Brexit, a progressive alliance seems further away than
   ever. The story of the Progressive Dilemma' remains one of unrealistic
   projects, invariably disappointed.},

Abstract = {Does globalization provide an escape from discriminatory legal and
   social institutions for women-owned enterprises? We develop an original
   test of this proposition based on a model of firm heterogeneity with
   discriminatory costs. Discriminatory institutions raise barriers to
   entry and increase costs of production, allowing only the most
   productive women-owned firms to survive. If the costs of discrimination
   are lower in export markets, the average surviving woman-owned firm is
   more likely to export and exports a higher proportion of total sales.
   Using a cross-national data set of firms, we show that while there are
   significantly fewer women-owned enterprises in countries with
   discriminatory institutions, these businesses export at higher rates.
   Global markets therefore provide an important, albeit imperfect,
   alternative to markets with poor protections of women's rights.},

Abstract = {The article reviews more than 65-year experience of studying
   dominant-party systems based on the analysis of a set of empirical and
   theoretical works devoted to the phenomenon of one-party dominance. In
   the second part of the article (for the first part see Politeia, 2017,
   No 3) A.Ostroverkhov examines the existing definitions of a
   dominant-party system and assesses the prospects for the development of
   the theory of one-party dominance. In his opinion, it is impossible to
   understand what really constitutes one-party dominance and why
   dominant-party systems are formed without returning to theoretical and
   methodological achievements within the framework of the interpretive
   paradigm, especially dialectics, which proposes contradictions between
   positivism and anti-positivism should be taken into account and
   overcome.},

   more demanding than he acknowledges. In particular, the argument
   advanced criticizes Miller's `fair shares' argument concerning
   obligations to refugees and his recourse to `mutual advantage' in

Abstract = {The essay aims to disclose British sociologist Ruth Levitas's proposal
   regarding the thorny issue of the lack of consensus about the definition
   of the concept of utopia, an issue which, in the Levitas's view, results
   in a widespread terminological confusion and in the omnipresent risk of
   arbitrary selection of the material. After an accurate analysis of the
   main theoretical and epistemological approaches on the topic, Levitas
   suggests an inclusive definition which would allow to cross the
   boundaries imposed by ``restrictive{''} characterizations, for the
   purpose of creating a higher degree of agreement with regards to what
   may be included within the concept of ``utopia{''}. Too ``limitative{''}
   definitions would instead lead to misleading conclusions about the
   destiny and the function of the utopian genre, among which the
   widespread belief that utopia is in decline or, even worse, definitively
   disappeared. Finally, Levitas suggests a ``sociology of utopia{''}
   through an analysis of the correlations between the two forms of
   knowledge, correlations which, in her view, has been repressed for
   decades.},

Abstract = {The paper offers five desiderata on a realist normative theory of
   politics: that it should avoid moralism, deontologism,
   transcendentalism, utopianism, and vanguardism. These desiderata argue
   for a theory that begins from values rooted in a people's experience;
   that avoids prescribing a collective deontological constraint; that
   makes the comparison of imperfect regimes possible; that takes
   feasibility and sustainability into account; and that makes room for the
   claims of democracy. The paper argues, in the course of exploring the
   desiderata, that a neo-republican philosophy of government does pretty
   well in satisfying them.},

Abstract = {Although it is generally thought that larger industries have greater
   political influence, by directly measuring the subnational importance of
   industries, this article suggests that it is the importance of
   industries within political jurisdictions, not their absolute size, that
   determines their domestic political leverage. Through the evaluation of
   Argentina's deviations from Mercosur's common external tariff and from
   intra-regional free trade, this study evidences that subnational
   economic interests directly influence Argentina's trade policies. For
   both large and small industries, their relative importance within the
   provinces that they inhabit provides the political clout necessary to
   gain preferential trade policy outcomes.},

Journal = {AFRICAN SECURITY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {10},
Number = {1},
Pages = {47-72},
Abstract = {This article examines continuities in the logic of postcolonial French
   military activism in Africa. It examines the long history of major
   French interventions on the continent, pointing to historically
   recurring views of threats, decision-making processes, and impact on the
   ground. Using this historical perspective, it evaluates the strategy and
   prospects of current French efforts in the Sahel. This article argues
   that French policy has largely failed in its stabilization goals.
   Principally, this is because it has strengthened the very factors at the
   source of the instability that France has aimed to contain.},

Abstract = {Citizenship is increasingly investigated not just in terms of rights and
   duties, but as contentious, evolving and continuously forged anew. This
   article analyzes an Israeli High Court ruling from 2007 to show how a
   liberal, human rights-based discourse enabled effective citizenship
   within neocorporatist frameworks for those outside the formal political
   community. The ruling, which extended Israeli labor law to Palestinians
   in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, marks the breakdown of
   neocorporatism's fundamental premise of congruence between labor force
   participation and participation in the political sphere, which engenders
   new opportunities for rejecting subjecthood and demanding inclusion.
   This marks a new development in the balance between the conflicting
   imperatives of economic inclusion and political exclusion in Israel's
   relations with the Palestinians, and legitimizes practices of
   citizenship where formal political space is denied. It is not yet the
   de-nationalizing' of the state, but may be a step in decoupling
   effective citizenship from national belonging.},

Abstract = {Democracies need an active civic society, and early adulthood is a
   significant period in life for becoming an engaged citizen. The research
   reported on here categorized young Australians according to their
   conceptions of good citizenship using latent class analysis. Half of the
   sample were characterized as either `engaged' or `duty-based,'
   suggesting that there is more to consider when talking about citizenship
   norms and value changes, as the other half comprised `enthusiastic' and
   `subject' citizens. Prior participation was almost unrelated to those
   citizenship norms. The findings provide implications for an active
   citizenry, and the discussion addresses limitations and directions for
   future research.},

   QUECHUA-SPEAKING CANARENSES},
Journal = {REVISTA DE CIENCIA POLITICA},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {37},
Number = {3},
Pages = {767-786},
Abstract = {I explore the terms in which Canarenses consider their unequal
   relationships with the world that surrounds them in the context of a
   transnational mining project on their lands. Both the mining industry
   and the Peruvian State have labeled this community as `poor'. Based on
   my own fieldwork conducted between 2008 and 2011, I examine public
   performances of religious and cultural rituals in order to unpack the
   terms in which these relationships are constructed. How is fear of (and
   desire for) the mining project expressed? The meanings attributed to
   participation in (or avoidance of) these performances by the Canarenses
   constitute a conceptual framework in which the label of ``poverty{''} is
   being confronted. In doing so, I suggest that these Canarenses' rituals
   are particularly concerned with the image of poverty used by Peruvian
   society to depict them. The invisibility of the Canarenses is, in fact,
   what allows and even reinforces this depiction as ``poor.{''} Finally, I
   show that fear of the label of poverty is combined with criticism of the
   term itself, as used by the Peruvian State to describe the indigenous
   groups in its territory. How do the ritual performers define poverty? In
   which terms do they classify different degrees of poverty? What
   manifestations of poverty do they find relevant or significant?},

Abstract = {Although participatory media practices are often adopted to address
   social issues with youth in school and community contexts, there is a
   lack of critical analysis of the visual and discursive representations
   that organize student-produced participatory films. To respond to this
   concern, I employ critical discourse analysis to examine a series of
   films that were created for a New Brunswick school-based participatory
   filmmaking program that I coordinate, called What's up Doc? Since the
   project's inception in 2009, students have produced over 60 films that
   have raised institutional critiques, troubled inequitable discourses,
   and addressed social justice issues. Drawing attention to discourses
   that framed students' films, I show how the work may perpetuate, rather
   than fully resist, marginalizing discourses, narratives, and visual
   representations. In particular, I show how the films may reproduce and
   authorize sexist discourses, demeaning narratives, and heteronormative
   assumptions. Youth may have undertaken filmmaking to generate social
   commentary and resist inequity, but critical engagement with the What's
   up Doc? program demonstrates how discursive power operates on, in, and
   through participatory media texts.},

Abstract = {Definitions of socio-political crisis and the social revolution are
   given on the basis of a critical analysis of the most popular concepts
   by Th. Skocpol and J. Goldstone. The main stages of crisis aggravation
   are singled out: pacification or suppression of revolution, significant
   concessions to protest, overthrow of power, state breakdown and
   destruction of key social institutions. The typology of fields of
   political interaction is presented: from peaceful institutional one
   (legal, administrative) to the most brutal fields (open street violence,
   armed violence, and civil war). The transition to an open conflict is
   treated as a parties' choice of suppressive strategies, because previous
   fields of interaction and peaceful strategies have received negative
   reinforcement. The emerging circumstances and the course of interaction
   determine the main channels of conflict dynamics: the escalation of
   violence usually leading to victory of one party over others, resumption
   of peaceful strategies and unstable situation, smoldering and recurring
   conflict that can last for years. Typical consequences of power
   overthrow vary from democratization and successful development, to civil
   war and state breakdown, to establishment of a new authoritarianism.
   Differentiating conditions for these options are considered.},

Journal = {CIVIL WARS},
Year = {2017},

Abstract = {Most studies on internal armed conflict focus on the dyadic interaction
   between the state and a rebel group, leaving less attention to
   inter-group fighting. Addressing this gap in the literature, this study
   argues that the interplay between economic and political inequality and
   weak state capacity increases the risk of non-state conflict. An
   empirical analysis of 178 non-state conflicts in Sub-Saharan Africa
   between 1989 and 2011 provides support for the theorized conditional
   effect, but only for the role of economic inequality. The effect of
   political exclusion in the context of a weak state is not confirmed,
   suggesting that such conditions may be more prone to violence of another
   kind (i.e., mobilization against the state). Overall, these findings
   highlight the importance of a functioning state for maintaining peaceful
   inter-group relations, while they also lend support to earlier research
   that reports divergent effects of economic and political inequalities on
   civil conflict risk.},

Abstract = {In this paper we will comment on the notion of tragedy of the commons as
   developed by Hardin, according to which common goods are doomed to
   over-appropriation and depletion by rational and self-interested
   individuals. Then, we will delve on the refutation of Hardin's theory in
   its own terms by Feeny, Ostrom and others, and we will explore some of
   the ways to understand todays' commons, beyond the framework of rational
   choice in which they were considered at the beginning. Later, we will
   take the idea of tragedy from formal theory to another one that takes
   into account relations of domination that made possible the
   privatization of the commons, revisiting the notion of primitive
   accumulation. To conclude, we will maintain that the common must be
   understood as a principle of political action that carries norms and
   responsibilities alien to those of neoliberal capitalism, under which
   rule the planet runs towards an ecological, economic and civilizational
   catastrophe.},

Abstract = {Across Mexican states congresses have the power to amend and approve the
   budget proposal submitted by the Executive. The aim of this paper is to
   examine what variables influence the Executive-Legislative relation
   during the budget approval process for the 2000-2012 period. The
   analysis shows that congresses make more amendments when the party of
   the governor loses seats or in contexts of divided government. Also,
   when the PRI is the opposition party there are more amendments to the
   budget. In contrast, electoral years and vertical divided government
   have no effect on the number of changes to the budget.},

Abstract = {This article describes public discussion in Indonesia and abroad before,
   during and after the International People's Tribunal 1965 (IPT).
   Hearings were held in The Hague in November 2015. As a ``tribunal of
   inquiry,{''} it derived its legitimacy from Indonesian and international
   civil society, while seeking guidance from conscience and the highest
   principles of international law and justice. Although pressure had grown
   since democratization in 1998 for action to resolve the numerous crimes
   against humanity committed against presumed communists in 1965, the
   government appears unable and unwilling to follow up. The IPT was one
   among many transitional justice initiatives undertaken by civil society
   as a result. Here we summarize the process of the hearings and the final
   report by a panel of international judges, as well as the reception of
   the report in Indonesia and abroad.},

Abstract = {I analyze a model of interest group influence on legislative voting
   through information transmission. The model shows how interest groups
   may craft different messages to target different winning coalitions in
   order to influence the outcome. If access to legislators is costly, then
   interest groups prefer to coordinate with allied legislators by
   providing them with information that helps them to persuade less
   sympathetic legislators. The model reconciles informational theories of
   lobbying with empirical evidence suggesting that interest groups
   predominantly lobby those who already agree with them. The model also
   makes new predictions about the welfare effects of interest group
   influence: From an ex ante perspective, informational lobbying
   negatively affects the welfare of legislators. The results highlight the
   need for more theories of persuasion that take collective choice
   institutions into account.},

   American politics. We argue that rather than anomalous and exceptional,
   the 2016 election represents an extension - and perhaps the beginning of
   a consolidation - of enduring and intersecting configurations of
   racialized and gendered power, marginalization, and oppression. We
   examine some of the ways in which these intersecting configurations
   structure and are structured by American politics, exploring some of the
   political consequences of proximity to or distance from the benefits of
   white heteropatriarchy.},

Abstract = {This article investigates whether exposure to extreme television media
   informs citizens about politics. Using lab experiments with both student
   and non-student samples, I find that extreme media produce higher levels
   of political knowledge and that they also produce higher levels of
   negative affect among viewers compared with control groups. I also show
   that extreme media are at least as informative as traditional news. This
   research adds to the growing literature on media effects in a polarized
   media environment, showing that extreme television media can have a
   beneficial impact on at least one important area of U.S. politics:
   citizen competence. To account for external validity and popular
   conceptions on extreme media's non-informative nature, I use
   cross-sectional data from the 2008 National Annenberg Election Survey
   finding that extreme television viewership correlates with greater
   political knowledge, while controlling for other known predictors.},

Abstract = {Perhaps more than any other minority group in Europe, the Roma have
   tried to reach beyond the boundaries of the national state to change
   local realities of marginalization. Roma activists have counted on the
   support of the EU to turn around the negligent attitudes of national
   governments. The further development of an EU framework that stimulates
   national states to design and implement social policies that protect
   Roma is no doubt necessary, but it may not be enough. In order to have
   real impact, the EU needs to address key obstacles of the area of social
   policy and human rights protection more broadly.},

Title = {Authoritarian governmentality through the global city: contradictions in

Journal = {CONTEMPORARY POLITICS},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {23},
Number = {4},
Pages = {446-468},
Abstract = {Over 30 years of strategic reconfiguration, Global Cities have proven
   themselves productive of metropolitan oligarchies of various hues that
   dominate the territories of their respective states. Set against the
   ecological contradictions' of historical capitalism, the article
   presents the Global City formation as a historically particular
   post-disciplinary technique in the capitalist world-system bound into
   the ecological contradictions of that system entering into a period of
   chronic crisis in the twenty-first century. This idiomatic technique is
   conceptualised in geo-historical terms as a distinct Geotechnic'
   modulation of control, through which the Global City is constituted as a
   geo-machinic assemblage in the historical technics of capitalist
   civilisation. Through a critical human geography, marxist political
   economy, and post-structuralist governmetnality studies, the adequacy of
   the Global Cities research agenda is challenged, and the emerging role
   of the World-City Archipelago in historical capitalism explored. In a
   constructive critique of Wolfgang Streeck's end of capitalism' thesis,
   the aim is to present the geotechnic city' as an emergent modality of
   global discipline in historical capitalism, whereby the latter's
   strategic contradictions are contained, resolved, displaced, sublated
   through a particular genre of spatio-temporal fix, and the future of the
   capitalist totality is secured through a new political idiom of
   metropolitan oligarchy.},

Pages = {49-70},
Abstract = {This paper argues that the ratio of legislature size to population is
   crucial for explaining income inequality. Larger legislatures (with
   respect to population size) promote equality in democratic regimes. The
   opposite effect is hypothesised for non-democracies, although the
   empirical results for this group are less significant. I suggest that
   larger legislatures decrease inequality in democracies by enhancing
   representative linkages and increasing political participation. On the
   contrary, they dilute the strength of opposition in authoritarian
   regimes, leading to inegalitarian outcomes. This study carries strong
   implications for the understanding of legislatures and the formation of
   inequality across political systems.},

Abstract = {Since the 2008 financial crisis, politics of austerity in Europe have
   engendered far-reaching socioeconomic and political transformations. The
   recent refugee `crisis' has also deeply affected the sociopolitical
   terrain. Contrary to past arguments about the reduced significance of
   the nation state, Europe is experiencing a resurgence of nationalisms.
   Simultaneously, often as a counter-response, several European cities are
   experiencing an emergence of social practices that claim urban politics
   as a dynamic field of action and contestation potentially transcending
   national boundaries. Such practices tended to adopt a `right to the
   city' approach. Currently, we observe a greater range of argumentations
   that re-signify the arena of `urban citizenship.' In this paper, we
   discuss how crises and the urban intersect and affect citizenship rights
   and practices in different cities in Southern Europe. From a
   `meta-analysis' of urban claims and practices, we argue that, starting
   at the municipal level, urban citizenship reconfigures the political.
   Through the entanglement of different scales and actors, emerging
   practices of solidarity and needs-based claims, and alliances between
   differently entitled subjects, involving both natives and foreigners,
   challenge and reshape institutions of governance and reactivate the
   field of urban politics against austerity and securitization.},

Abstract = {In the Soviet Union, many millions of people were subject to repression
   for political reasons. Over five million were arrested under false
   accusations and sentenced to many years of imprisonment or to death. A
   further six million people were dispossessed and deported solely due to
   their belonging to a specific social group. This repression began
   directly following the takeover of power by the Bolsheviks in 1917; in
   1987, people were still being arrested for political reasons. The
   rehabilitation of the victims of the great waves of repression during
   the 1930s began after the death of Stalin in 1953, and increased again
   during the Perestroika period. However, many of the victims of the state
   have still not been rehabilitated even today, and the few who are still
   alive receive little social support. The state regards history as a tool
   to use for its own purposes. The general public may occasionally show
   sympathy, but overall, they are indifferent.},

Abstract = {It is widely accepted that fragmentation influences conflict processes
   in a profound way. Multi-party conflicts with several fronts are
   notoriously hard to resolve. However, there is no easily computable
   measure to approximate conflict fragmentation. In this article, we
   introduce the conflict fragmentation index (CFI), which is computed by
   adapting the Herfindahl-Hirschman index. The CFI considers the relative
   prominence of each dyadic-level conflict-fronts nested in the entire
   civil war. The relative prominence is approximated by using available
   information on conflict casualties. The CFI is time-variant and highly
   sensitive to battlefield dynamics. The flexibility of CFI can bring
   several advantages. Most notably, it is possible to calculate monthly or
   even daily measures of conflict fragmentation by taking state-based
   (government vs. NSA) as well as non-state based (NSA vs. NSA) conflicts
   into account. Overall, the CFI provides a theoretically-informed and
   easy to compute measure to approximate conflict fragmentation.},

   activities in Africa are based on the principles of equality and mutual
   benefits (win-win), thus they are generally beneficial to the

   enhancing the capacity of national security agencies, fighting against
   piracy, strengthening maritime security, and promoting intelligence
   sharing in West Africa have been, in general, constructive. However,
   anti-Chinese sentiments mainly triggered by the involvement of Chinese
   migrants in illegal gold mining activities in Ghana and other West
   African countries have been destructive, with serious security
   ramifications for not only Ghana, but also the entire region that has a
   history of violent conflicts closely related to extraction of natural

Abstract = {This paper addresses the correlation between land-use changes and
   communal conflicts in Sub-Saharan Africa. In particular, by articulating
   the analysis on a 0.5 degrees x 0.5 degrees regular grid, we estimate
   the probability of a communal conflict event at time t in any given cell
   i as a function of a set of variables for land-use variations, a spatial
   and a temporal lag of the dependent variable, a series of climate
   attributes and time-invariant geo-physical attributes (all measured at
   cell level), and a set of institutional attributes (measured at country
   level). The results show that a positive variation in land-use for
   agricultural and urban purposes significantly increases both the
   probability and the number of communal conflicts. On the contrary, the
   impact of increasing pasture land is not so clear, since results
   supporting the evidence of a negative relation between pasture use and
   communal conflicts risk are not robust to different model
   specifications.},

Abstract = {One dimension of party realignment - party position change - has been
   debated extensively in recent political science literature. This article
   reviews recent evidence presented to explain position change:
   candidates, politically active groups, and ideology. Based on historical
   case studies, I make the case for treating politically active groups as
   the most important factor in party change. A clear understanding of
   these factors can help us understand whether recent changes in both
   parties are harbingers of long term trends.},

Abstract = {China is in dire need of energy resources to sustain its economic
   growth. In recent years, China has been turning more to Saudi Arabia and
   Iran in the Middle East, as well as Sudan in North Africa, as trading
   partners to secure its energy supply. This article explores China's
   energy strategy in the Middle East and North African (MENA) region
   through case studies of China's energy diplomacy with Saudi Arabia and
   Iran. It argues that China's energy strategy is very much driven by the
   ``Beijing Consensus{''} that features respect for others' sovereignty,
   emphasis on sustainability, equality, and quality-of-life, as well as
   incremental change to past institutions and practices. China has applied
   an equity ownership strategy to gain more control over oil flows as a
   shield against price fluctuations and to reduce the possibility of
   supply interruption; however, civil unrest and conflicts in the MENA
   region threaten to disrupt China's energy supply channels, which implies
   that China should work harder for regional peace in order to achieve
   sustainable energy supply.},

Abstract = {This study investigates the impact of urban protests on coup attempts
   and subsequent regime change in a sample of 39 Sub-Saharan African
   countries for the period from 1990 to 2007. Widespread public
   discontent, especially when occurring in urban centers, can act as a
   trigger of coups d'etat in autocratic regimes. Yet, it is less clear how
   elites respond to protests in terms of post-coup institutional change
   and democratization. To account for potential endogeneity of protests
   and coups, variation in rainfall is used as an instrument for urban
   protests. The results show that rainfall-related urban protests raise
   the likelihood that a coup is staged, but have no effect on subsequent
   democratization.},

Abstract = {This article assesses the influence of populist parties on two central
   aspects of democracy - participation and representation. In line with
   traditional theories on populism and democracy, we argue that populist
   parties have a positive effect on electoral turnout and the equality of
   participation. This effect, however, is moderated by the party's role in
   government or opposition as well as their host-ideology, i.e. left,
   centre or right. We argue that populist parties also have a positive
   effect on substantive representation, but that this effect is strongly
   dependent on their host-ideology. We test these arguments with lagged
   dependent variable models using data from 31 European countries from
   1990 until 2014. We find mixed support for our theoretical expectations.},

Abstract = {Whether cash transfers should be poverty targeted or universal within
   certain social categories remains a hotly debated topic. Recent plans to
   expand Nepal's Child Grant programme brought this question sharply into
   focus. Using available secondary data, this article presents a four-step
   analysis that examines the costs and benefits of different approaches.
   Given the country's poverty profile, the theoretical results of
   different targeting models, government capacity and overall costs, a
   universal (age-cohort targeted) approach achieves the best outcomes for
   children.},

   handled the punishment of the opposition, and the courts dealt with
   nonpolitical cases. In today's revolutionary regime, courts are not only
   in charge of punishing dissidence but have also become the regime's main
   legitimation force. In December 2015, following a landslide victory by
   the opposition in parliamentary elections, the lame-duck National
   Assembly appointed the Supreme Court justices in an irregular procedure
   that ignored the constitutional requirement for these positions.
   Consequently, the regime dominates the Supreme Court, which has deprived
   the National Assembly of its function, concentrating all powers in the
   President of the Republic. A controversial Supreme Court has become the
   only instrument supporting a regime that has lost the popular support
   completely, where citizens have taken to the streets to protest a
   government that has destroyed democracy and has subjected the country to
   deep political and economic crises.},

   materialized in the actor and communist militant Ruben Sotoconil. With
   this objective, their strategies to resist the dictatorial horrors are
   explored and special attention is given to the creation of the ``Teatro
   Familiar de Barrio{''} and to its scriptural production present in
   ``Revista Araucaria de Chile{''}. How does insilio incarnate and come to
   life in a particular case? Is the question that seeks to answer. For
   this, the sources visited are Araucaria Magazine, manuscripts, epistles,
   photographs and notes; In addition to the general bibliography referring
   to theatrical production in the authoritarian context.},

Abstract = {From the 1998 election of Hugo Chavez Frias as president until his death
   in March 2013, Venezuela went through significant changes. The launch of
   a political project geared toward the establishment of socialism for the
   twenty-first century, underwritten by the abundant oil revenues since
   2002, meant an unprecedented transformation in Venezuela. There was also
   a radical change in the country's foreign policy in the transition from
   the pre-Chavez Venezuela to the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela. This
   article analyzes part of the political legacy left by Hugo Chavez, the
   new objectives and values, new strategic orientations and priorities,
   and the transformation of the institutions charged with carrying out
   this foreign policy. It focuses on the Ministry of the Popular Power
   (Poder Popular) for External Relations of the Bolivarian Republic of
   Venezuela, and the creation of a set of intergovernmental organizations
   at the regional and international levels, particularly the Bolivarian
   Alliance for the Americas, that support the promotion of international
   solidarity with the revolutionary process led by President Chavez. While
   the main aspects of Hugo Chavez's approach to politics and foreign
   policy continue to be enforced today, serious economic and social
   deterioration linked to the decline in international oil prices has led
   to major challenges to Venezuelan regional leadership in recent years,
   reflected in recent changes to its foreign policy.},

Abstract = {Political science scholarship has found mixed evidence on the impact of
   partisanship on the taxation of firms. In this article, I show that
   although left-leaning governments set tax rates at higher levels than
   right-leaning governments, the difference in the effective tax rates
   paid by firms is much less dramatic between left and right governments.
   I argue that left-leaning governments maintain high tax rates, a visible
   policy their constituency supports, while allowing firms to transfer
   profits abroad to minimize their tax burden (transfer pricing).
   Constituency costs hinder them from cutting tax rates to avoid backlash
   from voters, but they impose fewer restrictions on profit-shifting to
   attract investment by multinational firms for economic growth. Data
   covering 19 advanced economies between 2006 and 2009 support my
   theoretical expectation. My analyses suggest that the effect of
   government partisanship on corporate tax policy can be ambiguous when
   political parties consider various policy tools.},

Title = {Measuring political agenda setting and representation in Turkey:
   Introducing a new approach and data set},
Journal = {PARTY POLITICS},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {23},
Number = {6},
Pages = {717-730},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {This article introduces a novel data set on the agenda of the Turkish
   legislature and political parties. Using the Comparative Agendas Project
   approach, we trace political issue attention over an 11-year-period
   (2003-2013). By topic coding various political activities, this approach
   illustrates the dynamics of the Turkish political agenda and the issue
   attention of the political parties, and, therefore, sheds new empirical
   light on the dynamics of Turkish legislative politics and party
   competition. In this article, we explain the construction of the data
   set from data collection to coding, describe its features, and provide
   examples of possible applications.},

Abstract = {Separation of powers existed in the British Empire of North America long
   before the U.S. Constitution of 1789, yet little is known about the
   strategic foundations of this institutional choice. In this article, I
   argue that separation of powers helps an imperial crown mitigate an
   agency problem with its colonial governor. Governors may extract more
   rents from colonial settlers than the imperial crown prefers. This
   lowers the Crown's rents and inhibits economic development by settlers.
   Separation of powers within colonies allows settlers to restrain the
   governor's rent extraction. If returns to settler investment are
   moderately high, this restraint is necessary for colonial economic
   development and ultimately benefits the Crown. Historical evidence from
   the American colonies and the first British Empire is consistent with
   the model. This article highlights the role of agency problems as a
   distinct factor in New World institutional development, and in a
   sovereign's incentives to create liberal institutions.},

Abstract = {This study applies black box scaling to the German Longitudinal Election
   Study candidate survey 2013 to shed light on an emerging right-wing
   party in Germany, the Alternative fur Deutschland (AfD). The scaling
   procedure extracts two meaningful and robust ideological dimensions
   described as socialism versus liberalism and libertarian versus
   authoritarian. Placing the ideal point of candidates from all parties
   into this two-dimensional space shows that AfD candidates are
   significantly more market liberal than Christian Democratic Union
   candidates but not more authoritarian. On these grounds, the AfD can
   hardly be regarded as a right-wing extremist party. Yet exploring
   ideological heterogeneity within parties indicates that East German AfD
   candidates are generally more authoritarian than their West German
   colleagues, highlighting a potential source of the party's recent shift
   from primarily Eurosceptic toward more nationalist conservative
   positions.},

Abstract = {Partisanship is a primary predictor of attitudes toward public policy.
   However, we do not yet know whether party similarly plays a role in
   shaping public policy behavior, such as whether to apply for government
   benefits or take advantage of public services. While existing research
   has identified numerous factors that increase policy uptake, the role of
   politics has been almost entirely overlooked. In this paper, we examine
   the case of the Affordable Care Act to assess whether policy uptake is
   not only about information and incentives; but also about politics.
   Using longitudinal data, we find that Republicans have been less likely
   than Democrats to enroll in an insurance plan through state or federal
   exchanges, all else equal. Employing a large-scale field experiment, we
   then show that de-emphasizing the role of government (and highlighting
   the market's role) can close this partisan gap.},

Abstract = {The political theory of Ernesto Laclau has generated several debates in
   the academic left. The label of Post-Marxism to his theory originated
   discussions about his relationship with Marx and the presence of the
   Marxist legacy in his work. In this matter one of the proposals of
   post-Marxism is abandoning dialectics. For Laclau, the Hegelian
   dialectic is guilty of introducing the logic of necessity in Marxism.
   This impedes analysis of contingency in history. This article studies
   Laclau's reading of Hegelian dialectic in different works and analyzes
   his writings on the notions of determination, negativity and
   contingency. A review of these concepts can restore an adequate concept
   of dialectic non-deterministic for the postfundational political
   thought.},

   from defending anarchy of states, Hobbes in fact constructs a largely

Abstract = {Public policy for supporting the visual arts has historically followed
   different traditions in France and the United Kingdom. In an environment
   of fiscal austerity that impacts upon public funding as well as private
   patronage, and given the tensions between artistic freedom on the one
   hand, and market constraints on the other, this article examines how
   these two traditions of financing artists has influenced the direction
   of the work itself. A brief historical presentation of the two forms of
   public support and their evolution in recent decades provides a
   framework for understanding government attitudes and policies on both
   sides of the Channel. A closer examination of selected artists, chosen
   here for their representativeness and their international renown, is
   used to illustrate the changing nature of public support for visual art
   creation.},

Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {To what extent have Republicans in Congress unified to work with
   President Trump, and what are the prospects for unity going forward?
   These questions are not as straightforward as they may seem given that
   the President is not deeply engaged in the policymaking process, he
   often reverses his positions, and he is prone to criticizing his most
   important partners in governing - Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell
   and House Speaker Paul Ryan - eroding trust among members of his own
   party and diminishing Republicans' prospects for passing their
   legislative priorities. In this analysis, I assess President Trump's
   relationship with Republicans in the House and Senate; internal unity
   and divisions among Republicans; Republicans' lack of success in
   enacting significant policy priorities prior to the August recess; the
   limited (but potentially growing) prospects for bipartisan cooperation;
   and the outlook for the remainder of the 115th Congress.},

Title = {Cooperative Business Structures for Green Transport Corridors},
Journal = {BALTIC JOURNAL OF EUROPEAN STUDIES},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {7},
Number = {2},
Pages = {3-27},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {In its White Paper on ``A Sustainable Future of Transport{''}, the
   European Commission promoted the idea of green transport corridors
   (GTCs) by establishing trans-shipment routes with concentration of
   freight traffic between major hubs. GTCs reduce environmental and
   climate impact of the traffic on these relatively long distances of
   transport while increasing safety and efficiency with the application of
   sustainable logistics solutions. The Baltic Sea Region (BSR) enjoys a
   vanguard position in the development and realisation of green transport
   concepts within Europe.
   Already the GTC definition of the European Commission emphasized the
   need for a fair and non-discriminatory access to corridors and
   trans-shipment facilities that enable all customers to participate in
   the corridor and make use of publicly available benefits. Research
   results of GTC initiatives revealed that cultural issues, cooperation
   quality and governance structures play a crucial role in the acceptance
   and success of the GTC concept.
   This paper highlights the current status and discussions on business and
   ownership models for GTCs and investigates the research question if and
   to which extent can cooperative concepts be used as a base principle for
   GTC governance. The authors participated in some of the most important
   GTC projects in the BSR, which provides them in terms of methodology
   easy access to literature reviews, secondary data analysis, expert
   interviews and surveys covering the entire BSR.},

Abstract = {What is the role of trade policy in military alliances? We analyze and
   test a game-theoretic model of economic and security cooperation in
   which allies hold different interests across the security and commercial
   aspects of the relationship. In equilibrium, allies with little market
   power who are valuable politically to larger states engage in
   sociallysuboptimal protectionism, as their allies' threats of
   retaliation are incredible. Stable cooperation emerges in the form of
   unretaliated protection rather than mutually low trade barriers. We test
   the model's implications against a dyadic data set of antidumping
   petitions from 1980 to 2013 and find that larger allies are more likely
   to tolerate protectionism by smaller allies by denying domestic
   petitions to retaliate against dumping measures by the latter.},

Title = {The effects of the distribution of mortgage credit on the wage share:
   Varieties of residential capitalism compared},
Journal = {COMPARATIVE EUROPEAN POLITICS},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {15},
Number = {6},
Pages = {819-847},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {The financialisation of advanced economies has developed in part through
   the widespread engagement of workers with the financial sector,
   specifically through the increasing adoption of household debt. Taking
   on debt establishes ``investor identities{''} for borrowers, which
   disciplines borrowers to demand employment and marginalises worker
   bargaining power. Although increased levels of household debt have been
   linked with a declining wage share of national income, there has been
   little examination of the effects of the specific channel of mortgage
   credit, the largest source of household debt, on the wage share. A
   series of regression models were implemented to test the relationship
   between the total mortgage stock and the wage share of GDP in four
   different countries, across three different Varieties of Residential
   Capitalism. While the panel data results demonstrate a negative
   relationship between mortgage credit and the wage share across the
   typologies, the relationship is concentrated in the liberal markets of
   the UK and the USA, and does not hold independently in Sweden and
   Denmark. There are four important differences that may explain the
   divergent results: (1) mortgages in liberal markets are provided at a
   higher cost than in non-liberal markets; (2) the use of mortgage bonds
   in non-liberal markets facilitates renegotiations in periods of borrower
   uncertainty; (3) the level of collective bargaining in Social Democratic
   states may strengthen worker wage negotiations; and (4) workers in
   liberal markets are reliant on mortgage finance to access the home as a
   financial asset in systems of asset-based welfare. The combination of
   which may explain how the increased disciplinary effects of mortgage
   finance have resulted in the reproduction of the conditions for capital
   accumulation in liberal capitalist states.},

Abstract = {The comparative study of populism has produced a wide spectrum of
   scholarship that covers different regions and historical periods.
   However, and despite significant breakthroughs in conceptualization and
   methodology, the process of scientific cumulation is hampered by the
   unyielding persistence of several misconceptions around the nature of
   populism, even in the face of repeated refutation by empirical
   developments. In this paper, I single out and discuss three main
   problems in the literature: the regional bias, the policy bias, and the
   normative bias. I argue that to protect the study of populism from the
   increasing threat of conceptual dilution due to sensationalist punditry
   and partisan scholarship, analysts should (a) avoid generalizing from
   region-specific perspectives; (b) remain skeptical of any association of
   populism with economic policy; and (c) refrain from exaggerating
   populism's impact on democratic institutions.},

Abstract = {For most of the 20th century, the Middle East and North Africa (MENA)
   rarely appeared on Turkey's radar as anything other than a source of
   threats. The Justice and Development Party's (AKP) 2002 ascension to
   power changed this, and Turkey increasingly began to turn toward MENA,
   especially as its prospects of joining the EU waned Politically, Ankara
   pursued a ``zero problems in the neighborhood{''} approach, forging
   strong commercial ties and mediating in disputes. The region's
   complexities, however, and Arab fears of Turkey aspiring to
   ``neo-Ottoman{''} dominance, created early stumbling blocks. By 2017,
   Turkey found it had plenty of problems in the neighborhood and
   preciously few friends. With the narrative of a ``Turkish model{''} for
   MENA at rest, Turkey is now struggling to fashion a strategy that would
   allow it to deflect challenges emanating from the region while shoring
   up its influence over its immediate neighbors.},

Abstract = {President Trump's establishment of his national security system proved
   highly problematic compared to those of his recent predecessors.
   Problems arose in its initial organization, especially the designation
   of his chief political strategist as a participant at its highest
   levels, later rescinded. Further difficulties developed with the
   resignation of his National Security Council advisor, after only 24 days
   on the job. The news media quickly pounced. They portrayed a presidency
   in disarray and a national security process as dysfunctional. It was a
   major blow to this new administration, even though it was unwilling to
   acknowledge it publicly. In his first solo press conference on February
   16, 2017, Trump stated, ``This administration is running like a
   fine-tuned machine.{''} Not quite. This article explores their early
   organizational difficulties in national security policy making.},

Title = {militaries' roles in political regimes: introducing the PRM data set},
Journal = {EUROPEAN POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {16},
Number = {3},
Pages = {400-414},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Have militaries become tired of interfering in politics? The declining
   number of military regimes and military coups implies a decrease in the
   influence of armed forces on political regimes. Yet, case and area
   studies underline that militaries still exert considerable influence on
   politics all over the world. This research note addresses this apparent
   misfit between quantitative data and qualitative studies by introducing
   a new measurement of armed forces' roles in political regimes. Based on
   previous research, we develop a systematic measure to differentiate
   between two dimensions of military interference in political regimes:
   the military ruler and the military supporter indices. Our Political
   Roles of the Military (PRM) Data Set contains information on 120
   democratic and autocratic regimes and a total of 138 regime spells for
   the period 1999-2012. The data set offers a whole range of indicators
   that will enable scholars to carry out causal-analytical studies on
   different forms and degrees of military influence on policy outcomes,
   economic performance, or the likelihood of regimes successfully facing
   and surviving political crises. Empirically, our data illustrate that
   militaries remain powerful actors in many regimes but tend to use more
   discreet and concealed channels to influence politics.},

Abstract = {This paper reconciles a substantial gap in legal scholarship: the
   Islamic State's (ISIS's) unrecognized genocide against Shia Muslims.
   Unlike ISIS's crimes against Yazidis, no substantial legal analysis on
   ISIS's Shia victims has been published. And while there are popular
   initiatives demanding ISIS's violence against Christians be recognized
   as genocide, there are no parallel movements on behalf of ISIS's Shia
   victims, despite a much stronger legal claim. As this paper expands,
   ISIS's genocide against Shias is unambiguous; Shia Muslims plainly
   comprise a protected religious group, ISIS has been transparent in terms
   of its genocidal intent, and ISIS's systematic killing of Shias clearly
   constitutes genocidal conduct under the Genocide Convention. Over the
   course of this paper, I advance this thesis, demarking clear parallels
   with ISIS's well-established genocide against Iraq's Yazidis. I also
   explain the significance of the legal community's neglect of ISIS's Shia
   victims.},

Abstract = {This article deals with Claudio Cesa's historical hermeneutic by using
   his most influential studies as well as many minor writings (often
   neglected and now available in some collecting books). Cesa (1928-2014)
   was the main Italian scholar of the German idealist political philosophy
   (Fichte, Schelling, and Hegel). This paper analyses Cesa's historical
   approach and it is primarily focused on his philological competence, his
   methodology, his ability in connecting political judgement and
   philosophy of history, and, last but not least, his contribution to a
   manifold interpretation of Hegel's political writings.},

Abstract = {James Madison's Notes of the Constitutional Convention have long been
   the gold standard for understanding how the Constitution was formed.
   Nevertheless, there are a series of troubling discrepancies within the
   extant records that give contradictory accounts of Madison's June 6
   speech, which is Madison's first semipublic expression of the argument
   later immortalized in Federalist no. 10. According to a provocative new
   theory advanced by the 2015 book Madison's Hand, these various
   discrepancies point to a larger scandal of Madison's routine negligence,
   frauds, forgeries, and cover-ups when he was writing his Notes. This
   article will demonstrate that this new hypothesis fails on several
   levels to provide a plausible solution. Furthermore, a fresh look at the
   clues, including ones that have never been noticed before, will finally
   point us in the direction of a satisfactory solution to this
   long-standing mystery. More importantly, this new solution reestablishes
   the reliability of Madison's Notes.},

Abstract = {This article makes the case that populism needs to be understood in the
   context of a model. The key argument formulated in this article is that
   the phenomenon of populism does not lend itself to taut theoretical
   formulations. Consequently, the explanatory and the inferential reaches
   of populism are largely descriptive. However, ``mere description''
   within the context of a model is more than enough to produce rich
   understandings of populism and, under the right modeling conditions,
   even predictions of populist discourse eruptions and movements.},

Abstract = {This article examines how ideas about what is to be governed, how and by
   whom, are made sense of in European Union governance. It interrogates
   the complex relationships of knowledge generation, knowledge
   circulation, expertise and policymaking in two contrasting policy areas.
   In social policy, the emergence and later privileging of a discourse of
   the `social investment state' are traced through the linked `ecologies'
   (Abbott, 2005) of formal `European' social science research, academic
   politicians and the Open Methods of Co-ordination. In security research
   policy, metis, or practical knowledge (Scott, 1998), has enabled major
   European corporations to assert a privileged discursive and political
   position in the `linked ecologies' of formal scientific research,
   product development and EU policymaking. These two cases demonstrate the
   partial integration of elite discourses with scientific rationalities
   into EU governance. In each case, the generation of knowledge and
   expertise is articulated in governance practices in ways that generate
   politically specific and limited - but not the same - versions of `the'
   EU to be governed.},

Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL RESEARCH},

Volume = {56},
Number = {3},

Abstract = {Notwithstanding the improvement in gender equality in political power
   and resources in European democracies, this study shows that, on
   average, declared interest in politics is 16 per cent lower for women
   than for men in Europe. This gap remains even after controlling for
   differences in men's and women's educational attainment, material and
   cognitive resources. Drawing on the newly developed European Institute
   for Gender Equality's (EIGE) Gender Equality Index (GEI) and on the
   European Social Survey (ESS) fifth wave, we show that promoting gender
   equality contributes towards narrowing the magnitude of the differences
   in political interest between men and women. However, this effect
   appears to be conditioned by the age of citizens. More specifically,
   findings show that in Europe gender-friendly policies contribute to
   bridging the gender gap in political engagement only during adulthood,
   suggesting that childhood socialisation is more strongly affected by
   traditional family values than by policies promoting gender equality. In
   contrast, feminising social citizenship does make a difference by
   reducing the situational disadvantages traditionally faced by women
   within the family and in society for middle-aged people and older.},

Abstract = {An endorsement of capitalism is often thought to be a concession to
   human selfishness. The thought often runs that while some other
   socioeconomic system - socialism, perhaps - would be morally preferable,
   we cannot live up to those high ideals. Jason Brennan has recently
   attempted to show that this widespread view is mistaken. Even in terms
   of ideal theory, Brennan argues, capitalism is morally superior to its
   rival. To make this case, Brennan critiques the work of the late
   socialist political philosopher, GA Cohen. Brennan argues that Cohen's
   justification of socialism is ill-conceived, and in fact, Cohen's
   failure helps to reveal that capitalism is morally superior to
   socialism. In this review article, I argue that Brennan's critique and
   attempted counter-claim are unsuccessful. Among other failings, Brennan
   leaves us with no adequate answer to the question, why capitalism?Cohen

Title = {Special affects? Nationalist and cosmopolitan discourses through the
   transmission of emotions: Empirical evidence from London 2012},
Journal = {BRITISH POLITICS},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {12},
Number = {3},
Pages = {409-431},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {International sporting and mega-events such as London 2012 provide a
   pertinent case study through which to explore contemporary approaches to
   nationalism and cosmopolitanism. Using original focus group evidence
   from participants with expertise in the Olympics, this article provides
   an insight into how nationalist and cosmopolitan discourses emerge in
   dialogue between informed individuals set against an emotionally charged
   background. The evidence indicates that the transmission of emotions
   might be integral to the operation of nationalist but less so to
   cosmopolitan discourses, underscoring the conditional character of the
   latter discourses. Therefore, we suggest that this takes previous work
   that associates nationalism with `hot' emotions and cosmopolitanism with
   `cool' emotions further. We found that most emotions appeared to be
   transmitted through challenges to, rather than in support of, a
   discourse. The opinions voiced in the focus groups are expected to be
   insightful for any investigation into the construction of nationalist
   and cosmopolitan discourses or, indeed, broader research into how
   emotions are actually transmitted - all of which have obvious relevance
   for social scientists interested in nationalism, cosmopolitanism and the
   role of emotions.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF POLITICS},

Volume = {79},

Pages = {979-994},

Abstract = {Mixed-member electoral systems are supposed to simultaneously produce
   coherent parties and ensure the representation of local interests.
   Whether these goals are achieved depends on the ability of parties and
   districts to control members of parliament (MPs). We regard the
   competitiveness of MPs' bids for renomination as a crucial indicator of
   the degree to which MPs are punished when deviating from the interests
   of their principals. The theoretical account we develop makes the
   competitiveness of MP renomination conditional on the characteristics of
   the electoral system, the candidate selection regime, an MP's
   parliamentary behavior, government status, and district characteristics.
   Corroborating our expectations, the analysis of the candidate selection
   processes in the run-up to the 2013 German Bundestag election shows that
   an increasing degree of ideological deviation from the party lineas
   expressed in parliamentary speechesresults in a worse position on the
   party list for opposition MPs but does not affect the renomination of
   list candidates from the government camp or district candidates.},

Abstract = {We re-deploy a list experiment conducted a decade ago to reassess the
   degree to which the American public opposes electing a woman as
   president. We find that opposition has been cut in half from
   approximately 26\% to 13\%. In addition, opposition is now concentrated
   in specific sociodemographic categories rather than being evenly
   distributed. Newly developed statistical methods that permit
   multivariate analysis of list experiment data reveal that resistance has
   all but disappeared among Democratic-leaning groups in the electorate.
   These patterns appear to reflect the reduction of uncertainty among
   groups most favorable toward the recent success of Democratic women.},

Abstract = {The article addresses the transformations experienced by the Chilean

   interpretations, we state that the process of socialist radicalization
   must be traced back to the 1950s and had its expression in strategic
   lines, programs and changes in coalitional politics. We consider that
   this process of radicalization had in its origins a nationalist
   character and that in its genesis played a fundamental role the
   adaptation of elements coming from Latin American nationalistic
   movements and socialist experiences that stressed their nationalistic
   character.},

Abstract = {This work researches the investments made in the palm oil plantations by
   the Italian Company Poligrow in Mapiripan (Meta). From the theoretical
   point of view, the analysis introduces the eco-territorial change of
   direction of Latin America in the last decade (based on reflections of
   Latin American geographers), and in particular, the eco-territorial
   resistance in Latin America against the study of social conflicts. In
   the case of Colombia, said conflicts take place in a particularly
   violent fashion, aggravated by the persistence of an internal armed
   conflict and the strengthening of counter-insurgency groups. At the same
   time, the indigenous and peasant communities have been affected by the
   deterioration of their territories. In fact, many paramilitary groups,
   whose action and presence transcend the logic of self-defense, pursue
   the grabbing of land in particular through accumulation by
   dispossession, attracted by the opportunity of new businesses in
   relation with the Green Capitalism rhetoric. Expropriation is followed
   by a juridical strategy to ``legalize{''} the grabbed land.},

Abstract = {This article argues that the goals and strategies the opposition uses
   against presidents with hegemonic aspirations are critical to understand
   why some leaders successfully erode democracy, while others fail. Using
   interviews and archival research, I trace the dynamics of erosion in
   Alvaro Uribe's (Colombia) and Hugo Chavez's (Venezuela) administrations.
   I show that during the first years of these governments, the opposition
   in both countries had some institutional leverage. The Colombian
   opposition used that leverage. It resorted to institutional and moderate
   extra-institutional strategies, which protected its institutional
   resources and allowed it to eventually stop Uribe's second reelection
   reform. The Venezuelan opposition forsook that leverage and chose
   radical extra-institutional strategies instead. The latter cost it the
   institutional resources it had and helped Chavez advance more radical
   reforms.},

Abstract = {This article is a comparative theoretical study of authority in the Arab
   Spring which draws upon the work of Max Weber and Khalil Ahmad Khalil,
   and examines the theoretical importance of a shift away from authority
   understood along the lines of single, charismatic individuals. I argue
   that the central implication of the lack of dominant leaders in the Arab
   Spring is the potential for the growth of a popular form of charismatic
   authority. This popular understanding of charisma would have several
   important consequences for building a more broadly inclusive arrangement
   of democratic rule. First, it would allow for the self-realization of
   ordinary citizens in a way that was not possible in an authoritarian
   setting, where popular aspirations and demands were realized only
   abstractly, if not simply denied, by being invested in the figure of an
   `inspirational leader' This self-realization relies upon an important
   reversal of an image of Arab publics as incapable of self-governance.
   Second, it would signal a shift towards greater collective control in
   governance. In place of the relations of dependency and clientelism that
   have plagued many Arab societies since the formal end of modern colonial
   rule, popular charisma represents the prospect of political relations
   founded upon broad-based control, and towards this end, it would signal
   an embrace of greater accountability for those in positions of power.
   Finally, it can provide lessons beyond the context of authoritarianism,
   meaning for democratic theory, by outlining the consequences involved in
   investing undue authority in single leaders or offices.},

Abstract = {This paper discusses the issue of possible reporting bias in media-based
   violent-event data and its relation to the role of communication
   technology in fostering collective action. We expand the work of
   Weidmann (2016), presenting several sensitivity analyses to determine
   the degree to which reporting bias may confound the relationship between
   communication technology and violence in a recent study that relies on
   event data for Africa. We find no strong evidence that suggests results
   on the positive relationship between communication technology and
   collective action in the study by Pierskalla and Hollenbach (2013) are
   wholly an artifact of reporting bias.},

Title = {Institutional Change, Discourse and Politics. A Poststructuralist
   Research Proposal},
Journal = {DESAFIOS},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {29},
Number = {2},
Pages = {199-236},
Month = {JUL-DEC},
Abstract = {The article deals with the discussion about the relation between
   institutions and discourse in political science. To do so, it recovers
   some contributions from discursive institutionalism that have outlined
   the way in which the symbolic dimension of politics allows for the
   comprehension of institutional change - something underestimated by most
   mainstream perspectives in institutionalism. The article shows how the
   ontological and epistemological assumptions of mainstream
   institutionalism limit the notion of politics to the achievement of
   consensus and providing reasons by communicative rationality of given
   actors, which, in turn, diminishes the contingent and contested
   character of politics. As a result, the article puts forward a
   poststructuralist perspective which underlines the constitutively
   decentered and conflictive character of social objectivity in the
   struggle among antagonistic hegemonic projects. Rhetorical tropes such
   as metaphor and metonymy are emphasized as resources in order to
   understand the dynamics of meaning displacement and re-totalization
   through which institutional change is produced. The article concludes
   with how some of these concepts can be used in the analysis of state
   reform in the province of Cordoba, Argentina, between 1999 and 2000.},

Journal = {PARTY POLITICS},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {23},
Number = {4},
Pages = {413-423},

Abstract = {This article examines whether the support for Eurosceptic challenger
   parties influences mainstream party position change on European
   integration in Western Europe. The key finding is that Eurosceptic
   challenger support is capable of influencing mainstream position shifts
   on European integration provided that, on average, EU issues are
   regarded as important by the Eurosceptic challengers. Moreover, the
   centre-left is more affected by Eurosceptic contagion since it is
   influenced by both radical right and radical left Eurosceptic success,

Abstract = {The work of Peruvian intellectual Jose Carlos Mariategui (1894-1930)
   inaugurated a profound debate on economic dependence and the
   possibilities of Latin American Marxism. Currently, different
   disciplinary perspectives continue to explore the Peruvian
   intellectual's contribution to the fields of social sciences and -
   particularlycultural studies. However, there are no contemporary
   geographical approaches that critically and systematically recover his
   work. This article theoretically explores Mariategui's relationship with
   geography and proposes a critical rereading of the sociospatial
   considerations in his seminal work, Siete ensayos de interpretacion de
   la realidad peruana (Seven Interpretive Essays on Peruvian Reality,
   1928). Likewise, the article reviews several biographic milestones from
   Mariategui's intellectual trajectory and Peruvian geography, which help
   to understand his theoretical-political project and its particular
   context of production as geographical meaning.},

Abstract = {Do contexts of greater income inequality spur the disadvantaged to
   achieve a class consciousness vital to contesting the fairness of the
   economic system and demanding more redistribution? One prominent recent
   publication, the 2015 study by Newman, Johnston, and Lown, argues that
   simple exposure to higher levels of local income inequality lead
   low-income people to view the United States as divided into haves and
   have-nots and to see themselves as among the have-nots, that is, to
   become more likely to achieve such a class consciousness. Here, we show
   that this sanguine conclusion is at best supported only in analyses of
   the single survey presented in that study. There is no evidence that
   higher levels of income inequality produce greater class consciousness
   among those with low incomes in other similar but neglected surveys.},

Title = {Decentralisation and regional cabinet size: the Spanish case (1979-2015)},
Journal = {WEST EUROPEAN POLITICS},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {40},
Number = {4},
Pages = {717-740},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {This article explores under what conditions regional governments tend to
   have larger or smaller cabinets. The main contention is that
   cross-regional variation in cabinet size is partly explained by the
   dynamics set up by the multilevel system of government, mainly
   territorial decentralisation, multilevel government (in)congruence or
   the existence of nationally distinct regions. The hypotheses are tested
   with a new and original dataset built upon the Spanish case (1979-2015).
   Findings show that regions with more welfare state policies, especially
   when the region's economic capacity is high, and nationally distinct
   regions tend to have bigger executives. In contrast, decentralisation in
   the form of basic state functions and government incongruence do not
   have a significant effect. Results have important implications for our
   understanding of sub-national territorial institutions and their
   interaction with decentralisation dynamics.},

Abstract = {Internet-enabled devices or Internet of Things as it has been prevailed
   are increasing exponentially every day. The lack of security standards
   in the manufacturing of these devices along with the haste of the
   manufacturers to increase their market share in this area has created a
   very large network of vulnerable devices that can be easily recruited as
   bot members and used to initiate very large volumetric Distributed
   Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks. The significance of the problem can be
   easily acknowledged due to the large number of cases regarding attacks
   on institutions, enterprises and even countries which have been recently
   revealed. In the current paper a novel method is introduced, which is
   based on a data mining technique that can analyze incoming IP traffic
   details and early warn the network administrator about a potentially
   developing DDoS attack. The method can scale depending on the
   availability of the infrastructure from a conventional laptop computer
   to a complex cloud infrastructure. Based on the hardware configuration
   as it is proved with the experiments the method can easily monitor and
   detect abnormal network traffic of several Gbps in real time using the
   minimum hardware equipment.},

Abstract = {The aim of this study was to determine civil liability arising from the
   exercise of employee and employer. The terms of realization of civil
   liability include the general and specific conditions and of important
   theories about civil liability of employers against workers is the risk
   and fault theory. The popular legal opinion is that employer's liability
   is based on the fault assumption which refers to a fault-based liability
   where the fault is assumed and doesn't need proof. But it seems the base
   of sum of the employer's liability is sum and integration of risk
   theories and the fault assumption because in the fault assumption we see
   the individual's assumed liability that he/she can proofing lack of
   fault or failure come out from liability burden. Despite the respect for
   civil rights doctrine, in the opinion of the writer (author) perhaps we
   can't present a recorded and definite basis for employer's liability, as
   most lawyers believe. So what is in the law is the collective result of
   the integration fault assumption and derivatives of risk theory. In this
   study, conducted using descriptive - analytical, to identify the various
   intellectual foundations on raised issue, the Legal Opinions, law of
   common law and Romano-Germanic in this article are referred to different
   approaches on the issue ahead be explained.},

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW},

Volume = {38},
Number = {3},
Pages = {378-395},

Abstract = {An extensive literature shows that economic globalization has a positive
   effect on gender equality. However, the effect varies greatly across
   countries and time. This article argues that social globalization -
   individuals' exposure to external ideas, people, and information flows -
   and the changes in values associated with it - is a key boundary
   condition for the effect of economic globalization on women's rights.
   While economic globalization opens up new opportunities for women,
   policy adaptation to these changes requires a social demand for efforts
   for change. Social globalization contributes to policy adaptation by
   exposing the public to alternative gender-role models, setting off a
   shift in values, which underlies support for gender equality. Results
   emerging from a time-series-cross-sectional analysis of 152 nations for
   the period 1990-2003 confirm that the positive effect of economic
   globalization on gender equality wanes at lower levels of social
   globalization. Further, multilevel-path-analyses models demonstrate how
   changes to individual-level values mediate the effect of globalization
   on individuals' support for gender equality.},

Abstract = {The communist AKEL party governed the Republic of Cyprus from February
   2008 to February 2013. During this period, AKEL had to deal with grave
   economic problems. This article uses the European Elections Study (Voter
   Study, Advance Release, 7/4/2010, http://www.piredeu.eu,2009) data and
   presents a statistical model that explains up to 70 \% of the variance.
   We show that retrospective sociotropic evaluation of the economy by the
   Greek Cypriots has a significant effect on their intention to vote or
   not for the incumbent party. Based on this result, one may argue that
   the considerable amount of votes lost by AKEL in February 2013
   presidential elections could be mainly because of the deteriorating
   economic situation since the party took office in February 2008.},

Abstract = {At a time when representative democracies are in deep crisis, this
   article examines the debate over representation as it appears in
   contemporary Marxist and poststructuralist political thought. The
   article discusses, more specifically, Ernesto Laclau's defense of
   political representation and pits this against Michael Hardt and Antonio
   Negri's vision of an ``absolute democracy{''} beyond representation, in
   order to chart a path between and beyond both contrasting positions. The
   crux of the argument is that in participatory democracies political
   governance becomes a common affair: a public good accessible to all
   members of a community on the basis of equality. Such a democratic
   regime contrasts with both representative democracies, where the
   assembled demos is excluded from any effective participation in the
   everyday exercise of major political power, as well as direct democracy,
   where the collective sovereign would be fully present to itself, total
   and undivided. Common political representation is open to all,
   inclusive, participatory, and accountable.},

Abstract = {This article argues that the way we understand presidential success
   should be different for presidents in different contexts. It provides
   the first deeper exploration of success for Skowronek's disjunctive
   presidents and finds that, particularly when these presidents engage in
   policy experimentation, they can play an important role in preparing the
   way for a later reconstruction. Although the presidents of disjunction
   are particularly constrained, they are capable of success as long as we
   judge them realistically and acknowledge that they may receive little
   credit for their concrete achievements. We illustrate this contention
   through the presidencies of Herbert Hoover and Jimmy Carter, which
   exemplify the degrees of success available within the constraints of a
   faltering partisan regime.},

Abstract = {Conceptualizing the ``three pillars of stability{''}, Gerschewski (2013)
   proposes legitimation, cooptation and repression as the fundamental
   principles of lasting autocratic rule. Recent studies put this so-called
   WZB model to an empirical test and probe the effects these three factors
   have on regime survival in light of autocratic elections (Lueders and
   Croissant 2014). Their finding that the WZB model has only limited
   explanatory power in competitive autocracies has sparked a broader
   debate about the empirical application of the model as such (Kailitz and
   Tanneberg 2015; Lueders and Croissant 2015). Our paper contributes to
   this debate in several ways: (1) rather than analyzing each pillar's
   effect in isolation, we investigate their combined effect; (2) rather
   than assuming causal symmetry, we expect to find different explanations
   for autocratic stability and breakdown, respectively; (3) by focusing on
   configurations of the pillars, we are in the position to identify
   distinct types - or ``worlds{''} (Gerschewski 2013) - of (un)stable
   autocracies. Using the data from Lueders and Croissant (2014) on
   elections in hegemonic and competitive authoritarian regimes between
   1990 and 2009, we apply fuzzy-set Qualitative Comparative Analysis to
   empirically investigate which, if any, combination of the dimensions of
   legitimation, cooptation, and repression lead to the survival of
   autocratic regimes and which ones to their breakdown. Our findings
   suggest that single pillars in isolation are causally irrelevant; that
   the WZB model is, indeed, capable of identifying stable autocracy types
   but it does not perform well in identifying the reasons why autocracies
   break down; and that the two viable types of autocracies identified by
   us are meaningfully distinguished by their different legitimation
   strategies.},

Abstract = {The Russian aggression against Georgia in 2008, the ongoing conflict in
   Ukraine, constant pressure on Belarus and political ambitions in Moldova
   have brought Russia's geopolitical ambitions in the former Soviet
   republics to the spotlight and pushed them into facing a difficult
   dilemma between a growing partnership with the EU or further cooperation
   with Russia and the Eurasian Union. The article assesses potential
   threats for four post-Soviet republics (Armenia, Belarus, Georgia and
   Ukraine) which may result from Russia's imperialistic ambitions. The
   study is based on the common features of two recent conflicts in Georgia
   and Ukraine and relevant economic and ethnic data. Based on the
   assumption that a common neo-imperial pattern exists in Russia's
   initiatives outside its nearest borders, the current research focuses on
   the key elements of Russia's neo-imperial dependence model, the current
   stage of the dependence-cycle and the pre-conditions for the target
   state to escape the dependence.},

Abstract = {We present, test, and extend a theoretical framework that connects
   disgust, a powerful basic human emotion, to political attitudes through
   psychological mechanisms designed to protect humans from disease. These
   mechanisms work outside of conscious awareness, and in modern
   environments, they can motivate individuals to avoid intergroup contact
   by opposing immigration. We report a meta-analysis of previous tests in
   the psychological sciences and conduct, for the first time, a series of
   tests in nationally representative samples collected in the United
   States and Denmark that integrate the role of disgust and the behavioral
   immune system into established models of emotional processing and
   political attitude formation. In doing so, we offer an explanation for
   why peaceful integration and interaction between ethnic majority and
   minorities is so hard to achieve.},

Abstract = {Lyndon Johnson woke up studying whip counts, went to bed reading the
   Congressional Record, and invested countless hours in between
   translating that political intelligence into a lobbying offensive. The
   result, famously christened The Johnson Treatment, remains the archetype
   practitioners and political scientists cite when appraising presidential
   leadership on Capitol Hill. Yet Beltway folklore aside, we know little
   about how LBJ helped forge winning legislative coalitions. Stepping back
   from the (countless) colorful anecdotes, this study offers a new and
   systematic look at Lyndon Johnson's lobbying. Specifically, after
   exploring theoretical models of presidential coalition building, we then
   investigate their operational tenets using original data on all
   President Johnson's contacts, with each member of Congress, in both
   chambers, for every day he was president.},

Abstract = {Scholars' attention to the concept of niche parties has greatly
   increased. While researchers agree that niche parties matter in a
   variety of ways, the definitions and measurements of such parties are
   manifold and an accordance remains yet to be found. I argue the given
   conceptualizations of niche parties (a) suffer from gaps between their
   measurements and theoretical concepts or (b) conceptual clarity. The
   theoretical concept I propose understands niche parties as (a)
   predominantly competing on niche market segments neglected by their
   competitors and (b) not discussing a broad range of these segments. By
   measuring exactly these two components in an additive index drawn from
   the MARPOR data, the validation shows that parties emphasizing niche
   segments differentiate themselves from their competitors also by using a
   condensed message on these segments. In particular, this component of
   party competition, the specialization of party offers, has not been
   studied in the literature on niche parties and should receive more
   attention.},

Abstract = {The discourse principle, according to which only the norms all potential
   subjects might approve are valid, represent the grounds of democracy in
   Habermas' theory. Nevertheless, Habermas' paradigm displays some
   ambiguities or internal tensions between the discourse principle and its
   feasibility; that is to say between the normative plan and the
   descriptive plan. Modern cognitive and experimental sciences, especially
   the studies concerning the collective reasoning, can play a part in
   clearing the prominent features of Habermas' paradigm by adding new
   points over its feasibility and by considering to which extent the
   discourse principle is limited to the normative sphere and/or is carried
   out in practical action.},

Abstract = {The promotion of peace and security in Africa necessitates security
   cooperation between states and collective security remains a way to
   pursue it. This paper explores the changed meaning and application of
   the concept of collective security within the African Peace and Security
   Architecture (APSA) to deal with both interstate and intrastate security
   concerns within the African Union (AU). Since the AU has made clear
   commitments to collective security, the aim is to determine to what
   extent the AU subscribed to collective security and applied it in terms
   of coercion, which includes interventions. While dealing with genocide,
   war crimes and extended presidential terms remains problematic, the AU
   has taken an assertive stand with the use of coercion in cases of
   unconstitutional changes of government. The article highlights the
   tension between the theory and practice of collective security in
   Africa.},

Abstract = {Political campaigns discuss the personal dimensions of their candidates
   with great frequency, but scholars of campaign message strategy have not
   addressed why and how campaigns do so. This project focuses on the use
   of biographical appeals in campaign advertisements. Employing a dataset
   of candidate-sponsored campaign advertisements in the 2004 House and
   Senate general election, we argue that campaigns use these appeals in an
   effort to develop and enhance the credibility and likeability of their
   candidate in the face of voter skepticism about politicians and
   political messages. We find that campaigns employ more appeals on
   biography than on any substantive issue and highlight certain aspects of
   their biographies, like family values, more than others. We also find
   that challenging campaigns are more likely to discuss their candidate's
   biography, but, surprisingly, that open seat campaigns are not. Our
   results demonstrate the importance of personal-based appeals to campaign
   strategy and that campaigns balance these personal and substantive
   concerns in developing their appeals to voters.},

Abstract = {Open-access (OA) advocates have long promoted OA as an egalitarian
   alternative to traditional subscription-based academic publishing. The
   argument is simple: OA gives everyone access to high-quality research at
   no cost. In turn, this should benefit individual researchers by
   increasing the number of people reading and citing academic articles. As
   the OA movement gains traction in the academy, scholars are investing
   considerable research energy to determine whether there is an OA
   citation advantage-that is, does OA increase an article's citation
   counts? Research indicates that it does. Scholars also explored patterns
   of gender bias in academic publishing and found that women are cited at
   lower rates in many disciplines. Indeed, in many disciplines, men enjoy
   a significant and positive gender citation effect (GCE) compared to
   their female colleagues. This article combines these research areas to
   determine whether the OA citation advantage varies by gender. Using
   Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney (WMW) tests, the nonparametric analog to the
   independent samples T-test, I conclude that OA benefits male and female
   political scientists at similar rates. Thus, OA negates the gender
   citation advantage that typically accrues to male political scientists.},

Abstract = {This essay selectively reviews the history of economic thought on war
   and peace, starting with Adam Smith. Today, Smith's trickle of thoughts
   has become a broad marshland. In this marshland, however, discrete
   currents are apparent - some stronger, some weaker - which this essay
   identifies, in rough chronological order, as war, defense, conflict,
   military, security, and peace economics. As these terms often are used
   interchangeably, one purpose of the essay is to more clearly delineate
   these intellectual currents and differentiate them from each other. By
   building canals in the marshlands as it were, the aim is to help all
   flows of contributions become stronger.},

Abstract = {Do natural resources impair institutional outcomes? Existing work
   studies how natural resources influence the behavior of leaders in
   power. We study how they influence leaders' rise to power. Our analysis
   focuses on oil price shocks and local democracy in Colombia, a country
   mired in civil conflict. We find that when the price of oil rises,
   legislators affiliated with right-wing paramilitary groups win office
   more in oil-producing municipalities. Consistent with the use of force
   to gain power, positive price shocks also induce an increase in
   paramilitary violence and reduce electoral competition: fewer candidates
   run for office, and winners are elected with a wider vote margin.
   Ultimately, fewer centrist legislators are elected to office, and there
   is diminished representation at the center. Our findings highlight how
   natural resources undermine democracy by distorting elections and
   suggest that conflict leaves the political sector vulnerable to the
   resource curse.},

Number = {2},

Abstract = {The effect of new International Monetary Fund (IMF) lending
   announcements on capital markets depends on the lender's political
   motivations. There are conditions under which lending reduces the risk
   of a deepening crisis and the risk premium demanded by market actors.
   Yet the political interests that make lenders willing to lend may weaken
   the credibility of commitments to reform, and the act of accepting an
   agreement reveals unfavorable information about the state of the
   borrower's economy. The net `catalytic' effect on the price of private
   borrowing depends on whether these effects dominate the beneficial
   effects of the liquidity the loan provides. Decomposing the
   contradictory effects of crisis lending provides an explanation for the
   discrepant empirical findings in the literature about market reactions.
   This study tests the implications of the theory by examining how
   sovereign bond yields are affected by IMF program announcements, loan
   size, the scope of conditions attached to loans and measures of the
   geopolitical interests of the United States, a key IMF principal.},

Abstract = {As full-time Church of England diocesan Bishops, the Lords Spiritual are
   necessarily very much part-time Parliamentarians. This presents them
   with challenges in terms of maintaining a presence, and demonstrating
   its legitimacy, in an increasingly `professionalised' House of Lords.
   This article draws on original interviews to explore the factors which
   shape the Bishops' attendance and participation in the House of Lords.
   It suggests that although long-standing constraints on their attendance
   have persisted and indeed increased in recent decades, they have
   nonetheless found ways to maintain and increase their Parliamentary
   activity in the light of changes in the Church, Parliament and society.},

Abstract = {Any crime could generate digital evidence. That is a reality law
   enforcement authorities across the world need to face. The volatile and
   ``unterritorial{''} nature of the evidence means that international
   cooperation in criminal matters is confronted with new questions. One of
   these questions is whether the traditional cooperation mechanism, mutual
   legal assistance, is a viable way of working. Due to its time-consuming
   and cumbersome functioning combined with the lack of a faster
   alternative, countries have developed unilateral and extraterritorial
   methods of evidence gathering. This paper zooms in on this development
   and the risks it entails.},

Volume = {15},

Abstract = {Extensive analyses of Marine Le Pen's media interventions as leader of
   the French Front National have revealed mostly rhetorical differences
   from her father's discourse. In particular, despite Marine Le Pen's
   professed openness toward women and their policy concerns, and despite
   her professed intention to transform the FN into party suitable for
   government, there has been little progress in these directions. However,
   the FN's visual discourse has been all but ignored by the scholarly
   analysis, despite the fact that campaign visuals encode significant
   social and political information. This paper finds that the FN
   candidates' visual presentation has undergone major transformations from
   the 2007 to the 2012 legislative elections. Specifically FN candidates
   in 2012 are more likely to visually portray themselves like mainstream
   party candidates. Compared to the 2007 elections, women candidates, in
   particular, were more likely to visually promote their personal
   qualities in 2012, in some respects more than 2012 men candidates.},

Abstract = {This paper uses original survey data to explore the landscape of support
   for a number of aspects of what might be called ``the American
   Dream:{''} the notion that hard work is rewarded, and individuals
   succeed and fail due primarily to their own efforts. In general, I find
   that Americans generally endorse the idea that hard work leads to
   success and that economic mobility is possible for those willing to put
   in the effort, but that there is significant individual and contextual
   variation in support for those beliefs. I find that most variation in
   support for meritocratic belief is a function of simple partisan
   politics: differences between liberals and conservatives, and between
   Democrats and Republicans, are far more important to explaining
   meritocratic belief than any other sociodemographic factor. But
   attributes of the context in which one lives matter as well. Among other
   things, this paper highlights the importance of local economic decline
   as an important topic for future research: those who live in communities
   that have seen their relative economic fortunes drop over the past
   decade are less likely to believe in meritocracy than those who have
   seen their communities thrive.},

Abstract = {This article explains legislators' support for electoral reforms
   reducing electoral irregularities and protecting voters' autonomy at the
   ballot box in Britain and Germany in the late 19th century. We argue
   that the main political cleavage over the adoption of new legislation to
   limit illicit electoral practices pitted politicians able to take
   advantage of opportunities for vote buying and intimidation against
   those who could not do so because of unfavorable political and economic
   conditions in their district. We examine the political, partisan, and
   economic factors accounting for candidates' ability to engage in
   electoral irregularities and show that, in both countries,
   resource-constrained candidates were more likely to support the
   introduction of electoral reforms. Because the primary illicit electoral
   practice differs across these two cases-vote buying in Britain and
   economic intimidation in Germany-some of the political and economic
   factors accounting for legislators' support for reform differ across
   these cases.},

Abstract = {Should the EU be a federal union or an intergovernmental forum?
   Recently, demoicrats have been arguing that there exists a third
   alternative. The EU should be conceived as a demoicracy, namely a `Union
   of peoples who govern together, but not as one' (Nicolaidis). The demoi
   of Europe recognise that they affect one another's democratic health,
   and hence establish a union to guarantee their freedom qua demoi - which
   most demoicrats cash out as non-domination. This is more than
   intergovernmentalism, because the demoi govern together on these
   matters. However, if the union aims at protecting the freedom of the
   different European demoi, it cannot do so by replacing them with a
   `superdemos', as federalists want. This paper argues that demoicracy
   does possess distinctive normative features; it claims, however, that an
   institutional choice between intergovernmentalism and federalism is
   necessary. Depending on how we interpret what the non-domination of
   demoi requires, demoicracy will either ground a specific way of
   practicing intergovernmentalism or a specific form of federalism. It
   cannot, however, ground an institutional model which is genuinely
   alternative to both.},

Abstract = {Our model describes competition between groups driven by the choices of
   self-interested voters within groups. Within a Poisson voting
   environment, parties observe aggregate support from groups and can
   allocate prizes or punishments to them. In a tournament style analysis,
   the model characterizes how contingent allocation of prizes based on
   relative levels of support affects equilibrium voting behavior. In
   addition to standard notions of pivotality, voters influence the
   distribution of prizes across groups. Such prize pivotality supports
   positive voter turnout even in non-competitive electoral settings. The
   analysis shows that competition for a prize awarded to the most
   supportive group is only stable when two groups actively support a
   party. However, competition among groups to avoid punishment is stable
   in environments with any number of groups. We conclude by examining
   implications for endogenous group formation and how politicians
   structure the allocation of rewards and punishments.},

Journal = {POLITICAL RESEARCH QUARTERLY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {70},
Number = {1},
Pages = {3-18},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {While democratic theory suggests that representatives should be willing
   to adjust their issue positions to adapt to new circumstances,
   politicians face serious political risks from flip flopping. How do
   members of Congress balance these risks? Using an original data set of
   district economic conditions and opinion from 2007 to 2010 and sets of
   repeated roll call votes, I leverage the exogenous shock of the Great
   Recession to explain position change on three major economic policies. I
   find that position change occurs in response to the constituency on
   final passage votes, but that partisan pressures exert greater
   influence, especially on procedural votes. This novel test of
   responsiveness has implications for the nature of policy representation
   and the mechanisms behind aggregate responsiveness.},

Abstract = {A claim so often made about the presidency that it approaches
   conventional wisdom is that the president sees, and therefore decides,
   issues differently than members of Congress do. This thesis emerged in
   the late 1700s in debates over ratification and has been consistently
   asserted by legal scholars, political scientists, and, most
   passionately, by U.S. presidents. I test this thesis by examining the
   legislative behavior of 23 men who have represented both a narrow
   constituency in Congress and the entire country as president. My results
   indicate that the presidency effectively moderated the legislative
   behavior of legislators who became president for roughly one and a half
   centuries; however, the modern presidency not only fails to moderate
   presidents, the presidency now appears to amplify the partisan bent of
   those who occupy the office.},

Abstract = {This article examines factors which led to what became known as the
   ``false positives{''} scandal in Colombia, in order to analyse the
   extent to which socio-economic inequalities and the persecution of the
   poor impact conflict dynamics and prospects for sustainable peace. The
   false positives scandal concerned the arbitrary execution of,
   principally, poor, marginalized male civilians by the military,
   sometimes in collaboration with illegal armed groups, who were then
   presented as guerrilla fighters having been lawfully killed in combat.
   These crimes were primarily committed between 2002 and 2008 and involved
   the execution of over 3,000 civilians. The scandal constitutes one of
   the most shocking global examples in recent years of crimes of the
   powerful: crimes committed by state actors against the most dispossessed
   and marginalized members of society. It will be argued that criminal
   accountability for those responsible for these crimes is important, but
   it is not sufficient. There is a need to address extreme socio-economic
   inequalities that prevail in Colombia and socio-cultural attitudes
   towards the poor which dehumanize and, thereby, deny or justify crimes
   and other harms against them. Otherwise the poor will remain vulnerable
   to further victimization and peacebuilding will not be successful or
   meaningful to those beyond privileged and elite groups.},

Abstract = {One of the major challenges in providing quality representation comes
   from the desire to balance the will of the majority with the needs of
   political minorities. Of particular importance is whether substantive or
   descriptive representation are necessary to create symbolic
   representation and perceptions that government outcomes are fair and
   legitimate. In this paper, we employ a novel experimental design to
   investigate how citizens feel about the relative importance of
   descriptive and substantive representation. Drawing on data from a
   nationally representative sample and two supplemental experiments, we
   show that citizens value descriptive representation independently of
   substantive representation. We also demonstrate that the degree of
   descriptive representation desired is conditional on the nature of the
   policy being considered.},

Abstract = {Given the transformation in the government of academic life over recent
   decades, the article attempts to derive a political critique of the
   changing psychosocial conditions of academic life via a historical
   juxtaposition with the nomos of the labour camp in Solzhenitsyn's Gulag
   Archipelago. The aim is to address the need to think beyond normative
   disciplinary power, to explore a distinctly capitalist governmentality
   in relation to Foucault's genealogy of power and to elaborate the
   techniques and practices of an emergent `meta-disciplinary' technology
   of labour control in academia. Therefore, a broadly Foucauldian analysis
   on these questions will be undertaken, and augmented with Marxian and
   post-Freudian insights into the role of capital accumulation dynamics,
   in order to texture the conventional presentation of governmental
   rationality. The result is a metonymic presentation of the `camp' as a
   physiological structure of capitalist Modernity, whose imprint can be
   discerned in numerous social and institutional settings, in this case
   Academia and the Gulag. From this outcome, insights into the
   transformation of living and labouring in academia, and the effects on
   psychological and intellectual well-being stemming from the new complex
   of control can be derived. The piece concludes with some thoughts on
   strategies of intellectual survival in academia, on counter-conducted
   techniques of subjectification and on possible means of resistance in
   the meta-disciplinary idiom.},
