Abstract = {Right-wing populist parties tend to combine criticism of how liberal
   democracy functions with calls for greater direct democracy. But do
   their voters share that support for direct democracy? In this article,
   survey data is used to examine, first, whether right-wing populist
   candidates in Australia, Canada and New Zealand were more supportive of
   direct democracy than candidates of other parties. Second, the views of
   right-wing populist voters about the functioning of democracy and direct
   democracy are investigated. While right-wing populist candidates turned
   out to be far more likely to support direct democracy, right-wing
   populist supporters did not mirror the candidates. Although these were
   among the most dissatisfied with how democracy worked, they did not
   necessarily favour referendums more than other voters. The findings have
   implications both for how we conceive of the relationship between
   populism and direct democracy and the remedies proposed for redressing
   populist discontent.},

Title = {Institutional bricolage in times of crisis},
Journal = {EUROPEAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {9},
Number = {1},
Pages = {139-160},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {How may we understand the occurrence of gradual but significant change
   following economic crisis? Theories of gradual institutional
   transformation offer important insights to analyses of long-term
   institutional change, but have so far shied away from dealing with
   institutional change during and following crisis, leaving the issue to
   more traditional critical juncture models. Instead of seeing gradual
   institutional change originating only in the efforts of rule takers to
   circumvent existing institutions - potentially leading to gradual change
   over longer periods of time - the paper suggests that in more abrupt
   processes of change characteristic of economic crisis, rule makers may
   also reinterpret the meaning of rules and redeploy them under
   significantly altered circumstances leading to gradual change. The paper
   suggests that the concept of bricolage is useful for understanding how
   policymakers create new institutional setups through the re-ordering of
   existing institutional elements. The empirical relevance of these
   arguments is demonstrated with a study of post-crisis special bank
   insolvency policies in Denmark and the United States, showing how in
   both polities new institutions were created from existing institutional
   elements.},

Volume = {45},
Pages = {180-190},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {We analyze the impact of economic conditions and income shocks on the
   stability of incumbents' support in Latin America. A reduction in the
   incumbent's vote share from one election to another is a behavioral
   indicator of voter discontent with her performance, a crucial element of
   democratic accountability. In explaining the percentage change in
   incumbent vote, we emphasize the importance of income effects. In
   particular, we argue that negative economic conditions have deleterious
   consequences on the capacity of incumbents to sustain their electoral
   support. We test this hypothesis both at the aggregate and individual
   level using electoral and survey data. We find evidence that negative
   economic shocks erode support for incumbents at both levels of analysis,
   thus increasing our confidence on results showing the impact of
   pocketbook economic vote in the region. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {How do electoral systems and intraparty candidate selection procedures
   affect party unity? In this article, I distinguish theoretically and
   empirically between electoral systems and candidate selections and argue
   that the influence of selection processes on parties' behavior is
   conditional on electoral system (and vice versa). Measuring parties'
   unity using Rice and weighted Rice scores, and applying hierarchical
   models to a new data set of 249 parties in 24 countries, I find support
   for the claim that the influence of selection processes on behavior is
   greater under electoral systems that encourage personal vote-seeking
   incentives than under electoral systems that encourage party
   centeredness.},

Abstract = {One of the new transformations in the scope of maritime transportation
   about shipping documents includes non-paper (electronic) maritime
   transport documents. Three principal functions of a bill of lading in
   maritime transportation comprise receipt of carriage of good, reason for
   carriage contract, and title document. The majority of studies are about
   to realize the functions of carriage receipt and reason for carriage
   contract within substitution of electronic documents, such as
   replacement of paper bill of lading with an electronic bill of lading.
   While there is not the same conclusion about the function of the title
   document and this doubt on the result is beyond the replacement of paper
   documents with electronic documents caused by ambiguities in considering
   the bill of lading as a title document of goods and function of a bill
   of lading as a title document. In general, the transfer of a bill of
   lading does not mean the transfer of ownership while ownership is
   transferred through a contract of goods' sale and bill of shading is
   considered as a document that indicates a property of goods to
   facilitate transactions within commercial operations.},

Abstract = {The paper aims to reexamine of the concept of sovereignty as an
   affirmation of freedom in history, in order to enable the realization of
   self-determination principle and also the fulfillment of human and
   fundamental rights. It was done with support of the theory of
   recognition, based on Hegel and contemporary and complementary
   interpretations. The work of two central authors to the concept of
   sovereignty, Bodin and Hobbes, were analyzed, stressing, contextualized
   and critically, the philosophical foundation and limitations to their
   proposes, which are incompatible to the abstract understanding that
   defended an absolute sovereignty. At the end, sovereignty is considered
   not as a right, but an effective necessity of recognition achieved among
   the states (international community), requiring both self-determination
   capacity and respect for human and fundamental rights.},

Abstract = {Using a new data set that captures the share of reporting on terrorism,
   we explore the nexus between terrorist attacks and the news. It turns
   out that terrorism mainly influences news reports through the number of
   incidents. Regarding the reverse causality, we provide evidence that the
   share of the news devoted to terrorism Granger-causes further terrorist
   activities. However, short-run and medium-run effects differ: media
   coverage on terror only impact in the severity of terror in the short
   run (up to two months). From the third to the tenth months, it causes an
   increase in the number as well as in the severity of the attack. These
   observations are consistent with the idea of competition between
   terrorist groups.},

   ANALYSIS OF WOMEN'S SUCCESS IN THE 2014 CZECH MUNICIPAL ELECTIONS},

Abstract = {Political representation of women is usually the subject of research at
   the national level of governance. Local level surveys are usually
   limited to statistical analysis or detailed descriptions of individual
   cases. As a rule, however, they do not address the determinants of the
   success of female candidates at the communal level. The study focuses on
   the success of female candidates at the local government level. The aim
   is to find a combination of conditions leading to a higher degree of
   political representation of women in the regional cities of the Czech
   Republic. The main benefit of the study is the use of QCA based on
   Boolean Algebra, which is an alternative to classical qualitative and
   quantitative methods, as it attempts to combine the benefits of both
   approaches and on this basis can provide a more comprehensive
   explanation of the studied Cases. The results showed significant
   differences between towns in Bohemia and Moravia, when women in Moravian
   cities are significantly under-represented. On the territory of Bohemia,
   the representation of women is sufficient in cities, which were
   inhabited in the past mainly by the German population and after the
   Second World War was settled by the Czech population. The results offer
   the potential for future comparisons with the results of statistical
   analysis, but also for the international comparison of not only
   post-communist areas.},

Abstract = {Ukrainian Crisis of 2014 is crucial for Russian pivot to the East which
   is considered to be a tool for tackling economic challenges and avoiding
   diplomatic isolation. Economically, this pivot implies cooperation with
   Asia-Pacific region in trade and energy. Politically, it means closer
   ties with the states of that region. At the same time, the success of
   the strategy hinges on the state of affairs in energy and on promoting
   to Asian markets specific goods that turns out to be a constraint for
   diversification of the Russian economy. Moreover, culturally and social
   Russia is much closer to Europe than Asia, and that is one more obstacle
   to ``Pivot to the East{''} strategy realization. However, transregional
   projects of the recent years, including Chinese initiative ``One Belt -
   One Road{''} and Russian ``Pivot to the East{''} might be key to enhance
   the strategic potential of Russia-China cooperation which meets Chinese
   national interests.},

Abstract = {Process tracing is a method to obtain solid causal inferences. Concerned
   by the fragmentation of the growing literature distinguishing different
   types of process tracing, we highlight the elements that unite this
   method: the construction, through different routes, of narratives that
   provide plausible, persuasive explanations of the outcomes of interest.
   Our argument draws on the comparison of two studies with different entry
   points to the research process: the first one starts inductively due to
   the novelty of the outcome of interest, while the second study starts
   deductively since previous theories were available. We show how to
   conduct process-tracing analysis rigorously and highlight that these
   studies converge to produce narratives structured around hypotheses and
   causal mechanisms that explain the outcomes.},

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL CRITICAL THOUGHT},
Year = {2017},

Abstract = {Written in response to a range of problems and debates, this paper
   provides an objective evaluation of the various stages in the economic
   development of the Soviet Union, as well as of the causes behind the
   dramatic changes experienced as that development proceeded. The paper
   thus explains the historical significance of the October Revolution for
   the economic and social development of the Soviet Union. The analysis
   begins with studies of War Communism and of the New Economic Policy as
   correct choices necessitated by their historical contexts. Then follows
   an examination of the road of socialist construction as opened up by the
   October Revolution. The achievements recorded along this road are held
   to have been greater than the mistakes committed. The paper concludes by
   pointing out three major causes that in the view of the author led to
   the collapse of the Soviet Union. These causes were at a basic level,
   long-term confusion in the field of theory and ideas; as a key factor,
   organizational and policy mistakes over an extended period; and as the
   fatal blow and immediate cause, the political betrayal represented by
   ``perestroika and new thinking.{''}},

Abstract = {The enormous complexity of the Venezuelan situation generates
   stupefaction and escapes any kind of scientific analysis. A trans

   the Venezuelan people cultural roots as an explanation for such a

   international market and the political and economic process of the
   so-called Bolivarian Revolution.
   Dr Jose Manuel Briceno Guerrero's thesis exposed on ``The labyrinth of
   the three minotaurs{''} works as a frame for this analysis and offers a
   deeper perspective than the merely political or economic one.},

Pages = {8-15},
Abstract = {Attempts to predict the future shape of President Donald Trump's defence
   policy in the Asia-Pacific are a challenge, at best. Nevertheless,
   Patrick Cullen argues that, in contrast to early assumptions that he
   would initiate a more isolationist defence policy and break with the
   previous administration's Rebalance to Asia policy, Trump is more likely
   to adopt a hawkish - if unpredictable - enforcement of the policy's key
   defence objectives. Gauging whether the Trump administration will bring
   either change from, or continuity with, the military component of the
   Rebalance to Asia policy will require keeping an eye on each of the
   policy's subcategories.},

Pages = {9+},
Abstract = {This article proposes a historiographical and conceptual analysis of
   ordinary practices of politics and their centrality in the elaboration
   of the idea of the common, considering the works of historians and those
   of political scientists. Following different paths, the two disciplines
   have pursued avenues of enquiry that seem to be converging, even though
   no formal connections have yet been made. On the basis of these findings
   and the analysis of recent works, this article proposes definitions and
   principles for studying these ordinary political practices, and examines
   the sources at our disposal, the forms of action and discourse they
   reveal, the content and the meaning of these practices, and their
   influence on the construction of the political order by public
   authority. This introduction reflects on the theoretical principles that
   underpin the articles in this issue, and questions in particular
   definitions of the ordinary, notions of the common, of the world, of
   proximity or fluid conjunctures that have structured our collective
   reflections.},

   possible to highlight common characteristics with the mainstream
   analyses of Social Europe but also specificities, the least of which is
   not that the most important areas in quantitative terms are also those

   way, an informal refugee camp was built in September 2015 in front of
   the Foreign Office in Brussels, Belgium. This article examines this
   camp, the Maximiliaan camp, as a contested space for citizenship. We
   analyse the acts of CollectActif, a collective consisting mostly of
   undocumented migrants, who set up a fixed kitchen and hence staged
   themselves as de facto citizens and as part and parcel of a broader
   citizens' movement. Based on ethnographic research within this kitchen,
   we focus on several polemical scenes' in which a divisive police logic
   is confronted with a logic of universal equality. We conclude with a
   reflection on how presupposing radical equality has come to function as
   an important part of CollectActif's activist citizenship.},

Abstract = {This article questions the political ability of common actors from small
   towns in the kingdom of France to resist violence during the first wars
   of religion (1560-1574). When everything at the national level pushed
   them to consider themselves as enemies, as ``Protestants{''} or
   ``Catholics{''} who had nothing in common, how did the ordinary citizens
   of these villages live together? To answer this question, this article
   analyzes ``friendship pacts,{''} signed between Protestants and
   Catholics when the wars resumed on a national level. In these
   agreements, the signatories promised to behave like ``brothers, friends,
   and fellow citizens{''} and, by writing a heterogeneous inventory of
   ``what they had in common,{''} they invented what, in spite of the
   religious rupture, would make them ``stand together.{''}},

Journal = {DEMOCRATIZATION},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {24},
Number = {1},
Pages = {20-40},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Personalist dictatorships make up an increasingly large proportion of
   the world's dictatorships. Moreover, they tend to be particularly
   resistant to democratization. Understanding the conditions that increase
   the likelihood of democratic transitions in personalist contexts,
   therefore, is critical for the study and practice of democratization in
   the contemporary era. This study argues that political party creation is
   a key factor. Though personalist dictators typically create parties to
   offset immediate threats to their power posed by the elite - and
   particularly the military - doing so encourages peaceful mass
   mobilization and a realignment of elite networks. These dynamics, in
   turn, enhance prospects of democratization. Using cross-national
   empirical tests that address the potential endogeneity of this
   relationship, we find support for the argument that personalist
   dictators who create their own political party are more likely to
   democratize than those who ally with a pre-existing party or rule
   without one.},

Journal = {POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {69},
Number = {1},
Pages = {1-15},
Abstract = {No development in international politics is attracting as much attention
   as the emergence of China as a great power. But many questions and
   uncertainties attend China's rise. What are the long-term goals of
   Chinese power? Does Beijing view the international system as
   fundamentally beneficial to its goals or as an impediment to them? Will
   China emerge as a more open, prosperous, just and sustainable society or
   less so? As China's paramount leader Xi Jinping is the single-most
   powerful individual shaping his country's answers to those questions. It
   is therefore important to illuminate and understand the forces which are
   likely to affect his thinking and his responses to them. With that in
   mind, this essay will delve into Xi's background, his stated vision for
   China's future and the challenges which confront that vision. From
   there, the essay concludes with an assessment of how these factors are
   likely to play out in Chinese domestic and foreign policy in the years
   ahead.},

Abstract = {When some members of yesterday's opposition organizations enter the
   state upon democratic breakthrough, does this empower or weaken the
   mission of the organizations left behind? While little research has been
   directed at this important element of democratization, I leverage the
   existing interdisciplinary social movement literature to create a series
   of forward-reaching arguments, based on identities, networks and
   opportunity structures. In the context of current studies, each of these
   factors should provide advantage to organizations with colleagues now in
   the state. By contrast, I argue that identities and personal networks
   developed during the struggle provide movement activists with
   opportunities to influence minor issues, but that new and differing
   institutional pressures create schisms on broader policy that turn prior
   bonds into a liability rather than an asset. I use elite interviews and
   media analyses in the case of post-democratic breakthrough Poland to
   evaluate three competing arguments, focused on identities, networks and
   institutions.},

Abstract = {The October Revolution was the starting point for a vast social project:
   the creation of a new type of human. Over the course of 70 years of
   Soviet rule, a specific anthropological type was indeed created: Soviet
   man. He is characterised by the ideological standards that he is
   expected to fulfil, and by the almost limitless power of the
   all-encompassing state institutions. He reacted to the omnipresent
   contradictions between reality and the official norms by adapting and
   developing double-think. The repressive state formed the mentality of
   people so firmly that this type began reproducing itself. In Russia,
   Soviet man was the basis for the resurrection of the authoritarian
   state.},

   sciences that have the political authority to interpret and are
   therefore instrumentalised by the political world or kept on a tight
   rein are now at risk of being isolated within their own country. The
   aspiration to maintain dialogue with East European partners must not be
   allowed to undermine standards of quality in the acquisition of
   knowledge. Transfer of knowledge on Eastern Europe faces a dual
   challenge.},

   COMMUNICATION},
Year = {2017},
Pages = {147-168},
Abstract = {As the Ukrainian crisis of 2014 unfolded, the chancellor of
   Germany-after speaking with the president of Russia-reported that she
   thought he was in a completely different world. His view of what was
   going on was so different than the conventional wisdom in the West that
   finding any common ground seemed nearly impossible. This chapter
   explores the roots of the different world views that adversaries are
   oftentimes operating with. It begins by laying out a rational baseline
   and then identifies three things that complicate the decisional process
   at the international level: 1) the need to add substantive context to
   key concepts, 2) imperfect signaling, and 3) propaganda. I then turn to
   the shortcuts people employ to manage the flow of information coming to
   them. This discussion of cognitive perspectives concentrates on
   attribution biases, in weighing graphic information and letting
   analogues and schemata do too much of the work when constructing mental
   pictures. Finally, I turn to a theory of motivated reasoning. It argues
   that an important source of the mental pictures being constructed are
   the sentiments felt by the observers. These emanate from within the
   observers more so than from the information coming to them from the
   outside. This theory of images contends that to avoid painful
   trade-offs, leaders and followers alike are motivated to adopt
   stereotypic images that relax what would otherwise be moral
   prohibitions. Doing this makes deciding easier but makes conflict
   resolution more difficult. It also drives a process of decision-making

Abstract = {This text presents how Pierre Muller's concept of public policy
   referencing is applied to some public policy instruments as analyzed
   during the 1994 - 2014 period when caring for displaced population. This
   period allowed the observation of an emergence of a series of images
   when caring for the displaced that, seen as a whole, make visible the
   complexity of this phenomenon in terms of public policy. This insofar as
   how it shows that discourses and actions when caring for the displaced
   population lack continuity even during the term of the incumbent
   government, which complicates the caring and restitution of rights
   processes. The changes in the reference frame (i.e. the collective
   imagination) when caring for displaced population that resulted from the
   analysis: from a perspective of harm (CONPES 2804 dated 1995), to one of
   differential care (CONPES 2924 dated 1997); Then to one of specialized
   care (Law 387 dated 1997), to finally arrive at one of differential care
   (Law 1448 dated 2011).},

Abstract = {This paper analyzes the impact of centralization process of presidential
   political power during the last decade (2003-2015) on human resources
   management policies within the National Public Administration. This
   period of systematic concentration of powers in the hands of the
   president was accompanied by a progressive expansion of nomination
   capacities in order to guarantee the political adherence of the
   bureaucracy to the official project. The flexibilization of designations
   was the main resource used by governments to ensure political leadership
   over bureaucracy. The presidents mainly resorted to two appointment
   strategies to spread their margin of discretion: (1) the extension of
   the structure of transitional hiring outside the career system; and (2)
   the colonization of hierarchical positions through exception. The
   increasing use of these flexible mechanisms contributed to limit the
   full institutionalization of a professional bureaucracy, negatively
   affecting both the size of the state apparatus and government
   performance.},

Abstract = {This article puts into conversation Friedrich Nietzsche's perspectivism
   and a particular expression of African animism, drawn from my
   ethnographic fieldwork in Ghana. Nietzsche's perspectivism extends
   interpretation beyond the human species into natural processes. Like
   perspectivism, African animism troubles the binariesbody/soul,
   nature/culturethat permeate anthropocentric thinking. Human-nonhuman
   relations are refigured as socio-ecological relations: the earth may be
   regarded as life-generating ancestors; baobab trees may approach humans
   as kin. These two images of the world intersect, but they do not mesh
   together. Nietzsche adopts perspectivism as active intersections between
   dynamic processes, within an open universe that has not been predesigned
   for humans. Animism tends toward a world of personalized relationships
   that would reach harmony if we would only lighten our ecological
   footprint. I draw upon such resonances to advance a new ethic of
   experiential environmentalism that treats ecological threats as lived
   risks and shared experiences with a lively and communicating
   environment.},

Abstract = {Who rules during the civil war? This article argues that the concept of
   armed group governance must be expanded to include auxiliary armed
   forces linked to rebels or the government. Comparing the organization of
   rebel and government auxiliaries, the article demonstrates that security
   governance during war is never static, but evolves over time. Evidence
   from the civil war in Mozambique (1976-1992) shows that the auxiliary's
   origin shapes its initial level of autonomy. Second, auxiliary
   contribution to battlefield success of one side may induce innovations
   adopted by auxiliaries on the other. Both have distinct consequences for
   the nature of governance.},

Abstract = {In 2011 South Africa led the UN Human Rights Council to adopt the
   first-ever UN resolution on sexual orientation. In 2014, South Africa
   was the only African state to support the follow-up to the 2011
   resolution. These actions create the impression that South Africa is
   strongly committed to the international advancement of sexual
   orientation rights. However, this article scrutinises South Africa's
   actions on sexual orientation rights at the UN for the period 1995-2015
   and will demonstrate South Africa's inconsistency, its frequent failures
   to support sexual orientation rights internationally, and its various
   actions against the advancement of these rights. The article sets South
   Africa's behaviour on sexual orientation rights against broader
   questions of the place of human rights in South African foreign policy
   and South Africa's international leadership.},

Title = {Politics, it has never been so simple Complex versus simple rhetoric and
   the use of hyperbole in political decision-making in the Netherlands},
Booktitle = {COMPLEX POLITICAL DECISION-MAKING: LEADERSHIP, LEGITIMACY AND
   COMMUNICATION},
Year = {2017},
Pages = {183-202},
Abstract = {Theory states that politicians tend to express their decisions,
   standpoints and behaviour in plain, simple, straightforward rhetoric.
   But the decision-making process might, in particular circumstances,
   require or take benefit from higher levels of complexity. It is assumed
   that several rhetorical figures, such as metaphor and hyperbole, affect
   the level of complexity, and with that the comprehensibility, of
   language or rhetoric. The use of these rhetorical figures could be aimed
   at the simplification of a statement or argument. Whereas this use of
   rhetoric for simplification is regarded as a semantic psychological
   effort, the cognitive complexity that is put into arguing or reasoning,
   as measured by the integrative complexity theory, should be perceived as
   an effort that is put in the cognitive psychological structure of
   language.
   This chapter aims to establish a connection between the use of hyperbole
   (exaggeration as a rhetorical figure) and integrative complexity in the
   rhetoric of party leaders in the Parliament of the Netherlands. The
   question is whether we can link the cognitive structure of language to
   the rhetorical use of language. For the assessment of the (cognitive)
   degree of complexity/simplicity in language we use the method of
   integrative complexity (e.g. Suedfeld, Chapter 6 in this volume) that
   examines the levels of differentiation and integration in written or
   spoken texts, whereas hyperbole use is measured through the methods that
   we explained in the previous chapter. Results of this study show that
   simple political language, or rhetoric with lower levels of complexity,
   tends to contain a greater number of hyperboles compared to more complex
   language. Additionally, it meets the expectations that complexity in
   rhetoric by ruling elites is more elevated compared to rhetoric among
   parties without legislative obligations; lower-complexity levels can
   especially be linked to the rhetoric of the radical-right populist
   leader.},

Abstract = {Violence, deaths, fear and sorrow characterise the everyday lives of
   those in Turkey's Kurdish region, also known as Northern Kurdistan.
   Through ethnographic field research, this article explores connections
   between resistance and emotions by scrutinising empirical observations
   and activists' narratives during and after participation in a ceremony
   for a 16-year-old Kurdish boy who had been killed by Turkish forces-a
   `martyr' in the eyes of the activists. By fusing empirical ethnographic
   data with James Scott's theoretical works on hidden resistance and Arlie
   Russell Hochschild's theorisations of emotional management, two distinct
   forms of what will be termed emotional resistance will be pointed out.
   Emotional resistance refers to conscious attempts to manipulate or
   manoeuvre around one's own emotional expressions or reactions in order
   to undermine the power of psychological or direct violence in political
   contexts.},

Abstract = {For quite some time, reinsurance companies have been pricing the ongoing
   climate change using weather- and catastrophe-related instruments and
   thus have been able to make money through climate change. Yet, at the
   same time, for reinsurance companies it is crucial that the likelihood
   of the events they underwrite is diminished as much as possible.
   Consequently, while profiting from the situation, these key actors of
   global capitalism also work to prevent climate change from taking place,
   and support the kinds of measures, on all political scales, that
   diminish the likelihood of severe climate change destruction. This
   article analyzes the materials that the reinsurance company Munich Re
   has distributed to stakeholders and asks how climate change is
   objectified by the reinsurance industry. How are weather-related
   catastrophes made into a financial risk and opportunity? The key
   conceptual tools for answering these questions are provided by Michel
   Serres's work on world-objects.},

Abstract = {The article examines the impact of international expert advice on
   efforts to introduce democratizing reforms in Ukraine's system of public
   administration following independence in 1991. The focus of the analysis
   is on an area which has particular resonance in the light of recent
   events in Ukraine, the relationship between Kyiv and the regions. The
   article argues that the effectiveness of external assistance has been
   compromised as much by institutional factors affecting the behaviour of
   international donors as by corresponding factors on the Ukrainian side,
   and that an opportunity to contribute to the democratic transformation
   of Ukraine has been needlessly wasted.},

   Capitalism to Socialism},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL CRITICAL THOUGHT},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {7},
Number = {1},
Pages = {15-31},
Abstract = {If we analyse the first 15 years of Soviet Russia, we see three social
   experiments. The first experiment, based on the equal distribution of
   poverty, suggests the ``universal asceticism{''} and ``rough
   egalitarianism{''} criticised by the Communist Manifesto. We can now
   understand the decision to move to Lenin's New Economic Policy, which
   was often interpreted as a return to capitalism. The increasing threat
   of war pushed Stalin into sweeping economic collectivisation. The third
   experiment produced a very advanced welfare state but ended in failure:
   in the last years of the Soviet Union, it was characterised by mass
   absenteeism and disengagement in the workplace; this stalled
   productivity, and it became hard to find any application of the
   principle that Marx said should preside over socialism-remuneration
   according to the quantity and quality of work delivered. The history of
   China is different: Mao believed that, unlike ``political capital,{''}
   the economic capital of the bourgeoisie should not be subject to total
   expropriation, at least until it can serve the development of the
   national economy. After the tragedy of the Great Leap Forward and the
   Cultural Revolution, it took Deng Xiaoping to emphasise that socialism
   implies the development of the productive forces. Chinese market
   socialism has achieved extraordinary success.},

Abstract = {40 years after the German Autumn, several questions still remain
   unanswered. They include the issue of whether the Soviet secret service,
   the KGB, supported terror groups in the West during the East-West
   conflict. Since Claire Sterling's The Terror Network, published in 1981,
   the theory has been in circulation that the RAF was assisted by Moscow.
   This theory is untenable: at no time did Moscow support the RAF
   terrorist activities. The overriding interest in a policy of detente and
   the CSCE process, as well as the fight against terrorism within the
   Soviet Union itself prior to the 1980 Olympic Games, were more important
   than supporting ostensibly anti-imperialist freedom fighters and
   terrorists in western Europe.},

Abstract = {Historically there have been various discussions on how to achieve
   development from different scopes and spaces. The vision of development
   from a global space has undergone a significant evolution to the present
   day, in particular after World War II, in the context of international
   development cooperation. Within a regional space, economic cooperation
   mechanisms have shown to be dynamic and positive for development. This
   paper aims, firstly, to set forth a review of the evolution of the
   development vision from a global and regional perspective. Secondly, to
   analyze contributions in commerce from a regional development
   perspective through a comparative analysis of the Pacific Alliance and
   the Latin American Integration Association between 2005 and 2014, as
   economic cooperation mechanisms in Latin America and the Caribbean that
   seek development within the same region.},

Title = {``This eminent woman has touched the universal soul{''}. A
   medical theory of the actress-singer in Luigi Morando De
   Rizzoni's La Pasta nell'Otello (Verona,
   Crescini, 1830)},
Journal = {LABORATOIRE ITALIEN-POLITIQUE ET SOCIETE},
Year = {2017},
Number = {20},
Abstract = {Luigi Morando De Rizzoni's fictional dialogue La Pasta nell'Otello was
   published in Verona following Giuditta Pasta's tour of northern Italy
   during the winter of 1829-1830. Five characters spend their evening
   debating the singer's talent, its causes and effects. Explicitly taking
   the side of the singer, the dialogue's author, a wine producer and the
   brother of a doctor, provides us with a fascinating text, both from the
   perspective of the opinions and accounts which he develops concerning
   Giuditta Pasta's singing and acting in Rossini's Otello, as well as the
   elements of aesthetic and medical theories which he integrates into his
   arguments. Indeed, the dialogue aims at establishing a universal
   aesthetic judgment on man's physiological nature, and the physical and
   moral effect on this nature which Giuditta Pasta, perceived as being
   exceptional, produces. In this way, contrary to erudite criticism -
   above all attentive to technical and musical aspects - De Rizzoni
   proposes a theory of aesthetic reception based on the communication of
   passions. The following text is the full translation of this document,
   previously unpublished in French.},

Abstract = {Hannah Arendt's political theory is often understood to rest on a
   celebration of action, the memorable words and deeds of named
   individuals, over against the anonymous processes constitutive of
   `labor' and `society'. Yet at key moments in The Human Condition and The
   Origins of Totalitarianism, Arendt seems to signal a different
   relationship between political action and anonymity; and she does so in
   part via citations of the novels of William Faulkner. Using the
   apparently contradictory notion of `anonymous glory' as a heuristic,
   this essay reconsiders Arendt's political thought through readings of
   the novels she cites, A Fable and Intruder in the Dust. The essay argues
   that, for Arendt, a conception of action adequate to the scale of modern
   social power must somehow be both indelibly tied to individual deeds and
   immersed in a processual field that is indifferent to the needs for
   meaning or purpose or satisfaction that individuals bring to what they
   do; and that Arendt's engagement with this problem both complicates the
   relation of action to its supposed opposites, and makes it more
   difficult to conceive of action's recovery as a reliable source of
   theoretical or political redemption.},

   legislative turnover in the context of majoritarian and proportional
   electoral systems. The differing electoral rules and replacement
   procedures for the two chambers of the Australian parliament over more
   than a century permit an analysis of the complex interplay between
   institutional rules, party strategy, and patterns of representation
   between 1901 and 2013. Since 1901, the Australian House of
   Representatives has been committed to single member electoral systems
   and by-elections for filling midterm vacancies, but major changes to
   both the electoral system and midterm replacement rules for the
   Australian Senate have played a critical role in enhancing party control
   of Senate careers.},

Abstract = {Traditionally, Italians have always been considered as strongly
   europhile. However, in the most recent decade, opinion polls and
   Eurobarometer data show that Italy is becoming one of the most
   eurosceptic European Union (EU) countries. This chapter analyzes current
   and past Italian attitudes toward the EU, it investigates correlations
   between the decrease in EU trust and the negative performance of the
   most relevant economic indicators, and it devotes a special focus to the
   Northern League, the `veteran' of Italian eurosceptic parties. By means
   of a description of earlier European Parliament (EP) elections in Italy
   and an analysis of the 2014 party platforms, this chapter shows how-for
   the first time in the history of Italian EP elections-the 2014 EP
   elections in Italy centered around EU issues.},

Abstract = {The article presents the conceptualization of new trends in the
   processes of civic participation both in Russia and abroad, which can be
   considered as sign of a crisis. It is shown that the processes of
   participation in the public sphere are characterized by a blurring of
   the boundaries between social, civic and political participation, the
   growth of the network and individualized forms of participation,
   primarily promotional design and type. In these conditions, relevant is
   the refinement of the essential characteristics of civic participation.
   According to the authors, it can be comprehended as the process through
   which citizens directly or indirectly affect the adoption of socially
   significant decisions affecting the public interest. On the basis of
   analysis of empirical studies, the authors conclude that the development
   of Russian civic practices lies, in general, within the international
   trends. These practices have their own specifics. For instance, they are
   characterized by a redistribution of the centre of gravity from the
   political to the social space, due to the decrease in the efficiency of
   functioning of state and municipal authorities, the persistence of a
   paternalistic strategies, in collaboration with civil society, as well
   as asymmetrical model of dialogue between the state and civil society
   based on the tradition of the monologue, propaganda, manipulation of
   public opinion that sets the civil initiatives clearly specified
   ``track{''}.},

Journal = {WEST EUROPEAN POLITICS},

Volume = {40},

Pages = {378-401},
Abstract = {Recent elections in Europe have shown that a context of increasing
   citizen distrust towards democratic institutions may lead to very high
   levels of electoral volatility and to the emergence of new parties. On
   the other hand, institutional reforms are sometimes presented as a
   solution to citizens' discontent with political institutions. Focusing
   on a specific type of political institution electoral systems the
   question addressed in this study is whether high levels of electoral
   volatility may trigger electoral reforms. The article investigates the
   conditions under which reforms affecting the electoral system's degree
   of openness to new parties were enacted in 25 European countries between
   1945 and 2012. The findings demonstrate that volatility due to the
   emergence of new parties is the most powerful explanation to account for
   the introduction of electoral reforms, particularly those that hinder
   the entry of new parties into the system.},

Abstract = {The first debate in 2008 was a turning point in the presidential
   election campaign: a race that was close before the debate turned
   decisively in Obama's favor following it. This article explores how the
   media reached their verdict that ``Obama won.{''} We examine two aspects
   of this problem: how, in practice, the media reached this verdict and
   whether they made the right decision from a normative standpoint. Based
   on content analysis of debate transcripts, we argue that the media
   interpreted the debate by synthesizing three pre-debate narratives in
   roughly equal proportions. Crucially, two of these narratives favored
   Obama. We also find that the ``Obama won{''} verdict was consistent with
   what we might expect had the debate been judged by a public-spirited
   umpire.},

Title = {Party Gate-Keeping and Women's Appointment to Parliamentary Committees:
   Evidence from the Italian Case},
Journal = {PARLIAMENTARY AFFAIRS},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {70},
Number = {1},
Pages = {62-83},

Abstract = {In this article, we investigate whether and how political parties
   function as gatekeepers in determining gender differentiations in
   committee appointments by using the Italian parliamentary committee
   system from 1994 to 2013 as a case study. Committee membership provides
   individual MPs with direct influence in a specific policy area as well
   as with visibility and expertise, thus affecting MPs' political careers.
   Accordingly, to study women's appointments to committees' positions is
   eventually to say something about women's chances to have an actual
   effect in the political process. After presenting the theoretical
   framework, three hypotheses are proposed. Our findings show that women
   tend to be appointed to committees dealing with stereotypically
   `feminine' and `less prestigious' issues, and that left-wing parties
   reproduce this pattern less than right-wing parties, but not when it
   comes to the appointment to more prestigious and influential positions.
   Moreover, we found that no significant longitudinal trends towards more
   unbiased distributions can be detected. A discussion closes the article.},

Abstract = {This paper offers a basic model of some of the main intersecting causes
   of the early abandonment and school failure of the Gitano or Spanish
   Romani adolescents. It is based on a long-term research in an
   educational community where the presence of Romani students has been
   particularly important. In this research, we studied how professors,
   parents and students experimented, perceived and voiced the processes
   that lead to a marked segregation of schools and of Gitano children in
   school, and how that related to the gradual lag in competences and
   grades of these children compared to the majority of pupils. One
   manifestation of this lag is that Gitano children have to repeat courses
   more often than their non-Gitano partners and become disillusioned and
   alienated from school routines, become older than their fellow students,
   thereby increasing conflicts. The problem becomes more severe during the
   transition from primary to secondary school, which often involves the
   displacement to an unknown and less protective environment, and a more
   demanding curriculum. In high school, Gitano pupils keep failing behind,
   and often become frustrated and discouraged. Around 16 years of age, the
   limit age of compulsory education, most Gitano adolescents abandon
   education for good and quickly become adults in hard but gratifying
   environments where early marriage and labor with kin offers a shortcut
   to adulthood and independence. Satisfying as this could be in the short
   term, it did not bode well for the future independence and the
   sustainable improvement of the living conditions of the Spanish Romani
   minority.},

Abstract = {Retrospective voting is arguably one of the most important mechanisms of
   representative democracy, and whether or not the public holds the
   government accountable for its policy performance has been extensively
   studied. In this paper, we test whether retrospective voting extends to
   parties in the opposition, that is whether and how parties' past
   performance evaluations affect their vote, regardless of whether they
   were in government or in opposition. Taking advantage of a rich set of
   questions embedded in a representative German national elections panel,
   we update our knowledge on the retrospective voting mechanism by
   modeling retrospective voting at the party level. The findings indicate
   that the incumbent status is not the only criterion for retrospective
   voting, ultimately suggesting that both government and opposition
   parties can expect credit and blame for their conduct and this should
   provide some impetus for responsive performance of all parties.},

Abstract = {The German Greens will soon celebrate the 40th anniversary of their
   foundation. It is time to look back and take stock of their achievements
   and failures. As always in the real world of politics, the balance is a
   mixed one. There can be little doubt that the Greens have had a
   considerable impact on the political agenda of Germany and beyond. This
   has influenced the policy output. Whether this counts as success or
   failure is largely a matter of normative conviction. Things are
   different when we look at their attempt to implant a new mode of
   intra-party democracy into the systemic framework of representative
   democracy. Here the record is far more modest. By and large, the Greens
   have adapted their party organization to the dominant model of their
   competitors. This can be explained by theories of party change and the
   institutional constraints of representative democracy.},

Abstract = {This article argues that it is possible to understand the ambiguities of
   European public opinion only if we approach the question in terms of
   how, both at the continental and at the national level, public opinion
   in Europe has been produced through socio-economic and political
   mechanisms, rather than being given by the sum of individual
   preferences. In particular, the paper focuses on how the specific
   conditions of being a citizen, and thus constituting public opinion, are
   produced through the restructuring of national spaces at the continental
   level. Taking as an example the case of the Greek referendum of July, 5,
   2015, on the structural adjustment program proposed by the European
   institutions, the paper argues that the EU is characterized by a process
   of continuous differentiation of the conditions of possibility and of
   the rights of national citizens. Finally, the paper proposes to read
   these transformations through the model, proposed by Nicos Poulantzas,
   of restructuring of the matrix of European statehood.},

Pages = {269-288},
Abstract = {How do post-communist memorial museums in East-Central Europe tell
   stories about double occupation (by Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union),
   collaboration, the Holocaust and victim narratives, and how have these
   narratives been influenced by accession to the European Union? How do
   the museums reference trends set by Holocaust memorial museums? The
   article shows that one group of museums invokes Europe and the
   Europeanization of the Holocaust. Other museums seek to contain certain
   aspects of the memory of Nazism so that it cannot compete with stories
   of Soviet crimes. Both incorporate elements from Holocaust memorial
   museums, indicating how universalized Holocaust remembrance is.},

Journal = {POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {69},
Number = {1},
Pages = {71-86},
Abstract = {Most studies of electoral behaviour in New Zealand do not pay much
   attention to the religious-secular cleavage. While a few studies noted a
   religious-secular cleavage prior to the adoption of proportional
   representation, most have assumed that such a divide since 1996 has been
   confined to the margins of electoral politics, with religious voters
   supporting smaller third parties over National. This article
   re-evaluates this conclusion using data from the New Zealand Election
   Study since 1990. The analyses show that, rather than supporting small
   third parties more clearly representing issues of concern to them,
   religious voters have voted largely for National in most elections as
   part of a religious-secular cleavage between National and Labour.
   Fluctuation in support for National among religious voters is tied to
   National's electoral fortunes: religious voters have been more likely to
   support National when the party has been likely to form the next
   government, but more likely to cast votes for third parties when
   National's prospects have been poor.},

Abstract = {Transparency is seen as an instrument to strengthen the legitimacy of
   the political-administrative system. The adoption of the so-called
   transparency laws, which shall extend the passive right of freedom of
   information to an obligation of active publication, reflects this
   debate. Against this background, the paper will systematize
   theoretically the effects of transparency on the legitimacy of public
   administration and collects empirical findings, which help to estimate
   the probability of these effects. It is shown, that the effects of
   transparency are complex and that the realization of the positive,
   intended effects is attached to conditions, which corresponded with
   empirical findings only to a limited extend.},

Abstract = {Christians in Slovakia constitute approximately 75\% of the population,
   according to the census of 2011. The vast majority are Catholics.
   Despite Slovakia being labelled a `Christian nation,' Slovak believers
   are gradually changing their religious self-identification. Based on
   empirical research conducted via questionnaires, content analysis and
   in-depth interviews in 2013, 2014 and 2015 we clarify the current trends
   in self-perception of the religious identity among Slovak Christians. We
   analyse their attitudes towards specific issues, such as homosexuality,
   referendum on family of 2015, and separation of the Church and State.
   The surprising results of the 2016 general elections, which have changed
   the political map of Slovakia, have also been taken into account. These
   attitudes are examined against the background of the relationship
   between conservatism and liberalism. This can be deemed as an
   antagonistic symbiosis rather than a fruitful dialogue.},

Abstract = {Many people in Russia have difficulty accepting the collapse of the
   Soviet Union. This feeling is also shared by members of the younger
   generation. Their values and norms are almost identical with those of
   their parents and grandparents. In interviews on the significance of
   their family remembrance of the Soviet past, it has emerged that they
   know little about the Revolution and the history of the Soviet Union. In
   almost every family, violence and repression are remembered, but at the
   same time, the Soviet Union is regarded as a country that promised
   progress and a better life. Today, young people complain about the loss
   of prospects for the future. Their recourse to the past satisfies their
   longing for security and stability.},

Pages = {271-298},
Abstract = {Since the late 19th century, the acceptance (or refusal) of
   administrative law has generated considerable controversies in the
   English public law. Judges and scholars have argued extensively about
   the compatibility with the common law of the new public authorities
   established in the wake of the late-Victorian administrative revolution.
   The work of A. V. Dicey is often referred to as the inaugural moment of
   these controversies. This article investigates the premises of the
   ``problem{''} of administrative law as it arises in Dicey, returning to
   an author to whom he constantly refers: Alexis de Tocqueville. It shows
   that, far from being a mere alibi, Tocqueville's thought has dictated
   the way Dicey constructed and gave coherence to the object known as
   ``administrative law{''}. Although he recognized his exaggerations and
   revised his view on administrative law more than once, Dicey has
   remained faithful to the conceptual ``style{''} of Tocqueville, and
   helped introducing this ``style{''} in the English legal scholarship.},

Abstract = {Analyzing the agenda for the Trump administration, the author argues
   that the US today is facing the issue of a large-scale package of
   measures to rescue a significant part of the American people living in
   ``its backyard,{''} through methods at harmonization of the transition
   from traditional industrialism to the ``new economy.{''} According to
   the author, Donald Trump as a true patriot managed to grasp all the weak
   points of the Americans (in contrast to his opponents from the bi-party
   establishment). Trump has quietly encountered the challenge of ``
   distorted globalization,{''} aimed at mainstream `` running ahead{''} in
   the interests of its superpower geopolitics and geo-economics,
   sacrificing once admired American industrial technology. Trump's slogan
   `` Let's make America great again{''} does not call back to decades ago
   (as his enemies attribute to him), but as an appeal for a temporary
   ``pedaling back{''} of ``rushing{''} to a harmonious transition of the
   whole people, not part of it, to the post-industrial phase of
   development. Naturally, the scale of the changes that have conceived
   Trump during the elections and with some minor amendments after his
   victory, is excessively huge, and fierce reaction of the conservative
   American establishment does not inspire optimism. However, in the world
   history, there have been cases when the obstacles to the development of
   capitalism were overcome without violence. If in a fairly short period
   of time, Trump succeeds to implement a substantial part of his reforms
   and to bring their implementation to the no-return point, then it will
   be enough to ensure that the public mood has changed, and the current
   split has been overridden. In this case, Trump will enter the annals of
   American history as a successful president-reformer. Donald Trump is not
   a `` black swan,{''} but a true chance for the United States and for the
   world (including Russia) to work together against the main
   threats-terrorism, and to build a new world order on the principles of
   multipolarity and mutual respect, diversity of free national states.},

Abstract = {Although many countries have ethnic kin on the wrong side of their
   borders, few seek to annex foreign territories on the basis of
   ethnicity. This article examines why some states pursue irredentism,
   whereas others exhibit restraint. It focuses on the triadic structure of
   the kin group in the irredentist state, its coethnic enclave, and the
   host state, and provides new data on all actual and potential
   irredentist cases from 1946 to 2014. The results indicate that
   irredentism is more likely when the kin group is near economic parity
   with other groups in its own state, which results in status
   inconsistency and engenders grievances. It is also more likely in more
   ethnically homogeneous countries with winner-take-all majoritarian
   systems where the kin group does not need to moderate its policy to win
   elections by attracting other groups. These conditions generate both the
   grievance and opportunity for kin groups to pursue irredentism.},

Title = {THEORETICAL AND METHODOLOGICAL ASPECTS OF POLITICAL ELITES'
   INSTITUTIONALIZATION IN THE BALTIC STATES},
Journal = {POLIS-POLITICHESKIYE ISSLEDOVANIYA},
Year = {2017},

Pages = {79-90},
Abstract = {The article deals with theoretical and methodological aspects of elite
   study in the Baltic states on the basis of small states and regional
   studies. The special features of genesis and development of power groups
   in the region are deduced. The problem of theoretical correspondence
   between structural and subject aspects of study of political elite is
   considered. Emphasis is put upon the problem of juncture between
   domestic and foreign policy factors influencing political elite
   decisions. One of the starting points is theory of small states through
   the lens of which the main features of power groups development in the
   Baltic region are investigated. Small size of a state produces high
   dependency of political elites is Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia on
   foreign factors or, using terminology of Joseph Colomer, contemporary
   ``empires{''} which structure transnational space. Special attention is
   paid to the historical factors in the genesis of political elite after
   the Baltic states left the Soviet Union. The article problematizes
   transitology paradigm, which is prevalent in the studies of this period
   in the Baltic states and in Eastern Europe as a whole. Besides the
   imperatives of regime change and transformation towards democratic
   ideals it is important to consider the imperatives of competition
   between power groups for resources in domestic and foreign political
   environment. Few contradictions are emphasized, i.e. the liquidation of
   OSCE missions in Latvia and Estonia, development of institutions of
   memory politics, criminalization of the denial of ``Soviet
   occupation{''}. These are the instances of political elite decision on
   different stages of political regimes genesis in the Baltic states which
   are not fit into the logics of theory of democratization. On the basis
   of these theoretical assumptions various methods of elite studies are
   considered. The article proposes a theoretical framework of
   institutional regionalism which is presumed as more efficient as means
   of power groups studies in the Baltic states.},

   ADMINISTRATION TOWARDS THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION AND OTHER STATES OF THE

Journal = {SRAVNITELNAYA POLITIKA-COMPARATIVE POLITICS},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {8},

Pages = {72-95},
Abstract = {The article is devoted to the analysis of policies of the two latest
   American presidents George W. Bush (2001-2008) and Barack Obama (his
   first administration, 2009-2012) towards Russian Federation and its
   neighbors - states of the CIS. The author in detail considers main
   milestones of this policy, its aims, ways, methods and results. The
   author highlights and analyzes main reasons of degradation of bilateral
   relations during George W. Bush presidency and considers positive
   results of ``Reset{''} policy of first Barack Obama's administration, at
   the same time noting their limitation and maintenance of disagreements
   in a few important problems. Policy of the USA towards Russia and other
   states of the CIS is considered in broader context of fundamental
   attitudes in foreign policy of neoconservative Republican George W.
   Bush' administration and Democratic Barack Obama's administration. The
   author makes the main conclusion that as a whole policy of the Democrats
   towards the Russian Federation and its neighbors was more reasonable,
   flexible and effective and let the United States because of softening of
   rhetoric and a few small compromises return relations with Russia to
   constructive cooperation and get from this country assistance in all key
   areas. But by the end of the first Barack Obama's term a few negative
   trends became obvious, and these trends developed during the second term
   of Obama's presidency. Post-Soviet area has remained potential
   ``battlefield{''} in relations between the two countries, and later this
   fact has led to the crisis in Crimea and Ukraine, which continues
   nowadays.},

Abstract = {This chapter focuses on the performance of eurosceptic parties in the
   European Parliament (EP) elections of 2014 in Central and Eastern Europe
   (CEE). The emphasis is placed on the importance of domestic factors in
   the development of eurosceptic parties. While domestic factors dominate
   both the agenda of the eurosceptic parties and the nature of political
   competition, we observe some common features among the CEE countries.
   The EP elections remain second-order elections, despite having been
   integrated into the domestic electoral cycles. Political parties in CEE
   have successfully adapted to the EP elections and use them
   instrumentally for predominantly domestic purposes. The rise of the
   eurosceptic parties should be seen in the context of continuing trust in
   the European Project and support for European Union (EU) membership.},

Title = {Beyond Inclusion: Critical Race Theory and Participatory Budgeting},
Journal = {NEW POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {39},
Number = {1},
Pages = {126-142},
Abstract = {Critical Race Theory (CRT) researchers maintain that mainstream liberal
   discourses of neutrality and colorblindness inherently reify existing
   patterns of inequality, and that privileging the voices of people of
   color and the marginalized is essential to addressing issues of equity
   and equality. Participatory budgeting (PB) aims, too, to include the
   voices of the marginalized in substantive policy-making. Through a CRT
   lens, I examine the ways in which the New York City PB process has thus
   far worked to simultaneously disrupt and maintain racial hierarchies. I
   pay particular attention to how social constructions of the ``good
   project{''} shape the discourses around community priorities and winning
   projects-especially in the areas of security/policing and education.
   While the New York PB process has successfully reached out to and
   effectively enfranchised traditionally marginalized constituents,
   including communities of color, its current focus on districts and the
   voting phase, alongside limited work on critical praxis, limits the
   extent to which these newly enfranchised constituents can problematize
   larger funding formulas and criteria in public budgets.},

Abstract = {Louis Althusser's critique of Gramsci's ``absolute historicism{''}
   involved the elaboration of a distinctive notion of plural historical
   temporalities or times. This argues, first, that Althusser's theory of
   plural historical temporalities should be understood as integrally
   linked to his critique both of structuralism and of theories of the
   subject. Second, the essay argues that, Althusser's early criticisms
   notwithstanding, Gramsci can be understood to have elaborated a
   consistently nonformalist notion of constitutive temporal plurality,
   particularly with his notion of ``prevision{''} as a method of political
   work. Rather than culminating in a figure of temporal synchronization,
   hegemonic politics should instead be thought as a mode of intervention
   that valorizes rather than negates the ``non-presence of the
   present,{''} or constitutive noncontemporaneity, as the fundamental
   condition of revolutionary politics.},

Abstract = {Political interventions in agricultural markets have significant effects
   on development outcomes. Although dictatorships have been found to
   follow urban-biased policies, which decrease the price of agricultural
   produce, this finding does not fully explain variation in agricultural
   policy across regime type. I argue that policy under autocracy is a
   function of the power of producers and consumers to organize
   collectively and threaten a regime, while democratic governments respond
   to electoral incentives for redistribution. I analyze policy outcomes in
   56 countries between 1963 and 2002 and find that democracies increase
   returns to farmers compared to autocracies. However, autocracies provide
   greater levels of support to farmers when landholding inequality or
   income inequality is high. Urbanization is associated with lower rates
   of assistance to agriculture under dictatorship versus democracy.},

Abstract = {This article investigates the emergence and transformation of a debate
   on ``welcome culture{''}. This concept has developed as part of a wider
   effort by the German government since 2005 to improve perceptions of
   immigration. In autumn 2015, the term entered mainstream public
   discourse when it became a point of reference for political, societal
   and media actors. These groups sought to promote a pro-refugee policy
   for humanitarian or economic reasons, or simply out of pragmatism.
   Eventually, right-wing actors began to dominate the discourse in order
   to undermine the pro-refugee camp and approach. The discussion therefore
   reflects the struggles to define whether Germany and Austria are
   countries of immigration, or should even aspire to this title.},

Abstract = {This article is a study of the musicians who laid claim to the
   aesthetics of free jazz in France and a contribution to the analysis of
   the phenomena of overarching radicalism. While the assignment to
   radicalism of this musical movement by its French commentators was at
   first the result of a complex and delayed transfer and the reception of
   a musical form that appeared in the United States, it also echoed the
   political commitment of musicians in the context of the French ``May{''}
   and the disengagement linked to the ebbing activism of the 70s. Based on
   testimonies and the study of the music and militant press of the time,
   this article attempts to reconstruct a dynamic of radicalization that is
   both original and partially obliterated.},

Abstract = {Several studies suggest that people suffering from ill health or
   disabilities have a lower propensity to vote. Using six rounds of the
   European Social Survey, we examine whether the effect of health or
   functional disabilities on electoral participation is less or more
   pronounced in countries which utilize a wider range of facilitation
   instruments, such as advance or postal voting, proxy voting and voting
   outside the polling stations. Our findings show that with the exception
   of proxy voting, voter facilitation instruments not only have
   insignificant main effects but also a negative interaction effect with
   poor health/functional ability (FA). As a result, voter facilitation
   intensifies the health-related differences but not by activating those
   who are more active to begin with, as suggested in previous studies. The
   endogeneity argument thus seems most warranted explanation for our
   findings: countries with low turnout among people with impaired FA or
   health are more likely to adapt facilitation practices.},

   political ideology},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF POLITICAL IDEOLOGIES},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {22},
Number = {3},
Pages = {285-298},
Abstract = {Theology in four voices represents a fitting methodological model for
   the study of political ideology, given the similarities between
   religions and ideologies as belief systems with ineliminable,
   fundamental beliefs. The formal theological voice is dropped from
   consideration on the grounds that, while the involvement of academic
   theologians in the theology of ordinary believers is entirely
   appropriate, political theorists ought not to be involved in seeking to
   change or refine the ideologies which they research. The normative voice
   - which we refer to as the established voice - consists of texts which
   carry authority within a particular ideology, such as The Communist
   Manifesto in Marxism, or J.S. Mill's On Liberty in liberalism; the
   espoused voice represents that which adherents of an ideology explain
   about what they believe; the operant voice consists of the political
   action taken by the adherents. While there are potential disadvantages
   to this method, there are also potential advantages. Firstly, it enables
   a fuller understanding of an ideology, especially when tensions arise
   between the three voices. Secondly, it allows the researcher to enter at
   any one of three points into a circle leading from pre-understanding to
   understanding. Thirdly and finally, the model presents opportunities to
   combine different methodological approaches into ideological research.},

Abstract = {This paper refutes the view of the Japanese government that the Diaoyu
   Islands have nothing to do with the Treaty of Shimonoseki, and points
   out that ``stealing{''} the Diaoyu Islands was one step in the Japanese
   strategy of the invasion of China in the SinoJapanese War in 1894. Only
   because the Japanese cabinet was fully assured of winning the war did it
   ``steal{''} the Diaoyu Islands before the Treaty of Shimonoseki, and the
   treaty was nothing but a means of legitimating this theft. Large numbers
   of historical documents are cited in this paper to prove that the Diaoyu
   Islands are affiliated islands of Chinese Taiwan. Although Japan annexed
   Ryukyu in 1879, these documents show that the Qing government protested
   immediately, and later on negotiated with Japan concerning Ryukyu.
   According to the Sino-Japanese negotiations over Ryukyu in 1880, the
   Japanese government agreed to give the Miyako and Yaeyama islands back
   to China. Until 1887, Zeng Jize, an official of the Ministry of Foreign
   Affairs of the Qing Dynasty, continued to declare that the Ryukyu issue
   had not been resolved. It was only because China lost the Sino-Japanese
   War of 1894 that the Ryukyu issue fell into abeyance amid the cloud of
   failure. Because the Chinese government subsequently repudiated the
   Treaty of Shimonoseki, and under the terms of the Cairo Declaration, the
   Ryukyu issue should again be back on the table.},

Journal = {POLIS-POLITICHESKIYE ISSLEDOVANIYA},
Year = {2017},

Pages = {186-191},
Abstract = {The Atlas of Russia's modernization, operating with phenomena and
   concepts with unclear boundaries and deep meaning, gives them spatially
   systematized data that form the very idea of the objects under study.
   The authors widely used heuristic approach, which only allows you to
   operate with such hardly predictible processes and trends as
   modernization and its state in the Russian regions and in Russia as a
   whole. More specifically, we are talking about the civilizational
   approach, supplemented and concretized by the results of more than 70
   sociological studies of modernization in almost one third of the
   subjects of the Russian Federation. The authors analyzed the internal
   challenges facing Russia, the answer to which should be modernization.
   For the first time in the study of modern Russian society, the Atlas
   represents modernization as a measurable, comparable and voluminous
   process. The Atlas draws a stage picture of the development of modern
   Russian society - at the exit from the industrial (primary) stage of
   modernization and preparation for entry into the information (secondary)
   stage. At this stage of modernization, the seemingly socio-cultural, but
   in fact - political discord of the modern Russian civilizational process
   will be overcome, and a humanistically oriented way of life for a large
   community of people in the northeastern part of the continent of Eurasia
   is approved, as an illustration of a possible new civilizational project
   for humanity.},

Journal = {POLITICAL BEHAVIOR},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {39},
Number = {4},
Pages = {1019-1041},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The importance of sex and gender to political behavior is reflected in
   the volume of work examining gender gaps in public opinion and partisan
   choice. Despite their centrality, sex and gender are poorly measured in
   survey research. The principal problem is the conflation of gender with
   sex in survey research. Consequently, gender is typically treated as a
   dichotomy, with no response options for androgynous gender identities,
   or indeed degrees of identification with masculine or feminine
   identities. We compare a new measure of genuine gender identification
   with a conventional measure of biological sex to determine whether the
   practice of using sex as a proxy for gender is sound. Sex is a fair
   proxy for gender, but for about a quarter of our sample, it is not.
   Moreover, greater nuance is gained when analyses incorporate a
   finer-grained measure of gender than is possible by using biological sex
   as a substitute. We argue that this is simply the start to an important
   conversation and that more research is needed to ascertain how we might
   best measure ``gender{''} in the future.},

Abstract = {In the case of Turkey, competing foreign policy perspectives have always
   represented a central issue in the ideological clash between Kemalism
   and Islamism, revolving around the definition of Turkey's identity and
   its future in the international arena. This paper analyzes the foreign
   policy writings of two dissimilar figures of Turkey's political Islam,
   namely Necmettin Erbakan and Sezai Karalcoc, both considered central for
   the development of the Islamist ideology in Turkey. This study explores
   their texts and detects similitudes revealing their common connection
   with Turkey's expression of the Pan-Islamist trend that reemerged during
   the Cold War. The analysis of these two authors concludes by pointing
   out the nationalist element characterizing Turkish Islamism -and Turkish
   Pan-Islamism- in comparison with analogous non-Turkish expressions of
   this ideology.},

Abstract = {The ability to amend legislative proposals introduced by the Commission
   is central to legislative process in the European Union. Despite this,
   very few attempts have been made to capture and explain such amendments.
   This study addresses this gap in the literature by considering the
   changes between the Commission's proposals and the final legislative
   outcome passed by the European Union. It does so by implementing minimum
   edit distance algorithms to measure changes between legislative
   proposals and outcomes. The findings suggest that legislative amendments
   are determined by the formal and informal institutional structures in
   which negotiations take place and characteristics of the proposal
   itself. Our conclusions contribute to the ongoing debate on the nature
   and distribution of legislative powers in the European Union.},

Abstract = {Contemporary European studies concur that public pressure and
   responsiveness have become key ingredients of the EU policy arena.
   Nonetheless, there is little known about when and how the elites in
   Brussels articulate public interests in EU policy debates. This article
   bridges this gap by examining the conditions under which political
   elites involved in EU legislative procedures address public interests in
   the news. It is expected that the politicization of EU policy processes
   stimulates elites to articulate public interests. The dataset consists
   of 2164 media statements in six European media outlets on a sample of
   125 legislative proposals (2008-2010). The results demonstrate that
   elites address public interests in the media predominantly when issues
   are publicly salient and attract intensive mobilization by civil society
   groups. Elites stay silent about public interests when policy processes
   are crowded with business lobbyists and are of low salience to European
   citizens.},

Abstract = {The rise of new middle classes over the past decade in Latin America has
   been widely acclaimed, among other reasons because of the role that many
   believe middle classes play in democratic stability. However, the
   vulnerability of the emerging middle class and the increase of social
   protest and mobilizations have dampened the enthusiasm and strengthened
   the desire to consolidate the gains achieved. The present study aims to
   identify whether discontent with the state's performance strengthens or
   weakens satisfaction with democracy. By implementing multi-level and
   regression models with survey data (Latinobarometro 2011) for 18
   countries in the region, we observe that democratic satisfaction is
   mainly influenced by the perception of social fairness and trust in the
   government, but not by self-perception of social class or
   dissatisfaction with public services. We conclude that protests
   expressing dissatisfaction with public services may be expressing the
   strength of the regime and a demand to strengthen it further, not the
   opposite.},

Abstract = {Two anarchist women from the late nineteenth to early twentieth
   centuries, Alexandra David-Neel and Lily Gair Wilkinson, combined their
   politics with radical engagement in walking. In both the literal sense,
   moving their bodies along the earth, and the figurative sense of calling
   on peripatetic tropes to express their ideas, they found walking to be a
   constitutive element of freedom. This paper brings the ideas of
   Whitehead and other process philosophers into conversation with material
   and semiotic dimensions of walking and with anarchist politics. In the
   political lives of Wilkinson and David-Neel, I see struggles to live
   anarchist lives, lives into which one could walk.},

Abstract = {This article proposes a critical discussion of an increasingly
   influential strand of contemporary democratic theory that attempts to
   justify majoritarian institutions on the grounds that they are the most
   adequate ``epistemic{''} means for discovering and implementing an
   objective standard of normative truth. The analysis is divided in two
   parts. In the first I show that the appeal to such epistemic standards
   is unnecessary because it is possible to justify majority rule on the
   ``purely procedural{''} grounds that it is the best way of instantiating
   the values of freedom (as consent) and equality (as impartiality). In
   the second part I suggest that the appeal to epistemic standards is also
   undesirable because it conflicts with three key democratic values:
   autonomy (as self-government), inclusion (as lack of discrimination in
   terms of political competence), and pluralism (as fair representation of
   conflicting interests within the political process).},

Abstract = {This study examines the impact of anger about the economic crisis on
   electoral participation and voting behavior. Previous work on emotions
   has consistently underlined the mobilization potential of anger. The
   economic crisis has generated widespread anger, but political
   disengagement, rather than mobilization, and growing support for
   populist parties have emerged as the dominant effects. This is because
   the impact of anger about the crisis is moderated by political efficacy.
   Among citizens with low efficacy, anger decreased electoral
   participation and fueled support for populist parties. In contrast,
   among citizens with high efficacy, anger promoted participation and
   increased support for mainstream opposition parties. I use the 2005-2010
   British election panel, which allows me to address endogeneity concerns,
   control for pre-crisis engagement and other negative emotions, and
   perform causal mediation analysis. This work contributes to the study of
   emotions and voting behavior; support for populist parties; and the
   political consequences of the crisis. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {Since the passage of No Child Left Behind, public schools have felt
   pressure to emphasize equitable academic outcomes. We investigate
   whether contracts agreed to by school boards and the superintendents
   they employ include academic and equity criteria to judge the
   performance of superintendents. Data come from the universe of 2013-14
   school superintendent contracts in North Carolina. Only nine of the 115
   contracts include academic goals of any kind, and none include
   equity-related criteria. Similarly, the universe of model superintendent
   contracts provided by state school boards associations (N=20) rarely
   mention such criteria. Findings suggest that one reason for the
   relatively static equity and achievement outcomes in American public
   schools since the national introduction of accountability-oriented
   reforms is that local school boards refuse to use academic and equity
   criteria to evaluate superintendents. The political science literature
   on elections and accountability suggests possible explanations.},

Abstract = {How do political identities shape seemingly non-political behaviors,
   such as consumption activity? This paper explores the extent to which
   political divisions impact apolitical behaviors, focusing on the case of
   voluntary donations to charitable organizations. Drawing on recent work
   showing partisans' differing use of ``conspicuous consumption,{''} we
   develop and test expectations as to how charitable activity may differ
   for Democrats and Republicans. Using three national surveys, including
   an original two-wave panel study, we find sizable differences in overall
   giving between partisans, with Republicans giving more to charity on
   average. We show that partisan differences in religiosity, and not
   differences in beliefs about government spending or desires to signal
   economic status, explain partisan gaps in giving. Our findings
   contribute to our understanding about the broader consequences of
   political fragmentation in the United States and provide further
   evidence for the social, as opposed to ideological, roots of political
   identity.},

Abstract = {The European Union's rules on free movement of people and the right to
   cross-border welfare are increasingly contested and have evoked one of
   the most salient debates in EU politics. The assumption that EU
   immigrants pose a net welfare burden' on the host member state has
   sounded loud and wide in recent years. This calls for an empirical test.
   In this article, we examine the fiscal impact of EU immigration on the
   universalistic, tax-financed welfare state of Denmark. We analyse EU
   citizens' contribution to and consumption of welfare benefits between
   2002 and 2013 on the basis of a unique dataset of administrative data,
   consisting of repeated cross sections of 100\% of the EU population
   residing in Denmark. We find that EU immigrants made a significant
   positive net contribution to the Danish welfare state over the long time
   span examined and thus reject the welfare burden' thesis for the crucial
   case of Denmark.},

   directed by Clodomiro Almeyda in 1979 after the internal division. It
   delves into two aspects, on the one hand the roles and character assumed
   by youth militancy in the inner clandestine PS, and on the other hand,
   in the factional phenomenon that develops within ``almeydismo{''}
   itself. All this in a temporary frame until the party unit in 1990.},

Abstract = {This article surveys the quantitative literature in coalition foreign
   policy. Tracing its development back to what we call the `first
   generation studies' in Democratic Peace research, we illustrate that its
   theoretical and methodological foundations distinguish this literature
   from its predecessors. We then overview the existing studies along three
   dimensions: the nature of the dependent variables, the content of the
   key explanatory variables, and the processes that identify and
   systematise the institutional factors that influence coalition foreign
   policy. Our suggestions for future research highlight some of the
   puzzles motivated by the findings of this literature and the promise of
   multi-method designs.},

Abstract = {In reinterrogating core concepts from his 2015 book, The End of
   Representative Politics, Simon Tormey explains the nature of emergent,
   evanescent, and contrarian forms of political practice. He sheds light
   on what is driving the political disruption transpiring now through a
   series of engaging comments from the field on well-known initiatives
   like Occupy, \#15M, and Zapatistas and also lesser-known experiments
   such as the creation of new political parties like Castello en Moviment,
   among others. Post-representative representation, it is argued, is not
   an oxymoron; it, like the term antipolitical politics, is rather a
   provocative concept designed to capture the radically new swarming
   politics underway in countries like Spain, Italy, Greece, Portugal, and
   Iceland. Citizens are tooling up with ICTs, and this has led to resonant
   political movements like \#15M in Spain or Occupy more broadly. Key
   takeaways from this interview include the double-edged nature of
   representation and the fact that new forms of political representation
   are breaking the mould.},

   alongside a UK-wide increase in awareness of the value of the positive

Abstract = {Blame avoidance behavior (BAB) encompasses all kinds of
   integrity-protecting activities by officeholders in the face of
   potentially blame-attracting events. Although considered essential for a
   realistic understanding of politics and policymaking, a general
   understanding of this multi-faceted behavioral phenomenon and its
   implications has been lacking to date. We argue that this is due to the
   lack of careful conceptualization of various forms of BAB. Crucially,
   the difference between anticipatory and reactive forms of BAB is largely
   neglected in the literature. This paper links anticipatory and reactive
   forms of BAB as two consecutive decision situations. It exposes
   dependence relationships between the situations that trigger BAB, the
   rationalities at work, the resources and strategies applied by
   blame-avoiding actors, and the various consequences thereof. The paper
   concludes that anticipatory and reactive BAB are distinct phenomena that
   require specific research approaches to assess their relevance for the
   workings of polities.},

Abstract = {In his recent book The Lockerbie Bombing: The Search for Justice, Kenny
   MacAskill recounts his decision to release Abdelbaset Al-Megrahi, the
   only man convicted of the Lockerbie bombing. Eight years have passed
   since Al-Megrahi's release on compassionate grounds. In the book
   MacAskill ranges far beyond the events in which he was closely involved,
   recounting the bombing itself, the subsequent investigation, trial and
   appeals in an effort to offer a comprehensive account of the Lockerbie
   bombing. In this article I review the book and return to some of the key
   issues raised by MacAskill's decision and the broader context in which
   it was made. I argue that the book sheds little new light on Lockerbie
   and that it falls short in precisely the areas where MacAskill might
   have the most insight to offer. It is a rather bloodless and legalistic
   account that renders the complexities and the shades of grey of
   international politics in black and white. The case will nevertheless
   remain fascinating to scholars of intergovernmental relations in the UK,
   of para-diplomacy, and of international politics.},

Volume = {56},
Number = {4},

Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {This article analyses the mechanisms establishing time consistency of
   constitutions. It explains why shorter and more locked constitutions are
   more likely to be time consistent (change less) and that long
   constitutions are more time inconsistent (change more, despite locking).
   Empirical evidence from all of the democratic countries in the world
   indicates that the length and locking of constitutions are not
   independent criteria, and that their combination leads to less time
   consistency. To address this inter-relationship, a measure of time
   inconsistency (a combination of locking and amendment rate) is developed
   and it is demonstrated that it is connected with the length of
   constitutions. The article shows how time inconsistency is incompatible
   with theories of constitutional amendment culture' not only at the
   theoretical level, but also empirically. Finally, the article proves
   that the empirical finding that the length of constitutions is related
   to lower per capita income and higher corruption are not only in
   agreement with time inconsistency arguments, but this also extends
   beyond OECD countries to all democracies.},

Abstract = {The relationship between the government and chaebols is often considered
   key for South Korea's post-war economic success. However, the political
   and financial liberalisation since the 1980s has reduced the state's
   absolute control of the economy. Its greater market liberalisation and
   outward investment since the 1990s has further tightened the link
   between the economy and the outside world. Korea's more globalised
   economy made the pro-business policies beneficial only for chaebols'
   expansion, instead of promoting economic growth.},

Abstract = {Framing effects are among the most commonly studied type of political
   information that shapes public opinion. We advance research on
   differences in susceptibility to framing effects by exploring whether,
   and how, physiological traits condition responses to messages in the
   political environment. In particular, we propose that the effectiveness
   of a frame depends on how well that frame's argument matches the
   physiological predisposition or ``outlook{''} of the recipient. We
   hypothesize that individuals who possess particular traits (we focus on
   physiological threat sensitivity) are more likely to be persuaded by
   frames that trigger those predispositions. To test this claim, we
   replicate and extend Nelson, Clawson, and Oxley's (1997) landmark
   framing experiment about political tolerance in response to a Ku Klux
   Klan rally. We find that participants high in threat sensitivity are
   more susceptible to frames that invoke physical danger, suggesting that
   physiological predispositions can help explain the influence of framing
   effects.},

Abstract = {The comparative study of subnational units is on the rise. Multilevel
   regression and poststratification (MrP) has become the standard method
   for estimating subnational public opinion. Unfortunately, MrP comes with
   stringent data demands. As a consequence, scholars cannot apply MrP in
   countries without detailed census data, and when such data are
   available, the modeling is restricted to a few variables. This article
   introduces multilevel regression with synthetic poststratification
   (MrsP), which relaxes the data requirement of MrP to marginal
   distributions, substantially increases the prediction precision of the
   method, and extends its use to countries without census data. The
   findings of Monte Carlo, U.S., and Swiss analyses show that, using the
   same predictors, MrsP usually performs in standard applications as well
   as the currently used standard approach, and it is superior when
   additional predictors are modeled. The better performance and the more
   straightforward implementation promise that MrsP will further stimulate
   subnational research.},

Abstract = {Over the past year, a seemingly relentless barrage of Brexit-related
   challenges has besieged the British constitution, which together have
   called into question the legitimacy of the political system. Yet,
   although it is tempting to regard the decision to hold a referendum on
   Britain's membership of the European Union as precipitating an acute
   constitutional crisis, this article argues that political and democratic
   dilemmas arising from Brexit are symptomatic of a wider constitutional
   malaise, the roots of which extend far beyond 23 June 2016. Flowing out
   of this, the article contends that the current crisis is one of
   constitutional myopia', fuelled by decades of incoherent reforms and a
   failure to address adequately democratic disengagement; and that the EU
   referendum and its aftermath have merely exposed the extent to which the
   foundations of the constitution have been eviscerated.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF POLITICS},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {79},
Number = {4},
Pages = {1286-1301},

Abstract = {How do voters attribute blame when policy responsibility is shared?
   While central to accountability, this question is difficult to answer
   because ``who does what{''} is often ambiguous. This article exploits a
   case where policy responsibility is unambiguous: local tax referendums.
   Although presidents have no control over property taxes or the decision
   to raise local rates, I find that voters punish the president's party
   for tax increases enacted via direct democracy. This effect is robust to
   adjusting for population-based measures of the local economy, as well as
   panel and discontinuity designs to account for unobserved factors. The
   effect varies with the magnitude of the tax increase but not with local
   economic performance, suggesting that voters react to the change in
   spending money, as opposed to being ``primed{''} to consider national
   issues. Thus, voters punish officials not only for events that no one
   controls but also for policies that voters themselves enact.},

Abstract = {The wave of attempts at lobbying regulation at national levels in Europe
   over the last decade highlights an increasing interest on the side of
   policy-makers to propose rules for lobbying in the context of a crisis
   of trust in political representatives. However, these initiatives lead
   to a paradox: Public and private actors want to be seen as supporting
   lobbying regulation, yet these same actors often contribute to the
   ineffectiveness and lack of implementation of the regulations. What is
   at stake for these actors when lobbying regulations are drafted and
   negotiated? Based on an interpretive policy analysis of the lobbying
   regulation processes initiated by governments in Poland (2003-2005) and
   the Czech Republic (2011-2013), the article shows how decisions about
   the design of the core policy instruments of lobbying regulations,
   registers of lobbyists and reporting obligations, contribute to shaping
   the institutional framework of state-society relations.},

Abstract = {This article develops an empirical measure of electoral availability,
   i.e., the micro perspective of political competition. As existing
   research conceptualizes political competition mainly as a macro- or
   party-level phenomenon, the micro perspective remains underdeveloped
   and, therefore, an important dimension of political competition, the
   availability of votes, is ignored. We introduce and discuss an
   individualized measure of electoral competition that is based on
   propensities to vote as indicators of the availability of voters to
   different political parties. The theoretical and empirical advantages of
   this measure are discussed: it is not restricted to parties' positions
   but is based on multidimensional party evaluations; it does not only
   focus on actual behavior but instead on the potential behavior of
   voters; the proposed measure takes all (relevant) parties into account
   instead of only including the two largest parties; as a continuous index
   it avoids arbitrary cut-off points; and the resulting individual-level
   results are easily summable to obtain party- and country-level values.
   Finally, correlations with individual, party and party system
   characteristics are discussed.},

Abstract = {The traditionally emergence of differences among people, common and
   perhaps it was natural and it is not usually considered in relations
   between individuals does not seem far-fetched idea origination dispute.
   With the growing human population and the natural growth of business and
   trade transactions between them and the complexity of certain fields of
   these transactions disputes arising from them, more and more widespread
   and sometimes even has been specialized. It went to the point in one of
   the last two centuries, several laws passed by the government to resolve
   the current dispute and with forming the courts for a variety of dispute
   resolution between individuals, many branches of the courts dedicated to
   legal and commercial affairs and handle their disputes. All countries
   dispute arises between individuals were appointed to the courts;
   although this is associated with the severity and weaknesses in
   different countries and legal systems. Some with creates parallel
   institutions for the courts try to reduce congestion in the courts
   claims and others by creating a concentration of executive power in the
   courts were concerned their main effort in resolving disputes before the
   court. Except for the courts in recent centuries in most societies with
   little differences in the shape and nature of the investigation into the
   allegations were established, in the last century, another institution
   for dispute between individuals was created in many countries and within
   their judicial system that was called judgment. This reference formed in
   subsets of international organizations was created to resolve
   international disputes that generally was concerned in the international
   trade disputes between natural or legal persons. This is in a series of
   international law, in the form of legislation and judicial procedures

Title = {Populism and Corporatism in the Middle East and North Africa: a
   Comparative Analysis},
Journal = {CHINESE POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {2},
Number = {3, SI},
Pages = {288-313},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {This paper would first define the concepts of populism and corporatism
   often used to study political systems in Latin America and Europe,
   (specially Southern Europe). The utility and the relevance of the
   concepts for the study of politics in the Middle East and North Africa
   (MENA) regions are delineated. Since our study of populism intends to
   not only shed light on populism as an ideology and movement, but also
   analyze its role as an instrument of incorporation of the newly
   energized masses in the political system and the consolidation of power
   of populist regimes, we believe the two concepts are organically linked
   and complementary and as such are integral to understanding populism not
   only as an opposition movement, but also in shedding light on the
   policies of populist states once in power. By making brief allusions to
   populist movements in other parts of the world, especially, Latin
   America, the commonalities and the differences are dissected. References
   are made to case studies of the Egyptian, Algerian, Libyan and Iranian
   revolutions as popular revolutions guided by a populist ideology and how
   these populist regimes once in power utilized a corporatist strategy to
   govern. These case studies would illuminate the particular political and
   cultural manifestations of Middle Eastern populism and corporatism, thus
   further contributing to our theoretical understanding of comparative
   populism and their application to the MENA political scene. Such broadly
   comparative approach allows us to engage in theoretical observations
   that put the MENA in a larger global context. It also challenges the
   theory of Islamic exceptionalism. In this paper, we first briefly define
   the concepts of populism and corporatism in a comparative perspective.
   Then the relevance and the application of the concepts in understanding
   the broad dynamics of the regional politics will be discussed.},

Title = {The Iskra Group and the ``Leninist model{''} of Party Organization: A

Abstract = {In March 1902, Lenin published a book entitled What Is to Be Done?
   Burning Questions of Our Movement, proposing a model of party
   organization for the nascent Russian social democratic movement, which
   had to be organized nationally. The book has historically raised a
   number of questions, of which the most important are: Was Lenin
   proposing a new model of party organization (.a ``cadre party{''} as
   opposed to a ``mass party{''}) or simply adapting the example of the
   Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD, the backbone of the Second
   International) to the conditions of Russian autocracy and to the
   factional struggle against the ``economists{''}, the Jewish Bund and a
   series of local organizations? Did that model of party organization
   represent an individual initiative of Lenin, or was it the joint project
   of the group that published the newspaper Iskra (Spark), which had been
   appearing since the first of December 1900 and which would organize the
   Second Congress of the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party (RSDLP) in
   July-August 1903? Finally, what was the connection between the model of
   party organization proposed in Lenin's book and the subsequent split
   between Bolsheviks and Mensheviks at the Second Congress of the RSDLP?
   In this article we will try to answer these questions in the light of a
   number of primary documents recently translated from Russian as well as
   of the criticism by Vera Zasulich, one of the most prominent
   representatives of the Iskra editorial board, of the tactics of
   individual terrorism employed by the newly created Russian Socialist
   Revolutionary Party, a criticism published in the theoretical organ of
   the German Social Democracy, Die neue Zeit, in December 1902.},

Abstract = {At 50\% of the global workforce, informal workers constitute a large,
   diffuse, and resource-poor group with high barriers to collective
   action. Contrary to scholars' expectations, informal workers organize to
   varying degrees in most countries, and states often encourage them to do
   so. Why do some informal workers organize while others do not? I argue
   that states can intervene in informal workers' collective action
   decisions: As enforcement costs increase, states may pay informal
   workers to organize, and then bargain with the resulting organization
   over self-regulation. I present a game theoretic model of state
   intervention in collective action and illustrate it with original

Abstract = {In the Danish case, school segregation is recognized as a crisis of
   society, but it is also a crisis in the deeper sense that central actors
   disagree about in what sense it is a crisis. This raises the general
   questions: In what sense is school segregation a problem? What exactly
   is the crisis? Though these are partly normative questions, in
   Scandinavian contexts we can interpret them in light of the internal
   value-commitments of society. Accepting this premise allows us to build
   on the empirically informed and philosophically rigorous work of
   Elizabeth Anderson according to which segregation should be viewed in
   light of the imperative of social integration. The demand for citizens'
   equal participation in the main institutions of society is, according to
   her, already entailed immanently if a society is broadly commitment to
   democracy. Finding this immanent democratic approach to be insufficient
   considering widespread concerns with respecting parental freedom, this
   article discusses the more value-integrative approach found in the
   political philosophical work of Hegel. According to this approach, our
   value-commitments to both social integration and individual freedom can
   be integrated if central public institutions reflect a complex structure
   of recognition. On the basis of both of these two steps, the article
   suggests ways of understanding and tackling the crisis of school
   segregation in a Scandinavian setting.},

Abstract = {This article interprets German national identity discourses through the
   lens of soccer. Germany's four World Cup championships came in a roughly
   20-year rhythm and happened at critical moments and turning points in
   its post-World War II history. Looking at the four World Cup wins in
   1954, 1974, 1990, and 2014 allows one to trace changes in German
   national identity that were reflected in the winning teams themselves as
   well as in the relationship of the celebrating public to the team and
   the country. International soccer events offer an opportunity to discern
   continuities and discontinuities in German national identity discourses.
   This article contributes to the literature by providing a comparative
   interpretation across six decades of soccer/national identity
   discourses. In such a comparative perspective, it becomes easier to see
   the changes and continuities that have characterized these discourses.},

Journal = {PARTY POLITICS},

Volume = {23},

Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {The micro-foundations of party unity are still an understudied topic in
   comparative politics. This article explores the effects of political
   ambition on party loyalty in Members of the Chamber of Deputies' (MCDs)
   claimed votes based on attitudinal data. Ambition theory posits that
   ambitious politicians should act according to the (s)electorate they are
   aiming to win for the next election, therefore acting prospectively in
   their legislative votes. Findings suggest that MCDs seeking office in
   the national executive branch are more likely to follow the party line
   and less likely to side with their district or vote inconsistently.
   While inclusiveness of candidate selection procedures alone does not
   have an effect, its interaction with differing ambitions does. The
   results provide us with a first systematic analysis of ambition and its
   effect on party loyalty in 14 countries by examining the individual MCD
   more closely.},

Abstract = {This work examines Russia's security narratives on Islam. Using a social
   constructivist framework and employing securitization theory, this paper
   attempts to assess the three primary sources of these narratives. I
   argue that the historiography of the Golden Horde rule over the Slavic
   principalities in 14th century, the mandated Islamic religious
   institutions and the Western influence constitute the primary sources of
   Russia's security narratives on Islam. By employing examples from the
   past and today, I demonstrate that these narratives have the potential
   to be utilized to politicize or securitize a portion of Muslims or Islam
   in Russia.},

Abstract = {In the last decades, municipal mergers have been one major element of
   local government reforms in Switzerland and beyond. In this article, we
   describe and analyze the political effects of this development. We use a
   quasi-experimental setting to test the impact of municipal mergers on
   electoral participation. We find that in merged municipalities, the
   decrease in turnout is significantly stronger than in non-merged
   municipalities. Further, the effect is more pronounced in relatively
   small localities. There is a temporal dimension to this effect-that is,
   turnout drops mainly in the first election after the first merger, but
   not so much after the second or third merger. Hence, the study provides
   a skeptical yet differentiated perspective on the democratic
   consequences of municipal mergers and points to further research avenues
   to develop a more comprehensive understanding of local government
   consolidation.},

Abstract = {Americans are turning to the Internet to learn about politics in greater
   and greater numbers. Under the current ``Web 2.0{''} paradigm in which
   users are encouraged to interact with online content, voters
   encountering political information on the Internet are typically exposed
   to more than just the news; online information is often colored by the
   reactions of previous readers, whether in the form of displayed comments
   or in readily apparent tallies of the number of ``likes{''} or
   ``shares{''} a particular item has received. In this paper we consider
   the effect these social cues have on online political information search
   and evaluation. Using processing-tracing software to monitor the
   patterns of information search and evaluation among our subjects, we
   find that social cues can function as a heuristic, allowing voters to
   reach judgments similar to those of their more informed counterparts.
   However, we also find that negative cues can adversely influence
   candidate evaluation, making subjects less disposed to a candidate than
   they would be in the absence of such signals.},

Abstract = {This article addresses the relationship between the salience of
   anti-elite/establishment rhetoric for political parties and party
   positions on European integration. Anti-establishment rhetoric is a
   feature of populism, which is increasingly influential in contemporary
   European politics. For populist parties across the continent, in several
   ways the European Union (EU) represents the pinnacle of elitedriven,
   establishment-based politics. Previous research has demonstrated that
   party EU positions are systematically related to their positions on the
   left-right ideological scale but that this varies from Western to
   Eastern Europe. Here, we show that parties that place more emphasis on
   anti-elite/establishment rhetoric are more likely to oppose European
   integration, and that this holds across the East/West geographical
   divide and controlling for a variety of other party characteristics.},

Abstract = {This article provides a genealogy of the broad patterns of belief that
   contributed to the democratic reforms contained in the Treaty of Lisbon.
   Based on an analysis of European Union documents, the article draws
   three primary conclusions. First, EU democracy is a composite of
   concepts. This is due to the fact that the institutions which had
   primary responsibility for negotiating treaty changes-the European
   Council, the European Parliament and the European Commission-drew on
   distinct ``governance traditions'' in formulating their reform
   proposals. Second, our understanding of which changes introduced by the
   Lisbon Treaty were intended to be democracy-enhancing should be
   significantly broadened. This becomes evident once it is understood how
   certain reforms are connected to the three institutions' wider webs of
   belief. Third, two factors explain continuing limitations on the
   democratic character of the Union: conflicts over what democracy should
   mean in the context of the EU and the purpose or motivation behind the
   Lisbon Treaty reforms, what is labeled here a ``system maintenance''
   view of democracy. In addition to these substantive contributions to the
   study of the EU and democracy, the article also outlines the main
   analytical components of a genealogical approach.},

Abstract = {This article provides a comparative and longitudinal analysis of the
   policy selection methods adopted by Northern Ireland's five main
   parties. Drawing on data from multiple sources, it sheds light on an
   important element of intra-party democracy and party organisation in the
   region. Accounting for instances of reform, this article reveals the
   extent to which the parties have altered their procedures following the
   introduction of devolved power-sharing in 1998. Policy development is
   revealed to be primarily top-down in nature, with a clear
   professionalisation of the process in recent times. In a concurrent
   development, parties have also adopted a more proactive and, typically,
   consultative approach to policy development, affording ordinary members
   greater opportunities to register their views. However, such
   consultation also privileges several actors outside the parties'
   boundaries, a finding which raises questions concerning both their
   organisational integrity and the nature and meaning of conventional
   party membership in Northern Ireland.},

Title = {On the mismeasurement of sincere and strategic voting in mixed-member
   electoral systems},
Journal = {ELECTORAL STUDIES},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {48},
Pages = {19-29},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Under mixed systems, voters cast two votes to elect the same legislative
   body: one vote for parties using proportional rules and one for
   candidates using majoritarian rules. Voters are said to cast straight
   -tickets if the candidate they vote for is of the same party as their
   proportional vote; otherwise, they are said to cast split -tickets.
   Split-ticket voting is commonly used as a measure of strategic voting as
   splitters are usually assumed to express their true preference in one
   vote but vote strategically in the other. This study challenges this
   practice showing that split-ticket voting does not necessarily indicate
   strategic voting, just as straight-ticket voting does not necessarily
   indicate a sincere vote. This result has wider consequences as it
   indicates that measuring strategic voting from observed behaviour can
   result in incorrect conclusions about vote choice. (C) 2017 Elsevier

   situations},
Journal = {CONFLICT STUDIES QUARTERLY},
Year = {2017},
Number = {20},
Pages = {20-33},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {This paper explores the character of Truth and Reconciliation
   Commissions (TRC) in South Africa and the gacaca courts in Rwanda in a
   bid to understand how indigenous values emphasised within some of the
   different indigenous African cultures like Ubuntu (a quality that
   includes the essential human virtues - compassion and humanity) in South
   Africa accounted for the success of these institutions in these
   countries. What seems to be invariably missing in the other experiments
   of TRC across the continent is the lack of cultural considerations in
   their construct which this article argues that it accounted for their
   failure. While post conflict reconciliation remains relevant, as
   communities move from war to peace and from repression to democracy and
   vice versa by healing relationships and social structures, many of the
   experiences with TRC, especially in non-Western contexts have ended up
   not being able to promote peace through genuine social repairs. In cases
   like Liberia and Ivory Coast, among many others, these institutions have
   been criticised as sidelining indigenous cultural values to yield the
   desired transformative effect. While much has been documented about the
   relative strengths of tribunals and TRCs, one area that has received
   little attention is the religious and cultural relevance of these
   institutions. There seems to be inadequate space created for cultural
   and religious traditions within these liberal mechanisms of peace
   building. While relying solely on secondary data in the conduct of this
   research, we argue that the present peace approaches in Africa have not
   adequately considered the cultural factors of the continent in their
   formation. Even within the advent of modernity and globalisation,
   traditional systems and their values could still be negotiated within
   the new status quo ante without losing its value. Their strength resides
   in the fact that they are not created solely by laws, but are generated
   by the respective communities.},

Abstract = {In the 20th century we witnessed a continuous revision of the
   epistemological and methodological presuppositions of historiographic
   work. Strong upheavals underwent positivist, very traditionalist and
   reductionist visions in approaches, opening new perspectives on sources,
   thematic, personalities, events, historical times, objectivity, scales.
   It was problematized as to its scope, legitimacy, interdisciplinary
   dialogue, the structures that are linked in its becoming, the synthetic
   quality. Change that has led to an approach to the subaltern, the lower,
   the microhistorical, the everyday, to the contemporary experience from
   the perspective of memory and the lived of the voiceless. International
   migration as a social phenomenon affecting large sectors of society has
   been favored by this historiographical renewal. Our goal is to make a
   preliminary theoretical approach to history as a science and
   contemporary international migration, and in particular that of
   Mexico-United States.},

Abstract = {Recent attacks against critical infrastructures have shown that it is
   possible to take down an entire infrastructure by targeting only a few
   of its components. To prevent or minimize the effects of this kind of
   attacks, it is necessary to identify these critical components whose
   disruption, damage or destruction can lead to the paralysis of an
   infrastructure. This paper shows that the identification of critical
   components can be made thanks to a particular pattern of the graph
   theory: the vertex cover. To illustrate how the vertex cover can be
   useful for the identification of critical components, the electrical
   power transmission and distribution system of the United States is used
   as an example. It is shown how it is possible to build an attack
   scenario against an infrastructure with the results of a vertex cover
   algorithm.},

Abstract = {For the bargaining model of war, in the absence of incomplete
   information and commitment problems, war is irrational. But this finding
   rests on a simple and rarely discussed assumption, that bargaining is
   between exactly two participants. When we relax this assumption, in a
   three-player bargaining game, war is an equilibrium. Thus, a key finding
   of the bargaining model, that there is always an agreement that all
   states prefer war, is an artifact of dyadic analysis. By removing this
   limitation, we can find new factors that affect the risk of war: the
   number of actors, divergence in state preferences, alliance dynamics,
   and the issue being bargained over.},

Abstract = {The transition of the warfare mentality from the conventional domains of
   engagement (air, land, maritime, and space) to the cyberspace domain has
   not been an easy one for established organizations and institutions. The
   battlefield, in which now speed and stealth instead of size and budget
   are the determining factors that provide an edge have not well for many,
   especially those in the military. Now they do not clearly dictate who
   amongst combatants have the `upper hand' and represent a significant
   paradigm shift from factors that were very good predictors of a
   potential outcome of military conflicts. The battles of the past were
   largely over territories and resources (Landscape Metrics, 2015). We see
   outcomes now being influenced by a broader range of factors, including
   politics, culture, economy, religion, and ethnicity. These new `pivot
   points' for conflict require a very different understanding and approach
   to achieve desired outcomes. Technology continues to be the main enabler
   that has transformed the battlefield and the rules of engagement from
   the conventional domains to cyberspace. The issue of attribution has
   been a huge differentiator and looms very large in cyberspace conflicts
   because it is very difficult to determine within a sufficient timeframe
   the source of an attack and to be able to respond to or prevent attacks.
   Now conflicts have expanded in such a way that combatants now cross all
   prospective levels of society from targets to attackers or perpetrators.
   The low cost required to provide significant damage to a desired target
   environment in cyberspace has been a game changer. As a result, the
   rules of engagement which were much clearer in conventional domains on
   military fronts are much more blurred due to the new realm of
   combatants, and as such, has changed many of the approaches and
   methodologies that were standard practices in traditional campaigns. In
   this paper, we focus on cyber conflicts and how the cultural differences
   of these three communities have plagued the ability to achieve a simple
   and coherent response against attackers and perpetrators. We pursue the
   relevance of trust and deterrence and their influence on `warfare'
   tactics in the cyberspace domain. We also look at culture and the `new
   norm' and how they have required consideration of new and unconventional
   approaches. We see how data can better inform decision makers and those
   responsible for designing and implementing campaigns in this new era of
   conflict. Our results indicate the need for a different model to work
   through the differences in culture if better are to be obtained by the
   combatants. In addition, we see that an approach that includes cyber
   deterrence framed in the context of active defense provides optimism on
   future outcomes.},

Abstract = {Many studies have deduced subterranean dialogues between Hannah Arendt
   and Carl Schmitt from indirect evidence. This article uses new evidence
   from marginalia in Arendt's copy of Nomos of the Earth and finds that
   she formed, but never published, an incisive critique of Schmitt's
   geopolitics. Through an analysis of Arendt's comments on the topics of
   soil, conquest, and contract, I show that Arendt deemed Schmitt's theory
   to be imperialist and in contradiction with itself. Her reading of
   Schmitt prompts important new questions regarding the scholarly use of
   Schmitt's conception of nomos as a tool of critique against American
   empire in the post-9/ I I era. The marginalia also suggests, against
   past scholarship, that Arendt thought justice should play a central role
   in politics. I propose that we look to Arendt's own conception of nomos,
   which she developed later, in order to form an alternative geopolitics.
   Because of her focus on intersubjective world-building, Arendt's nomos
   embraces contract and promise-making, and thus provides the foundation
   for a theory of geopolitics and law that is as necessarily democratic as
   Schmitt's is violent.},

Abstract = {Most economic models of election outcomes make two assumptions: voters
   look at the aggregate economy, and they compare the state of the economy
   with some fixed reference. We argue that the increase in economic
   inequality and slowing of overall growth suggest these assumptions
   should no longer hold. We propose a theory that allows voters to take
   into account the distribution of economic growth, and we reconsider
   different decision rules voters could use to evaluate the incumbent.
   Analyzing presidential elections from 1952 through 2012, we show that
   models using the economic performance of individual income quintiles are
   indistinguishable in overall fit from models using aggregate income to
   predict election results, but can produce different predictions given
   different distributions of growth. And we show that voters do not appear
   to explicitly compare economic performance of the incumbent with the
   out-party, suggesting they have reneged on their role as rational gods
   of vengeance.},

Abstract = {This article explores how the recent political discourse in Spain is
   problematizing motherhood and is producing ``mothers{''} as political
   subjects. More in particular, the article is concerned about how public
   policies are involved in the production of differentiated spaces of
   bodily vulnerability. To do so, it analyses the policy discourse in two
   different areas: on the one hand, the regulation of sexual and
   reproductive rights and specifically abortion, paying special attention
   to the latest legislative reforms; on the other hand, on the regulation
   of differentiated access to assisted reproduction techniques in public
   health services especially since the 2014 reforms. By doing so, this
   article aims at contributing to post-structural policy analysis
   literature, providing a deep insight into the effects of political
   discourse both on the distribution of social and bodily vulnerability
   and the production of gendered subjectivity.},

Abstract = {In Italy the law 190/2012, with subsequent modifications, includes
   preventive and repressive measures against corruption and illegality in
   public administration. These measures, implemented according to a
   multidisciplinary approach, responding to the need for transparency and
   adjustment of Italian law to European and international standards. It
   should be noted that regulatory action of this kind need a reasonable
   period of time, so that, through constant and progressive analysis of
   the concrete and effective application, can be evaluated the beneficial
   effects for the social system.
   This work, without being exhaustive, aims to analyze the criminological
   aspects of corruptive phenomena and its systemic nature, comparing
   national statistics with the results of some international polls.},

Abstract = {A growing social science literature has used Twitter and Facebook to
   study political and social phenomena including for election forecasting
   and tracking political conversations. This research note uses a
   nationally representative probability sample of the British population
   to examine how Twitter and Facebook users differ from the general
   population in terms of demographics, political attitudes and political
   behaviour. We find that Twitter and Facebook users differ substantially
   from the general population on many politically relevant dimensions
   including vote choice, turnout, age, gender, and education. On average
   social media users are younger and better educated than non-users, and
   they are more liberal and pay more attention to politics. Despite paying
   more attention to politics, social media users are less likely to vote
   than non-users, but they are more likely to support the left leaning
   Labour Party when they do vote. However, we show that these apparent
   differences mostly arise due to the demographic composition of social
   media users. After controlling for age, gender, and education, no
   statistically significant differences arise between social media users
   and non-users on political attention, values or political behaviour.},

Abstract = {Political candidates in multi-member district proportional systems use
   different campaign strategies. Scholars have studied why some candidates
   focus on the party and run a party-centered campaign, while others
   highlight their own personal profile and merits by running personalized
   campaigns. However, it remains unclear how these different strategies
   influence the electoral success of candidates, especially in the context
   of proportional flexible list systems. To answer this question, we asked
   Belgian candidates to map out their campaign strategy and linked this to
   their election results. We find that especially investing personal money
   is an important predictor of success. Moreover, we find that candidates
   who aim to attract attention for themselves rather than the party also
   score better, but this effect is contingent on a candidate's resources,
   list position, and political party.},

Abstract = {The belief that people are generally fair and trustworthy has generated
   plenty of scholarly attention in recent decades, particularly in the
   Scandinavian countries, which are often known for high levels of social
   trust. This article draws attention to the current discussion in the
   literature on whether social trust is a stable cultural trait marked by
   persistence or is based on experiences and subject to change throughout
   life. Based on unique longitudinal data from five different cohorts of
   young people in Sweden, ranging in age from 13 to 28 years, this article
   provides an empirical contribution on how social trust develops over
   time. The results show that there is a greater degree of instability in
   social trust between 13 and 15 years of age than in other age groups,
   and that social trust appears to stabilize with age. Findings also
   indicate that there are substantial inter-individual differences in
   social trust among young people within the same age group, both in
   initial levels and in the rates of change over time. The article
   concludes that although social trust is relatively stable it tends to
   crystallize in early adulthood, highlighting the relevance of the
   impressionable-years hypothesis.},

Abstract = {This article examines the nationalization of electoral change in
   presidential elections. It presents a technique to measure the national
   electoral swing and the subnational deviation in the electoral swing for
   each major presidential contender, for each consecutive pair of
   elections. The national swing indicates the uniform shift across
   electoral districts, whereas the subnational deviation indicates the
   extent of new district-level variation for any particular election. In
   addition, the nationalization score reveals the relative magnitude of
   the national and subnational components of district-level electoral
   change, which has the advantage of allowing comparisons across
   countries, parties, and elections. The article analyzes relative
   nationalization scores for all major candidates in 74 presidential
   elections from 14 countries in the Americas, and for electoral change
   that occurs between first and second round contests in majority run-off
   presidential elections. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {In the 2011 Irish general election, held in the midst of the economic
   crisis, electoral reform was catapulted to the top of the agenda, with
   all of the political parties including proposals for electoral reform in
   their manifestos. The matter was subsequently given to the Irish
   Constitutional Convention to discuss. The Convention recommended keeping
   a modified version of the existing single transferable vote electoral
   system. This article reviews the Irish debate, showing how for the most
   part the impetus for electoral reform came from the party leaderships.
   By contrast, mass public opinion on the issue was at best equivocal. A
   curious feature of the Irish debate was how arguably it was
   strategically misdirected, at least on the part of the mainstream
   parties: the reforms being promoted by the elite were more likely to
   have weakened the position of the established elite than to have
   strengthened it.},

Abstract = {On the eve of the twentieth anniversary of the handover, Hong Kong's
   transition towards a full democracy remains unsettled. Drawing upon the
   contemporary theories of hybrid regimes, this article argues that
   manipulations adopted by electoral authoritarian governments have become
   increasingly common in Hong Kong today. As Hong Kong's elections,
   opposition activities, and media have been increasingly put under
   electoral authoritarian-style manipulations, the city-state is now
   situated in the political grey zone in-between liberal authoritarianism
   and electoral authoritarianism and its transition into a full democracy
   remains nowhere in sight. The case study of Hong Kong will help enrich
   the existing comparative literature on hybrid regimes by developing a
   new in-between category and offering an interesting case of
   democratization of sub-national polity.},

Abstract = {The Macedonian filmmaker Milco Mancevski is adamant that there is no
   such thing as Balkan cinema and he is not ``a Balkan filmmaker{''}. He
   has repeatedly stated that his films are about people and not place, and
   insists that it is a fundamental mistake to read a film that is from
   somewhere as necessarily about somewhere. In this paper I argue, to the
   contrary, that Mancevski's films are deeply rooted in a specific
   geopolitical space. Mancevski's films range across genre, time and
   place, their experimental form disrupts narrative conventions and
   presents the past as discontinuous and open. The films engage in
   complicated and often indirect ways with our relationship to the past
   and how the past can be represented. Mancevski's films, I contend,
   struggle with the ``founding trauma{''} of national identity, that is to
   say, with the creation of the modern Macedonian state out of the ruins
   of the Ottoman Empire at the beginning of the twentieth century and more
   recently the expulsion of the Slavic population from Northern Greece
   after the end of the Second World War. Furthermore, his films deploy
   elements of a national imaginary to construct a unique ``timeless{''}
   and ``mythical{''} Macedonian national identity.},

Abstract = {This paper aims to contribute to discussions around alliances and
   collaborations between feminisms. It analyses relations between
   movements in the development of indigenous women's organizational
   autonomy in Mexico. It seeks to understand how the struggle for autonomy
   involved a redefinition of the forms of collaboration by indigenous
   women in the consolidation of their movement. An intersectional
   perspective is proposed to better understand how power relations affect
   the organizing processes of social movements, as well as how
   organizations and individuals respond to and challenge them. I argue
   here that the redefinition of collaborations and alliances has been a
   key determinant in the organizing capacity of indigenous women to
   position themselves as autonomous political actors. From the analysis of
   two specific cases, this paper poses broader questions regarding
   representation and autonomy that may be applied towards a reflection of
   our feminist practices and discourses of solidarity.},

Abstract = {China has long represented a puzzle for scholars of democracy, who view
   political trust as an important indicator of regime legitimacy. Previous
   studies show that while democracies around the world experienced
   declining levels of political trust, the authoritarian Chinese
   government maintained unexpectedly high levels of trust. Using World
   Value Survey (WVS) data over a critical 12-year period (2001-2012) and
   multilevel modeling techniques, we explore both macro-and
   individual-level determinants of political trust in China. We find that
   province-level economic performance and individual-level income combine
   to influence political trust. Higher levels of individual-level income
   have a positive effect on trust in more developed provinces but an
   opposite effect in less developed provinces. Furthermore, individuals
   living in provinces with higher levels of inequality and openness tend
   to be less trusting of government. Our study offers critical insights
   not only for political trust in China but also the country's political
   future.},

Abstract = {We present a formal model of party competition to explain differences in
   party ideological ambiguity. Existing works generally argue that parties
   are more or less ambiguous depending on whether their supporters are
   risk-acceptant or risk-averse. Our model explores more fully strategic
   choice of ambiguity by considering nonelectoral benefits to
   ambiguitythat is, party elite recruitment and retention. In terms of
   costs, we assume that all voters are risk-averse, who therefore prefer
   less ideological ambiguity. Explicitly considering both costs and
   benefits derives our hypotheses and highlights the importance of party
   competitionambiguity is influenced by the proximity to a party's closest
   ideological competitor. An empirical analysis of twenty-eight European
   countries supports our hypotheses.},

Abstract = {Over the past five years transgender children and their parents have
   emerged as visible actors in public discussions about the rights of
   transgender people in Canada. In this article, I track the work of
   emotions in parent advocacy, showing how the enactment of filial
   (family) ties sheds new light on the gendered relationship between
   intimacy and political practice. I argue that an affective shift in
   parenting has opened up space for some cisgender parents to emerge as
   political actors in trans advocacy work. The affective politics of
   parent advocacy nonetheless operates through dominant frames of
   gendered, classed and racialized normativity, limiting both who can
   become a parent advocate and potentially narrowing the focus of the
   struggle. ResumeAu cours des cinq dernieres annees, les enfants
   transgenres et leurs parents sont apparus comme des acteurs visibles
   dans les debats publics sur les droits des personnes transgenres au
   Canada. Dans cet article, je retrace le travail emotionnel que comporte
   la sensibilisation parentale en montrant comment le resserrement des
   liens filiaux (familiaux) apporte un eclairage nouveau sur la relation
   genree entre intimite et pratique politique. Je soutiens qu'une
   evolution de la parentalite a ouvert un espace permettant a un nombre de
   parents cisgenres de s'affirmer comme des acteurs politiques dans le
   travail de sensibilisation trans'. La politique affective de la
   sensibilisation parentale fonctionne neanmoins au travers de modeles
   dominants de normativite de genre, de classe et de race, limitant a la
   fois le nombre de ceux qui peuvent se porter a la defense des parents et
   retrecissant potentiellement l'objet du combat.},

Abstract = {Previous scholarship argues that House members' partisan relationship to
   the president is among the most important determinants of the share of
   federal dollars they bring home to their constituents. Do presidential
   politics also shape distributive outcomes in the Senate? Analyzing the
   allocation of more than \$8.5 trillion of federal grants across the
   states from 1984 to 2008, we show that presidential copartisan senators
   are more successful than opposition party members in securing federal
   dollars for their home states. Moreover, presidents appear to target
   grants ex post to states that gain presidential copartisans in recent

Abstract = {This article uses the concept of high culture to assess the underlying
   assumptions and philosophy of Scotland's Curriculum for Excellence
   (CfE). For the most part, these remain vague and unarticulated. This has
   two consequences. First, a consensus forms easily around CfE because it
   means different things to different stakeholders and is presented to
   teachers as a depoliticised and technocratic policy response. Second,
   because its core tenets are so hazy, it is extremely difficult to argue
   against. Although CfE is widely regarded to have at its heart some form
   of constructivism, the justification for such an approach is never
   articulated. By assessing CfE's relationship with high culture, this
   article attempts to flush out its implicit core assumptions. Its central
   argument is that CfE cannot simultaneously please everyone. Perfectly
   justifiable alternative curricular paths have been abandoned. Far from
   being a technocratic and depoliticised policy response, CfE is in fact a
   much more controversial and ideological shift than the level of scrutiny
   it has thus far received would suggest.},

Abstract = {In this short but critical appreciation of Keith Dowding's seminal
   Philosophy and Methods in Political Science I reflect on the distinctive
   treatment of both realism and explanation in contemporary political
   science that its author offers, expressing rather more sympathy for the
   former than the latter. I welcome his critique of the use and misuse of
   isms' in much of the existing literature, while pointing to some
   potential inconsistencies; I accept his broad and inclusive
   understanding of philosophic realism; and I praise Dowding for putting
   the question of explanation - and its adequacy - at the heart of the
   philosophy of political science (where I think it belongs). Yet I reject
   the idea that prediction is, or indeed, should be central to all social
   scientific explanation. Similarly, I take issue with the contention that
   we are typically distracted by questions of causation, suggesting that
   the presentation of a credibly causal' narrative is the crux of
   adjudicating good from bad explanation. I explore the implications of
   such a position and conclude with comments on Dowding's call for the
   reproducibility and transparency of data.},

Journal = {POLITICAL STUDIES REVIEW},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {15},
Number = {2},
Pages = {243-254},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Blame avoidance behaviour (BAB) has become an increasingly popular topic
   in political science. However, the preconditions of BAB, its presence
   and consequences in various areas and in different political systems
   largely remain a black box. In order to generate a better understanding
   of BAB and its importance for the workings of democratic political
   systems, the scattered literature on BAB needs to be assessed and
   structured. This article offers a comprehensive review of the literature
   on blame avoidance. It departs from Weaver's concept of blame avoidance
   and subsequently differentiates between work on BAB in comparative
   welfare state research and work on BAB in public policy and
   administration. It is argued that between these two strands of
   literature a bifurcation exists since both perspectives rarely draw on
   each other to create a more general understanding of BAB. Advantages
   from existing approaches must be combined to assess the phenomenon of
   blame avoidance in a more comprehensive way.},

Abstract = {This study illuminates Xenophon's teaching about the underlying
   psychological motives of the most fully developed political ambition. An
   analysis of what the Cyropaedia portrays as the interplay among Cyrus's
   spiritedness, justice, benevolence, piety, and cultivation of an aura of
   divinity leads to an unveiling of supreme ambition's deepest root: not
   the desire for power as such, nor the love of justice, but the desire to
   be a quasi-divine benefactor. The article traces the development of this
   ambition from its earliest manifestations in the young Cyrus's puppylike
   spiritedness, through his hope-filled rise to power, to his grim mature
   rein and his death, showing how a shadowy concern for immortality drives
   him in ways he is reluctant to see or acknowledge.},

Journal = {AMERICAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW},

Volume = {111},

Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Third parties often have a stake in the outcome of a conflict and can
   affect that outcome by taking sides. This article studies the factors
   that affect a third party's decision to take sides in a civil or
   interstate war by adding a third actor to a standard continuous-time war
   of attrition with two-sided asymmetric information. The third actor has
   preferences over which of the other two actors wins and for being on the
   winning side conditional on having taken sides. The third party also
   gets a flow payoff during the fighting which can be positive when
   fighting is profitable or negative when fighting is costly. The article
   makes four main contributions: First, it provides a formal framework for
   analyzing the effects of endogenous intervention on the duration and
   outcome of the conflict. Second, it identifies a boomerang effect that
   tends to make alignment decisions unpredictable and coalitions
   dynamically unstable. Third, it yields several clear comparative-static
   results. Finally, the formal analysis has implications for empirical
   efforts to estimate the effects of intervention, showing that there may
   be significant selection and identification issues.},

Abstract = {Selective exposure is a growing concern as people become more reliant on
   social media for political information. While self-reports often ask
   about exposure to political content on social media, existing research
   does not account for the fact that even those exposed to political
   content may still choose to ignore it. To effectively account for this,
   we employ corneal eye tracking software, such that we can observe users'
   gaze and the amount of time they actually spend with political content.
   Consistent with expectations, the earlier a cue that a post is
   political, the faster a user skips over it. This trend is concentrated
   among those least interested in politics. Implications for how we think
   about social media and political information flows in the modern media
   environment are discussed.},

Abstract = {The United States has a divided social welfare state split between
   public programs and tax subsidies for private benefits. Moreover, this
   separation is mapped onto divisions of political party and socioeconomic
   class. Democratic elites prefer creating and expanding public programs
   that assist the working poor and Republicans prefer using tax subsidies
   to help wealthier citizens pay for social services and benefits. Are
   these relationships among partisanship, socioeconomic class, and
   patterns in social spending reflected in public opinion? Do Democratic
   voters and the working poor favor public social programs over private?
   Are Republican voters more likely to support tax subsidies for private
   welfare over public spending? My analysis shows that while both public
   spending and tax breaks enjoy similar levels of support in the
   aggregate, there are partisan and class differences in support for
   direct social spending versus tax subsidies for social welfare.},

Abstract = {Voters in US elections receive markedly different representation
   depending on which candidate they elect, and because of incumbent
   advantages, the effects of this choice persist for many years. What are
   the long-term consequences of these two phenomena? Combining electoral
   and legislative roll-call data in a dynamic regression discontinuity
   design, this study assesses the long-term consequences of election
   results for representation. Across the US House, the US Senate and state
   legislatures, the effects of `coin-flip' elections persist for at least
   a decade in all settings, and for as long as three decades in some.
   Further results suggest that elected officials do not adapt their
   roll-call voting to their districts' preferences over time, and that
   voters do not systematically respond by replacing incumbents.},

Abstract = {Ethics constrains us. But ethics can also act as an enabler', helping to
   secure compliance with public policies. Basing policies on ethical
   principles helps the public know what is required of them by public
   policies. Framing policies in those ways also primes people to think in
   terms of their own ethically based reasons for action. Basing policies
   on ethical principles can assist in securing the cooperation of
   potential veto players by creating cooperative norms and a culture of
   trust.},

   The Security Aspects of Exclusion and Identity Formation},
Journal = {SECURITY AND HUMAN RIGHTS},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {28},
Number = {1-4},

Month = {APR},
Abstract = {This article attempts to explore the nexus between exclusionary
   state-building practices, inter-ethnic relations and Violent Extremism
   and Radicalisation that Lead to Terrorism (vERLT). The current focus on
   individual trajectories has left the social context in which individuals
   radicalise underexplored. By taking a birds-eye view, this article aims
   to untangle the ways in which particular historic conditions and
   perceptions of discrimination and marginalisation following
   state-building practices feed specifically into the radicalisation of
   minority communities. Following a comparison between state-building
   practices in Turkey, China and Spain and the impact on Kurdish, Uyghur
   and Basque identity construction respectively, the authors argue that
   the failure to include minority groups into the identity of the state is
   one of the key reasons for the politicisation of minority identities.
   This implies the need for inclusionary policies as a response to VERLT.
   It is exactly through the promotion, facilitation and execution of
   inclusive policies that the OSCE can make an important contribution.},

Abstract = {Common markers of social class include income, wealth, education and
   family background. Though these capture staple pedestrian elements of
   class, they understate something substantial - social class is produced
   by political experiences. Building on this observation, I argue that
   social class is constructed and reinforced via political institutions
   that differentially affect the daily experiences and life trajectories
   of Americans. Viewing class through this lens (instead of more simply as
   a function of income or education) enables clarity on two critical
   features of the American political system: (1) its deeply racialized
   institutional practices (2) its dual inclusionary/exclusionary
   governance structures. Most broadly, this essay pushes us beyond a view
   of class as a set of variables that affect political outcomes and
   towards inquiry into the ways that political institutions produce class.
   Ultimately, such a conceptual pivot illuminates additional pathways for
   transforming economic and political relations in the United States.},

Abstract = {In federal systems, both state governments and firms have incentives to
   strategically locate polluting facilities where the environmental and
   health consequences will be borne as much as possible by residents of
   other jurisdictions. We analyze air polluter location in the United
   States using a spatial point pattern model, which models where events
   occur in latitude and longitude. Our analyses indicate that major air
   polluters are significantly more likely to be located near a state's
   downwind border than a control group of other industrial facilities,
   results that are robust to a wide variety of model specifications and
   measurement strategies. This effect is particularly pronounced for
   facilities with toxic air emissions. The observed pattern of polluter
   location varies systematically across states and time in ways that
   suggest it is responsive to public policy at both the national and state
   levels.},

Abstract = {Electoral observation has become an essential exercise for the
   development of electoral democracy. The proliferation of organizations
   monitoring elections makes necessary to distinguish real ``election
   observation activities{''}, from other similar activities, such as
   ``electoral accompaniment{''}. Independence is an essential element that
   must be respected by true electoral observation organizations.
   Accordingly, the lack of independence in some of these organizations
   transforms them into ``intervened electoral observation{''} actors,
   dowgrading its credibility and reliability. Hence, the last electoral
   processes that have taken place in Venezuela, provide the necessary
   factual basis to distinguish OAS election observation missions, from
   UNASUR accompaniment missions.},

Abstract = {This study analyzes the Soviet politics of silence during Stalin's
   collectivization campaign in the context of peasant resistance, state
   violence, and the famine in 1928-1929, and illuminates the primary
   function of strategic silencean information blockade which creates a
   space for violence and human suffering. Only in silence does the
   landscape of violence emerge and its spiral dynamics consume everyone,
   assailants and victims, proceeding swiftly to the eventual destruction
   of this landscape. In Ukraine, strategic silence and the relatively
   hermetic information blockade highlights the intentional nature of state
   violence: it produced a ghetto of exclusion that helped crush peasant
   resistance to collectivization and prevented Ukraine's potential
   secession from the Union. More profoundly, the politics of silence is
   analyzed as cultural violence and one of the most important building
   blocks in the foundation of genocide that routinely provokes and
   escalates direct violence, a phenomenon which culminates in massacres,
   repressions, and famines, as happened in the Ukrainian case.},

Abstract = {Until today, the global financial crisis that commenced in 2007
   continues to cast its shadow beyond the economic realm. This paper
   analyzes in how far political parties in Europe have adapted or modified
   their election manifestos as a reaction to this external shock. In doing
   so, the analysis focuses on members of the green party family with their
   distinct postmaterialist heritage. In the tradition of party family
   research, we test whether these political parties reacted coherently or
   whether the programmatic changes were largely due to electoral
   competition within the respective national context. The results show
   that the effect of party family membership on changes in green parties'
   election manifestos was secondary to the influence of changes in the
   respective party system as well as the extent to which the respective
   countries were afflicted by the crisis. Thus, our paper contributes to
   research on party families and provides insights on (green) parties'
   responsiveness and programmatic changes in times of crisis.},

   scientists. This article pays particular attention to the way in which
   `people' can be approached and appealed to by their leaders. In
   particular, by undertaking a content analysis of the two most read daily
   newspapers in Italy, and by relying on the technique of correspondence
   analysis, this article shows that to fully understand the phenomenon of
   populism, the way in which `the people' are approached by their leaders
   cannot be left aside. In doing so, this article empirically analyses and
   discusses three dimension of populism and contributes to a more granular
   understanding of this phenomenon in established democracies.},

Abstract = {The attitudes of the European Union (EU) citizens towards immigration
   and the impact of their national identification on attitudes towards the
   EU have received ample attention in the literature. However, the
   immigrants' identification with Europe has not been adequately studied.
   This article investigates the impact of non-EU immigration heritage on
   European identification. Based on social identity theory and using
   Eurobarometer cross-sectional data, it compares the European
   identification of those with a first generation non-EU immigration
   heritage to that of EU country natives. Moreover, it focuses on salient
   aspects of immigrant experience such as country policies directed at
   reducing discrimination and personal experience of discrimination. The
   results show that those with non-EU immigration heritage have higher
   European identification compared to the natives. Furthermore, in line
   with social identity theory, this article shows that successful
   anti-discrimination policies pull immigrants towards national
   identification rather than European identification.},

Abstract = {This article, drawing on the case study of resource development and
   conflict in Bougainville (Papua New Guinea), explores how global faith
   in development hollows out the possibilities of justice for peoples
   transitioning from the violence of colonization, corporate-state crime
   and armed civil conflict. While developmental faith promises a future
   horizon of prosperity with the Global North, Bougainville's recent
   history illuminates how development's economy of sacrifice authors
   social fragmentation, conflict and gross environmental harms while
   serving the interests of powerful transnational corporation, states and
   local elites. The harmonization of such interests, when coupled with
   development's reluctance to confront substantive colonial and
   post-colonial injustices, risks setting the parameters for a new era of
   instability and state-corporate crime.},

Abstract = {Does the structure of inequality in a society matter for the amount of
   redistribution from rich to poor? New, groundbreaking research indicates
   this to be the case: Where the market income of the middle class is
   comparably close to that of the poor, a cross-class coalition between
   the two groups emerges. This cross-class coalition will tend to favor a
   generous welfare state and extensive redistribution. We add to this in
   two ways. First, we complement the theoretical framework by highlighting
   the role of the politicization of multiculturalism. We posit that the
   social affinity between the middle class and the poor is lower when
   multiculturalism becomes politicized. Second, we provide new information
   on the mechanism by which social affinity affects redistribution. When
   the income of the middle class is comparatively close to the income of
   the poor, more people vote for leftleaning parties; yet as
   multiculturalism becomes politicized, this effect disappears.},

Abstract = {Reconciliation and conflict transformation require simultaneous effort
   across several socio-political levels. This article advances both a
   conceptual and an empirical argument to frame reconciliation and
   conflict transformation in these terms. First, the article draws on
   theories of agonistic democracy to argue for the intrinsic and
   potentially productive role of non-violent conflict in reconciliation
   efforts that accept conflict as both enduring and necessary. Second, the
   article contends that reconciliation is a multi-level task that requires
   ongoing attention and effort directed towards constitution building,
   institutional reform and relational transformation. The article
   concludes that, once conflict transformation is understood in these
   terms, reconciliation must be seen as a far more difficult and long-term
   endeavour than is usually acknowledged, requiring innovative political
   institutions capable of keeping open spaces for democratic political
   contestation.},

Title = {The choice of candidate-centered electoral systems in new democracies},
Journal = {PARTY POLITICS},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {23},
Number = {2},
Pages = {160-171},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Most studies of candidate-centered electoral systems, that encourage
   politicians to seek personal votes, have focused on the impact of such
   institutions. This paper focuses instead on their origins in new
   democracies. It hypothesizes that voter demands for local and individual
   benefits and party access to government resources for such benefits are
   likely to lead politicians to choose a candidate-centered electoral rule
   during a transition to democracy. Cross-national quantitative studies of
   97 new democracies from 1950 to 2008 support these claims, revealing
   that (1) the poorer the average voter, the more likely a
   candidate-centered electoral institution will be adopted and (2) where
   incumbent governing parties are more influential in selecting new rules,
   candidate-centered electoral systems are more likely to be selected.
   Nonetheless, (3) in highly developed countries even those governing
   party members tend to opt for a party-centered system; conversely, (4)
   in extremely less-developed countries even opposition politicians, who
   would otherwise select a party-centered electoral system, are likely to
   choose a candidate-centered system if they are dominant at the time of
   writing the new institution. These findings shed light on the
   endogeneity of electoral systems and suggest a powerful impact of social
   context on institutional choice. The paper also contributes more
   generally to theories of electoral system choice.},

Abstract = {Right-wing populist parties in European democracies appeal to citizens'
   feelings of uncertainty related to globalization by promoting tough
   immigration laws and curbing the power of the European Union. This
   article adds to our understanding of how individuals' risk propensity
   relates to support for right-wing populist parties and their ideas in
   the context of globalization. In particular, by drawing on survey data
   from the United Kingdom we investigate how this personality trait
   relates to support for the United Kingdom Independence Party and the
   vote for a British exit from the European Union. The article explores
   the complex interplay between risk propensity and right-wing populist
   appeals by dissecting the direct, indirect and total effects of this
   trait.},

Abstract = {The 2014 Euromaidan revolution, which started as a non-violent
   demonstration for European integration, eventually gave rise to a
   nation-wide movement against the usurpation of power, corruption, and
   human rights violations. One of the main demands of Euromaidan
   protesters to the new government was to launch a comprehensive personnel
   reform that would cleanse the state apparatus from public officials of
   the Communist era (1919-1991) and those affiliated with the Yanukovych
   regime (2010-2014). This article examines the lustration process in
   post-Euromaidan Ukraine through the prism of earlier personnel reforms,
   mainly in Central and Eastern Europe (CEE), and discusses the
   similarities and differences between them. The analysis focuses on two
   key features that make the Ukrainian case stand out across CEE
   lustrations. First, Ukraine's lustration reconciled transitional justice
   with socio-economic imperatives, such as the fight against corruption,
   not only as a discursive practice but also a legal matter. Second,
   unlike CEE lustrations the Ukrainian government implemented lustration
   23 years after the fall of Communism and during the ongoing military
   confrontation in eastern Ukrainian Donetsk and Luhansk regions (Donbas).
   The article contributes to the literature on the evolution of
   transitional justice which has expanded far beyond the conventional
   redress for past human rights violations and may now incorporate
   peacebuilding and structural justice agendas.},

Abstract = {This article considers the extent to which the debate about animal
   rights can be enriched by Richard Rorty's theory of rights. Although
   Rorty's work has enjoyed a lot of scholarly attention, commentators have
   not considered the implications of his arguments for animals. Nor have
   theorists of animal rights engaged his approach to rights. This article
   argues that Rorty's thinking holds a number of attractions for
   proponents of animal rights. It also considers some of its drawbacks. It
   is further argued that Rorty's thinking about rights avoids many of the
   problems that animal ethic-of-care theorists have found in rights
   discourse being applied to animals. Rorty's work thus provides a
   valuable resource for bringing these two major strands within the animal
   ethics literature into closer theoretical kinship.},

   eminently practical and material character of the alienation that Marx
   describes. On the other hand, the frequent references in his work to the
   human being as a collective subject, as a concrete species and as a real
   historical society that produces its own life and its own power by
   transforming nature of which it is part.},

Abstract = {Party-driven and religion-driven models of opinion change posit that
   individuals revise their positions on culture war issues to ensure
   consonance with political and religious predispositions. By contrast,
   models of issue-driven change propose that public opinion on cultural
   controversies lead people to revise their partisan and religious
   orientations. Using data from four panel studies covering the period
   1992-2012, we pit the party- and religion-based theories of opinion
   change against the issue-based model of change. Consistent with the
   standard view, party and religion constrain culture war opinion.
   Contrary to the conventional wisdom, but consistent with our novel
   theory, opinions on culture war issues lead people to revise their
   partisan affinities and religious orientations. Our results imply that
   culture war attitudes function as foundational elements in the political
   and religious belief systems of ordinary citizens that match and
   sometimes exceed partisan and religious predispositions in terms of
   motivating power.},

   Liberalization},
Journal = {AMERICAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {111},
Number = {1},
Pages = {1-20},

Abstract = {Existing political economy models explain the politics of trade policy
   using inter-industry differences. However, this article finds that much
   of the variation in U.S. applied tariff rates in fact arises within
   industry. I offer a theory of trade liberalization that explains how
   product differentiation in economic markets leads to firm-level lobbying
   in political markets. High levels of product differentiation eliminates
   the collective action problem faced by exporting firms while
   import-competing firms need not fear product substitution. To test this
   argument, I construct a new dataset on lobbying by all publicly traded
   manufacturing firms from reports filed under the Lobbying Disclosure Act
   of 1995. I find that productive exporting firms are more likely to lobby
   to reduce tariffs, especially when their products are sufficiently
   differentiated. I also find that highly differentiated products have
   lower tariff rates. The results challenge the common focus on
   industry-level lobbying for protection.},

Abstract = {Facing the threat of Somali piracy, private actors have created a
   private security governance framework by both issuing and implementing
   standards as well as offering operative security solutions through armed
   guards. Which conditions have facilitated this provision of private
   security? The present article approaches this research question in two
   innovative ways: Theoretically, by deriving four conditions from the
   literature on private climate governance and applying them to the
   security realm; and empirically, by analyzing the activities of Private
   Military and Security Companies and the shipping industry in the case of
   Somali piracy based on a series of semi-structured interviews. Thus, the
   article contributes to the literature on private security in at least
   two ways: it provides an extensive understanding of private security
   incorporating operative and regulative elements and it uses insights
   about private governance from a more developed field in order to
   understand private security governance more systematically. The article
   concludes that all four conditions prominent in the literature on
   climate change - risk perception, involvement of capital markets,
   governmental inability, and commodification - can successfully be
   applied to the case of Somali piracy and explain the emergence and
   dynamic of private security governance.},

Title = {Japan's international peace operations in South Sudan: Peacekeeping and
   civilian protection dilemmas},
Journal = {AFRICAN JOURNAL ON CONFLICT RESOLUTION},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {17},
Number = {2},
Pages = {143-167},
Abstract = {After the independence of South Sudan from Sudan on 9 July 2011, the
   Japanese government decided to dispatch its Self-Defence Forces (SDF) to
   South Sudan under the auspices of the United Nations Mission in the
   Republic of South Sudan (UNMISS). Despite the post-conflict military
   clashes in South Sudan, the Japanese government did not withdraw the
   SDF, but instead, the Abe administration assigned a new mission, the
   so-called `kaketsuke-keigo' ('rush and rescue'), to rescue staff of
   international organisations and non-governmental organisations (NGO) in
   preparation for possible armed attacks during peacekeeping operations.
   The new mission can be regarded as Prime Minister Abe's `proactive
   contribution to peace' (proactive pacifism) in action, and the policy is
   congruous with the purpose of `human security' and `protection of
   civilians'. This paper aims to investigate Japan's contribution to
   peacekeeping operations in South Sudan and examine associated dilemmas
   facing the United Nations, the Japanese government, and the Japanese
   peacekeepers in UNMISS - which need to be overcome for future

Abstract = {In this paper, I will analyze Axel Honneth's theory against the
   background of some of the criticisms that Amy Allen levelled against it.
   His endeavor seems to partially compromise his ability to identify the
   domineering forms of power that the subject does not acknowledge
   consciously and affectively. I will argue that, despite some significant
   limitations, Honneth's theory has become increasingly able to analyze
   social negativity since The struggle for recognition. Also, in both
   defending Honneth's methodology and delimiting its scope, I aim to
   contribute to the debate between two understandings of power: power as
   `domination' and power as `constitution'.},

Journal = {POLITICKE VEDY},

Volume = {20},
Number = {4},
Pages = {46-62},
Abstract = {The migration crisis to and in Europe had more characteristics but there
   was one above others - the struggle for a unified reaction of the
   European Union. The situation was also complicated by the fact that
   opinions on the response often differed at the internal level of the
   member states, as in the Czech Republic, a birthplace of the voluntary
   movement called the Czech Team. In this study, one aspect of the team
   members' motivation was analysed the declaration of the ``European
   identity{''} as a form of their protest against the state immigration
   policy, considered to be anti-European. The occurrence of this incentive
   element had been investigated by the participant observation,
   unstructured interviewing of volunteers in Serbia and compared to the
   related researches on motivation. The results showed the protest against
   the state policy was often combined with other protests (for example
   against media or extremist groups) and was the most apparent during the
   peak of the crisis in 2015. Later, following the stabilisation of mass
   migration in the Balkans, the strong declaration of the European
   identity lost its relevance. The volunteers and their open critique of
   the policy gain the attention at the state and international levels.
   However, the real impact on the Czech immigration policy remains
   questionable and rather insignificant.},

   ICCPR},
Journal = {NORDIC JOURNAL OF HUMAN RIGHTS},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {35},
Number = {3, SI},
Pages = {220-239},
Abstract = {2016 marked the fiftieth anniversary of the International Covenant on
   Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) and thus of the oldest self-standing
   general right to non-discrimination in international law under article
   26. The Human Rights Committee has enforced the right with rigour
   creating a vast and formidable body of discrimination jurisprudence over
   the decades. This jurisprudence, though, is doggedly single-dimensional
   and appears to have given short shrift to discrimination based on
   multiple and intersecting grounds of article 26, viz race, colour, sex,
   language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social
   origin, property, birth or other status. This article examines the
   curious case of missing intersectional discrimination in the ICCPR. It
   does so by pulling together the dispersed and often unidentified claims
   based on more than one ground of discrimination. It delineates the
   pathologies of reasoning in these claims which have overlooked the idea
   of `intersectionality' understood as disadvantage based on multiple and
   intersecting grounds, which is both similar to and different from
   disadvantage based on individual grounds. The article shows that this
   conceptual reckoning matters in identifying and addressing
   discrimination, and thus enforcing the commitment in article 26 of
   addressing not just single-ground discrimination but `any
   discrimination' against `all persons' on `any ground. or other status.'},

Abstract = {In the United States, the crisis that broke out in 2008 inaugurated a
   public debate on the decline of the middle class with peculiar
   historical references: from the Great Depression and the New Deal to the
   globalization of the Nineties, through the fractures imposed by the
   social movements of the Sixties and the neo-liberal turn of the
   Eighties. In the light of a debate in which the middle class emerges as
   an indisputable keyword of the American political cultures, the essay
   points out the historical origin of the fetish of middle class by
   showing the role that US social sciences have had in the making of the
   middle class as an ideological notion at the very foundation of the
   American century. Released by its fetish, middle class emerges as a
   historical category that allows to trace the formation of the liberal
   order and its transition to the neoliberal order, to point to the crisis
   and transformation of capitalism and the American state, to identify the
   frontier beyond which their historical legitimacy is missing.},

Abstract = {Gun violence persists in the United States, claiming lives and
   escalating healthcare costs. This article seeks to contribute to social
   justice work on the ``gun problem{''} by studying gun collectives. To
   understand gun culture and to identify gun violence reduction
   strategies, we study places where gun owners organize - legal ( and
   sometimes illegal) settings that facilitate dialogue about gun issues.
   Based on participant observation and collaborative event ethnography at
   gun shows and a private shooting party, this analysis presents findings
   about the practices gun collective members use to manage stigma. We
   conclude that when participants in gun events attempt to subvert core
   stigma through everyday stigma management practices, they effectively
   facilitate the unfettered exchange of potentially dangerous goods,
   promote the invisibility of oppressive structures, and normalize
   violence.},

Abstract = {Partisanship and cognitive mobilization are generally seen as
   independent and counter-balancing influences on vote choice. While the
   former is typically regarded as a shortcut, reducing the need for close
   ideological congruence with one's preferred party, the latter is
   associated with increasing levels of political sophistication and the
   importance of ideological proximity in voter decision-making. This paper
   tests the strength of these arguments in comparative perspective using
   data from Wave 3 of the Comparative Study of Electoral Systems (CSES).
   Our results show that in general higher levels of political
   sophistication are associated with higher levels of voter-party
   ideological congruence and that a strong party identification reduces
   this proximity. For voters with both high levels of sophistication and
   strong partisanship, however, congruence remains high. In a second step
   we examine whether these relationships are affected by the complexity of
   the party environment. Our findings show that party system size has no
   effect on levels of ideological congruence at the individual level, and
   this holds for different levels of voter sophistication. We conclude
   that for the most part voter sophistication and party identification are
   best seen as counter-weights in determining vote choice.},

Abstract = {Until the 1990s, the European water policy has been defined by and for
   water users abstracting water or discharging waste through water
   infrastructures: urban water services, irrigated agriculture and
   industries discharging pollutants into rivers. The European Water
   Framework directive (WFD) issued in 2000 departs from this sectorial
   stance. It regulates all continental aquatic systems in order to take
   into account cumulative effects of environmental degradations. This
   article evaluates the ecologisation of the European water policy through
   its instruments of regulation and governance. It presents a typology of
   policy learning in relation to their sector-based or ecological
   orientation in a multilevel context. At European level, the enactment of
   the WFD may be explained by mere strategic learning. Its implementation
   at French level requires further elaboration and implies : (1)
   sector-based strategic learning fostering equipment; (2) ecological
   conceptual learning; and (3) uncertainties generated by new
   commensuration process. In this case, ecological mainstreaming proceeds
   along two avenues : recycling of previously marginal ecological tools
   designed within the water sector and ignorance of new tools and other
   actors strategies.},

Abstract = {The 2014 European Parliament (EP) elections saw unprecedented support
   for eurosceptic parties. This chapter aims to examine what message
   voters intended to send by voting for radical parties in Belgium.
   Drawing on the literature on citizens' attitudes toward Europe, we
   analyze to what extent this surge of support for eurosceptic parties was
   about Europe. We rely on data from the 2014 PartiRep survey and test
   four models on the Belgian case. We show that despite strong
   depoliticization of European Union (EU) issues, Europe now matters even
   in Belgium. Citizens who voted for a radical and eurosceptic party did
   so not as a protest against the government or because of utilitarian or
   identity-related considerations, but to express anti-EU sentiments.},

Year = {2017},
Volume = {8},

Pages = {8-19},
Abstract = {As think tanks continue to grow exponentially in number worldwide, their
   influence on world politics has also been increasing. These think tanks,
   including Russia's policy-oriented scientific research institutes, study
   a wide range of pressing political, social and economic issues, present
   their ideas and recommendations to national governments and
   international institutions, and promote international dialogue to foster
   solutions to world's most burning problems. For think tanks to remain
   trustworthy and influential, they need to maintain their integrity,
   independence of judgement, in-depth scholarship, and a sharpened focus
   on real-world outcomes. Their impact will also depend on their
   efficiency in promoting their findings through an active publications
   campaign, first-rate conferences and seminars, skillful outreach
   programs, innovative Internet activities, and cutting-edge social
   networking. With the assistance of think tanks, the world politics will
   be better informed and thus more enlightened, future-oriented,
   resourceful, and better equipped to find solutions to ongoing conflicts,
   build international cooperation, and avoid crises in the future.},

Abstract = {This year, 2017 marks the thirty-fifth anniversary of the Falklands
   crisis. This article addresses the question of why Britain fought the
   Falklands war. Britain's official representation of the war began with a
   false premise, which proclaimed that ``the Falkland Islands were a
   British sovereign territory.{''} Metaphorically speaking, Britain's
   representation was structured into ``a chain of hypothetical
   propositions.{''} This metaphor not only enables one to apprehend a
   striking parallel between the deduction of one proposition from another
   and the construction of national interests but also offers a useful way
   to understand how Britain's premise delineated the parameters within
   which the putative truths of British interests could be
   ``discovered,{''} reproduced and transmitted through pure deduction. The
   validity of the conclusion that Britain must repossess the Falklands
   through military means did not flow from empirical evidence. Rather, it
   stemmed from the power held by the British ruling elite to define the
   first premise.},

Abstract = {``Evidence-based{''} methods, which most prominently include randomized

   standard{''} for assessing the effect of public policies. But the
   enthusiasm for evidence-based research overlooks questions about the
   reliability and applicability of experimental findings to diverse
   real-world settings. Perhaps surprisingly, a qualitative study of
   British educators suggests that they are aware of these limitations and
   therefore take evidence-based findings with a much larger grain of salt
   than do policy makers. Their experience suggests that the real world is
   more heterogeneous than the world imagined by evidence-based policy
   enthusiasts.},

Abstract = {How do militias use the external support provided to them by powerful
   foreign actors? In Kunduz province, Afghanistan, a wide range of
   militias have received money, weapons, training and political support
   through several US-funded militia programmes. While labelled as `local
   self-defence forces', the observable behaviour of these militias ranges
   from providing local governance services in the areas they control to
   preying upon the people they are supposed to guard. Through the
   analytical lens of multi-layered governance this article investigates
   how the external support of the United States has been adopted,
   manipulated, and/or diverted by local militias in Kunduz to serve their
   own agendas. While the militia support yielded short-term
   counterinsurgency gains, in the mid to long term, it has unintentionally
   undermined both the security needs of local populations in Kunduz and US
   strategic interests.},

Abstract = {This paper discusses the trajectory of the concept of citizenship in its
   manifold dimensions and ramifications in modernity, bringing out its
   main worldwide concrete incarnations. Marshall's and Marx's definitions
   are discussed, but an effort is made to cover the most relevant global
   literature on the subject. It is argued that although modernity has
   become a catchphrase lately, it is increasingly threatened by recent
   developments in terms of what may be called social liberalism, which
   seats comfortably with the present pattern of global capitalist
   accumulation and neoliberalism. Finally, against these recent
   developments, the emancipatory potential of citizenship is briefly
   accessed.},

   social media platform, the article examines what groups of Hispanic
   Facebook users were attracted to Clinton's targeted autoplay videos,
   what elements within these videos best enticed these people into liking
   the videos, and if the Clinton campaign appeared to learn what types of
   autoplay videos were most effective over the course of the primary
   season.},

Title = {Macro-regional strategies of the European Union (EU) and experimentalist
   design of multi-level governance: the case of the EU strategy for the
   Danube region},
Journal = {REGIONAL AND FEDERAL STUDIES},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {27},
Number = {1},
Pages = {1-22},
Abstract = {Placed within EU Cohesion policy and its objective of European
   territorial cooperation, macro-regional strategies of the European Union
   (EU) aim to improve functional cooperation and coherence across policy
   sectors at different levels of governance, involving both member and
   partner states, as well as public and private actors from the
   subnational level and civil society in a given `macro-region'. In
   forging a `macro-regional' approach, the EU commits to only using
   existing legislative frameworks, financial programmes and institutions.
   By applying the analytical lens of multi-level and experimentalist
   governance (EG), and using the EU Strategy for the Danube Region as a
   case, this article shows that `macro-regional' actors have been
   activated at various scales and locked in a recursive process of EG. In
   order to make the macro-regional experiment sustainable, it will be
   important to ensure that monitoring and comparative review of
   implementation experience functions effectively and that partner
   countries, subnational authorities and civil societies have a voice in
   what is, by and large, an intergovernmental strategy.},

Abstract = {After the collapse of the Soviet Union, the post-Soviet countries
   carried out policy reforms largely within the framework of the
   technocratic model. The transformation projects were elaborated and
   partly implemented by the groups of professionals under the mandate
   granted to them by the political leadership. The latter sought to
   consolidate its monopoly over decision-making and assessing reform
   projects realization, ``isolating{''} their content from the impact of
   public opinion. The article is devoted to a critical analysis of the
   technocratic model of policy in the post-Soviet Eurasia of the
   1990-2010s. The author focuses on the political and institutional
   constraints associated with the influence of vested interests and
   mechanisms of functioning of the state apparatus. The final part of the
   article discusses alternatives to the technocratic model, the prospects
   for their implementation and the potential effect.},

   Can the EU's Accession to the ECHR Ease the Tension?},

Abstract = {The principle of mutual trust has been a central pillar of the European
   integration project, first as a tool for market integration, and as the
   European Economic Community became the European Union, as a mechanism
   for a more wide ranging integration of the legal orders of the member
   states. The EU now has legislation in place which imposes obligations on
   member states to trust each other's civil and criminal justice systems,
   immigration and asylum law, and family law. But these obligations of
   trust imposed by EU law may conflict with obligations that member states
   have to secure the rights under the ECHR. Accession by the EU to the
   ECHR was supposed to resolve this conflict, but in its Opinion 2/13, the
   Court of Justice appeared to have dealt a fatal blow to this solution.
   This article explains the tension between the EU principle of mutual
   trust and the duty to secure ECHR rights. The article examines the most
   recent case law of the CJEU and the ECtHR in order to assess whether a
   resolution of this tension has been found, and whether the EU's
   accession to the ECHR will be possible.},

Abstract = {This article focuses on state and non-state interactions that enable
   instilling indigenous territoriality in the political agenda, during
   constituency processes. Hence the interest in knowing, why did
   indigenous territories get instilled in the political agenda during
   Colombia's 1991 Constituent Assembly? The working hypothesis argues
   that, via institutional coupling, some players take advantage of the
   political moment to link problems with solutions and so push the issue
   on the agenda. This institutional coupling mechanism hypothesis is
   constituted as of theoretical discussions about drafting a political
   agenda and as of the institutional set up where the players perform. The
   proposal is to have a methodology that does follow-up on processes, to
   identify the operating mechanism and the analysis of policy instruments
   to organize empirical evidence. Finally, the necessary and sufficient
   parts are screened and ratified for the mechanism to work. The same is
   true of the agencies unleashed within it. The discourse method to
   understand the trajectory and functioning of local public policies.},

Abstract = {Much has been written about the sources of public opinion regarding gay
   and lesbian civil rights and liberties in the West. In contrast, we know
   far less about the dynamics of sexual prejudice in other places in the
   world, including in Eastern Europe, where social movements on behalf of
   gay and lesbian rights are a more recent phenomenon. My goal in this
   article is to examine the etiology of Poles' views on gay and lesbian
   rights. In light of the theory and empirical evidence that suggest
   significant links between religiosity, cultural beliefs regarding
   family, gender roles, and attitudes toward Poland's membership in the
   European Union on the one hand and support for equal treatment of gays
   and lesbians on the other, I seek here to explore the nature of these
   links. The analysis I summarize also contributes to the larger
   literature on attitudes toward sexual minorities by simultaneously
   modeling the relationships between these variables using nationally
   representative survey data.},

Title = {The Incumbency Bonus Revisited: Causes and Consequences of Media
   Dominance},

Year = {2017},
Volume = {47},

Abstract = {The literature on political actors' media appearances has repeatedly
   documented the so-called incumbency bonus (that parties and politicians
   in government have more media coverage than those in the opposition).
   This bias is normally attributed to news criteria that reflect political
   power, such as relevance and the elite status of actors. Supplementing
   existing perspectives, this study puts forward a new explanation of the
   incumbency bonus. The article argues that variations in the media
   dominance of incumbents are the result of the interplay between
   journalistic norms and political context. Outside election campaigns,
   political news is driven by the `watch dog' norm. Thus the media focus
   on societal problems, which produces a critical emphasis on incumbent
   actors. But when party competition intensifies, either during campaigns
   or when issues become salient, the norm of objective and impartial
   journalism results in a more balanced coverage where challengers
   increase their presence. The argument receives support through
   multivariate models of incumbent and challenger appearances in Danish
   radio news broadcasts over a twenty-year period. Finally, in terms of
   democratic implications, the importance of the watchdog norm challenges
   the assumption that the incumbency bonus constitutes an electoral asset.
   Since media dominance is closely related to government responsibility
   for all kinds of problems, incumbent support is found to dwindle with
   increased media appearances.},

Title = {Trials, lustration, and clean elections: the uneven effects of
   transitional justice mechanisms on electoral manipulation},
Journal = {DEMOCRATIZATION},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {24},
Number = {6},
Pages = {1195-1214},
Abstract = {Transitional justice aims to promote democratization, but previous
   research has found that it has mixed effects. We address this puzzle by
   focussing on how transitional justice affects a necessary condition for
   democracy: clean elections. We test for the effects of four transitional
   justice mechanisms - truth commissions, lustration policies, amnesties,
   and trials - on two different types of electoral manipulation, using
   data from 187 post-transition elections held in 63 countries around the
   world from 1980 to 2004. We find that post-transition trials limit
   illegal forms of electoral manipulation, such as vote-buying and
   falsification of results, but have no effect on legal forms of
   manipulation. By contrast, lustration policies limit legal manipulation
   tactics, like intimidation and harassment of opponents by the security
   services, but do not affect illegal tactics. By showing that different
   aspects of transitional justice can have varying influence on electoral
   integrity, this project improves understanding of the mechanisms that
   link transitional justice and democratization.},

Journal = {REGIONAL AND FEDERAL STUDIES},

Volume = {27},
Number = {5, SI},
Pages = {529-548},
Abstract = {Intergovernmental councils in Germany comprise 18 sectoral ministerial
   conferences and the prime ministerial conference as peak organization.
   They complement the Bundesrat as institutions of Intergovernmental
   Relations in the German system of cooperative federalism, dealing with
   matters of shared rule as well as self-rule. Based on expert interviews
   among ministerial bureaucrats, this contribution finds that contrary to
   conventional wisdom, vertical influence and autonomy protection are not
   their main purpose. Rather, they serve primarily information exchange
   and coordination. Still, the emphasis on either influence and autonomy
   protection or coordination and information as well as the directions of
   interaction vary across policy sectors. We further investigate
   constitutional allocation of power and party political composition as
   determinants on the specific purpose of ministerial conferences. The
   findings suggest that the allocation of power is more important than
   party political composition in explaining variation between sectoral
   ministerial conferences.},

Abstract = {Norm critique is a recent discourse and practice in Sweden that is
   associated with queer resistance. It is taken up as a mode of governance
   in several Swedish institutions and companies. At face value, norm
   critique allows queer resistance to have a direct impact on
   institutional sources of norms in society. However, this article argues
   that such a shift in queer resistance replaces the queer emotionally
   overt subject with a rationalist style of emoting. It also argues that
   norm critique (re) institutes a subject position that paradoxically
   sides with contemporary forms of power and its demands for emotional
   competence.},

Abstract = {This article analyzes voter identification laws in the United States and
   their effects on voter turnout. Theoretically, there are plausible
   reasons to hypothesize turnout lowering effects, though there are also
   reasons to hypothesize those effects might be minimal. Methodologically,
   there are research design hurdles to clear in order to produce effect
   estimates that may be attributed to voter identification laws.
   Empirically, a small number of studies have employed suitable research
   designs and generally find modest, if any, turnout effects of voter
   identification laws. This may indicate that voter identification laws
   have only minor effects on turnout, or it may be due to the fact that
   the type of voter identification law that may have the most significant
   effects-a strict photo identification law-is a relatively recent
   phenomenon. Future elections and the related additional data may make it
   possible to adjudicate among these possibilities.},

Abstract = {We shed light on the discontent with and the appeal of democracy by
   interviewing some of the most committed critical citizens: core
   activists in street protests. Based on interviews in Athens, Cairo,
   London, and Moscow, we found that they rejected representative democracy
   as insufficient, and believed democracy to entail having a voice and a
   responsibility to participate intensively in political decision-making.
   Activists saw themselves as engaged in prefigurative politics by
   fostering democratic practices within the movement and, ultimately, in
   society, but also raised concerns about internal power dynamics
   reproducing existing inequalities and exclusions. The insistence by
   activists that citizens have both a right and a duty to participate
   should be taken more seriously by political scientists and policymakers,
   not just as a threat to democracy and democratization, but as an
   opportunity. However, contemporary social movements are not
   straightforward sites of prefiguration, but sites of struggle between
   experimental and traditional forms of organizing, between inclusive
   aspirations and exclusive tendencies.},

Abstract = {Museums play an important role in the official presentation of history.
   This applied in particular to the Soviet museums of the revolution. In
   today's Russia, the state also exerts influence on museums. At the same
   time, they are being altered by greater professionalisation and
   international networking due to economic pressure. Museums bring
   together politics, science and the general public. Their work tells us a
   great deal about the state's policies on history and changes to its own
   self-image. The exhibitions held to mark the 100th anniversary of the
   Russian Revolution in the ``Museum of Contemporary Russian History{''}
   in Moscow and the ``Museum for Political History{''} in St. Petersburg
   differ significantly in terms of their concepts, museum design and
   political statement, and reflect the uncertainty in terms of history
   policy as to how to handle this delicate commemorative year.},

   Nomination Campaigns},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF POLITICAL MARKETING},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {16},
Number = {3-4},
Pages = {343-364},
Abstract = {This paper is an analysis of the Trump and Sanders' campaigns for the
   presidential nomination of their respective parties. It studies the
   structure of the relationship between the campaign and its supporters
   through communication on each candidate's Facebook page. While both
   campaigns have been termed populist, we differentiate populism from
   connectivism and develop an account of a connective campaign as a
   species of connective action. Whereas populism is predicated on a
   singular people, connectivity involves the acceptance and recognition of
   difference as a resource for political activity. Whereas populism
   involves a hierarchical authority relationship, connectivity is based on
   a reciprocal authority relationship. Finally, populism articulates an
   anti-establishment demand while connective campaigns demand for citizens
   to have the capacity for consequential engagement with political life.
   The empirical results demonstrate that connectivism and populism are
   distinct in practice and that these attributes hang together as two
   separate concepts. Further, we find that Trump's campaign communications
   emphasize populist themes, for Sanders such themes are limited and in
   the shadow of connectivism.},

Abstract = {The article presents a model for comparative study of international
   political regions, which assumes a constitutive dependence of the type
   of regionalism on the type of statehood. The model is based on the
   characteristics of micro-regional dynamics, namely, the specifics of the
   regionalization of states of pre-modernity, modernity and
   post-modernity. Using Marxist interpretation of state as a relationship
   between social classes and interest groups allowed the author to combine
   micro, meso and macro levels of analysis within a single comparative
   matrix. According to his conclusion, states of pre-modernity, modernity
   and post-modernity are formed due to the evolution of social relations
   at the micro level, and their regionalization leads to the formation of
   a system of regional governance of the appropriate type. This model
   offers a more important heuristic value than the theory of ``new
   regionalism{''}, because, unlike the latter, it explains both
   non-European and European versions of regionalism.},

Abstract = {The border between Germany and Denmark is a result of the Versailles
   Peace Treaty implemented after the First World War. Drawn after a
   plebiscite in 1920, it was challenged until at least the 1950s by key
   actors within the respective national minorities on either side of the
   border and their nationalist supporters. Since the millennium, though, a
   narrative of reconciliation and cooperation has taken over, where
   national minorities' institutions have taken in a central role of
   political bridge-building and de-bordering. The article will analyse the
   role of the German and Danish national minorities as secondary foreign
   policy agents in Danish-German relations in general and regional
   cross-border cooperation in particular. I argue that there is still a
   gap between rhetorics of involvement and factual governance, and that
   secondary foreign policy impact is heavily dependent on institutional
   capacity.},

Abstract = {This paper studies the epistemic dynamics preceding the emergence of
   mass movements. By means of an agent-based simulation, we study the
   informational processes generating those shared attitudes towards a
   political system that are necessary for mass movements. We show that
   societies of lower mobility will structurally underestimate the
   potential for political change. Moreover, we find systematic differences
   in attitudes between critics and supporters of a regime. A side-effect
   of the emergent informational dynamics is that system critics will, over
   time, develop higher estimates of the potential for change than their
   less discontent peers.},

Title = {ON THE DEFENSE OF THE MAJORITY RIGHTS},
Journal = {POLIS-POLITICHESKIYE ISSLEDOVANIYA},
Year = {2017},
Number = {1},
Pages = {177-182},
Abstract = {The ethno-religious composition of such European countries as France,
   Germany, Belgium, Spain, and Austria is rapidly changing. The ``old{''}
   residents of many European countries increasingly feel threat to their
   normal life. Associate Professor of the Interdisciplinary Center in
   Herzliya (Israel) Liav Orgad tried to examine some modern issues alien
   to liberal mentality as a part of the liberal discourse. In his
   monograph ``The Cultural Defense of Nations. A Liberal Theory of
   Majority Rights{''}, he cites adequately modeled predictions, according
   to which by 2051, in such countries as Austria, Belgium, Cyprus,
   Germany, and Spain, the national balance is likely to change in most
   radical way: the current majority will turn in a minority in their own
   countries. A significant number of Muslims living in Western Europe does
   not accept its values and prefers Shariah. In turn, European countries
   are engaged in an undeclared, but no less obvious defense of cultural
   policy and national identity of the majority. At the same time, the
   liberal law system has never endowed the national identity of the legal
   registration status. Defense is carried out by indirect methods through
   the laws on immigration and naturalization. At the same time, the
   structures responsible for security of the EU external borders suffer
   from a constant underfunding, and a monopoly on the use of force is
   available in the member states, but not the EU as a whole. Institutional
   and financial issues to ensure the rights of the majority are beyond
   Orgad's analysis. Nevertheless, the scale of the problems identified by
   the researcher is so impressive that there is an emotional expectation
   of a global response to global challenges. Orgad offers to limit and
   clearly delineate the space of loyalty. In his view, it is
   constitutionalism that should become the basis of its principles. He
   justifies the idea that the protection of the majority is a legitimate
   and necessary protection of the individual.},

Abstract = {Varieties of modern nondemocratic electoral political regimes is
   determined by institutional, structural, actor-oriented (procedural)
   differences between << the new autocracies >>. The trajectories of
   political transformation and regime changes in these hybrids depend
   largely on the specific political decisions and actions of key political
   actors in the process of democratization. This article analyzes the
   actions of the opposition from the angle of mobilization and cooperation
   as << winning >> tactics in the electoral competitive nondemocratic
   regimes. The empirical part of the article includes: 1) forming a public
   protests database in the electoral cycle of 2015 (January-September) in
   the Central Federal District of Russia, which includes the regional
   authority elections, members of regional and local legislatures; 2)
   statistical processing of data of opposition's participation /
   nonparticipation in public protests, number of protesters, opposition
   cooperative actions, issues of protests; 3) designing and measuring
   empirically observable features of protests make it possible to segment
   the public protest activity into 2 basic parts: civic activity and
   mobilization activity - and then to analyze the scope of cooperation of
   various opposition parties in mobilization actions. These results make
   it possible to answer the following questions: to what extent Russian
   opposition actors use public protest activity as mobilization resource
   and to what extent they are prepared for cooperation in a public protest
   field?},

Pages = {112-132},
Abstract = {In this article, I present a critique of existing approaches to the
   distinctive harm of genocide and offer an alternative approach. I draw
   on Hannah Arendt's unique conception of genocide, to suggest an
   `existential' account of the harm of genocide. For Arendt, the
   distinctive loss in genocide was not a moral loss, strictly speaking,
   but rather an existential loss to humanity. By destroying a nation in
   whole or in part, genocide robs us of a variety of possible ways of
   experiencing and understanding the world. This approach, I argue, is
   original and valuable, and merits further consideration by anyone who is
   interested in the problem of genocide.},

Journal = {ASIAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE},

Abstract = {This study is interested in the impact of Facebook as a source for
   political information on public opinion during political controversies.
   In a society where the mainstream media are under heavy influence by the
   dominant power and yet Internet communication is largely open and free,
   social media may become particularly important for the transmission of
   critical information and viewpoints. The social media information
   environment may exhibit an overall `anti-establishment bias.' However,
   the impact of social media should vary across individuals depending on
   the extent and character of user selectivity. Analysis of data collected
   during the political reform debate in Hong Kong (N = 3,246) show that
   reliance on Facebook as an information source relates negatively to
   support for the government's reform proposal. But the relationship is
   strongest for people without a strong political orientation and people
   who do not name any newspapers as their main information source. General
   theoretical implications of the findings are discussed.},

Journal = {REGIONAL AND FEDERAL STUDIES},

Volume = {27},
Number = {2},
Pages = {127-151},
Abstract = {The paper contributes to the studies of effects of political regimes on
   public policies by looking at a previously unexplored aspect of this
   issue: the propensity of political regimes to create vast and extensive
   formal regulation. To study this topic, it applies subnational
   comparative method and uses a dataset of subnational regions of Russia,
   which provides a unique opportunity for a large-N investigation of the
   research question because of substantial variation of regional political
   regimes and regulatory environments and because of availability of a
   proxy for comparing the use of formal regulation across regions. The
   paper shows that more competitive regimes are more likely to expand the
   formal law than less competitive ones; however, the implications of this
   expansion of formal law for the economy are ambiguous.},

Abstract = {This paper deals with the development of relations between the U.S. and
   Cuba from 1959 till now. Its aim is to analyse main factors and facts
   that led to the creation of special relations between these two states.
   These two neighbouring countries did not maintain diplomatic relations
   for more than half of the century and their economic relations were
   frozen as the result of extensive economic embargo imposed by the U.S.
   However, following certain subjective but especially objective factors,
   the barriers for development of political and economic cooperation were
   gradually removed from 2008. Despite that, the relations between the
   U.S. and Cuba cannot be characterized as friendly. The countries have
   different social structure and different attitudes toward understanding
   of such terms as democracy and human rights. Objective development in
   the world, especially the processes of social and economic globalization
   lead to the easing of some dogmas and also some social and economic
   changes are visible slow. Normalization of relations between the U.S.
   and Cuba should help to improve economic situation on Cuba. However,
   both players have their own attitude towards the process of
   liberalization of mutual relations and their further development.
   Despite that, there is a resumption of dialogue and cooperation between
   both states.},

Title = {With a Little Help from the Opposition? Relaxing Term Limits in the
   Argentine Provinces, 1983-2017},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF POLITICS IN LATIN AMERICA},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {9},
Number = {3},
Pages = {49-90},
Abstract = {How do incumbents manage to relax term limits when they cannot impose
   their preferences unilaterally? Interpreting constitutional reforms as a
   bargaining game between a term-limited executive and the opposition, we
   argue that reforms involving term limits should be more likely when (a)
   the incumbent party can change the constitution unilaterally, or (b) the
   opposition is pessimistic about its future electoral prospects;
   moreover, (c) this second effect should be stronger when a single
   opposition party has veto power over a reform because this precludes the
   executive from playing a ``divide-and-rule{''} strategy. We examine
   these claims with data from the Argentine provinces between 1983 and
   2017. In line with expectations, the results show that the probability
   of initiating a reform is highest when the executive's party controls a
   supermajority of seats, but falls sharply when a single opposition party
   has veto power over a reform and this party expects to do well in the
   next executive election.},

Abstract = {This article interrogates the state-centric notion of border and
   security in Kashmir and examines the non-state, and non-central
   government, actors in the borderland evolution. It analyses the
   border-related peace initiatives and examines the following questions:
   Are the initiatives purely state centric? Are the non-central government
   actors totally absent in the bordering practice in the Kashmir
   borderland? Is the secondary foreign policy as a tool for cross-border
   cooperation apparent in the region under scrutiny? Secondary foreign
   policy, a concept which has become recently vogue in border discourse in
   Europe, emphasizes on non-federal actors, particularly at a local level,
   and their role in shaping relations in border regions. Drawing on the
   literature on borders and qualitative field research, the article
   examines whether the recent border evolution in Kashmir has witnessed
   activism at two planes: grass-roots non-state actors and non-central
   government.},

Abstract = {The fact that the European elections in 2014 resulted in an
   unprecedented success for Eurosceptic parties raises questions
   concerning the influence of political elites on citizens'
   Euroscepticism. This paper examines whether Eurosceptic messages have a
   different impact when communicated by mainstream right-wing parties vs.
   their more radical counterparts. We do so using data from a survey
   experiment conducted in Germany in 2013. Our results show that
   Eurosceptic messages from mainstream parties significantly increase
   Euroscepticism among voters but that those effects are confined largely
   to ``in{''}-partisans. Furthermore, when a message is effective among
   ``out{''}-partisans, it is due to a combined effect of source and
   message credibility. This holds true for both mainstream and radical
   right parties suggesting that contrary to expectations, the former do
   not enjoy any advantage over the latter in terms of perceived
   credibility.},

Abstract = {Across Europe we see faith-based organizations (FBOs) getting involved
   in the policy field of immigrant integration. The interweaving of the
   policy fields of religion politics and immigrant integration is
   particularly delicate in systems of religion-state cooperation. Here,
   FBOs and state actors build on each other to fulfil certain tasks. This
   paper explores how FBOs are involved in the field of immigrant
   integration and which techniques of government are being used. Drawing
   on empirical case studies from Austria, Germany and Switzerland, the
   paper shows that religious communities fulfil multiple roles as civil
   society actors, as religious representatives or as migrant associations.
   While similarities occur due to comparable structures and institutions,
   observed differences are the consequence of different constellations of
   suspicion and trust between FBOs and state actors.},

Abstract = {The article discusses practices of attributing responsibility as a
   source of the political authority of transnational enterprises. We
   highlight how private enterprises use processes of attribution as a
   source of power and legitimacy, thus producing collectively binding
   trans national regulations. We illustrate our argument with reference to
   environmental protection in the context of deep-sea mining and corporate
   transparency in the field of human rights. Both cases illustrate that
   social dynamics (re-)constitutethe reference object as well as the
   reference subject of responsibility in line with corporate logics of
   action; such re-interpretations create political authority of private
   enterprises.},

Abstract = {Cyberspace is considered as one of the most modern means for conclusion
   of contracts and meeting the obligations arising from that, particularly
   in commercial transactions. The nature of electronic contracts-in terms
   of creditability, form and homogeneity with public disciplines and
   regulations of civil law about the contracts-is a new topic based on
   which recognition and investigation on the legal effects depend on
   formal structure of cyberspace and information and communication
   technology concepts known in this area. Present work mainly investigates
   following items: Electronic contract conclusion and specific properties
   of such agreements, effect of electronic trait on its way of formation
   as well as compatibility of public rules and regulation of electronic
   contracts in Iranian Electronic Commerce Act and UNCITRAL model law.
   Electronic contract principally does not differ traditional ones in
   terms of nature. However, structure of cyberspace has brought up new
   specifications and concepts. A descriptive-analytical method with
   comparative approach were used for data collection. Current rules and
   regulations at contracts area in traditional space seem to not be able
   to completely meet emerging rights in cyberspace but beside traditional
   legal basics, some rules and regulations are necessary to eliminate
   existing confusion by setting determination in modern legal
   uncertainties. Present study tries to answer above queries by assessment
   and comparison of location and time of contract conclusion in Electronic
   Commerce Act and UNCITRAL Model Law.},

Abstract = {This article reassesses the portrayal of aristocratic government in
   Machiavelli's Discourses on Livy. Political theorists working on
   Machiavelli's analysis of regime types have interpreted aristocratic
   republics in the Discourses to be internally stable and isolationist,
   and popular republics to be tumultuous and expansionist. Focusing on the
   issue of stability, I argue that such a clear distinction between the
   two regimes does not in fact exist for Machiavelli. Rather, it is by
   emphasizing close similarities in class relations within aristocracies
   and popular governments that Machiavelli formulates a new understanding
   of the relationship between constitutional form and inequality. Viewing
   the disciplinary laws and redistributive mechanisms of aristocratic
   republics to be insufficient in preventing class conflict, Machiavelli
   overturns a core argument of Renaissance political theory: that a
   politically hierarchical regime could remain just under a constitution
   committed to controlling the effects of private wealth. I draw out
   Machiavelli's critique of aristocratic constitutionalism by re -reading
   his accounts of Sparta and Venice, the two exemplary elite -ruled
   republics in the Discourses.},

Abstract = {On the basis of the theory of normative power, E.Pavlova analyzes
   specifics of the formation of the modern discourse of the European
   identity, where the classic image of ``the other{''} has been gradually
   acquiring new features. By the example of the Spanish party
   ``Podemos{''}, the article shows how the application of special schemes
   to overcome the ``otherness{''}, which are inherent in the mechanism of
   normative power, makes it possible to simultaneously support two
   seemingly opposing regulatory blocks, the EU and Venezuela. The
   theoretical part of the article is based on the research studies devoted
   to the issue of the European identity, above all within the conception
   of normative power of Europe. The empirical part of the article presents
   discourse analysis of the key publications and statements made by the
   leaders of the ``Podemos{''}.},

Abstract = {A high employee engagement has become the new one-best-way across all
   type of organizations. Passion and discretional effort that would
   guarantee productivity for employers and wellbeing for employees. This
   is what renovated management discourses have been promoting for some
   years now and justifies our general objective: a better understanding of
   the potential contradictions associated with employee engagement. We
   conduct qualitative fieldwork at the Spanish subsidiary of a leading
   American multinational of the ICT industry where dedication and passion
   emerge as central in our interviewees' discourses (professionals and
   managers). Passion seems to play a key role to understand a level of
   dedication at work that employees tend to explain as a result of
   personal and voluntary choices, even when risks for work-life balance
   and health and generalized doublethink emerge as contradictions. A
   critical discourse analysis suggests that passion, more than being a
   voluntary choice and/or an end in itself, seems to an insidious strategy
   to enact a mandatory obligation, a means to sustain the work
   intensification process. We find a sophistication of the normative
   control mechanisms, something aligned with emergent neo-normative
   mechanisms in the international literature, that, like their
   predecessors, focus on subjectification processes and identity
   management. Our results would support the growing (con) fusion to
   evaluate the internal/external origin of demands and control in the
   so-called knowledge work, in line with social trends towards activation,
   self-management and entrepreneurship.},

Abstract = {We argue that local, long-term exposure to a centralized political
   authority determines sub-national patterns of contemporary economic
   development. Older research on economic development has focused on
   cross-national income accounts, often ignoring the large sub-national
   variation in income differences. Likewise, research on the effects of
   political institutions on development has mostly neglected sub-national
   variation in the institutional environment. Yet a growing body of work
   shows that the geographic reach of states within countries and their
   ability to foster economic exchange have varied dramatically through
   history. We contribute to recent research on sub-national development by
   creating a new measure of local historical exposure to state
   institutions that codes geographic distance to historical capital cities
   and use highly spatially disaggregated data on economic development,
   based on satellite data, to test their relationship. We find clear
   evidence, using fixedeffects estimations for both European and global
   data, that local historical proximity to capital cities is associated
   with higher levels of economic development. This finding is further
   substantiated through a number of robustness checks covering alternative
   measures, specifications, and sensitivity analyses.},

Abstract = {This paper will study tourism as a site of citizenship formation with a
   particular focus on the arrangements and lived practices of citizenship
   in the Finnish Youth Organization and in a sub-section of Northern
   Ostrobothnian Travel Club between 1965 and 1985. From the perspective of
   the model of citizenship in Finland, modern mass tourism was not
   unproblematic and it was uniquely incorporated in the program and
   activities of the Finnish Youth Organization, underlining the wider
   social and civic utility of tourism. In this paper, the examination of
   archive materials from this particular historical period will provide a
   nuanced understanding of the mutual formation of citizenship and tourism
   at multiple geographical scales and insight into how the model of
   citizenship has been of great importance for mobile people in many ways.},

Abstract = {Private information and the commitment problem are central to the
   rationalist theory of war, but causal evidence is scarce, as rationalist
   explanations for war are difficult to test with observational data. I
   design laboratory experiments to isolate the effects of private
   information and the commitment problem on the risk of conflict. I find
   that the commitment problem sharply increases the incidence of conflict,
   but there is no significant difference in conflict incidence with or
   without private information in the shadow of shifting power. I also
   investigate the realism of the positive experimental results with a case
   study of Japan's decisionmaking on the eve of the Pacific War. The
   permutation of formal, experimental and historical methods applies the
   strength of one method to compensate for the weakness of another.
   Convergent results from the different methods strengthen the causal
   inference.},

Title = {The Effect of Death on Dissolution of Marriage Contract with Emphasis on
   Presumed Death},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF POLITICS AND LAW},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {10},
Number = {1},
Pages = {219-227},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {The dissolution of the marriage contract is either intentional or
   compulsory. The intentional dissolution basically takes place with
   divorce or termination application. But, the unintentional or compulsory
   dissolution means a marriage contract is dissolved automatically and
   without the will of the parties. The most important causes of
   unintentional dissolution include termination, death, expiration (in
   temporary marriages) and. which marriage contract can be dissolved by
   the occurrence of these and some other special causes. One of
   unintentional marriage dissolution causes is death. Death is divided
   into three groups of natural death, presumed death and constructive
   death. Iran's civil law has not pointed directly to constructive death,
   but beside other categories states its conditions and ordinance. There
   is no doubt that natural death triggers a marriage contract to be
   dissolved. There is disagreement among experts of Islamic rules and
   jurists on this matter if presumed death can dissolve a marriage or not.
   But, with study of legal rules related to missing person and the effects
   of the judgment rendered for presumed death, it seems that presumed
   death can dissolve the marriage contract too. And, the divorce
   application sets out at article 1029 of Iran's Civil Law relates to an
   occasion which inheritors have not applied from the court to issue a
   presumed death judgment.},

Abstract = {This article seeks to problematize the issue of pathology and to render
   it intelligible. I elucidate a cultural-political model of a) why
   pathology is prevalent in numerous forms and social domains, and b)
   interventions for ameliorating widespread pathology, and ultimately
   eradicating it. This model draws on the work of Eric Fromm that
   articulates how pathology is characteristic of normal social,
   psychological activity in many or most societies. This article also
   discusses two ways in which prevalent pathology is misunderstood, and
   not corrected, eradicated, or prevented. One misinterpretation is the
   standard biomedical model of pathology. A second misinterpretation is a
   liberal, humanistic, postmodern position that denies all pathology and
   insists that behavior is a positive expression of choice and agency,
   which must be validated and accepted rather than corrected.},

Title = {Persuasive Populism? Estimating the Effect of Populist Messages on
   Political Cynicism},
Journal = {POLITICS AND GOVERNANCE},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {5},
Number = {4},
Pages = {136-145},
Abstract = {Many European countries have seen a growth of populism in recent years.
   Extant research shows that populist parties are increasingly successful,
   and that populist messages appear more frequently in the media. This
   raises the question to what extent populist messages affect public
   opinion. The aim of this study is to assess whether populist messages
   fuel political cynicism by arguing that an arrogant, selfish and
   complacent political elite does not listen to what ordinary people find
   important. Moreover, it assesses whether populist messages affect only
   those already favourably predisposed towards populist parties, or
   whether it affects citizens across the board. The results of a survey
   experiment, conducted in the Netherlands, suggests that individuals who
   are exposed to populist messages are indeed more cynical afterwards than
   individuals who are exposed to a very similar, but more `neutrally
   formulated' message. However, the effects seem to be restricted to
   supporters of populist parties.},

Abstract = {This commentary discusses the state of supranationalism in Latin
   America. We will enumerate the numerous regional organizations in the
   Western Hemisphere, and also discuss their successes and failures at
   regional integration. While integration has had some successes,
   supranationalism has yet to flourish among Latin American states and it
   will probably not for the immediate future. Empirical evidence suggests
   that, while inter-state warfare is scarce in the region, there are still
   too many inter-state tensions, including ongoing border disputes, as
   well as occasional incidents, which prevent supranationalism from taking
   hold. This explains the lack of a North Atlantic Treaty
   Organization-esque type South American bloc. Nevertheless, small-scale
   integration projects have been successful, like visa waivers systems,
   educational programs or defense-cooperation projects. Ultimately, in a
   changing global geopolitical system, the distrust for supranationalism
   remains the same in Latin America.},

Abstract = {Through an analysis of parliamentary debates concerning naturalization
   procedures for stateless children in Estonia and Latvia from
   independence through 2015, this article explores how Russia has
   influenced policymaking toward Russian-speakers. By shifting the focus
   from policy outcomes to the policymaking process, operationalizing
   policymakers as their own field of contestation within the quadratic
   nexus framework, and treating external pressures as strategic
   opportunities for domestic policymakers, I find that Russia has been
   utilized as both a motor and a brake on reform in these cases.
   Nationalizers in both states have used Russia's activism to discredit
   European recommendations and to deflect responsibility for
   Russian-speakers, explaining the delays, controversies and suboptimal
   outcomes surrounding the passage of simplified procedures in 1998,
   despite the use of EU conditionality. While Russia's kin-state activism
   has been used primarily to justify exclusionary preferences in
   post-accession Latvia, it has been harnessed as a motor for reform in
   Estonia, contributing to the passage of an amendment granting
   citizenship to stateless children at birth in 2015.},

Abstract = {This article examines the prevalence of organized political violence in
   Nigeria and in the process explores its causative and sustaining
   factors. Literature on the discourse of organized political violence in
   Nigeria is robust in its analyses. This article proposes that the
   emergence and sustenance of organized political violence in Nigeria is a
   direct result of elite political culture in Nigeria. A qualitative
   approach was used in sourcing and analyzing evidence from the field and
   historical records to examine key arguments that support this assertion.
   It was discovered that the political environment of Nigeria has defined
   elite political culture to be largely grounded on zero sum politics,
   politicization of violent and nonviolent conflicts, and identity
   politics. These observations underscore elite political culture as a
   consistent phenomenon in the development and sustenance of organized
   political violence in the State. This article serves as a framework for
   the examination of identified elements of elite political culture that
   foster the emergence and sustenance of organized political violence in
   Nigeria.},

Abstract = {Community-based action research (CBAR) encourages students to view
   internships and other civic-engagement opportunities as the first steps
   in collaborative projects that build long-term relationships with
   community partners and model how democracy works. We marshal
   longitudinal data, qualitative and quantitative, on both attitudes and
   behaviors to demonstrate meaningful impacts of community-based work by
   university students. Our approach to this difficult question involves
   the use of a treatment group contrasted with two distinct control
   groups: one situated somewhat closely to the experiences of the
   treatment group and one more distantly. Despite the difficulty of
   developing metrics of attitude and behavior change over relatively short
   periods of time, we achieve leverage on the question of how project
   pedagogies and experiential learning shape civic attitude formation and
   associated changed behaviors.},

   Workers' Labor Unions in the Supreme Court},
Journal = {NEW POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {39},
Number = {1},
Pages = {1-16},
Abstract = {In Harris v. Quinn (2014), the United States Supreme Court used
   disability rights rhetoric of independence and control to argue that
   disabled people-not the State-are the real employers of in-home care
   workers. Consequently, the State cannot force care workers to pay labor
   union fees. Justice Alito's majority decision interprets the employment
   contract as a capacity contract: a device that uses the recognition of
   equal cognitive capacity to obscure domination. Alito ignored the
   vulnerability of disabled people and in-home care workers to legitimize
   neoliberal cutbacks. In her dissent, Justice Kagan argued that disabled
   people, care workers, and the State forge multiple and iterative
   contracts. Using Kagan's dissent, Charles Mills's critique of ideal
   theory, and Susan Burgess and Christine Keating's participatory social
   contract, I argue that an emancipatory contract must replace cognitive
   capacity as the condition of membership with the recognition of shared
   human vulnerability amid oppressive conditions.},

Journal = {AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE},

Volume = {52},
Number = {3},
Pages = {367-382},
Abstract = {Political contestation within liberal democratic states is an important,
   albeit limited, guide in defining how these states domestically
   implement their international human rights obligations. While often
   ritualistically endorsing human rights standards, political actors allow
   themselves a limited policy space with their domestic political contest
   circumscribed by more pervasive influences, often at odds with the
   state's international commitments. This article examines recent health
   and housing policy initiatives by Australia's two major political
   parties and assesses them against its international commitments.
   Applying a social constructivist approach, this article argues that the
   dominant neoliberal political discourse and the state's institutional
   structure set contextual boundaries to the parties' policy contestation
   and reveal the limited influence of domestic political contestation in
   determining Australia's rights implementation.},

Pages = {311-332},
Abstract = {This article analyses specifics of the process of ethnic identity
   formation in the Balkans in some comparison with Western European
   national identity construction. It ascertains that Balkan nationalism is
   based not on assimilation of local communities into the national whole
   as in the West but on dissolution of local communities by constructing
   out of them ethnic communities. Ethnicity construction was born from a
   severe rivalry around which one of the ethnic definitions would be
   imposed on a single local group. The article concludes that civic vs.
   ethnic models of nation-formation are applicable for the region.},

Abstract = {China and the European Union (EU) are the world's first and third
   biggest energy consumers today. Owing to the physical distance and the
   fact that both China and the EU are energy-importers, there has thus far
   been a relative lack of interaction in the energy field. Few existing
   studies of China-EU relations focus on energy issues. While China became
   the world's biggest energy consumer, largest carbon-emitter as well as
   largest investor in renewable energy in 2011, the EU has been facing
   challenges in securing its energy supply because of domestic antagonism
   towards nuclear power and a worsening relationship with Russia. Adding
   also the role of energy-related carbon emissions in the international
   climate change negotiations, energy became a crucial area for
   cooperation for world players like China and the EU. This article
   examines the China-EU energy interaction, especially the perceptions of
   the EU's role. The analysis is based on primary empirical data from
   three research projects. It finds that China has yet to view the EU as a
   prominent global energy player or even a major energy partner. Instead
   of passively receiving norms sent by the EU in the energy dialogues,
   this article argues that China has been a selective norm-taker.},

Volume = {5},

Pages = {80-92},
Abstract = {The impetus for the Bangladesh Sustainability Compact was the Rana Plaza
   industrial disaster, which took the lives of roughly 1,200 garment
   workers and injured twice. The Compact required the fulfilment of
   several time-bound commitments by the Bangladesh government in two key
   areas-labour law reform and protection of the right to freedom of
   association and ensuring fire and building safety. The EU heralded the
   Compact as an innovative, multilateral approach to encourage its trade
   partners to comply with ILO core labour rights. The editors of this
   issue of Politics and Governance asked the contributing authors to
   examine effectiveness of trade and labour standards and to consider
   alternative mechanisms to advance workers' rights. Specifically, they
   queried whether the Compact could be considered a new and effective
   alternative model. This hope appears misplaced.},

Title = {Does Reacting to the Past Increase Student Engagement? An
   Empirical Evaluation of the Use of Historical Simulations in Teaching
   Political Theory},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE EDUCATION},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {13},
Number = {1},
Pages = {46-61},
Abstract = {Within the teaching of political theory, an assumption is emerging that
   Reacting to the Past simulations are an effective tool because they
   encourage greater student engagement with ideas and history. While
   previous studies have assessed the advantages of simulations in other
   political science subfields or offered anecdotal evidence of their
   effectiveness in political theory courses, less attention has been paid
   to the empirical assessment of simulations in political theory. This
   study uses data - in the form of presimulation and postsimulation
   surveys, as well as focus groups - collected from two political theory
   courses in order to gauge levels of student engagement inside and
   outside of the classroom. We ask if students' levels of engagement
   increase during the simulation in their political theory courses. We
   also explore the mechanisms involved in driving higher levels of student
   engagement during the simulation. We conclude by arguing that it is the
   liminal nature of the Reacting to the Past simulations that most likely
   explains increased levels of student engagement.},

Abstract = {In A Theory of Justice John Rawls argues that self-respect is `perhaps
   the most important' primary good, and that its status as such gives
   crucial support to controversial ideas like the lexical priority of
   liberty. Given the importance of these ideas for Rawls, it should be no
   surprise that they have attracted much critical attention. In response
   to these critics I give a defense of self-respect that grounds its
   importance in Rawls's moral conception of the person. I show that this
   understanding of self-respect goes well beyond giving support to the
   lexical priority of liberty, also supporting Rawls's still more
   controversial view of public reason. On my account, taking self-respect
   seriously requires the coercive enforcement of public reason. This is a
   novel argument for public reason, in that it grounds the idea in justice
   as fairness and mandates its coercive enforcement.},

Abstract = {The forms of legal advice given to employees has rarely been the subject
   of inquiries that deal with the legal activity of French unions. A
   comparison is made between two sorts of advice: advice that is delivered
   by activists at the lower levels of three unions and advice that is
   delivered by the labor inspectorate by means of an ethnographical
   inquiry. The article emphasizes two aspects of the activity: the
   translating of difficulties in the workplace and feelings of injustice
   into legal categories, and filtering the legal demands of the employees.
   It also highlights the political dimension of such an activity. The
   inquiry helps to point out some differences between the two types of
   actors, according to organizational and professional logics.},

Abstract = {This chapter considers Orwell by Gordon Bowker and Orwell: Life and
   Times by Scott Lucas. In a contrarian way, it suggests Orwell was a
   hopeless optimist: in Nineteen Eighteen-Four, he thought that rulers and
   indeed ruled, would care enough about history to want to rewrite it! Did
   George W. Bush know or care? Would President Donald Trump? The ignorance
   surrounding the 2003 Iraq War was truly Orwellian and his work gives
   intellectual tools to understand manufactured amnesia and false memories
   on this scale. In stark contrast, Scott Lucas's biography is effectively
   a sustained polemic against its subject. That has, in Orwell's words
   about totalitarian language, ``a curious mouthing sort of quality, as of
   someone who is choking with rage and can never quite hit on the words he
   wanted,{''} and it is a prescient description of Lucas's treatment.},

Abstract = {The Chinese state has installed the residents' committee as a form of
   self-governance organization in each residential area in the cities. It
   is, however, challenged by the homeowners, a social group that has newly
   emerged as a result of China's economic liberalization. To protect their
   own rights, the homeowners created homeowners' committees' as an
   alternative organizational channel for participation. Moreover, they
   manage to merge individual homeowners' committees into larger
   homeowners' associations, thus expanding the site of citizenship
   practice from the grassroots level as endowed by the state to the civil
   sphere. When the homeowners act as political actors addressing their
   collective issues and influence the dynamics of citizenship, they
   collectively construct a democratic citizenship from below. From this
   aspect, citizenship in contemporary China is by no means a
   top-down-created process but is an outcome of the complex interplay
   between the state's top-down initiation and the citizens' bottom-up
   construction.},

Abstract = {The paper has the objective of thinking about the current conditions of
   political thought in LatinAmerica. To this end, a critique is made to
   the reception of the political philosophies of Antonio Gramsci and Louis
   Althusser in the academic left and postulates the necessity of an
   ontological-anarchist turn in the political thought. To establish the
   political ontological performance of contemporary anarchist thought, the
   essay performs a double strategy. First, it suspends the common place
   which establishes anarchy exclusively as a way of life. Second, it
   argues in favor of the possibility of understanding anarchy as a
   political ontology capable of investigating the configurations of the
   existent as a dissemination of imaginable possibilities. Finally, the
   essay explores the critical figure of the marrano to indicate the
   possibility of an-archaeological logic to think about the conceptual
   problems of Latin American politics.},

Abstract = {Richard Nixon's 1972 ``opening to China{''} is regarded as one of the
   most significant moments of U.S. foreign policy during the Cold War.
   Through his rhetoric before, during, and after his visit to the People's
   Republic of China, the president moved from established metaphors of
   communist nations and peoples as ``savage enemies{''} and descriptions
   of ``Red China{''} as a nation ``lost{''} to communism to a narrative
   that suggested openness and friendship. In this essay, we argue that
   Nixon's use of spatial, territorial, and orientational metaphors such as
   ``journey for peace,{''} ``open the door,{''} ``bridge,{''} ``wall,{''}
   ``common ground,{''} and ``close the gulf,{''} compounded with his
   physical presence in China, are key for understanding the force of his
   rhetoric during this shift in U.S. Cold War foreign policy. In
   discursively and politically opening transnational U.S.-China relations,
   Nixon weakened the polarized East-West ideological and geographic divide
   and provided a new vision of Cold War geopolitics.},

Abstract = {A country that has not gone through a revolution, India has been the
   crucible of several reform movements as early as the nineteenth century.
   But none of them intended to break with the past. They even sometimes
   prepared the ground for revivalism. In parallel, Hindu traditionalism
   developed in reaction to social and cultural change. In the twentieth
   century, these schools of thought found political expressions in the
   Congress party where they inhibited the fights against the caste system
   and land reform. These trends continued after 1947, in reaction to
   Nehruvian views, till conservative Congressmen created the Swatantra
   party and then the Congress (O).},

Abstract = {This article examines the Canadian Charter with reference to ``the
   British connection{''} and ``the Americanization thesis.{''} It also
   attempts to demonstrate the importance of Montesquieu's The Spirit of
   the Laws in addressing these issues. Pierre Trudeau insisted that a
   Charter of Human Rights would provide Canadians with a new beginning and
   settle difficult questions about the Canadian identity. His critics said
   that fundamental rights were already protected because Canada had a
   constitution similar in principle to the United Kingdom, and that the
   proposed Charter was a step in the Americanization of Canada. What a
   Montesquieuean analysis helps to identify are significant limitations in
   both ``the British connection{''} account and ``the Americanization
   thesis.{''} And, by the avoiding the abstract universalism of Trudeau's
   ``inalienable rights{''} theorizing and Dworkin's ``rights as trumps{''}
   regime, a Montesquieuean analysis also helps to demonstrate the
   distinctiveness of Canadian constitutionalism from Confederation to the
   Charter.},

Title = {Who Is Responsible for the Gender Gap? The Dynamics of Men's and Women's
   Democratic Macropartisanship, 1950-2012},
Journal = {POLITICAL RESEARCH QUARTERLY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {70},
Number = {4},
Pages = {749-761},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {I argue the gender gap is a function of men and women changing their
   partisanship as they seek the best representation of their gendered
   social identity from the political parties. Specifically, shifts in the
   parties due to party realignments and shifts in the composition of
   parties' congressional delegations have provided individuals with a
   clearer signal on which to base their partisan attachments. Men and
   women have responded differently to these signals and developed
   different political identities over the past seventy years, resulting in
   the gender gap in partisanship. To test this theory, I have constructed
   an innovative macro-level dataset of men's and women's partisan
   attachments on a quarterly basis between 1950 and 2012. I use a
   Seemingly Unrelated Regression framework to estimate patterns of men's
   and women's Democratic macropartisanship and whether particular factors
   contribute to the gender gap by having different effects on men's and
   women's partisanship. The results are consistent with my theoretical
   expectations, highlighting how symbolic images shape partisan
   attachments, and demonstrate the gender gap is a function of changes in
   both men's and women's macropartisanship.},

   Rica, El Salvador and Honduras. For this purpose, we specified Mixed
   Mutinomial Probit models and found that ideological proximity had a
   relevant effect on voters' choices. Moreover, the ideological distance
   between those citizens and the candidates affected the latter
   differently, depending on the partisan context in which they were
   competing.},

Abstract = {The United States' South Asia strategy has been based on the calculation
   of its overall national security priorities. In practice, when U.S.
   priorities are at odds with those of other regional powers, Washington
   tends to adopt a ``no-expectations{''} psychological approach toward its
   regional partners to avoid disappointment, a technical ``de-hyphenation
   strategy{''} to improve policy efficiency, and practical cost-benefit
   analysis to evaluate the effectiveness of its South Asia strategy.
   However, Washington often has to come to terms with the realities on the
   ground with regard to its leadership role in South Asia. For the time
   being, Washington has articulated its strategic objective in South Asia,
   that is, a regional balance of power in favor of the United States
   vis-a-vis its perceived competitor, China. Therefore, it has conducted
   conditional cooperation with Pakistan and Afghanistan on land, and
   committed support for India on security issues in the Indian Ocean, so
   as to hedge against China's growing presence in South Asia. The
   enhancement of U.S.-India defense and security cooperation has fueled
   China's suspicion of India's intention to join the U.S.-led coalition
   against it. By the logic of balance of power, the United States will
   continue to regard India as a strategic counterweight to China, which is
   likely to increase the possibility of strategic tensions and conflicts
   between China and India that may finally entangle the United States.},

Abstract = {Where and how have precolonial institutions of conflict resolution
   remained intact? Although it is often argued that traditional
   institutions can play a key role in managing communal conflicts, little
   is known about the conditions of their survival. This article argues
   that historical, political, and cultural topographies are essential to
   understanding patterns of the persistence and demise of precolonial
   institutions. Traditional modes of conflict resolution remain strong
   where they have been internalized over centuries: in the cultural and
   political centers of precolonial states. I use original geocoded survey
   data and historical spatial information on precolonial Burundi to
   analyze this hypothesis. The estimations yield robust correlations
   between the geographic patterns of the precolonial kingdom and current
   modes of resource-related conflict resolution.},

   actual impact of deliberation. Can deliberation enhance European
   identity? We specifically address this question by using deliberative
   polling quasi-experiment that involved random sample of 348 European
   citizens in 2 days deliberation on issues of European concern. The
   comparison of citizens' sense of belonging to both EU and nation states
   before and after deliberation, allowed us to explore the effects of
   deliberation on identity and further test it against the control group.
   The analyses show that when European citizens are enabled to deliberate
   on European issues beyond national borders their exclusive national
   identity decreases and they become more community minded. The observed
   transformation of identities is further analyzed in order to explore the
   relationship between European and national identity. The analyses
   indicate that even after deliberative treatment in which European
   identity has been activated the relationship between multiple identities
   remains compatible.},

Abstract = {The polarization of political parties in the United States is a
   well-documented phenomenon. This paper considers polarization of the
   judicial branch and relates it to the evolution of the parties. In this
   paper we define polarization specifically as movement from a modal
   distribution (of votes, attitudes, or decisions) to a bimodal
   distribution along a liberal-conservative spectrum over time. Using data
   compiled from 90,000 United States District Court decisions published in
   the Federal Supplement between 1934 and 2008, we find that the judiciary
   began to polarize in the 1960s and has remained polarized. We consider a
   number of competing explanations for the polarization of the district
   courts, including a top-down view that emphasizes presidential power and
   a bottom-up view that focuses on the sorting of elites that form the
   pool of potential judges.},

Abstract = {The theory of deliberative democracy is here furthered in terms of three
   images that locate its essence in respectively a single forum, a
   deliberative system, and an encompassing polity featuring particular
   integrative norms. The first two are ubiquitous, though contested, the
   third is stated here. Deliberative theorists need to contemplate how
   practices that make sense in each image connect to the other two. Forums
   only make sense when linked in a system that can synthesize very
   different deliberative virtues (notably, justification, reflection, and
   inclusion). Any system's democratic qualities can only be evaluated in
   terms of the polity. While judgment in terms of the conditions of
   normative integration in the polity is therefore primary, particular
   forums can promote deliberative authenticity in a system, and systems
   enable inclusive application of deliberative ideals. Deployed in this
   way, the three images help solve internal disputes and respond to
   critics.},

Abstract = {Neoliberalism is a slippery concept, neither intellectually precise nor
   political useful. It is used so widely, to mean such different things,
   that it becomes almost impossibly vague, while dissimilar international
   experiences of social change undermine the sweeping designation provided
   by most presentations of neoliberalism. The term is too often used as a
   catch-all category or as a category that catches selectively whatever a
   particular author chooses and disapproves. It is a word of the academic
   `left', accepted neither by our opponents, the supposed neoliberals, nor
   in popular discourse, and its use perpetuates a self-referential world
   of our own. There is little new or liberal in the ideas or practices of
   `neoliberalism'. The term is politically unhelpful, little use in
   identifying strategic priorities. A tendency to reproduce a binary,
   which posits the state as good and market as bad, is particularly
   unhelpful.},

Abstract = {The signing of a comprehensive peace agreement (CPA) is often seen as a
   historic milestone in a peace process, and its implementation takes a
   highly legitimized set of reforms and puts it front and center in
   national politics. This article examines the aggregate implementation of
   CPAs signed since 1989 and future conflict behavior between the
   negotiating parties and between the government and non-signatory groups.
   It argues that implementation is both a peace-building process and an
   outcome that normalizes political relations between hostile groups,
   solves commitment problems and addresses the root causes of civil
   conflict. Statistical tests utilizing new data on the implementation of
   CPAs support the argument. The extent to which an agreement is
   implemented is shown to have significant long-term effects on how long
   peace lasts - an effect that applies not only to the signatories of the
   agreement, but also to the government and non-signatory groups.},

Abstract = {This article examines how the level of social trust varies between
   different party supporters in four Nordic countries. We aim to offer new
   interpretations concerning the associations between party preference and
   social trust by examining social activity, social status and
   institutional confidence of political party supporters. Our data are
   derived from the Danish, Finnish, Norwegian and Swedish sections of the
   European Social Survey including three recent rounds with over 20,000
   observations. We found that the level of trust among the supporters of
   populist parties is relatively low in each country. Differences between
   parties may not be explained completely by respondents' perceived social
   activity or institutional trust. Our results also suggest that higher
   societal status does not affect social trust similarly across party
   groups. In country comparison, we found that the supporters of populist
   parties are not as isolated in Finland as elsewhere. The article
   concludes with a discussion on interconnectivity between social trust
   and cultural homology, which is channelled by citizens' political
   preference.},

Title = {Enhanced Cooperation, EMU Reforms and Their Implications for

Abstract = {Initially, before the entry into force of the Maastricht Treaty,
   differences in integration between members of the European Communities
   (EC; later the European Union) were relatively few and usually temporary
   in nature. The Schengen Agreement, the Maastricht Treaty and the Treaty
   of Amsterdam, and the possibility of establishing enhanced cooperation
   meant that the problem was becoming more and more important in the
   functioning of the EU-both in theory and in practice.
   The objective of the paper is to show that for several years, along with
   the stagnation in the deepening of integration between all the EU Member
   States, differentiation of integration in the EU is progressing very
   rapidly. The progressing differentiation in the EU is a consequence of
   mainly two processes: the development of enhanced cooperation and
   reforms in the eurozone, which are strengthened by the widening of the
   EU.
   The article covers the issue of the categorization of differentiation of
   European Union integration, which constitutes the theoretical framework
   for further considerations. Specified processes which contribute to
   increasing the differentiation of the EU are discussed, showing the
   development of enhanced cooperation in the EU and presenting the reforms
   of the eurozone. The article concludes with the identification and the
   consequences of differentiated integration, both those that have already
   occurred and those that may occur in the future.},

Journal = {COMPARATIVE EUROPEAN POLITICS},

Volume = {15},

Abstract = {This article examines whether gender affects candidates' position on the
   economic and cultural dimensions of political competition in nine West
   European countries. Using data from the Comparative Candidate Survey, we
   find that female candidates hold, on average, more liberal views than
   their male party colleagues. These gender differences vary according to
   the nature of issues. Female candidates are more liberal than their
   party colleagues on the cultural dimension, but we find no systematic
   differences in policy preferences on economic issues. Moreover, gender
   differences vary according to parties' ideological position on the
   left-right scale with a more pronounced gender gap in right-wing
   parties. Our findings contribute to the literature on female candidates
   and on the impact of women in politics more broadly.},

Abstract = {Pacific diplomacy has entered a new chapter in the twenty-first century;
   it should chart a strategic course among diverse geopolitical agendas,
   new and multiple actors, including beyond the traditional nation state,
   and evolving regional identity politics. Often on the receiving end of
   soft diplomacy from the established and rising powers of the
   Indo-Pacific seeking to exert influence, the Pacific Island nations face
   real consequences of transnational challenges such as climate change and
   marine resource depletion, and are crafting their own pragmatic
   diplomacy. The emerging Pacific approach suggests that aspects of
   network diplomacyleveraging bilateral, multilateral, and multi-actor
   relations to forge issues-based coalitions around a common goalwill
   increasingly become a necessary feature of Pacific states seeking to
   navigate shifting geopolitics, and situate themselves within an emerging
   Indo-Pacific region.},

Title = {Sub-Saharan Africa: Societal Reintegration of Ex-Militant Youths},
Journal = {CONFLICT STUDIES QUARTERLY},

Abstract = {This is a study of how militant youths in Sub-Saharan African conflict
   areas reintegrated into civilian life after they were granted Amnesty.
   Specifically, the study explored what reintegration means to different
   segments of the society and how the amnesty programs fit these
   descriptions, the extent to which the ex-militants are reintegrated into
   civilian life socially, economically and politically, the contextual
   factors that make reintegration difficult and how the different forms of
   capital acquired by the ex-militants during and after the crisis have
   transformed. The area of study was the oil rich Niger Delta region of
   Nigeria where sixty ex-militants and eighteen community leaders from
   Ijaw, Urhobo and Itshekiri ethnic groups were selected for the study.
   Questionnaire, interviews and focus group discussions were employed to
   generate the needed data. Findings revealed that the way the
   reintegration package was carried out fell short of what the
   ex-militants and the communities perceive reintegration to be. As a
   result, the ex-militants have not been effectively reintegrated into
   civilian life. Factors such as failure to address the cause and effects
   of the conflict, alienation of the communities in the amnesty program
   and inability to find substitutes for the ex-militants hindered
   effective reintegration. Meanwhile, the different forms of capital
   acquired by the ex-militants have undergone some transformation much of
   which was used for clandestine activities. The study recommends that
   reintegration exercise should be based on the context that produced the
   conflict and that communities should be directly involved in its design
   and implementation.},

Title = {Do Rural Migrants Divide Ethnically in the City? Evidence from an
   Ethnographic Experiment in India},
Journal = {AMERICAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE},

Volume = {61},
Number = {4},

Abstract = {Despite rapid urbanization across the Global South, identity politics
   within rural-urban migrant communities remains understudied. Past
   scholarship is divided over whether village-based ethnic divisions will
   erode or deepen within diverse poor migrant populations. I assess these
   divergent predictions through an ethnographic survey experiment'
   (N=4,218) among unique samples of poor migrants in India. Contra
   conventional expectations, I find intra-class ethnic divisions are
   neither uniformly transcended nor entrenched across key arenas of
   migrant life. Instead, I observe variation consistent with situational
   theories predicting ethnic divisions will be muted only in contexts
   triggering a common identity among migrants. I pinpoint urban employers
   and politicians as these triggers. Poor migrants ignore ethnic divisions
   when facing these elites, who perceive and treat them in class terms.
   However, migrants remain divided in direct interactions with each other.
   These bifurcated findings imply poor migrants may be available for both
   class-based and ethnic mobilization in the city.},

Journal = {BRITISH JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {47},
Number = {4},
Pages = {749-782},

Abstract = {Scholars argue that states undertake foreign military interventions for
   economic reasons, yet few have investigated whether intervention
   produces economic benefits. This article answers this question in the
   context of US foreign-imposed regime changes (FIRCs) in Latin America.
   Because FIRCs install leaders who are sympathetic to the intervener's
   interests, economic arguments maintain that these interventions should
   increase bilateral trade between the targets and imposing countries. Yet
   security-based arguments assert that FIRCs should have little economic
   effect, as regime changes target threats rather than generate economic
   benefits. A third perspective argues that FIRCs reduce trade by
   generating political instability, which causes foreign firms to cut back
   on their involvement and domestic firms to experience difficulty getting
   goods to market. To test these competing arguments, this study employs a
   novel dataset on bilateral trade (1873-2007) compiled through archival
   research in Washington, DC. Using a gravity model and synthetic
   controls, it finds that FIRC produces an average decrease of 45 per cent
   in the dollar value of bilateral trade. Further analysis of archival
   sector-level data and case studies cast doubt on alternate explanations.},

Abstract = {Following the fallout between Russia and the West, Moscow embarked on a
   strategy to make its energy industry a foreign policy tool. In this
   context, it engaged Turkey in an effort to assert itself in the European
   market and solidify control over it. Looking to implement its pivot to
   the East, Russia has also sought to become a major energy producer in
   Asia by squeezing competitors out of the region. The Middle East came
   into the spotlight for Moscow when it decided to hedge its bets in the
   energy sector and gain more control over global markets. To that end,
   Russia pursued mutually beneficial cooperation with the GCC states to
   make the market more predictable. Russia has also come forward as a
   major energy supplier for former Soviet clients in the Middle East.},

Abstract = {Mediation as a means of consumer dispute resolution is a widespread
   practice amongst Spanish consumer ADR entities, both public and private,
   in spite of the lack of data aggregation. Despite its remarkably wide
   implementation, our system hardly envisages any provisions to support
   its regime. This study aims to contribute to the debate on the structure
   of Spanish consumer mediation, as key in guiding the future legislative
   activity with a view, among other objectives, to transposing Directive
   2013/11/EU on alternative dispute resolution for consumer disputes. In
   light of European Law, the author highlights the need to focus future
   legislation in such a way as to take into account the analysis of
   current interests and the requirements of internal legislative policy,
   without ignoring the practice of consumer mediation by ADR entities.},

Year = {2017},
Volume = {17},
Number = {3},

Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Most state supreme court justices have time-bound terms that require
   them to be reappointed or reelected after a certain amount of time. In
   three American states, South Carolina, Vermont, and Virginia, the
   legislature has the sole power to retain justices. Legislatures, and
   their specialized judiciary committees, are well positioned to monitor
   judicial behavior and can reject retention for justices who are
   unacceptable. This turns the legislature's oversight authority into
   influence over policy making by justices who still need to be
   reappointed to additional terms. But some justices (co-partisans) are
   insulated from this influence by their connections to the majority
   party, which substantially increases the likelihood of their retention.
   I show that, between 1995 and 2014, justices appointed by the minority
   party who were eligible for a new term voted more in line with the
   preferences of their legislature than those who were no longer eligible
   for a new term due to mandatory or voluntary retirement. No similar
   effect is found among appointees of the majority party. To support my
   argument that it is the legislature's reappointment authority that gives
   them this power, I conduct a placebo test to show that governors in
   these states enjoy no comparable influence on reappointment-seeking
   justices. This legislative influence represents a substantial limitation
   on judicial independence.},

Abstract = {In this article, the author proposes a re-examination of the Hegel-Marx
   connection, with particular regard to the presence in Marx's critique of
   political economy of categories and structures drawn from Hegel's logic.
   Through a discussion of the so called ``homology thesis{''} (the idea
   that the functioning of capital represents a historical embodiment of
   Hegel's idealistic logic, that is, of the domination of ``pure form{''}
   over the concrete), the Author maintains that the relation between
   Capital and Hegelian logic should be reframed as follows. Firstly, he
   argues that Marx's critique shares the Hegelian aim of unravelling the
   quasi-natural activity of logical categories. Secondly, he shows that
   Hegel's ``system of needs{''} displays a peculiar relation between
   universality and particularity that corresponds to political economy as
   an eminent example of ``intellectual{''} science, while Marx's notion of
   capital allows the construction of the critique as a ``philosophical
   science{''} in the Hegelian sense. Thirdly, he maintains that
   interest-bearing capital is to be conceived of not only as the highest
   point of reification, but also as the real starting point of the
   monetary circuit, and that in this latter function it proves to be even
   more ``Hegelian{''} than in the former. As a result of this renewed
   interpretation, a more adequate picture of the complex ontological and
   methodological relation between Hegel and Marx becomes possible.},

Abstract = {The liberal justification for censorship equates the harm in hate speech
   with the sort of tangible injury that would justify state intervention
   under J.S. Mill's harm principle. Recently, Jeremy Waldron has suggested
   that the real harm perpetuated by hate speech is less tangible, taking
   it to be a variety of moral pollution which undermines both the public
   good of inclusiveness and the minority's assurance of personal dignity.
   This paper scrutinizes Waldron's conception of the harm in hate speech,
   arguing that it lacks the specificity and gravity Mill's principle
   requires in order to justify censorship. The paper also questions the
   categorical distinction between hate speech and speech that is ``merely
   offensive,{''} arguing that Waldron's reasons for censoring the one also
   apply to the other. The result is a censorship regime that liberals
   ought not to accept.},

Abstract = {In an extractive economy with territorially uneven costs and benefits,
   who should decide the fate of oil and mining projects: directly affected
   minorities or national citizenries? I reframe this question empirically:
   How are the collective identities and interests attached to various
   scales of democracy politically constructed in the increasingly frequent
   conflicts over resource extraction in Latin America, and what can we
   learn from these conflicts about broader dynamics of democratic
   contestation? To answer this question, I propose the concept of scaling
   democracy: the agonistic processes by which the scales of democratic
   decision-making and the democratic people are contested, established,
   and transformed. The concept of scaling democracy draws our attention to
   the ways in which the collective identities and interests attached to
   the various scales of democracy are constructed. These
   interest-articulations and collective identities are shaped by available
   institutional norms, organizational infrastructures, and social
   meanings. I draw on data from participant observation of a community
   mining consultation in Ecuador, and show that participatory institutions
   in the arena of resource extraction have fueled a contentious process of
   scaling democracy, with broader implications for the study of
   participatory democracy and scholarship on the relationship between
   resource-dependency and democracy.},

Title = {Constitutional courts as veto players: Lessons from the United States,
   France and Germany},
Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL RESEARCH},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {56},

Abstract = {The number of constitutional courts and supreme courts with
   constitutional review rights has strongly increased with the third wave
   of democratisation across the world as an important element of the new
   constitutionalism. These courts play an important role in day-to-day
   politics as they can nullify acts of parliament and thus prevent or
   reverse a change in the status quo. In macro-concepts of comparative
   politics, their role is unclear. Either they are integrated as
   counter-majoritarian institutional features of a political system or
   they are entirely ignored: some authors do not discuss their potential
   impact at all, while others dismiss them because they believe their
   preferences as veto players are entirely absorbed by other actors in the
   political system. However, we know little about the conditions and
   variables that determine them as being counter-majoritarian or veto
   players. This article employs the concept of Tsebelis' veto player
   theory to analyse the question. It focuses on the spatial configuration
   of veto players in the legislative process and then adds the court as an
   additional player to find out if it is absorbed in the pareto-efficient
   set of the existing players or not. A court which is absorbed by other
   veto players should not in theory veto new legislation. It is argued in
   this article that courts are conditional veto players. Their veto is
   dependent on three variables: the ideological composition of the court;
   the pattern of government control; and the legislative procedures. To
   empirically support the analysis, data from the United States, France
   and Germany from 1974 to 2009 is used. This case selection increases
   variance with regard to system types and court types. The main finding
   is that courts are not always absorbed as veto players: during the
   period of analysis, absorption varies between 11 and 71 per cent in the
   three systems. Furthermore, the pattern of absorption is specific in
   each country due to government control, court majority and legislative
   procedure. Therefore, it can be concluded that they are conditional veto
   players. The findings have at least two implications. First,
   constitutional courts and supreme courts with judicial review rights
   should be systematically included in veto player analysis of political
   systems and not left aside. Any concept ignoring such courts may lead to
   invalid results, and any concept that counts such courts merely as an
   institutional feature may lead to distorted results that over- or
   under-estimate their impact. Second, the findings also have implications
   for the study of judicial politics. The main bulk of literature in this
   area is concerned with auto-limitation, the so-called self-restraint' of
   the government to avoid defeat at the court. This auto-limitation,
   however, should only occur if a court is not absorbed. However, vetoes
   observed when the court is absorbed might be explained by strategic
   behaviour among judges engaging in selective defection.},

Abstract = {Explicitly and implicitly in The Spirit of the Laws, Montesquieu binds
   together the Japanese who persecute Christians and the Inquisitors of
   Catholicism who persecute heretics. In seeking purity, both sets of
   vehement reformers impose atrocious punishments. In so binding the
   abuses of the East and West together, the work is an expression neither
   of Orientalism nor of Eurocentrism as conventionally understood.
   Although Montesquieu thus offers a critical approach to Europe's
   vulnerability to reformers who go to extremes, whether pious zealots who
   seek to perpetuate Christianity or zealous Enlightenment philosophes who
   would seek to eradicate it, many commentators have focused on the work's
   apparent neutrality with regard to the various cultural phenomena it
   examines. The key to understanding Montesquieu's reserved tone lies in
   his commitment to moderation. Given the West's continuing vulnerability
   to extremism of various types, Montesquieu's moderate teaching on the
   need for moderation in corrections remains pressingly relevant.},

Abstract = {This work incorporates factual disagreements as a conceptual hinge
   between responsibility and responsiveness. Within this conceptual
   framework, I analyze the policy of debt relief carried out by the
   Argentine Government between 2003 and 2014. Based on this analysis, it
   is argued that, although there is a consensus that responsiveness is a
   positive attribute for democracy, its existence does not always become a
   valuable fact for the quality of democracy. In order for this to take
   place, responsiveness must be accompanied by the legitimacy of factual
   disagreements, which has not occurred in the analyzed period. This paper
   describes the existence of a deficient institutional performance within
   the National Public Credit Office to process and legitimize factual
   disagreements, which has prevented the government's responsiveness
   towards citizens to lead to an improvement in the quality of Argentine
   democracy.},

Abstract = {One of the obstacles to democratic development is the reluctance of
   political leaders to leave office. This article argues that alongside
   democratic constraints and accountability, leaders' career
   concernspecifically, the possibility of post-tenure careersis an
   important factor behind their rotation in office. While literature
   exists about leaders' exit and fate, we lack a systematic understanding
   of their careers and whether former rulers retire, remain in politics,
   or pursue civil service, business, international, or non-profit careers
   after leaving office. Drawing on the new data on the prior- and
   post-tenure occupations of leaders from 1960 to 2010, the article
   explains how democracy, personal background, and the economy influence
   what ex-leaders can do, and why. In turn, over time the post-tenure
   careers of prior rulers may strengthen the precedent behind the
   institutional routinization of the rotation in office norman important
   component of democratic consolidation.},

Abstract = {We propose a format for presenting experimental results that combines a
   graph's strength in facilitating general-pattern recognition with a
   table's strength in displaying numerical results. The format supplements
   a conventional bar graph with additional text labels and graphics but
   also can be based on a dot plot. The resulting enhanced bar graph
   conveys general patterns about treatment effects; displays point
   estimates and confidence intervals for all key quantities of interest
   relevant to testing hypotheses (e.g., first differences in the mean of
   the dependent variable); and clarifies the interpretation of these
   quantities as treatment effects. Presenting information in a single
   figure avoids the need to devote scarce journal space to both a graph
   and a table. Moreover, an enhanced bar graph prevents readers from
   having to move back and forth between a graph and a table of numerical
   results-thereby reducing their cognitive load and facilitating their
   understanding of the findings.},

   began a process of mourning in search of the claim of their rights. The
   work developed in the year 2015 in the Granada - Cundinamarca

   to determine how do women's experiences promote the diffusion of
   collective memory and the rebuilding of their social fabric? For this
   purpose, a descriptive ethnographic research was carried out, which

Abstract = {This article aims to make the relationship between the principles of
   autonomy and beneficience (and non-maleficence) within the ethics of
   health professionals (mos especially the medical profession), seeking to
   demonstrate that there is a proper and healthy relationship between
   doctor and patient (service user health) is essential to respect the
   principle of autonomy, behold, every human being must be recognized as
   an end in itself. Medical activities by understanding procedures
   involving life, health and physical integrity of individuals, must be
   guided by principles and values varied - and sometimes conflicting, such
   as autonomy and beneficence, why often health professionals face ethical
   dilemmas difficult to solve when the practice of their activies. Thus,
   the principles advocated by secular bioethics (autonomy, beneficence and
   justice) ares the basis for the reflection of the actions to be taken in
   the held of health - in particular medicine. The increasing valuation
   given to the principle of autonomy - as qell as, the principle of
   informed consent - changed the doctor-patient relationship (user of
   health services), removing the supremacy of the principle of beneficence
   (derived form Hippocratic ethics) and, via consequence, the coexistence
   of both principles in the relationship between health professionals and
   patients, results for both the responsibility for the decisions taken
   during clinical practice.},

Abstract = {This paper assesses the most important theories that have reflected on
   the reasons why the law must be obeyed (leaving aside the Theory of the
   State classical authors, as they did not develop their writings in the
   context of a democratic system). It also addresses the reasons that
   could justify disobeying the law. The paper argues that an ethical
   justification for obedience to the law exists in a democratic system.
   Following this, the article proposes the existence of an individual
   moral reason with more weight than the first, which may justify breaches
   of the law. Naturally, dissidence against the rule of law for
   ideological reasons is not always justified, even though moral reasons
   are involved. Thereby, to conclude the paper assesses the position the
   legal system can, and should, adopt, when confronted with an ethically
   motivated infringement of the law.},

Abstract = {The Political theology of J. B. Metz points out a fundamental problem in
   the twentieth century to the statement: << The superman means first and
   foremost the imminence of death of man >> (Foucault, 1970: 371) proposed
   by Michel Foucault in 1968. From a deep research on that statement, the
   Political Theology of Metz assume the responsibility of motivate the
   three categories rebirth to the subject: Narrative, Memory and
   Solidarity. This research is a hermeneutical study of these three
   categories, but solidarity devote special attention in these category.
   In conclusion, the legitimate position of theology to oppose any
   scientific theory that wants to reduce man to an object, especially
   Michel Foucault, that expresses the human heart does not exist or is
   arguing that the word humanism would be abstract, making man a
   self-referential system that is more likely a machine than God's
   creation.},

Abstract = {Based on the liberal and positivist philosophies, during the Gomez's
   time a selective immigration was made, that praised the white element
   from the West as the only ``able{''} population to achieve the ideals of
   material and civilizing progress. Under this rationalization a state
   racism was created, where Chinese and Syrian communities, among others,
   were rejected by the authorities that saw as a potential threat their
   growing presence in the country. Based on these considerations, the aim
   of this research is to explain immigration policy in Gomez's times, to
   see how other cultural groups were discriminated based on a state
   racism. To carry out this work the methodology of history is used, from
   the location, arching and analysis of documentary sources contained
   mainly in the Memories of the Ministry of Development. It is concluded
   that in Gomez's times were ruled racist policies against non-Western
   corporate groups to prevent their entry or stay in the Republic.},

Abstract = {The Democratic Party (PD) is the only reasonably organized party in the
   Italian de-structured party system. It is itself undergoing a process of
   transformation. It defies all traditional party definitions. It is no
   longer a class-based mass party and not even a mass party. Nobody within
   the party believes that such a party can resurrect. It shows many
   features of a catch-all party, but some of them are by far more
   prominent than others. It is not simply an electoral-professional party
   since its aims go beyond just winning the elections and it relies more
   on internal resources than on outside professionals. At this point, the
   most appropriate definition is that of a personalist party cum factions.
   This article tries to explain : (1) how the PD has acquired a dominant
   position in Italian politics; (2) how its leader has been elected by
   members and sympathizers of the party; and (3) how much he is trying to
   transform the PD into a vehicle pursuing his personal ambitions. Much of
   what Matteo Renzi will achieve or fail to obtain depends on the new
   electoral law and on the opposition mounted by some actors, especially
   the Five Stars Movement. The easiest forecast is that in the short-run
   the Italian party system will remain de-structured providing
   opportunities, but also volatility risks for the PD and its leader.},

Title = {The impact of elite frames and motivated reasoning on beliefs in a
   global warming conspiracy: The promise and limits of trust},
Journal = {RESEARCH \& POLITICS},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {4},
Number = {3},
Month = {JUL-SEP},
Abstract = {Given the potential attitudinal and behavioral impact of Anthropogenic
   Global Warming (AGW) conspiracy beliefs, it is important to understand
   their causes and moderators. Here, two explanations for the variation in
   these beliefs are engaged: the first is the choice among elites to frame
   AGW using the phrase `global warming' (GW) as opposed to `climate
   change' (CC); the second is partisan motivated reasoning. A theory is
   then developed about the role of trust in moderating the impact of the
   two frames on AGW conspiracy beliefs. In the case of CC, which is
   perceived as less severe than GW (and is therefore less identity
   threatening among Republicans), it is hypothesized that trust will
   moderate hoax beliefs among Republicans. In the case of GW, where the
   implications of existence beliefs have policy consequences that are more
   unpleasant, motivated reasoning will `win out', and trust will not
   moderate conspiracy endorsement among Republicans. The results from an
   original question framing experiment are consistent with the author's
   hypotheses. Whilst trust is a welcome commodity to those looking to
   persuade citizens to support AGW-ameliorating policies, it is not a
   cure-all, especially in the face of elite partisan cues that edify
   pre-existing attitudes/identities and arouse a strong desire to engage
   in motivated reasoning.},

Abstract = {Immunity from execution means that the criminal court verdict against a
   natural person who is resident in the country as a foreign government's
   representative is not enforceable. Its philosophy is the good
   performance of diplomatic missions and compliance with the general
   principle of the sovereignty of states whereby no state should be judged
   by another state or another state's laws are applied to it. Despite some
   views that under certain circumstances and with certain existential
   context continue to invoke the immunity, there is no doubt that the
   dominant approach of courts in civilized societies is to accept the
   immunity of property and governing activities of states and to reject
   their immunity about their possessive properties and activities. Here we
   review some proceedings which can clearly demonstrate through
   argumentative and legal bases that the sovereignty of the politics over
   the law and justice is already over.
   The following cases will be examined in this study: Swiss company NOGA
   vs. Russian Federation, the US company Creighton vs. the State of Qatar,
   Swiss company Ektimon vs. the Government of the Socialist Republic of
   Libya, and the Central Bank of Iran vs. Peterson.},

Journal = {ROMANIAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {17},

Month = {SUM},
Abstract = {In this article, we use the Institutional Analysis and Development
   framework in order to assess the state of the commons and of the
   organizational form known as Obstea Mosnenilor in a communal village
   from Romania, Dragoslavele. We employ the design principles proposed by
   Ostrom in order to show how a critical juncture, the imposition of the
   communist regime, changed the operational rules-in-use. After it was
   dismantled in 1949, the obste was reestablished in 2000 and most of the
   formal rules have been adopted in their original form. However, the
   circumstances in which the obste operated had changed during the
   communist regime. Some of the most significant changes that occurred
   during this period and during the transition period had been the
   deterioration of the social capital and the fact that the villagers had
   ceased to rely on the commons as the main income-source. We assess the
   state of the commons and whether collective action problems are solved
   in the obste by resorting to the design principles proposed by Ostrom in
   her evaluation of the institutions that govern common-pool resources. We
   conclude that respecting those 8 design principles to a certain degree
   does not suffice in the absence of social capital, and that the
   Dragoslavele obste cannot be considered a robust institution according
   to our definition (we consider an institution to be robust if it is able
   to avoid the tragedy of the commons).},

Abstract = {Governors have always had to balance state interests with political
   party interests. However, governors' role in the federal arena, which
   historically has had a significant bipartisan element, has shifted
   somewhat, today placing a greater emphasis on party interests. This
   change is one of the degree; it is less a sea change than a change in
   the salinity of the sea. I provide evidence of this move to more
   partisan behavior and explore two sets of interrelated factors that have
   influenced this change: party polarization in Congress and state
   legislatures and among voters, and the structure, activities and
   influence of the National Governors Association, Democratic Governors
   Association, and Republican Governors Association. This article
   represents an initial effort to tease out some of the varied causal
   effects and establish a framework for scholars to further explore the
   dual gubernatorial responsibilities of advancing state interests and
   party interests.},

Abstract = {Minor parties in American politics often struggle to gain support due to
   the phenomenon of strategic voting, as they rarely field viable
   candidates. However, in several US states, fusion (a process by which
   multiple parties may nominate the same candidate) averts this obstacle
   by allowing minor parties to cross-endorse major-party candidates.
   Although major parties are known to perceive these fused ballot lines as
   electorally advantageous, their value in terms of additional votes for
   fusing candidates has not yet been systematically studied. Focusing on
   US House of Representatives elections in New York (where fusion is
   prevalent) between 1952 and 2014, I demonstrate that, under certain
   conditions, fusing with minor parties improves major-party candidates'
   electoral performance by substantialand, occasionally, electorally
   decisiveamounts.},

Abstract = {Recent federal court decisions have deregulated state campaign finance
   systems to a significant degree. These decisions are not only rooted in
   First Amendment jurisprudence but also raise issues of federalism.
   Although most studies of federal-state conflict focus on disputes
   between state officials and elected federal policy makers, courts are
   also policy-making institutions, and in the absence of policy making by
   other federal branches, courts have become the critical federal policy
   maker in this area. In response to U.S. Supreme Court rulings that
   deregulate campaign finance rules and are out of step with the policy
   preferences of many state electorates and officials, states are
   attempting to resist these rulings, but using different approaches than
   are used by states in disputes with the Congress or President. We
   discuss these rulings and state responses to them. We also describe the
   implications of these dynamics for federalism.},

Abstract = {A key development during the Obama Administration was the increasing
   importance of state attorneys general (AGs) in national policymaking.
   This article examines the dual role that AGs played during the Obama
   years. The first role was highly contentious, with Republican AGs
   leading several multistate challenges to Obama Administration priorities
   and successfully limiting President Obama's policy legacy. The second
   role was more cooperative, involving increasing coordination between AGs
   and their federal counterparts in national enforcement efforts. Relying
   on case studies in the areas of immigration enforcement, climate change
   regulation, and the oversight of for-profit higher education, this
   article highlights several crucial trends concerning the activities of
   these important state-level actors.},

Abstract = {Can politically polarizing events bear dividends for extremist
   lawmakers? Evidence from California legislative financial disclosures
   suggests they can. During the state's numerous budget shutdowns of the
   last 30 years, extremist legislators outside their party median could
   expect greater fund-raising hauls than their more centrist counterparts.
   The results suggest that polarizing events such as California's
   perennial budget impasses can make extremist positions more appealing to
   the polarized political elites who generally fund political campaigns.
   Regardless of the motivation, however, these results suggest a strong
   incentive to prolong political discord by extremistsa troubling outcome

Abstract = {This article focuses on the research of Stalinist repression in Estonia,
   observing the work done within the past 25 years. Understandably, many
   studies have concentrated on victims and repressive institutions. The
   public concern for the topics in the 1990s has considerably declined in
   recent years. Although by today we have an excellent overview of
   committed acts of violence, there are numerous aspects that require
   in-depth research. It is necessary to notice not only the victims and
   perpetrators, but also common citizens' forms of action both in crucial
   and everyday situations. The engagement of fellow-citizens in various
   punishment operations, staging ``guilt{''} and confrontation, and other
   similar maneuvers caused tensions in the population and as such
   facilitated the established control over society. Mapping various
   measures taken by the state and the experiences gained by different
   social groups is an essential stage in interpretation of tough times.
   This work needs to be continued.},

Abstract = {In this essay, I argue for the inclusive advantage of John Rawls's The
   Law of Peoples through a critical engagement with the political
   development of modern China. I start by introducing some recent
   developments in contemporary Chinese political theory, showing why it is
   now theoretically difficult to imagine that China can be incorporated
   into a liberal international order as a liberal society. In the main
   body of the essay, I conduct a comparative study of Joseph Chan's
   Confucian perfectionism, a Confucian-inspired political theory embedded
   in Chinese cultural tradition and constructed for modern China, and the
   Law of Peoples. The purpose is to reveal (a) that there has already
   existed a school of Chinese political thought that will incorporate
   China into the Law of Peoples as a decent Confucian-inspired society and
   (b) that such a society will accept its global responsibility designated
   by the duty of assistance yet reject a global difference principle in
   the global original position. I conclude by suggesting how this
   potential inclusiveness of the Law of Peoples may help to remove some of
   new disturbance to the ideal of a just and stably peaceful world.},

Abstract = {This study examines the effects of civic consciousness and civil
   disobedience on individual attitudes toward, and participation in,
   contentious politics. Using the newly collected survey data on civic
   consciousness and civil disobedience in Taiwan in 2015, this study finds
   that both civic consciousness and civil disobedience are significantly
   associated with individual support for and engagement in contentious
   politics. Specifically, people with strong civic consciousness and civil
   disobedience are more likely to support the Sunflower Movement and take
   part in contentious political activities such as rallies, marches, and
   strikes. The findings imply that as the ideas of civic consciousness and
   civil disobedience prevail in a democracy, the public will be more
   likely to choose to use contentious political activities to express
   their opinions instead of institutional and legal approaches when the
   government is unable to respond to public needs in a timely manner.},

Abstract = {Negotiations between federal and state officials are a mainstay of
   intergovernmental relations, but the politics of negotiation have been
   largely understudied. In this article, we provide a window on those
   politics by examining the development of the Arkansas premium assistance
   waiver-an early and influential Medicaid waiver. We examine the leverage
   of both the federal and state governments in their efforts to reach
   agreement on a plan that suited both sets of actors. The federal
   government was providing funding important to the state, but the state
   had the capacity necessary to put a program in place. The federal
   government wanted some type of expansion in a Southern state; Arkansas
   wanted to do it ``their way.{''} Also key to the Arkansas case is the
   persistence and shared vision of the federal and state actors who in the
   end trusted each other and produced a policy both were proud of.},

Abstract = {Due to institutional fragmentation and conflicts among various actors, a
   systematic reform to improve the effectiveness of the global energy
   governance system has become increasingly urgent. Currently, the Group
   of Twenty (G20), which consists of the world's major economies and
   constitutes 60 percent of global energy trade, is in a good position to
   remold the global framework for energy governance. The past G20 summit
   meetings have witnessed more attention and efforts from member-state
   leaders to address problems associated with global energy. However, most
   of the discussion has been focused on technical issues rather than a
   comprehensive review of the whole governance system. In the future, the
   G20 should take proactive measures to enhance its leadership role and
   policy innovation in the reform of global energy governance, in order to
   spur green development of the world. As the largest developing nation,
   China should tap into the G20 platform to advance the transformation of
   its domestic and international energy systems.},

Abstract = {South Africa's cities are focal points in any contemporary snapshot of
   the country. Their swift transformation within the national landscape
   means that they now affect or even dominate every other element within
   it. Its cities and their burgeoning populations have become defining
   characteristics of the country with their increasing political sway and
   growing contribution to the national economy. For many people living in
   cities, their urban affiliation is stronger and more meaningful than an
   increasingly abstract and distant national affiliation. Cities are
   important to national branding because they are localised and tangible
   points where national perception and reputation often originate or are
   reinforced. For many stakeholders it is city brands that contribute most
   directly to their perceptions of the national brand in areas such as
   ease and security of investment, economic status, liveability, tourism,
   personal interaction or safety and security. This article considers
   South Africa's largest cities, their competitive positions within the
   country, in Africa and across the globe, and it does so with a measure
   of inclusive urbanisation that is relevant to a wide spectrum of South
   Africa's stakeholders - national and international business and
   investors, institutions, government and citizens.},

Abstract = {A large body of aggregate-level work shows that government policies do
   indeed respond to citizen preferences. But whether citizens recognize
   that government is responsive is another question entirely. Indeed, a
   prior question is whether or not citizens value responsiveness in the
   way that academic research assumes they should in the first place. Using
   comparative data from the European Social Survey, this article examines
   how citizens see government responsiveness. We show that several key
   assumptions of the aggregate-level literature are met at the individual
   level. But we also present results that show that attitudes toward
   representation and responsiveness are colored, sometimes in quite
   surprising ways, by winner-loser effects. In a finding that stands in
   some contrast to the normative literature on the topic, we show that
   these sorts of short-term attitudes help shape preferences for models of
   representation. In particular, we show that the distinction between
   delegates and trustees is a conceptual distinction that has limits in
   helping us to understand citizen preferences for representation.},

Abstract = {This article questions the argument that we need a post-functional
   theory of European integration. We suggest instead that the integrative
   mechanisms of classical neofunctionalist theory explain advances in
   European integration in the twenty-first century, especially if
   incorporated into a broader understanding of policymaking grounded in
   the multiple streams approach. Neofunctionalist mechanisms, in our
   understanding, work by changing the contents of the problem, politics
   and policy streams, systematically biasing all three toward integrative
   solutions to European problems. We illuminate our argument with two
   cases of integration in health policy, namely communicable disease
   control and health technology assessment. In these areas, as with other
   areas of European Union health policy, substantial European integration
   has taken place since 2000 despite long-standing member state reluctance
   to integrate and Lisbon treaty language discouraging integration.},

Abstract = {The European Commission initiative on collective redress was a failed
   attempt to introduce a form of class action in the European Union.
   Business organizations were firmly opposing the proposal, while citizen
   interest groups were mobilized to support it. The outcome was rather
   puzzling because some previous research suggests that business
   organizations in the European Union most often find themselves
   unsuccessful in defending the status quo, especially in the field of
   environmental and consumer protection. Business lobbying success in this
   case is explained by the low media salience of the issue and diverging
   preferences among public officials. The article illustrates how lobbying
   success in the European Union can also be achieved by maintaining the
   status quo and contributes to our understanding of contextual factors,
   most notably the role of policymakers.},

Title = {The effect of political trust and trust in European citizens on European
   identity},
Journal = {EUROPEAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {9},
Number = {2},
Pages = {161-181},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {In the literature, two approaches toward the development of a European
   identity can be distinguished. Society-based approaches assume that the
   most important foundation for the development of a European identity is
   trust toward other European citizens as this allows Europeans to
   identify with the European Union as a community of citizens and values.
   The institutional approach, on the other hand, assumes that a shared
   European identity is predominantly based on trust in political
   institutions. In this paper, we use the results of the IntUne Mass
   Survey 2009 (n=16,613 in 16 EU member states) to test the relationship
   between social and political trust on the one hand, and European
   identity on the other. The results suggest that trust in other European
   citizens is positively associated with European identity, but trust in
   the European political institutions has a stronger relation with
   European identity. This could imply that efforts to strengthen European
   identity cannot just rely on a bottom-up approach, but should also pay
   attention to the effectiveness and the visibility of the EU institutions
   and the way they are being perceived by European citizens.},

Abstract = {What explains minority language recognition? Why are some governments
   more responsive than others to minority linguistic demands? While there
   are reasons to believe democracies - as protectors of civil liberties -
   are generally more likely to recognize minority demands, I argue only
   those without a sizable majority extend such recognition to the highest
   levels. This is because the dominance of one large linguistic group
   electorally impedes a democratic government's ability to grant such
   benefits to the smaller ones. I test this argument by using a newly
   constructed measure of minority language recognition. This variable
   identifies whether a minority language is used in public education, and
   if so, it differentiates between instruction of and instruction in a
   minority language. I find that while democracies are indeed more likely
   to acknowledge minority languages, the effects are conditional: only
   those without a majority are able or willing to accommodate minorities
   to the fullest extent. Otherwise, when there is a tyranny of the
   majority, democracies behave no differently than their dictatorial
   counterparts. The results - robust to different measurements of
   majoritarian politics - hold important implications for our
   understanding of democracy and its ability to satisfy demands in divided
   societies.},

Abstract = {How is populism distributed over the political spectrum? Are right-wing
   parties more populist than left-wing parties? Based on the analysis of
   32 parties in five Western European countries between 1989 and 2008, we
   show that radical parties on both the left and the right are inclined to
   employ a populist discourse. This is a striking finding, because
   populism in Western Europe has typically been associated with the
   radical right; only some particular radical left parties have been
   labeled populist as well. This article suggests that the contemporary
   radical left in Western Europe is generally populist. Our explanation is
   that many contemporary radical left parties are not traditionally
   communist or socialist (anymore). They do not focus on the proletariat',
   but glorify a more general category: the good people'. Moreover, they do
   not reject the system of liberal democracy as such, but only criticize
   the political and/or economic elites within that system.},

Abstract = {This paper presents the findings of a review of literature to understand
   the issues facing the Sultanate of Oman in this area, and to identify
   international examples of best practice in the use of social media to
   promote political literacy among young people. Evidence-based
   recommendations for the Government of the Sultanate of Oman are
   developed, which include the provision of social media literacy training
   at school and university level, as well as the establishment of an
   online citizen engagement portal. By adopting international best
   practice in the use of social media to promote political literacy and
   citizen engagement among young people, it is believed that the Sultanate
   of Oman can provide a model for other Middle Eastern Arab states,
   helping to reduce the potential for political conflict in these
   countries and promoting participatory approaches to policy-making which
   reflect the growing demands of young citizens.},

Abstract = {This paper uses a laboratory experiment to examine how different rules
   for re-selecting the leader of a group affects how that leader builds a
   winning coalition. Leaders play an inter-group game and then distribute
   winnings from that game within their group before standing for
   re-selection. The results of the experiment show that leaders of groups
   with large winning coalition systems rely heavily on distributing
   winnings through public goods, while leaders of groups with small
   winning coalition systems are more likely to target specific citizens
   with private goods. Furthermore, the experiment shows that supporters of
   small coalition leaders benefit from that support in future rounds by
   receiving more private goods than citizens that did not support the
   leader. Meanwhile, citizens that support a large coalition leader do not
   benefit from this support in future rounds. Therefore, small coalition
   leaders target individual citizens to maintain a coalition over time in
   a way not possible in a group with a large winning coalition. Finally,
   in the experiment, small coalition leaders increased their payoffs over
   time, suggesting that once power has been consolidated, small coalition
   leaders narrow their coalition.},

Abstract = {Academia has become an increasingly common political target,
   particularly the institution of academic tenure, which many conservative
   politicians accuse of helping to perpetuate the ideological
   indoctrination of students. This study focuses on students' perceptions
   of professors' ideology by examining the link between student ideology,
   professor favorability, and perceptions of professors' ideology. We
   employ an original survey instrument and find that, rather than forming
   perceptions of their professors' political views based on their
   professors' actual positions, students tend to project their own
   ideology onto their professor, based on the extent to which they like
   their professor.},

Abstract = {This article considers the hypothesis that the positive actions taken by
   members of Congress (MCs) influence citizens' evaluations of them, their
   party, and Congress as an institution. We begin with a look at the
   available cross-sectional survey data on contact with legislators and
   legislator and institutional approval. Their legislative responsiveness
   appears to have a small spillover effect on institutions. However, when
   we employ a unique panel design that controls for prior levels of
   opinion and avoids recall bias, we find no evidence of spillover
   effects. Overall, we find that constituents who received a response from
   their own MC evaluate that representative more positively than those who
   did not receive a response, but legislator responsiveness does not
   predict evaluations of the MC's political party or the Congress.},

Abstract = {Policy science, particularly the policy network approach, is teeming
   with new studies and concepts. This abundance has resulted from the
   inescapably multidisciplinary approach of policy science and from our
   ambition to surpass traditional policy analysis. The field's concepts
   are developing so rapidly, however, that new hybrids and mutations
   threaten us with confusion and overcomplication rather than providing us
   with clarity, and cumulative improvement and theory development are thus
   hampered. These unintended consequences are intimately associated with
   errors of conceptual stretching, that is, using valuable concepts with
   clear meaning to refer to inapplicable phenomena, thus misusing and
   diminishing the value of our conceptual tools. In policy science, this
   is also the case with central analytic tools, frameworks, models, and
   theories. Therefore, although policy making can be messy, if we hope to
   escape the alleged impasse in policy science, we cannot afford to
   tolerate the current inaccuracies of conceptual stretching.},

Abstract = {The notion that cultural characteristics influence political regimes
   remains popular, despite mixed supporting evidence. In particular,
   democracy is argued to emerge and thrive in countries where liberal or
   freedom-oriented values (so-called self-expression values) are
   widespread. Inglehart and Welzel, for instance, report such an effect,
   mainly drawing inferences from cross-country comparisons. Yet
   cross-country correlations between self-expression values and democracy
   could stem from different processes. Reinvestigating this relationship,
   this article finds no empirical support when employing models accounting
   for sample-selection bias, country-specific effects and the endogeneity
   of values to democracy. Self-expression values do not enhance democracy
   levels or democratization chances, and neither do they stabilize
   existing democracies. In contrast, this study finds indications that a
   country's experience with democracy enhances self-expression values.},

Abstract = {For some years now the clamour for the democratisation of internal party
   politics has been spreading. This issue has been addressed in Italy and
   France. In the run-up to the 2013 parliamentary election in Italy and
   the 2012 presidential election in France, leftist coalitions held open
   primary elections to select their chief executive candidates, with Pier
   Luigi Bersani and Francois Hollande finally emerging as nominees. In
   this article, we examine whether the levels of turnout and competition
   in the party primaries are associated with the results of the general
   election. Using data at the level of the Italian province and the French
   departement, we show that the results of the general election were
   affected by the primaries. We show that turnout enhanced electoral
   performance, while competition depressed it. The positive effects of
   turnout were greater than the negative effects of competition.},

Abstract = {Partisan voters are optimistic about electoral outcomes: their estimates
   of the probability of electoral success for their party are
   substantially higher than the average among the electorate. This has
   large potential implications for political bargaining. Optimistic
   electoral expectations make costly bargaining delay look more
   favourable, which may induce partisans to punish their party for
   agreeing to a compromise rather than waiting, for example by not turning
   out to vote. Party decision makers should take this into account when
   bargaining. We set up and analyse a simple game theoretic model to
   explore the implications of partisan optimism for political bargaining.
   We show that increased optimism among a partisan group leads to a
   stronger bargaining position for their party, but may hurt its electoral
   prospects. Another main finding is that even high levels of partisan
   optimism do not in themselves cause inefficient bargaining delay.},

Month = {APR},
Abstract = {How does network structure influence opinion? Relying on theories of
   preference formation and social networks, we randomize a sample of
   adults into networks that vary in structure. In one (a clustered
   lattice), individuals' connections tend to be connected to each other;
   in another (a random network), individuals' connections tend not to be
   connected, instead providing access to different regions of the network.
   We seed messages that reflect competing sides of policy debates in each
   network: one underdog viewpoint is seeded less often, while a dominant
   viewpoint is seeded more often. We track their diffusion and find that
   the random network increases exposure to underdog views, compared with
   the clustered lattice. Individuals in the random network subsequently
   learn more about the policy debates and become more sympathetic toward
   the underdog perspective. This has implications for how less funded
   information campaigns can strategically target social networks to
   maximize exposure and change minds.},

Abstract = {Taking into proper account the geographic distribution of ethnic groups
   and the operation of electoral systems within individual countries
   reveals that the impact of ethnic diversity and electoral systems on the
   number of parties has been underestimated. Contrary to earlier findings,
   this study reveals that ethnic diversity spurs party proliferation in
   countries with both majoritarian and proportional electoral systems,
   though the effect is stronger in the latter. The insights gained here
   provide a theoretically derived measure of ethnic diversity that is
   useful for estimating its effect on specifically political phenomena and
   generating an improved holistic measure of the impact of electoral
   systems. More crucially, the results indicate that electoral system
   designers have a greater capacity to structure electoral outcomes. The
   results rely on multivariate models created using a new database with
   election results from 1990 through 2011 in sixty-five free democracies.},

Abstract = {Recent decades have seen issues of asylum seeking and border security
   feature heavily in Australian federal elections, with significant
   campaign time and money dedicated to the promotion of border security
   policies that seek to limit the number of boats carrying asylum seekers.
   In this article, we investigate the language of threat and the
   construction of asylum seekers as a threat to national security, we
   suggest that this language can be traced to the 2001 Tampa crisis, and
   that while there have been brief phases where a humane approach to the
   arrival of asylum seekers was present, the asylum seeker issue overall
   has been exploited by major political parties to generate positive
   election outcomes at the expense of Australia's humanitarian
   obligations. We argue that the current perception of Australia's border
   protection laws are a form of compassionate deterrence, where inhumane
   treatment of asylum seekers is justified on the basis of saving
   lives.{''}},

Abstract = {This essay argues that attention to Adam Smith's ironic framing of his
   historical narratives in the Wealth of Nations shows his critique of
   modern commercial society to have been more radical than is generally
   recognized. These narratives traced the pathologies of European
   development and the complex chains of causation that linked Smith's
   readerswith often destructive and even catastrophic resultsto other
   human beings distant from themselves. While Smith gave reasons to doubt
   that sympathy for distant others could bring about reform, I argue that
   he used irony and what he called ridicule to make the book's British
   audience aware of the violence of the global commercial system and their
   place in it as both abettors and lesser victims of its abuses.},

   the members of the tribal council and a part of the barangay council of
   San Luis, Malitbog, Bukidnon. The study uses qualitative approach and
   the data is interpreted by means of descriptive analysis. The study
   shows the different cases of social discords by which the tribal council
   heard. It also presents the resolution processes, the nature of penalty
   imposed and the interface of the tribal council and the barangay
   (village) justice system vis-a-vis resolution of conflicts. It also
   presents the problems encountered by the tribal council in the
   resolution of conflicts. The study identi fies eight cases of social
   discord, namely: thievery, fighting, murder, misunderstandings,
   adultery, land conflicts, contempt against rituals and conflicts
   involving rebels. The resolution processes of the Higaunon tribal
   council varies from one conflict to another. Upon the filing of a
   complaint, the tribal council would then schedule the time and place for
   hearing the case. Sala (penalty) varies according to the nature of the
   offense. Conflicts involving non-Higaunons are resolved by the sitio
   (zone) representative.},

Abstract = {During the process approving the Cadiz constitution, the Bourbon Nueva
   Planta was, for the first time, revoked in a legal manner with regard to
   Catalonia. The Catalan deputies preferred the installing of a moderate
   monarchy, as a form of government based on the separation of powers and
   a nation state based on national sovereignty. Of course, they differed
   in the precise form of this organization. As was underlined by the 1812
   Constitution, Antonio de Capmany and Jose Espiga advocated for a
   politically centralized and culturally uniform state. On the contrary,
   Aner favoured recognizing the particularities of the provinces or
   kingdoms that made up the extensive and heterogeneous Hispanic Monarchy.
   Finally, it should be pointed out that federalism, republicanism and
   democracy were considered political anathemas.},

Abstract = {Presidential scholars and baseball writers debate who were the greatest.
   While baseball analysis evolved from qualitative impressions of
   ``experts{''} to rigorous, data-driven ``sabermetrics,{''} analysis of
   presidential greatness continues to rely on ``old-school{''}
   reputational rankings based on surveys of scholars' qualitative
   assessments. Presidential-congressional relations and baseball are all
   about winning, but what fans (of sports and politics) find most
   intriguing is Wins Above Expectations (WAE)-did the team do better or
   worse than expected? This paper adapts the Pythagorean Expectations (PE)
   formula developed to analyze baseball to assess legislative success of
   presidents from Eisenhower to Obama. A parsimonious regression model and
   the PE formula predict annual success rates with 90\% accuracy. The
   estimates of WAE from the two approaches, however, are uncorrelated.
   Regression analysis does not identify any president who systematically
   exceeded expectations, but sabermetric analysis indicates that
   Republican presidents outperform Democrats. Neither approach correlates
   with recent presidential greatness rankings.},

Abstract = {Although Prime Ministers (PMs) often have the constitutional right to
   fire ministers, their ability to exercise this power is contingent on
   institutional rules and party politics. This article focuses on the
   relative powers of Presidents, PMs and political parties over cabinet
   composition in semi-presidential systems. Several expectations regarding
   their ability to fire ministers are tested on an original dataset on the
   tenure of French ministers under conditions of unified government and
   cohabitation. The analysis shows that presidential influence over
   cabinet composition strengthens during unified government. Although the
   influence of both PMs and parties increases during cohabitation, their
   bearing on cabinet composition varies less than expected across the two
   executive scenarios. Moreover, ministerial durability is shown to
   increase during cohabitation. These results highlight the impact of
   intraparty constraints on prime ministerial influence and the
   asymmetrical relation between executive format and the ability of the
   President and the PM to control executive decision making.},

Journal = {AMERICAN POLITICS RESEARCH},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {45},
Number = {2},
Pages = {224-255},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {We report findings from an experiment where participants read a story
   about a speech that sharply criticized U.S. foreign policy. The story
   varied how elites framed the speech, the speaker's apparent ethnicity,
   and the content of the speech. We assess how each of these factors
   affected not only tolerance judgments but also inferences about the
   speaker's motives and the likely consequences of the
   speech-considerations that play a central role in free speech
   jurisprudence. Troublingly, we find that the effects of elite framing
   and the speaker's apparent ethnicity are often comparable with the
   effect of the speech explicitly calling for violence. Our design also
   allows us to assess the extent to which the effectiveness of elite
   framing is constrained by ``facts on the ground.{''} However, we find
   little evidence that the framing effects we identify depend on the
   content of the speech or the speaker's ethnicity.},

Abstract = {What is the legacy of Japanese colonial rule in East Asia? In this
   article, I use a geographic regression discontinuity design to examine
   of the long-run effects of Japanese rule over northern China. I find
   that the Japanese colonization of northern China had a positive long-run
   effect on state institutions-with persistent increases in schooling,
   health, and bureaucratic density. I also find suggestive evidence that
   colonization led to increases in wealth, as measured by census data and
   nighttime luminosity. The positive legacy of Japanese colonization in
   northern China suggests that intense state building efforts can pay
   long-run dividends, even in the context of a brutal and extractive
   regime.},

Abstract = {For over eight decades, Fianna Fail demonstrated a remarkable capacity
   for successful adaptation to cope with a turbulent and increasingly
   uncertain electoral environment. Unlike many dominant parties that rely
   principally on state resources to bolster their organizational reach,
   Fianna Fail has demonstrated a knack for adapting to challenges in more
   nuanced and variegated ways to reinforce its long-term advantages within
   the Irish party system. This article highlights two overarching
   strategic adaptations, in particular. First, it underscores how Fianna
   Fail's capacity for ideological adaptation has contributed to
   constraining the electoral arena, thereby preventing minor parties from
   successfully claiming hot-button issues and instead re-directing
   competition towards the their party's relative ability to deliver goods
   and services locally. Second, it places in high relief Fianna Fail's
   capacity to employ extra-parliamentary institutional adaptations within
   the Irish political system, including the national system of wage
   bargaining, referenda, and tribunals at times when it suits the party
   electorally. Taking into account these adaptive strategies is essential
   for understanding Fianna Fail's uncanny electoral staying power.},

Abstract = {Voters are often uninformed about the political candidates they choose
   between. Governments, media outlets, and civic organizations devote
   substantial resources to correcting these knowledge deficits by creating
   tools to provide candidate information to voters. Despite the widespread
   production of these aids, it remains unclear who they reach. We collect
   validated measures of online voter guide use for more than 40,000
   newspaper readers during a state primary election. We show this
   newspaper-produced voter guide was primarily used by individuals with
   high levels of political interest and knowledge, a finding in contrast
   to earlier hypotheses that providing guides directly to voters online
   would reduce disparities in use based on political interest. A field
   experiment promoting the voter guide failed to diminish these
   consumption gaps. These results show that the same content preferences
   that contribute to an unequal distribution of political knowledge also
   impede the effectiveness of subsequent efforts to close knowledge gaps.},

Abstract = {This study sheds light on how new Eurosceptic parties are received and
   interpreted by the media. It does so by analysing the quality press
   coverage of three specific cases: the Movimento Cinque Stelle (M5S)
   (Italy), the Alternative fur Deutschland (AfD) (Germany) and the Team
   Stronach (TS) (Austria). These cases represent non-extremist Eurosceptic
   challengers to the political establishment, which capitalized upon the
   Euro Crisis and competed in national elections in 2013 for the first
   time. We look at their representation in the coverage, which issues they
   were mainly associated with, and how they were pictured overall. The
   results of the analysis show that the presentational style differs among
   the parties: a strong personalization, a strong negativity and a focus
   on events characterized the presentation of the M5S and the TS, while
   issues played a slightly greater role for the AfD. The three parties'
   coverage, however, converges in a generally peripheral role of issues,
   in an overall negative bias, and in depicting them as dangerous and
   irresponsible populist protest parties.},

Abstract = {Starvation is widely recognized as a weapon of extreme mass violence, a
   gross violation of human rights, and a crime in international criminal
   law, yet forced starvation is still practiced today. Starvation was used
   as a political tool against Ukraine in the Holodomor, was part of Nazi
   strategy during World War II, and is one of the most readily identified
   aspects of the Armenian Genocide in the Ottoman Empire during the period
   1915 to 1923. This study examines how starvation was used by the Young
   Turk regime as a deliberate policy against the Armenians, the Armenians'
   experience of starvation, and why starvation was chosen as a tool of
   genocide. Starvation was highly effective in the large number of
   Armenians that perished, and was deliberately chosen as a method of
   killing, partly for plausible deniability and partly for the prolonged
   suffering it caused, resulting in the eradication of Armenian identity.},

Abstract = {This article examines Martha Derthick's view of the American federal
   system as developed primarily in her book Keeping the Compound Republic,
   focusing on the system's enduring features and evolution in the
   twentieth century and considering the value of the compound republic and
   what is necessary to sustain it. Derthick's understanding of federalism,
   which was shaped in important ways by her mentor Edward C. Banfield,
   favors a pragmatic blending and balancing of national and federal
   elements to create healthy communities with the objective of fostering
   self-government. This understanding rejects three popular notions of
   federalism-federalism as policy efficiency, states' rights federalism,
   and political process federalism. In contrast with these alternative
   approaches, Derthick develops a principled stand for federalism that
   opposes commandeering of states and supports representative
   self-government.},

Title = {The Strategic Coordination under Quasi-SNTV: A Case Study of Hong Kong},
Journal = {JAPANESE JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {18},
Number = {1},
Pages = {155-175},

Abstract = {This article aims to explore the effects of quasi-SNTV (Single
   Non-transferable Vote) under the Largest Remainder Proportional
   Representation (LRPR) in Legislative Council (LegCo) elections in the
   Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) after the British
   handover of 1997. Although the quasi-SNTV results from the inability of
   political parties to control their candidates, the Democratic Party (DP)
   and the Democratic Alliance for the Betterment of Hong Kong (DAB) can
   obtain more seats in total than they could by coordinating around one
   single list if they can successfully control their party label and the
   political camps can coordinate different parties and candidates. The
   quasi-SNTV in Hong Kong is notable for the strategic coordination found
   in its alliances, a key aspect that differentiates it from Colombia's
   quasi-SNTV. The DP's failure can be attributed to its internal conflicts
   and the lack of coordination among the pro-democracy alliances. In
   contrast to the democratic camp, which lacks any overriding authority to
   coordinate different parties and candidates, the pro-China's united
   front machinery facilitates coordination and helps the DAB perform
   better than the DP in quasi-SNTV.},

Abstract = {Debates about whether presidential nominating conventions are useful
   institutions in American politics have emerged in recent presidential
   elections. Are they needless events or do they serve an important
   democratic purpose? Do potential voters gain anything from the
   conventions? In this article, I use panel data collected around
   presidential conventions to examine how exposure to convention speeches
   impacts postconvention knowledge about the candidates, controlling for
   preconvention knowledge levels. I find evidence that campaign
   information generated during the presidential conventions increases
   knowledge about candidate positions, although the convention that occurs
   first in a presidential election appears to have a larger effect on
   knowledge gains than the convention that occurs second. I conclude that
   conventions have not outlived their usefulness but are instead important
   institutions that facilitate political learning and therefore enhance
   the democratic process.},

Abstract = {Courts resolve individual disputes and create principles of law to
   justify their decisions and guide the resolution of future cases. Those
   tasks present informational challenges that affect the whole judicial
   process. Judges must simultaneously learn about (1) the particular facts
   and legal implications of any dispute; (2) discover the doctrine that
   appropriately resolves the dispute; and (3) attempt to articulate those
   rules in the context of a single case so that future courts may reason
   from past cases. We propose a model of judicial learning and decision
   making in which there is a complicated relationship between facts and
   legal outcomes. The model has implications for many of the important
   questions in the judicial process, including the dynamics of common law
   development, the path-dependent nature of the law, and optimal case
   selection by supervisory courts.},

Abstract = {This study explores conceptual conflicts embedded in the thematic
   grounding of classical realism. To establish conditions of consistent
   normality in human political behaviour for realist analysis, the
   rhetoric of originary political wisdom usually ties its claims, as a
   research framework, to myth and enlightenment. Because Thucydides,
   Machiavelli or Hobbes articulated the premises of political realist
   analysis in the contexts of state formation, anarchic regional politics
   and perpetual war, these first figures of political authority seem to
   have set terms of geopolitical analysis that erase context, arrest
   temporality and homogenise space by pointing analysis back to classical
   events, thinkers and struggles in mythic terms. Critical theorists ask
   if such mythic styles of reasoning are a credible approach, even though
   many accept such modes of analysis. Consequently, this study explores
   how myth affects political realist studies to question how statecraft
   perpetuates itself on reason, myth and their contradictions.},

Journal = {CONTEMPORARY POLITICAL THEORY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {16},
Number = {1},
Pages = {41-64},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {This article argues that current economic upheaval should be understood
   as a problem of domination, in two respects: the `dyadic' domination of
   one actor by another (such as in the case of corporations over workers),
   and the `structural' domination of individuals by a diffuse,
   decentralized, but nevertheless human-made system (such as the `market'
   itself). Such domination should be contested through specifically
   democratic political mobilization, through institutions and practices
   that expand the political agency of citizens themselves. The article
   advances this argument by synthesizing two traditions of political
   thought. It reconstructs radical democratic theory from the Progressive
   Era (1880-1920). These thinkers in turn help to reinforce contemporary
   debates in neorepublican thought, resolving disputes over the scope of
   domination and the relationship between domination and democracy. This
   synthesis offers a novel normative framework for diagnosing and
   responding to the current combination of economic upheaval and political
   dysfunction.},

Abstract = {African elections are unique in several respects; in ethno-religiously
   divided nations, elections are often decided on the basis of candidates'
   ethnic or religious affiliations rather than political ideologies. In
   Nigeria for example, campaigns differ greatly from what is obtainable in
   other countries. For example, music plays a huge role in the outcome of
   elections in Nigeria. It also significantly determines whether or not
   the elections will be violent or non-violent. This is because music
   evokes emotions and connects with people in a personal and intimate way.
   This study critically examines the two-edged nature of music's effect on
   society and offers some evidence to demonstrate that music can help in
   fostering peace in the society particularly as it concerns peaceful
   elections. Adopting an ethnographic research methodology, the article's
   argument draws on examples from Ghana, Kenya and Nigeria, countries
   where the medium of music was fittingly utilised to promote peaceful
   non-violent elections.},

   violence perpetrated by street gangs, drug trafficking organizations,

   history of corruption and favoritism within those institutions continues
   to undermine citizens' faith in the legitimacy of their actions.
   Finally, El Salvador confronts a challenging road ahead characterized by
   uncertainty over the implications of an overturned amnesty law, low

Abstract = {The aim of the article is to present Michael Walzer's conception of
   global justice, which is one of the few conceptions suggested by
   contemporary political philosophy that proposes an order that might be
   regarded as an interstate order. Despite globalization, interdependence
   and widening of the transnational political sphere, Walzer still regards
   States as the most important political units within the international
   system and considers that they have a moral significance derived from
   the political communities they claim to represent. Walzer's political
   conception of global justice is opposed to dominant cosmopolitan
   analysis within contemporary international political theory, which
   consider that legitimacy of the States depends on their capacity of
   making possible human autonomy.},

Abstract = {The multiplication of actors on the global scene displays how economics
   and political interdependences are plural and rooted, and how far are
   the States bonded to new political and economics subjects. The national
   space has no longer the centrality it acquired during modernity. This
   loss is due to the emergence of plural spaces in which the State -
   globalized and discontent - is forced to operate. However, the external
   bonds represented by this new economics of interdependences, are sided
   by the transformations in the principles orienting the choices and the
   behaviours of individuals, interpreted as economic agents. Those
   principles do represent the inner bond of politics and the internal
   limits to the agency of the States. The economic governance of politics
   constitutes a new economics of interdependences and behaviours
   expressing, at the same time, the promotion and the management of
   subjectivities. It operates as a new ratio societatis: a new ``global
   economic civilization{''}.},

Abstract = {How does partisan control of local government affect performance in
   elections at different levels of government in multilevel systems with
   fiscal imbalances? In systems where local politicians depend on higher
   levels of government to have access to fiscal resources, at election
   time, voters have incentives to vote for local politicians' allies, to
   vote for alignment. An analysis of elections in Mexico (1991-2009) shows
   that partisan control of local government has a positive effect of the
   party's candidates in federal legislative elections, and that this
   effect is intensified as municipal fiscal dependence increases.},

   selection},
Journal = {PARTY POLITICS},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {23},
Number = {1},
Pages = {55-65},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {The question of how party leaders are selected has recently, and
   belatedly, come under systematic comparative scrutiny. If it is the
   location of intra-party power that interests us, however, it might be
   that some of the more observable indicators in such processes, such as
   the identity of the selectorate, are not actually the most revealing
   ones. Using a delegation perspective, we thus present a framework for
   analysing prior steps in leader selection and relate it to various
   ideal-typical constellations of intra-party power. The framework
   encompasses, first, what we call precursory delegation, with focus
   especially on an agent that, formally or informally, manages the
   selection process before it reaches the selectorate. Second, the
   framework takes account of the degree to which the process is managed
   rather than left open to free competition between leader candidates. We

Abstract = {This article focuses on the Platine region - the area around the River
   Plate basin straddling five South American states: Argentina, Brazil,
   Bolivia, Paraguay and Uruguay. It undertakes a rough reconstruction of
   the delimitation processes that took place in the region, and seeks to
   identify and order the core initiatives that led to the formation of
   unilateral and bilateral regulatory devices across borders. Mainly, my
   insights are drawn from the legislation adopted by each of the countries
   (laws, constitutions) and among states (agreements, protocols). The
   focus is on two specific concepts: delimitation and bordering. The
   article manages largely to reconstruct the regional border system that
   allowed the differentiation of territories, but also their rapprochement
   and the maintenance of certain power balances, despite the asymmetries
   and rivalries extant throughout the 19th and 20th centuries.},

Abstract = {The article introduces the teaching and learning concept for a hands-on
   seminar in the field of election campaigns. The core idea is to move
   student groups to develop a strategy for a party and creatively
   implement it by designing election campaign posters. The concept has
   been put to the test with Master level students in the run-up of the
   German Bundestag election in 2017. Cognitive as well as affective
   teaching and learning goals were extensively accomplished. In
   particular, the students' experience of competency, autonomy and social
   inclusion led to a high degree of motivation in students as well as in
   academic personnel. However, teaching and learning goals concerning
   working skills were only partly met. Therefore, the article discusses
   ideas for an optimization of the concept.},

   British politics have engaged with the concept of ideology. It begins by
   revisiting Michael Freeden's seminal intervention on the subject before
   going on to assess the way in which recent work has challenged, and
   indeed preserved, older assumptions about the nature and function of
   political ideas. In doing so, it pursues two objectives: it seeks to
   demonstrate the consequences of regarding ideas as a significant feature
   of twentieth-century politics, and it attempts to encourage a more
   vibrant dialogue between historians and other disciplines that are
   contributing to the field of ideology studies.},

Abstract = {This review examines state building in the Middle East from a long-term,
   historical perspective. The Middle East's early transition to settled
   agriculture meant the region was home to many of the most sophisticated
   and best-developed states in the ancient world. As Middle Eastern states
   emerged from Late Antiquity, their fiscal and bureaucratic capacity
   enabled institutional forms not possible in Europe, including reliance
   on slave soldiers for the state military elite as well as state control
   of land that could be distributed to state servants in the form of
   temporary, revocable land grants. Because a landed gentry did not emerge
   as an influence-wielding social class in the Middle East until a
   relatively late date, religious elites-who served as important providers
   of public goods as a result of their control of Islamic charitable
   foundations-became key intermediaries between state and society. Core
   features of the institutions of Islam's classical period largely
   persisted until the decline of the Ottoman Empire with implications for
   the nation-state forms to follow.},

Abstract = {This article aims to question the discourse on ``the war on terror{''}
   developed by the French President in the wake of the two terrorist
   attacks that occurred in France in 2015. Drawing from critical discourse
   analysis, it explores the discursive legitimation strategies deployed by
   President Hollande to legitimate France's securitarian response to the
   two attacks. It reveals how the defence of human rights served as an
   overall justificatory framework, through rationalisation, appeals to
   authority, and moralisation. It argues that Hollande implemented a
   discursive manipulation of reality to shield his actions from criticisms
   of illiberalism, all the while reframing the notion of human rights,
   undermining it and paving the way for an authoritarian-driven executive.},

Abstract = {This article focuses on intergovernmental councils (IGCs) in the United
   States in which prominent state-level executive politicians, that is,
   governors, play a leadership role. In the US case, these IGCs developed
   out of a desire to facilitate interstate information exchanges and a
   need for state governments to join forces to protect their autonomy
   vis-a-vis the federal government. In this latter role, the councils
   function as lobbyists for state government interests. The research
   question driving the analysis has to do with impact: what difference do
   executive-led IGCs make, either vertically or horizontally, in the US
   federal system? The question of impact is particularly relevant because
   growing partisan polarization in contemporary federal and state
   political institutions complicates collective action by states.},

Volume = {20},
Number = {1, SI},
Pages = {114-126},
Abstract = {Drawing on the particularities of Catalonia (and related cases), the
   general point of this contribution is to argue that Patten's equal
   recognition theory is modeled upon a too-restricted set of empirical
   assumptions, a circumstance that might harm its value as a tool for the
   orientation, evaluation, and reform of public policy. What is absent in
   Patten's account - or at least not properly inserted into it - are four
   built-in modules that we have named `history', `democracy',
   `international relations', and `migration'. When it comes to recognition
   of minorities, the past matters more often than Patten is willing to
   accept; democracy can lead to permanent departures from equal
   recognition on the part of self-governing national minorities; in the
   recognition game, there are other relevant players than simply states
   and their minorities; and one of these players, namely immigrant groups,
   can (albeit involuntarily) distort equal recognition schemes.},

   two key players engaged in global climate governance, on which their
   interactions have a great influence. China and the EU depend on each
   other in the development of a low-carbon economy, while, at the same
   time, they cooperate and compete in the construction of rules and
   regulations concerning climate change, and have gone through three
   stages in the UN climate change agreement negotiations. China and the EU
   should keep on cooperating in global climate change governance, which
   would be helpful for both parties in solving their own problems and

Abstract = {The opposition nature society has stopped being a paradigm where the
   first dominated over the second, to reach a current debate where a new
   relationship government-society-nature is discussed. Using Ecatepec's
   example, it is sought to identify some practices that give rise to a
   ``water vote{''}, understood as the political power derived from the
   management, management, distribution, consumption of the resource. We
   intend to focus on the political uses of water conflicts, with a
   holistic view, that allows to explain the networks between their
   multiple dimensions. The objective is to understand how these conflicts
   change the socio-political relations. We conclude that in Ecatepec in
   the metropolis of Mexico, political forces are expressed ``behind{''}
   the access to the natural resource, or the service of potable water,
   which brings with it social and political repercussions.},

Abstract = {This chapter examines Dutch public opinion toward the European Union
   (EU) in a longitudinal perspective. From being a traditional core
   pro-European country, the Netherlands has recently experienced
   widespread euroscepticism that has become mainstream. The European
   Parliament (EP) 2014 elections witnessed this evolution. Yet, Dutch
   euroscepticism has previously been shown to consist of multiple
   dimensions. In this chapter, we revisit the dimensional structure of EU
   attitudes in the aftermath of the Eurozone Crisis. Using four-wave panel
   survey data from the Netherlands (2013-14), we show that indeed at the
   aggregate level there is stability in Dutch public opinion. The
   five-dimensional structure of EU attitudes still holds, while the
   increased importance of EU attitudes for voting behavior in EP elections
   is also highlighted.},

Abstract = {The interpretation of self-determination as a vote for secession shaped
   the state that South Sudan has become since the 2011 referendum.
   Self-determination, this paper argues, is a democratic political process
   in which citizens determine their preferred form of statehood and nature
   of governance for their country. In South Sudan, however, political
   actors-with international support-established conditions that reduced
   such complex democratic processes to narrow technical matters. Equating
   self-determination with secession consolidated political and military
   domination in a process designed to end such domination. This was done
   at the expense of a more inclusive, process-oriented and political
   interpretation of self-determination.},

Abstract = {Since 2005, the Centre for European Studies and Comparative Politics
   (CEE) of Sciences Po has built an innovative project on the European
   Union (EU) legislative process. The Observatory of European Institutions
   (OEI) aims at better understanding the evolution of the legislative
   process in the EU since 1996.
   The goals of the Observatory are threefold. First, it aims at a better
   understanding of the political process through an innovative and
   wide-coverage database. For each adopted legislative act, about 100
   variables are collected, each of them providing detail on the decision
   making in the EU and its Member States. Second, the Observatory values
   comparative approaches. The dataset allows for an in-depth analysis of
   each policy sector. All in all, the information in the Observatory opens
   up a number of new research opportunities such as the impact of new
   Treaties, institutional reforms or the ongoing economic and political
   crisis, on each policy sector.},

Abstract = {The current crisis could lead us to expect an overall increase of
   conflicts in the EU legislative process and eventually a shift from a
   consensual system to a majoritarian system. This paper aims to assess
   the evolution of conflict in the EU legislative process in order to test
   this expectation. It constitutes a first attempt to deepen our
   understanding of conflict in the EU legislative process thanks to the
   database of the Observatory of European Institutions. We first define
   several intra-institutional and inter-institutional indicators of
   conflict. Then we assess the evolution of conflict for the period
   1996-2014. The data show a limited increase of conflict in the
   legislative process. However, the legislative actors still comply with
   the norm of consensus; the EU political system has not shifted from a
   consensual system to a majoritarian system. In order to explain this
   trend and apparent lack of change, we suggest several hypotheses: The
   institutions' adaptation by stealth; the inter-institutional drive
   towards legislative productivity; institutional patriotism.},

Abstract = {The need to hold capital to account and to bend markets to the common
   good is as powerful as ever, yet it is becoming steadily harder to
   create an electoral or political majority for such an idea in societies
   that are fractured and divided. The fundamental bond between voters and
   parties depends on political identity relationships; old ones are
   fading, new ones need to be created. The most dynamic politics in
   advanced capitalist societies are those of nation, people and place. The
   strategic challenge for the left is to create a new progressive
   patriotism that can embed radical ideas in a common sense of national
   purpose.},

Journal = {POLITICS GROUPS AND IDENTITIES},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {5},
Number = {1},
Pages = {25-45},
Abstract = {Studies of women's protest have adopted various social movement
   approaches that look at the mobilization of resources, the facilitating
   and constraining role of opportunity structures, and questions of
   framing and culture. This study looks at the role of symbolic resonance,
   a theme which is mostly absent from both feminist scholarship on women's
   movements, but also from social movement theory. This paper explores the
   symbolic meanings behind the public displays of the female naked body in
   the face of repressive authority in contemporary protest movements for
   peace, human rights and democracy in Africa, with a focus on the 2015
   protests in Amuru District in Northern Uganda.},

   counseling in Argentina},
Journal = {REVISTA DE INVESTIGACIONES POLITICAS Y SOCIOLOGICAS},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {16},

Pages = {87-98},
Abstract = {Abortion, according to the Argentine Penal Code of 1821, is a crime
   against life and the person. This nineteenth-century text includes two
   exceptions in which abortion is legal: in case of rape or when the
   pregnancy poses a risk to the health or life of the pregnant woman. In
   spite of this context of restrictive legality in Argentina, as in other
   Latin American countries where abortion is not legal, the popularization
   of the abortive use of misoprostol has led to less risky practices. In
   this line, for almost a decade, social and professional organizations of
   the public health system provide listening and accompaniment, offering
   public and legal information on the use of misoprostol for abortion.
   These spaces are called pre and post abortion counseling.
   In this paper, we will analyze how pre and post abortion counseling in
   the public health system, in the beginning an unregulated practice
   performed by some health professionals in isolation, are giving rise to
   diffuse policies, imprecise policies that have not been planned and are
   characterized by a reduced level of institutionalization. This
   conceptual proposal emphasizes the role of the health professionals who
   contribute daily to the construction of public policies from below with
   their actions.},

Abstract = {Do the productive occupations of working places and especially factories
   carried out by workers prepare the ground for a global alternative to
   capitalism? To contribute to current debates on this issue, this article
   proposes a historical case-study focused on the occupations of the
   French watch factory ``Lip,{''} in Besancon, between 1973 and 1977. By
   paying attention to the changing practices of occupation during this
   ``mythical{''} conflict, by way of a longitudinal study of archives, we
   want to emphasize the difficulty faced by workers in terms of fixing the
   political meaning of production restarting within their occupied
   factory. As they simultaneously try to struggle and survive, workers and
   their trade unionists permanently re-invent the daily routine and
   concrete rules of occupation. According to this, the case of the Lip
   factory is more than an emblematic example of the ``post-68{''} period
   in French labor activism, but may also question the political dimension
   in current experiences of occupied and reclaimed factories.},

Abstract = {The multiculturalist theory by Will Kymlicka studies conditions of a
   ``good democracy{''} in culturally heterogeneous societies. In this
   context Kymlicka pleads for social and political recognition of cultural
   minorities. How relevant are these demands when it comes to intrastate
   cultural conflicts? The aim of this paper is to create a dialogue
   between the multiculturalist theory and quantitative conflict research.
   To this end a preliminary regression analysis was conducted. It
   generated three main results: Out of all demands formulated by Kymlicka
   only political representation rights effectively diminish conflict
   probability. Autonomy rights even seem to have the opposite effect, thus
   to increase conflict probability. The tolerance of a society does not
   impact on the conflict probability. The central (multiculturalist)
   insight, of relevance for both academics and practioners, hereby is that
   political recognition can only have an impact, if any, if the targeted
   groups actually feel recognized.},

Abstract = {This article explores and compares self- and xeno-visions of Brazil's
   energy policy in relation to the European Union (EU) and the other BRICS
   countries. Brazil's competence as `green' or `environmental power' is
   often highlighted in view of its ascending role in international
   relations. Yet, its diverse and green domestic energy matrix of around
   45 per cent renewables is a mixed blessing. The EU and Brazil seem
   natural partners in their normative orientation towards sustainability,
   but empirical evidence from our media analysis of the two leadings
   dailies - Folha de Sao Paulo and Valor Economico - and expert interviews
   in Brasilia and Brussels suggest a picture of normative discrepancies in
   interpreting the guiding norms of sustainability, competitiveness and
   security.},

Year = {2017},

Pages = {249-274},
Abstract = {The goal of this study is to examine the behaviour of electoral
   stakeholders that has influenced the quality of parliamentary elections
   in the Czech Republic since the 1998 elections. The text attempts to
   answer these questions: `What kinds of strategies do political actors
   use in electoral processes that decrease the quality of elections?' `Do
   these tactics vary over time?' `Are they efficient?' `Who are the
   actors?' The Czech Republic, as a newly established democracy, features
   comparably very high electoral integrity, while neighbouring countries
   experience (from time to time) electoral problems. This work aims to
   describe the behaviour of electoral stakeholders in order to understand
   whether they behave in a manner which maintains a high level of
   electoral integrity. The framework for analysis is constructed on the
   background of Andreas Schedler's work (2002; 2013) with respect to
   influencing the level of institutional rules or the game within those
   rules. The analysis consists of different kinds of data sources. Among
   these, election observation mission reports, parties' strategic
   documents (party manifestos), secondary analyses (providing the
   explanation of behaviour), and news (offering information about
   behaviour on a daily basis) are most important. The results will provide
   a description of primary electoral stakeholder behaviour, which then
   allows us to better understand how they affect electoral integrity.},

   and discrimination, as well as the integration of Germans into Soviet

   Soviet ``normality{''}. To date, however, this dimension has hardly
   featured at all in the version of the history of the Russian Germans
   supported by academics and the general public. Thus an important common
   element of the Russian Germans, who emigrated to Germany in their
   hundreds of thousands during the 1990s, is overlooked.},

Title = {Ideology in the age of mediatized politics: from `belief systems' to the
   re-contextualizing principle of discourse},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF POLITICAL IDEOLOGIES},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {22},
Number = {2, SI},
Pages = {197-215},
Abstract = {Mediatized politics is often associated with a metamorphosis of
   politics; a shift from philosophical fermentations to effective media
   campaigning and from rational argumentation to personal appeals, sound
   bites and dramatic effects. The question this article raises is whether
   this alleged metamorphosis allows some space for ideology to emerge and
   play any role in contemporary politics and, if so, what the implications
   for the study of political ideology in the age of mediatization are? As
   I will argue, to study ideology in the context of mediatized politics is
   not to make big claims about the survival or demise of some `grand'
   belief systems but to analytically address the potential of political
   discourse, as it is articulated through several media genres within
   specific socio-political contexts, to re-contextualize symbolisms from
   the past serving the effective exercise of political power in the
   present. I will further illustrate this attempted revisionism by briefly
   examining three televised political advertisements, which I take as an
   example of mediatized politics, by the American Democratic Party for the
   2008 presidential election in the US, by the British Conservative party
   for the 2010 general election in the UK and by the Panhellenic Socialist
   Movement for the 2009 parliamentary election in Greece, respectively.},

Journal = {NEW POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {39},
Number = {4, SI},
Pages = {538-553},
Abstract = {This article examines the persistence of spatial metaphors in modern
   political thought, from the ``public sphere{''} that has defined liberal
   and republican thinking for the past few centuries to the high-profile
   ``occupations{''} that have animated political action of the past few
   years. The article argues that these metaphors reflect a ``spatial
   imaginary{''} that corresponds to an ideal of politics as the forcible
   control of space, and then explores the possibility of a ``temporal
   imaginary{''} more compatible with the imagination and aspiration
   required of progressive politics. The article explores how the dual
   meaning of the term ``occupation{''} - the filling of space and the
   filling of time reflects the dialectic of time and space, and considers
   what happens when a spatial imaginary overshadows the temporal dimension
   of politics. Ultimately, the article argues that a spatial imaginary
   tends to inform an idea of politics as a functional use of force, while
   a temporal imaginary forwards a greater appreciation for history, civic
   work, and creativity.},

Title = {Secrecy, Efficiency, Transparency in EU Negotiations: Conflicting
   Paradigms?},
Journal = {POLITICS AND GOVERNANCE},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {5},
Number = {3},
Pages = {6-15},
Abstract = {This contribution considers how the values of transparency and
   efficiency are realised in the context of ``EU negotiations{''} both in
   the internal and the external sphere. Legislating comes with a
   presumption of openness in the EU, while international negotiations have
   traditionally been assumed to require secrecy. However, irrespective of
   the basic paradigms, the institutions often appear to follow a rather
   simple rationale that secrecy makes better decisions, both in internal
   and external affairs. Similar efficiency concerns seem to relate to
   protecting the procedure of decision-making from external influence.
   Therefore, the fundamental trade-off between democratic accountability
   and efficiency in the external and internal fields might not be all that
   different: efficiency is linked with secrecy, and comes at a cost for
   participation and openness. I explain how the two paradigms-openness and
   transparency in legislative work and secrecy in international
   negotiations have recently developed, and how the values of openness and
   efficiency have been addressed by the Court of Justice of the European
   Union in its recent jurisprudence. This discussion witnesses to a
   possibility that the old secrecy paradigm might be about to break in
   international relations while a new transparency paradigm in EU
   legislative work is struggling to emerge.},
