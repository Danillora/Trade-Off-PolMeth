Abstract = {The withdrawal process from the EU (Brexit) raises issues of great
   significance both in British constitutional law and in EU law, according
   to Article 50 TEU. Some of the issues raised in the British legal system
   have been settled by the Supreme Court in the Miller case; but there are
   others still to be clarified: the role of Parliament in the task of
   adapting EU law, which the Government is attempting to replace via an
   unlimited delegation of powers (the Henry VIII clauses); or that of the
   devolved bodies, which the Government is seeking to exclude from the
   recovery of powers from the EU. The outcome of the negotiations may
   jeopardize British internal cohesion, in relation to both Scotland and
   Northern Ireland. And the circumstances of withdrawal and future
   relations between the UK and the EU - especially in the case of no
   deal-could seriously affect the UK's economic wealth and stability. The
   formal right to withdrawal is thus deeply conditioned by its practical
   feasibility.},

Title = {Liberal Peace Intervention in the Central African Republic: Limitations
   and Reworking a ``Hybrid{''} Order},
Journal = {AFRICAN SECURITY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {10},
Number = {1},
Pages = {1-24},
Abstract = {This article uses Roger Mac Ginty's four-part model of hybridity as a
   conceptual paradigm to reconsider the relative failure of the liberal
   peace intervention as a model of building peace in the Central African
   Republic. The article argues that the limited success of the liberal
   peace intervention in the Central African Republic is due to its strict
   adherence to internationalist, top-down, and exclusionary approaches.
   This, the article argues, eventually obscures local agency, reduces
   local stakeholder actors to irrelevance, and derails any prospect of
   ensuring cross-community reconciliation programs. Thus, we conclude that
   a more inclusive approach, involving participatory, locally engineered,
   and hybridized LPI-which enforces and brings in the utility of local
   actors, resources and practices-would be a more effective way of
   sidestepping the defective trappings of fundamentally ``foreign{''}
   interventionist paradigms in the Central African Republic.},

Abstract = {At the end of the twentieth century (after a long history of coups
   d'etat, a military uprising, a civil war, and a four-decade
   dictatorship) the Spanish public had serious doubts about the democratic
   nature of the armed forces. In 1989, the Spanish armed forces first took
   part in an international mission. Now, after 25 years of continuous
   active participation in overseas missions, public opinion polls rank the
   armed forces as the second most trusted institution in the country.
   International missions have contributed to (1) modernizing the Spanish
   armed forces; (2) changing the mentality of the Spanish military; and
   (3) improving Spanish society's perception of the armed forces' role.
   All in all, the armed forces' performance abroad has helped improve
   domestic civil-military relations.},

   James Bryce's Modern Democracies. Bryce promoted empirical studies of
   leadership rhetoric, interested especially in the comparatively advanced
   democratic case of Australian political leadership. Our selection of six
   cases provide sketches of a group of powerful leaders, each of which has
   at some time been forced to speak out in defence of their public
   legitimacy as a political and public leader. The set includes four prime
   ministers: Tony Abbott; Malcolm Turnbull; Julia Gillard; and Kevin Rudd;
   one foreign minister, Bob Carr; and one civil society leader, Noel
   Pearson.},

Abstract = {This article uses the hegemonic/counter-hegemonic framework of Italian
   scholar and activist Antonio Gramsci to explain how a movement known as
   social justice feminism emerged as a counter-hegemonic response to two
   hegemonic concepts established in and continued, respectively, the
   post-Civil War United States: laissez-faire industrial capitalism and
   patriarchal dominance. In four stages from 1899 through 1940, social
   justice feminists pursued the promotion of an ``entering wedge{''} labor
   legislation strategy and the increasing participation of women in
   national politics, particularly in the Democratic Party. While
   substantially successful in its goals, social justice feminism failed in
   two important aspects: its inability to work independently of a
   patriarchal political system, and, most significant, its apparent
   refusal to include women of color.},

Abstract = {The concept of responsibility is a crucial term in the field of ethics,
   even though it is quite new in this context. Before the 19th century,

   used to analyze problems of ``responsibility{''}. The emerging idea of
   responsibility was supposed to guarantee more flexibility and openness
   in a changing and more complex world. Today, the diffusion of
   responsibility challenges its meaning and meaningfulness. The effort to
   uphold this idea often results in precise, manageable and role-specific
   systems of responsibility, comparable to (older) systems of ``guilt{''}
   and ``duty{''}. The article traces forms and effects of specific moral
   responsibility by referring to two novels by Heinrich von Kleist and
   Cormac McCarthy. The analysis demonstrates that moral responsibility
   cannot be captured in closed systems of rules with limited scopes. This
   is not to question the necessity of rule-based systems in general.
   However, by focusing on blind spots of such systems, responsibility is
   conceptualizes more creatively as a ``model{''} (Adorno) and less as
   stabilizing responsibility systems but as means of irritating them.},

Abstract = {The origin and evolution of the data protection right has a clear
   European leadership. The global impact of this originally European
   legislalion has led to the proliferation of national laws for the
   protection of data in the rest of the continents and has forced global
   technology services - regardless of their geographical origin-to adapt
   to European data protection standards. In particular, these IT services
   have been adapted to the jurisprudence of the Court of Justice of the
   European Union on the privacy protection on the Internet. This article
   will demonstrate the extra European impact of three renowned recent
   judgments of the Court of Justice of the European Union: Case Digital
   Rights (Data Retention Directive), Case Google (Right to be Forgotten)
   and Case Facebook (Safe Harbour). These rulings are a milestone in the
   evolution of the data protection because of its global impact and,
   consequently, by the transference of the European standards of data
   protection to the rest of the planet.},

Abstract = {Proponents of practice-dependent egalitarianism argue that egalitarian
   duties and entitlements only apply among participants in morally
   relevant practices. In this paper, I argue that these views are
   implausible because they allow for objectionable treatment of
   non-participants. I show that it is impossible, on the basis of
   practice-internal considerations alone, to determine the extent to which
   the pursuit of practices can permissibly limit the opportunities of
   non-participants. There are opportunities beyond the current holdings of
   practices to which no one has a privileged claim (such as unowned
   natural resources), and the distribution of which is a matter of
   justice. A just distribution of such unowned distributive goods, though,
   requires a practice-independent distributive baseline. I further show
   that such a baseline can only be egalitarian because all alternative
   baselines face serious objections. From this I conclude that any
   plausible theory of distributive justice must accept some form of equal
   practice-independent distributive entitlements.},

Abstract = {Majority opinions are the most important output of the US Supreme Court,
   not only disposing the instant case but also providing guidance for
   other institutions, lower courts, and litigants as to the state of the
   law. The authoring of dissenting opinions, though, is frequently
   regarded as deleterious to the Court's institutional legitimacy and the
   efficacy of the majority opinion. Leveraging the content of all Court
   opinions between 1979 and 2009, I argue dissenting justices use
   dissenting opinions to strategically alter the issue dimensions
   addressed in the majority opinion. An examination of the effect of
   separate opinion content on majority opinions indicates dissenting
   opinions yield majority opinions addressing a greater number of topics,
   and I provide evidence that the dynamic is driven by the strategic
   behavior of dissenting justices seeking to realign the Court.},

Abstract = {In the view of Poland's minister for economic affairs, the country is in
   a trap. He claims that the growth model of the past 20 years is
   preventing Poland from becoming one of the leading economies in Western
   Europe. While the diagnosis may be correct, the remedy offered by the
   government is not. High-performing institutions and direct foreign
   investment are one of the key factors for high growth. By contrast, the
   PiS is creating poor governance and wishes to see less foreign capital
   in the country.},

Title = {Debate on the New Global Capitalism: Transnational Capitalist Class,
   Transnational State Apparatuses, and Global Crisis},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL CRITICAL THOUGHT},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {7},

Pages = {171-189},
Abstract = {The state-centrism and nation-state/inter-state framework that reifies
   and fetishizes the nation-state and informs much theorization and
   analysis of world politics, political economy, and class structure is
   ever more incongruent with twenty-first century world developments. An
   epochal shift is underway to a new phase in the on-going and open-ended
   evolution of world capitalism, global capitalism, characterized by the
   rise of truly transnational capital and the integration of every country
   into a new globalized system of production and finance, a transnational
   capitalist class as would be global ruling class, and transnational
   state apparatuses. The anomalies in traditional approaches demonstrate
   the need for a Kuhnian paradigm shift. Competition among capitals and
   international conflicts are endemic to the system yet competition takes
   on new forms in the age of globalization not necessarily expressed as
   national rivalry. Global capitalism is in crisis. The more enlightened
   strata of the transnational elite want stronger transnational state
   apparatuses in order to cement the rule of the transnational capitalist
   class, bring a measure of regulation and governance from above, and
   stabilize the crisis-ridden system. A global rebellion against the
   transnational capitalist class is underway but popular, working class,
   and leftist struggles face many challenges.},

Abstract = {Legislatures in parliamentary systems are frequently seen as weak policy
   actors, and this is nowhere more true than of the British Westminster
   parliament. But real-world changes, and recent research, suggest that
   Westminster's influence is significant and growing. This raises new
   questions about which non-government actors are influential, and we
   explore this through analysing 4,361 amendments proposed to 12
   government bills. Assessing non-government amendment `success' presents
   challenges, however, since many such proposals are clearly not sincere
   attempts at legislative change. We thus make two substantive
   contributions. First, we quantitatively assess the influence of
   different groups at Westminster, showing both non-government influence
   and cross-party working to be more extensive than traditionally assumed.
   Second, we link predictions about opposition and backbench
   parliamentarians' motivations to the legislative amendment process,
   proposing a typology of motivations for such amendments, with wider
   application. Overall, we argue that understanding non-government
   parliamentarians' diverse motivations shows that they `fail' far less
   often than commonly assumed.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF POLITICS IN LATIN AMERICA},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {9},
Number = {3},
Pages = {121-140},
Abstract = {This article presents the case for steering clear of electoral
   outcome-based regime classifications. It advocates focusing instead on
   the systemic character of the formal and informal institutions that
   govern access to power as a more appropriate way to draw electoral
   regime boundaries. The case study of Ecuador under the presidency of
   Rafael Correa is offered as an example of this approach. Both electoral
   outcomes under Correismo (2006-2017) as well as the procedural context
   in which elections occurred are examined. But the regime is here
   analyzed and categorized on a procedural-centered basis. The analysis of
   the slope of the playing field in the electoral arena reveals that
   political competition was fundamentally unfair, placing the regime in
   the competitive authoritarian category. This conclusion is reached on
   grounds of the incumbent's capture of the electoral management body, as
   well as highly discriminatory electoral laws drawn by the incumbent,
   among many other factors that rendered Ecuadorean electoral contests
   unfair.},

Abstract = {On the basis of the analysis of the historical forms of radical mass
   protest, E.Schultz demonstrates inadequacy of (neo) Malthusian and
   structural-demographic approaches to explaining the origins of this
   phenomenon. According to his conclusion, the reasons for the emergence
   of social protest lie in psychology rather than economics. Protest is
   caused by the belief that the government in power is to blame for the
   financial deterioration and is incapable of solving this problem rather
   than deterioration per se. The fall in living standards, even a
   significant one, will not cause an outbreak of protest if an economic
   crisis or outsiders are to blame rather than power holders. The same
   applies to other classical reasons and pretexts for protest. Although
   deterioration of the financial situation and demographic pressures etc.
   can create a basis or serve as a trigger for the onset of a radical mass
   protest, additional conditions are necessary (auxiliary factors).},

Journal = {RETHINKING MARXISM-A JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS CULTURE \& SOCIETY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {29},
Number = {4},
Pages = {511-537},
Abstract = {Marx develops two different theories of the employment relationship. The
   first is based on an agreement for the sale of a commodity whereby
   workers cede a flow of abstract labor springing from a stock of labor
   power. This commodity seems to be a natural abstraction, with the
   properties of a productive force owned by the worker. Exploitation
   occurs when the exchange value of the flow of labor power is lower than
   the value-creating capacity of abstract labor. In the second theory, the
   employment relationship is based on a transaction establishing workers'
   subordination to capitalists and the subsumption of workers' productive
   capacities under capital, anticipating the modern theory of the
   employment contract as an institution determining an authority
   relationship. This theory is not liable to criticisms of essentialism
   and naturalism and is able to sustain a consistent and realistic account
   of capitalist exploitation as based on the command capitalists exert in
   the production process.},

Abstract = {Despite a comparatively flat' social structure and lack of obvious
   class-based cleavages, Australian society is stratified by objective,
   multidimensional measures of social class. Using data from a July 2015
   survey of a random sample of Australian citizens, latent class analysis
   identifies six class types in Australian society, based on the
   distributions of cultural, social, and economic capital among
   respondents. The resulting classes are categorised as precariat', ageing
   workers', new workers', mobile middle', emerging affluent', and
   established affluent'. The precariat is characterised by high numbers of
   retired pensioners, the ageing worker class the highest mean age, and
   the new worker class by its low rate of unemployment. The established
   middle class accounts for one quarter of the adult population, while the
   emergent affluent class has the youngest mean age, and the established
   affluent is the most advantaged. We also show Australians are acutely
   aware of their class identity.},

Abstract = {Academic literature has extensively analysed the impact of political and
   cultural factors on civil society. However, the influence of economic
   change on the infrastructure and features of civil society has remained
   relatively understudied. This article analyses the impact of the
   economic crisis on Greek civil society and links the findings to the
   broader academic debate on civil society. On the basis of the Greek
   case, the article argues that: (1) the density of civil society may be a
   misleading indicator of its strength if abstracted from the broader
   economic context and (2) the economy is not merely an external force,
   enabling or hindering the development of associational activity. It also
   shapes the nature and patterns of civic engagement and participation.},

Journal = {CRITICAL REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL SOCIAL AND POLITICAL PHILOSOPHY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {20},
Number = {6},
Pages = {736-744},
Abstract = {According to David Miller, there exists a special relationship between
   migrants at the border and members of a political community that the
   migrant hopes to join. It is the task of a political philosophy of
   migration to define a state's obligations toward individuals who are
   vulnerable to the state's actions without being members of the political
   community. I define the vulnerability in question as lacking capacity to
   be autonomous for lack of options to realize one's plan of life. I then
   discuss Miller's claim that what matters is sufficiency of generic
   options rather than access to all options. Miller wants to say that
   sufficiency can be achieved by assuring the protection of human rights.
   This claim neglects the source of the individual migrant's
   vulnerability. I therefore argue that Miller neglects the specific
   relationship he has identified between potential host state and hopeful
   migrant, and advocate instead that the potential host state has to
   consider the vulnerability that is due to its own policies, such as
   migration regimes. This grounds a causal responsibility to protect the
   basic interest in leading autonomous lives for the migrant at the
   border.},

Title = {Trust Matters: Enhancing Government Legitimacy through Participatory
   Budgeting},
Journal = {NEW POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {39},
Number = {1},
Pages = {95-108},
Abstract = {Legitimacy is a problem of contemporary governance. Communities lack
   trust in elected officials-in their effectiveness, fairness, and
   representation of the public interest. Participatory budgeting (PB)-a
   set of democratic processes where residents determine how to spend a
   public budget-helps bridge that distance by letting the public make
   spending decisions. Since 2011, some of New York City's (NYC) council
   members have been implementing PB with their capital budget-setting
   aside a million dollars in their districts each budget cycle for PB.
   Participatory budgeting has the potential to rebuild relationships
   between government and communities. Using data from over eighty
   interviews conducted by New York University (NYU) graduate students in
   2013 and 2014 with PBNYC participants over two years, this article
   suggests that in council districts using PB, residents have greater
   feelings of access to and voice in local government, and better
   understanding of the complexities of spending public monies, often
   leading to a more positive view of government officials, and bolstering
   legitimacy of local government.},

Title = {Networkers, fund hunters, intermediaries, or policy players? The
   activities of regions in Brussels},
Journal = {WEST EUROPEAN POLITICS},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {40},
Number = {5, SI},
Pages = {1088-1108},
Abstract = {Regions started opening offices in Brussels in the mid-1980s. Today,
   well over half of Europe's regions are present there. What do they do
   once they are in Brussels? Are they mainly networking, chasing funding,
   acting as intermediaries, monitoring legislation, or trying to influence
   the EU's decision-making process? No study has analysed this question
   apart from the pioneering work by Marks et al. in 2002. This article
   breaks new ground by analysing both group-level and contextual factors
   in a series of multilevel models. Based on a survey of regional offices
   in Brussels, results indicate that contextual factors, such as levels of
   self-government back home, matter. However, group-level characteristics,
   such as an office's longevity in Brussels, seem to affect a wider range
   of activities. Overall, older offices are more interested in the EU
   policy-making process and less interested in chasing funds or
   networking. Conversely, offices representing regions with weaker
   self-governing capacities rather conceive of their role as that of an
   intermediary, acting as an interface between the region and the EU
   institutions.},

Pages = {70-84},
Abstract = {The author attempts to prove that, along with the well-known major paths
   of development (revolutionary and evolutionary), there is another
   specific way of development -the one of a ``trauma society{''}. It is
   shown that the notion of ``trauma' has acquired social significance as
   it was comprehended in the philosophical, psychological, sociological
   and political science literature. The author considers ``trauma
   societies{''} to be the countries that have been experiencing stagnation
   in development for a long time or are in a recession, losing their
   previous achievements. The article reveals the essential characteristics
   of `trauma society{''}, its causes, consequences of its development.
   Particular attention is paid to Russia, which, according to the author,
   can be attributed to the ``trauma societies{''}, since it rejected the
   socialist past while failing to achieve the goals it set and, at the
   same time, losing faith in the values that underpinned this transition
   in the first place. The author points out that no society (and Russia is
   no exception) can be traumatized forever, hence he attempts to forecast
   the circumstances under which it could recover from the trauma and
   analyzes the obstacles to the transition to a truly democratic,
   well-functioning society, yet not overcome. As a result, the author
   outlines the strategic concepts of Russia's development.},

Abstract = {This review ``diagnoses{''} climate change as an international
   governance challenge and explores the political feasibility of
   alternative ``cures.{''} Human activities' growing effect on Earth's
   climate system is extremely challenging, characterized by, inter alia,
   very long time lags between mitigation measures (similar to costs) and
   environmental effects (similar to benefits) and by stark asymmetries
   between ``guilt{''} in causing the problem and vulnerability to climate
   change. Two main cures have been suggested. Some analysts argue that
   because climate change is a global process, adequate solutions must
   likewise be global. Others shift attention from the challenge's format
   to the sources of human motivation, arguing that a decentralized
   (bottom-up) approach will more directly engage a wider spectrum of
   motivations and actors. These cures are neither mutually exclusive nor
   easily combined. IR research contributes more to the former cure than to
   the latter but can play a constructive role in linking them.
   Humanity has the capacity, ingenuity, technologies and resources to
   create a better world. However, the lack of appropriate institutions,
   coordination mandates, political will and governance structures
   make{[}s] the task difficult.},

Abstract = {Transition from civil war to peace may entail a shift in violence from
   the countryside toward micro-level and depressed areas in urban
   settings. Those areas could be labeled as urban brown zones, reframing
   the well-known O'Donnell's concept. Highly violent postconflict settings
   and societal violence situations can be characterized as violent peace.
   Violent peace urban scenarios require a non-traditional citizen security
   approach attuned to the local turn in peacebuilding critical paradigms
   instead to problem-solving perspective.},

Journal = {CITIZENSHIP STUDIES},

Volume = {21},

Abstract = {The multi-faceted crisis that has hit Greece and other (southern)
   European countries has had severe consequences on people's everyday
   lives. In an attempt to cope with, but also resist, dramatic changes in
   lifestyles, incomes and welfare, several initiatives have sprung up all
   over the country at many different scales, with diverse targets, varying
   actors and outcomes. Many people have abandoned their privacy to
   participate in public actions of solidarity, in initiatives that often
   involve new or alternative uses of urban space. It seems that practices
   of solidarity and claims around material spaces are becoming an
   important `laboratory' for shaping a different public sphere. Drawing
   from relevant examples in Athens, the paper aims to reflect on the ways
   in which such practices and claims arise and develop; how different
   types of rights and forms of doing politics are enacted in situations of
   crisis and deprivation; and finally how such practices reconfigure
   public space and shape notions of belonging, which ultimately (re)
   define urban citizenship.},

Pages = {269-286},
Abstract = {The legitimacy of political orders is an important reference point in
   political analysis, but the concept is difficult to operationalize and
   measure - particularly in those countries where legitimacy is critical,
   i.e. cases of political transformation, non-democratic rule and high
   state fragility. To be successful, legitimation (the process by which
   legitimacy is procured) has to fulfil two functions: relate demands for
   legitimation to government performance (the demand cycle'), and relate
   legitimacy claims issued by the rulers to behavioural patterns of the
   ruled (the supply cycle'). Looking at the recent academic debate, the
   article finds that empirical research has largely ignored the demand
   cycle, while attempts to explore the relationships underlying the supply
   cycle tend to suffer from misconceptions of basic terms. The article
   proposes a framework for empirical enquiry that addresses both
   shortcomings.},

Abstract = {For Hiroshi Watanabe, ancient China offers an illiberal and democratic
   experience that could foreshadow the future of Western democracies. He
   invites us to fear a possible sinization of America, thus joining the
   fears of Tocqueville. By following the Tocquevillian analysis of
   democratic tendencies, it becomes clearer how China became a democratic
   society, from the Song dynasty in 960 to the end of the Qing dynasty in
   1911, finding in Chinese history traits of a democratic culture.},

Abstract = {The role of competition is a frequently overlooked yet important feature
   for understanding the crisis-ridden nature of capitalism. One of the
   approaches that has consistently highlighted the nature and impact of
   capitalist competition in different historical periods is that of the
   social structure of accumulation (or SSA). Building on the understanding
   that intensified capitalist competition can indeed co-constitute
   capitalist crises, this essay further theorizes the competition-crisis
   nexus by linking capitalist competition to the structural problem of
   overaccumulation. It then reconstructs the role of intensified
   capitalist competition during the decline of the monopoly and post-World
   War II SSAs and in the current phase of neoliberal capitalism in the
   United States while focusing on antitrust and financial-market rules as
   part of the wider institutional settings that inhibit or facilitate the
   process of capital accumulation in each period.},

   George Orwell, whose unbending integrity and attachment to the craft of
   writing and reporting is still an inspiration. Few of them can tick all
   the boxes, but Christopher Hitchens came closer than most.
   ``Contrarianism{''} when he practiced it well, eventually meant not
   accepting other people's lines, reflexive prejudices, and expedient
   complaisance. However, he missed on some points. As a former Trotskyist,
   even after his break with most of the so-called left over the Iraq War,
   he never abandoned his adulation for Trotsky. Hitchens all along
   considered Saddam Hussein to be a grotesquely evil figure, unlike many
   whose ethics were consistently ditched when it came to battling
   ``imperialism,{''} just as Orwell had berated those who thought
   concentration camps were evil, but Gulags acceptable.},

Abstract = {This article assesses the apparent effect of political multiculturalism
   on tolerance of Muslim accommodation among native-born majority members.
   Our principle goal is in understanding how public opinion on religious
   accommodation varies as a function of both federal multicultural policy,
   on one hand, and more deeply rooted notions of political culture, on the
   other. We do so by examining responses to a pair of survey experiments
   embedded in surveys conducted in Canada and the United States. The
   experiments allow us to convincingly demonstrate Muslim exceptionalism.
   Contextual comparisons across multicultural policy regimes (Canada and
   the United States) and within them but across distinct political
   cultures (Quebec vs. English Canada) lend credence to a fairly subdued
   role for policy and a much larger one for political culture. These
   effects are, we argue and show, strongly moderated by support for
   multiculturalism at the individual-level.},

Journal = {CITIZENSHIP STUDIES},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {21},
Number = {7},
Pages = {792-808},
Abstract = {Given the rapidly increasing presence of poor and low-income migrant
   children in Chinese metropolises, some non-governmental organizations
   (NGOs) have shifted their intervention strategies from material
   assistance (spreading kindness') to value and capacity building
   (building new citizens'). Drawing on ethnographic data from an ongoing,
   longitudinal study (2007-2016) of migrant children in Shanghai, this
   paper critically examines the citizenship education initiated by a
   domestic NGO, Changban Volunteer Center (a pseudonym), which seeks to
   instil such children a set of civic virtues to foster their educational
   advancement and upward social mobility. The theoretical framework of
   multidimensional citizenship is employed to tackle the identity
   challenges faced by migrant children in dealing with multifaceted
   identities attached to urban, rural and global settings. This paper
   contributes to the theoretical debate on interventions by educational
   NGOs, in particular how they perceive and implement citizenship
   education for disadvantaged internal migrants. It further considers the
   potential of this type of informal education to help cultivate
   citizenship-related attitudes and capacities and to address the
   educational exclusion of migrant children.},

   from another party? And do these voters vote for their preferred party
   or their preferred candidate? We use the Making Electoral Democracy Work
   data for the 2015 Canadian federal election in three provinces (British
   Columbia, Ontario and Quebec). We find that one voter out of ten
   particularly liked a candidate from a party other than the one he or she
   preferred. For two out of five of such voters, the preference for the
   local candidate trumped the party preference.},

Abstract = {The article analyzes and explains the functioning of the information and
   intelligence system Plataform Mexico, from its origins to its
   consolidation, as a vanguard network interconnected between the three
   levels of government (federal, state and local) that allowed to make
   more efficient the research work about security in Mexico by sharing
   information in real time between the different security corporations of
   the country by means of the installation of a complex telecommunications
   platform, integrated by Interconnection Nodes (ITN's) in the different
   federative entities as well as with the government offices of
   dispensation of Justice. For this purpose is aided by the Single
   Criminal Information System (SCIS) which is made up of different
   applications, such as: the Homologated Police Report, biometric records,
   police records, criminal records, geographic information systems, prison
   records, ammunition, vehicle registration, forensic ballistics, among
   others. All this monitored through the Intelligence Center of the
   Federal Police (ICFP) as the central node for the exploitation of the
   information contained in Platform Mexico. The article also addresses the
   operability regarding the information security under which the system
   operates.},

Abstract = {Under conservative Prime Minister Abe Shinzo, Japan has embarked upon a
   high profile Womenomics' foreign policy agenda to highlight Japan's
   official development assistance (ODA) contributions to women's
   empowerment worldwide. This paper examines the puzzle of why such an
   avowedly conservative government would pursue a feminist foreign policy
   agenda. The paper finds that Japan's Womenomics diplomacy cannot be
   explained simply by materialist or domestic political explanations, but
   is best understood as a strategic campaign stemming from elite concern
   about Japan's national identity and esteem about its status in the
   world. Through Womenomics diplomacy, Japan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs
   attempts to construct Japan as a leader on women's rights and gender
   equality in response to the twin stigmas of Japan's treatment of wartime
   comfort women' and perennial low rankings on international indexes of
   gender equality.},

   Pinar del Rio Civic-Religious Center, from September 2002 to January
   2004, with the objective of determining their role in strengthening
   civil society in Cuba. As a methodological tool we chose content
   analysis, both quantitative and qualitative. Based on the results
   obtained from the quantification of the selected information, we proceed
   to the study of their content, within the context of Cuban reality.
   Prior to that, we establish a theoretical framework, in order to clarify
   the concept of civil society and its main characteristics in Cuba, as
   well as the role of the Church and lay Catholics in its promotion.},

Abstract = {Stephen Skowronek's partisan regime theory invites challenges concerning
   how we can measure such regimes, especially if the variable of analysis
   is ``institutional reconstruction{''} associated with a new president.
   But if we follow an interpretation by Andrew Polsky and look for cycles
   of partisan narratives-later candidates praising the accomplishments of
   a new president-I argue that partisan regime theory can be measured and
   it provides a straightforward explanation for why a small number of
   presidents seem to dominate America's political imagination. I suggest a
   new rationale for and measurement of the crises that are a necessary but
   insufficient condition for a new narrative regime to begin.},

Abstract = {When exploring the political response of citizens to economic
   inequality, scholarship primarily focuses on support for left parties
   and demand for redistribution. This article expands upon this literature
   by exploring whether inequality generates public support for a known
   inequality-attenuating force in societylabor unions. In contrast to
   prior work, which largely focuses on national levels of inequality, we
   focus on the effect of citizens' firsthand exposure to inequality in
   their local context. We theorize that residing in a context with visible
   income inequality should generate support for expanding the power of
   unions and should do so by augmenting the perceived exigency of unions
   in advocating for the working class. Using observational analysis of
   national survey data, reinforced with matching, placebo tests, and a
   survey experiment, we find strong support for our theoretical
   expectations.},

Abstract = {Previous research has noted the importance of public opinion on foreign
   policy issues. This study seeks to identify Costa Ricans' public opinion
   structure, in order to estimate the effect of a relevant international
   event: the International Court of Justice's decision on the case Costa
   Rica vs. Nicaragua. For this purpose, we use a series of surveys, which
   have periodically incorporated questions related to foreign affairs. It
   can be confirmed that the approval of foreign policy and domestic policy
   are relatively autonomous dimensions. In addition, the models indicate
   that the perception of foreign relations in the country improved
   significantly after the Court's decision was known. These results show
   that public opinion in Costa Rica responds to international events,
   although this happens in conditions of special sensitivity, such as
   relations with Nicaragua.},

Abstract = {Congressional parties are commonly viewed as unified legislative teams,
   but recent intraparty battles have revealed serious ideological
   divisions within the House Republican caucus. Using annual ratings from
   nearly 300 interest groups, we estimate the ideological locations of
   Republican legislators in order to map their party's factional
   structure. Based on the distribution of interest-group support from 2001
   to 2012, we detect three Republican factions that we characterize as
   worker oriented, pro-business, and ethno-radical. We find that
   Republican leaders block bills by legislators in the worker and
   ethno-radical subgroups and that they advance bills by members in the
   corporate faction.},

Abstract = {Why do majority parties choose to add extreme dead on arrival bills to
   their legislative agendas rather than enactable legislation? Majorities
   in Congress choose this strategy in order to accrue political support
   from their allied interest groups who reliably reward this legislative
   behavior. By examining all bills that receive floor consideration from
   2003 through 2012, as well as interest group scorecards and campaign
   commercials, I find support for my theory. Dead-onarrival bills generate
   electoral benefits for majority-party lawmakers, are more politically
   valuable than other bills, and are more often used to credit rather than
   punish legislators.},

Title = {Challenges of the Police as a political actor in Spain},
Journal = {REVISTA ESPANOLA DE CIENCIA POLITICA-RECP},

Number = {45},
Pages = {147-172},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Over the past decades, police forces have evolved significantly as a
   result of the structural changes that have taken place in democratic
   societies. The growing delegitimization of representative political
   institutions; the empowerment of citizens; the crisis of the welfare
   state and the consequences of socioeconomic globalization have shaped a
   scenario in which a classic institution, such as the police, is
   struggling to relocate itself in an ambiguous space. This is leading to
   its overlap with other institutional actors and some glimpse of an
   identity crisis. The aim of this article is to investigate the
   challenges that Spanish police forces are facing as political actors, in
   this context. In this scenario, a complex structure of interactions
   between the police forces, political-institutional decision-makers and
   various social actors is built. We define the profiles of such
   interaction in a variable geometry framework which is highly systemic
   and prone to stability. In this system of relationships, security forces
   face a structural bewilderment derived from their confused and weakened
   position caused by the hegemonic pressure put by: (1) empowered social
   actors; (2) demanding and increasingly delegitimized political
   decision-makers; and (3) increasingly sophisticated, complex and
   powerful professional challenges. The perspective of analysis is
   institutionalist, as it is assumed that the police institution
   conditions actors' perceptions and interests, but these gain enough
   relevance and determination to influence an uncertain future scenario.
   The methodology is qualitative, and it is based on chief police
   officers' testimonies, whose speeches are interpreted in the light of
   previous relevant academic contributions. This research was founded by
   the Spanish National Science Program 2012-14.},

Abstract = {This article analyses the organizational and political changes
   experienced by SOFOFA, the Chilean industrialist main organization. In a
   time span characterized by growing confrontational politics, the
   industrialist also implemented organizational changes in SOFOFA and
   engaged in a prolonged and profound debate about their relationship with
   the public sector. The III Industry National Conference, organized by
   SOFOFA and held in June 1953, marked a turning point. It signaled a much
   more critical stance towards the model of capitalist modernization since
   1939. Propelled by the uncertainty and the threat unleashed by the
   economic interventionism of the second Ibanez administration
   (1952-1958), the conference brought to the fore the disagreements and
   the generational conflict between those members who wanted a more
   vigorous entrepreneurial position vis-a-vis the authorities and those
   who preferred to maintain the traditional lobbying methods and informal
   corporatist arrangements with government officials and congressmen.},

Abstract = {In the last decade, there has been a major increase in the technology
   that enables representatives and voters to connect with one another.
   Representatives can use email, their political party's website, personal
   websites, Facebook, e-newsletters, weblogs and Twitter simultaneously to
   bypass the traditional political media. The author asks, what are the
   usage patterns of these web applications? What are the characteristics
   of the representatives who use these technologies? What are their
   attitudes about their use? Most previous studies have concentrated on
   one perspective (representatives or voters) or used one research method
   (questionnaires, interviews, hard data). This article is unique in that
   it combines several research methods: interviews with representatives
   regarding their attitudes toward the new technology and hard data from
   the Israeli Knesset's website regarding the MKs' use of web
   applications. The findings demonstrate that the Israeli representatives
   are no different than their colleagues in other parliaments. Young MKs
   and junior MKs are more likely to use web applications than older MKs
   and those with more seniority. However, coalition MKs use web
   applications differently than opposition MKs. Furthermore, the
   representatives have positive attitudes toward the use of web
   applications and consider them useful for communicating with the voters.},

Abstract = {Data breaches are becoming more common and numerous every day, where
   huge amount of data (corporate and personal) are leaked more frequently
   than ever. Corporate responses to data breaches are insufficient, when
   commonly remediation is minimal. This research proposes that a similar
   approach to physical pollution (environmental pollution) can be used to
   map and identify data leaks as Cyber pollution. Thus, IT institutions
   should be made aware of their contribution to Cyber pollution in a more
   measurable method. This article defines the concept of cyber pollution
   as: security vulnerable (such as unmaintained or obsolete) devices that
   are visible through the Internet and corporate networks. This paper
   analyses the recent state of data breach disclosures Worldwide by
   providing statistics on significant scale data breach disclosures from
   2014/01 to 2016/12. Ivan Burke and Renier van Heerden model security
   threat levels similar to that of pollution breaches within the physical
   environment. Insignificant security openings or vulnerabilities can lead
   to massive exploitation of entire systems. By modelling these breaches
   as pollution, the aim is to introduce the concept of cyber pollution.
   Cyber pollution is a more tangible concept for IT managers to relay to
   staff and senior management. Using anonymised corporate network traffic
   with Open Source penetration testing software, the model is validated.},

Abstract = {The heroes of American politics are often represented as timeless
   figures, sometimes literally carved in stone. A growing literature on
   collective memory, however, has emphasized the ways in which historical
   reputations are socially constructedand reconstructedover time. This
   article considers Chief Justice John Marshall as a case study in this
   dynamic process of constructing historical reputation. Marshall stands
   above all others as the great chief justice, but nonetheless his
   reputation has not always been secure. Surveying both citations to
   Marshall's key opinions and popular and scholarly discussions of the
   chief justice himself across time, the article shows how Marshall's
   reputation has been remade over time to fit the political needs of the
   moment. Marshall's durability as a historical figure has turned not on a
   single set of particularly timeless accomplishments but on the diversity
   of his contributions to the constitutional canon.},

Title = {Truman defeats Dewey: The effect of campaign visits on election outcomes},
Journal = {ELECTORAL STUDIES},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {49},
Pages = {49-64},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Political science research suggests that campaign visits by presidential
   candidates produce small and short-lived effects, consistent with mixed
   findings of their influence on election returns. We argue that existing
   studies are constrained by two issues: most studies rely on state-level
   data, rather than more localized data, and do not incorporate
   differentiation in the quality of campaign appearances in their
   assessment of visit effects. To incorporate these concerns in a study of
   campaign visit effects on election outcomes, we study the 1948
   presidential election, during which Harry Truman engaged in a major
   whistle-stop train tour and won a surprise victory over his opponent,
   Thomas Dewey. Using data on campaign stops gathered from archival
   sources, we estimate the effect of campaign appearances on candidate
   vote share at the county level. We find that Truman, on average, gained
   3.06 percentage points of the overall vote share in counties that he
   visited. Consistent with contemporary judgments of the ``quality{''} of
   the two candidates' campaign stops, we find no effect of Dewey's
   appearances on his performance. Our results provide strong evidence that
   candidate visits can influence electoral returns, rather than merely
   affect short-term public opinion. In counterfactual simulations, we show
   that Truman's extensive campaign tour likely won him the state of Ohio,
   highlighting the importance of strategic campaign decisions and campaign
   effects in close elections. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Political brokers mobilize voters all over the world, yet little is
   known about what motivates them to do so. This article theorizes about
   two drivers of brokers' efforts: (1) incentivesmonetary rewards or
   sanctionsand monitoring and (2) partisan attachment. We examine our
   theory using data on the Mexican National Educational Workers Union
   (SNTE), Latin America's largest union and a well-known political
   machine. Consistent with the role of teachers as brokers, we find that
   the vote share of parties supported by the SNTE machine is higher in
   polling stations located in schools. This effect is absent when teachers
   are asked to mobilize voters in support of a party for which they have
   no partisan attachment, and it is uncorrelated with the union's
   monitoring capacity. This suggests that partisan attachment, rather than
   incentives and monitoring, explains the SNTE's effectiveness as a
   political machine.},

Journal = {GOVERNMENT AND OPPOSITION},

Volume = {52},

Abstract = {While it is commonly assumed that parliamentary opposition is on the
   wane in Western democracies, we argue that evidence supporting this
   established proposition is lacking. Therefore, drawing on unique data
   from the Swedish parliament (the Riksdag), between 1970 and 2014, this
   article breaks new ground by systematically testing the
   waning-of-opposition thesis'. First, we explore patterns of
   cross-partisan cooperation by gauging the extent to which governments
   seek to accommodate the position of the opposition. Second, we study the
   degree of partisan conflict over time by mapping the degree to which the
   opposition politicizes and rejects government policies. Our findings
   directly contradict the waning-of-opposition thesis. In contrast to
   theoretical expectations, including the influential cartel-party
   thesis', the article finds that partisan struggles in general have
   intensified significantly over time. Therefore, the article casts
   significant doubt over the influential idea that parliamentary
   opposition is waning.},

Abstract = {Novel national survey data (spanning eight years), a parsimonious
   definition of identity, and a new Implicit Association Test are brought
   together to examine ``implicit party identity{''} for the first time.
   This offers the most direct evidence available that voters associate
   themselves with their party at a visceral level, sometimes in a more or
   less pronounced way than they realize or report. This pre-introspection,
   automatic association relates strongly to voter evaluation and
   interpretation of the political world. Comparisons with standard
   explicit measures and three key outcomes (affect, differential
   evaluation, and motivated processing) offer insight regarding the
   nature, distribution, and measurement of party identification. Explicit
   and implicit measures largely corroborate each other in distinguishing
   between Democrats, Republicans, and Independents but deviate in
   registering partisan intensity. ``Leaners{''} appear closer to partisans
   than to pure independents, and implicit identity yields a more graduated
   relationship than explicit party identification with outcomes of
   political cognition.},

Abstract = {The influence of party connection on the selection of judges has long
   been an issue in Canada This article considers whether such connections
   adversely affect the appointment of women judges to federally appointed
   courts. The answer appears to be yes. Using political donations as a
   proxy for party connection, the data analyzed here suggest that as the
   number of appointees with connections to the government rises, the
   number of women appointees falls. However, for appointments to
   provincial courts by the government of Ontario, the prevalence of
   political connections among judicial appointees is less prominent,
   suggesting that different systems of judicial appointment may help to
   lessen these effects.},

Abstract = {The Immediate Supply of Information (Suministro Inmediato de
   Informacicn) system is Spain's new system for managing value added tax
   and represents a significant advance in tax-related e-government, as
   well as an increase in the use of information technologies in
   interactions between the tax authorities and taxpayers.
   This new system entails the keeping of record books via the State Tax
   Administration Agency website, by means of the virtually immediate
   submission of invoicing records. Taxpayers must forward invoicing
   details to the tax authorities via the Internet, and this information
   updates, almost in real time, the records kept for the tax.
   Two goals lie behind its introduction. Firstly, to enhance taxpayer
   support by providing them, initially, with a range of tax data and,
   subsequently, with a draft tax return; and secondly, to provide greater
   and more efficient tax control by making quality information available
   very quickly.},

Journal = {EUROPEAN POLITICAL SCIENCE},

Volume = {16},

Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Research on interest groups has evolved from a focus on small-N studies
   to larger-N studies in the past 15 years. While both European and
   American research has become more sophisticated and aware of
   methodological aspects, there is yet no specialized literature on
   methods regarding how to study interest groups. Only few studies discuss
   the methodological implications of interest group studies, as well as
   the transferability of methods employed in other areas of political
   science to this research area. The contributions in this symposium focus
   on major problems and topics in interest group research and elaborate
   methods to deal with them: (1) the identification of the relevant
   interest group population, (2) the analysis of interest group strategies
   such as access, (3) the identification of interest groups positions and
   frames, and (4) the measurement of interest group success and influence.
   The introduction outlines these research problems and describes how the
   contributions to this symposium address them. The aim of the symposium
   is to increase awareness of the intricacies of these research problems,
   outline suitable practices to handle them, and stimulate debate on these
   methodological aspects.},

Abstract = {Using electoral data from a nearly comprehensive set of the world's
   electoral democracies (1992-2014), including 131 independent countries
   and one non-sovereign territory, this article develops an explanatory
   model of legislative fragmentation that incorporates electoral
   fragmentation, the territorial patterns of party support, district
   magnitude, specific electoral system effects, and the balance of
   personal and party vote components within the incentive structures
   generated by electoral rules. The analysis proves that there is a strong
   negative association between the territorial homogeneity of the vote and
   legislative fragmentation, and shows that those varieties of electoral
   rules that increase the salience of personal component in party-centred
   elections tend to enhance legislative fragmentation. Due to its
   statistical properties, the model allows for establishing the impact of
   each of the factors, as well as their relative weights, with a high
   degree of certainty.},

Abstract = {We argue that occupational unemployment rates, by informing perceptions
   of economic insecurity, serve as a salient and powerful heuristic for
   aggregate economic performance. Consequently, high and rising
   occupational unemployment leads to negative evaluations of the economy
   and reduces the probability of supporting the incumbent government.
   Simultaneously, however, such changes shift support toward left-wing
   parties. Thus, economic insecurity serves as a valence issue, but is
   also inherently a positional issue, due to the distributional
   consequences of welfare policies. This brings about a potential conflict
   as under left-wing incumbent governments the economically insecure are
   cross-pressured, which increases their likelihood of exiting the
   electoral arena completely. We test our hypotheses using a Bayesian
   hierarchical multinomial model, with individual-level data from 43
   elections in 21 countries. We find support for the hypothesized effects
   of employment insecurity on voting behavior, with a follow-up analysis
   supporting the posited informational mechanism.},

Abstract = {Do Canadians' preferences for Canada's role in the world depend on who
   Canada acts with and not just what Canada does? This question is
   particularly important in the context of overseas military intervention,
   which Canada never undertakes on its own. This paper presents a survey
   experiment measuring how support for a hypothetical peace operation
   changes with the leader of the mission. Missions led by the United
   Nations and by Canada's European allies receive more support than
   American-led missions do, especially among respondents who also favour
   peace operations for substantive reasons. The finding suggests that the
   UN and the European connection are alternative ways for a mission to
   benefit from a preference for multilateralism. While the results confirm
   some tension between American-led missions and internationalism,
   European partnerships may offer a way of reconciling an interest in
   alliances with the internationalist Canadian public.},

Abstract = {We show that unexpected financial windfalls increase corruption in local
   government. Our analysis uses a new data set on flood-related transfers,
   and the associated spending infringements, which the Bulgarian central
   government distributed to municipalities following torrential rains in
   2004 and 2005. Using information from the publicly available audit
   reports, we are able to build a unique objective index of corruption. We
   also exploit the quasi-random nature of the rainfall shock (conditional
   on controls for ground flood risk) to isolate exogenous variation in the
   amount of funds received by each municipality. Our results imply that a
   10\% increase in the per capita amount of disbursed funds leads to a
   9.8\% increase in corruption. We also present suggestive evidence that
   more corrupt mayors anticipated punishment by voters and dropped out of
   the next election race. Our results highlight the governance pitfalls of
   nontax transfers, such as disaster relief or assistance from
   international organizations, even in moderately strong democracies.},

Abstract = {Repositioning by political elites plays a key role in a variety of
   political phenomena, including legislative policymaking and campaigning.
   While previous studies suggest that repositioning will lead to negative
   evaluations, these studies have not explored the role of elite
   communications in structuring mass responses. We argue that this
   omission is problematic because elite explanations for their actions may
   limit the costs associated with `flip-flopping' by persuading some
   citizens to update their attitudes so that they agree with the elite's
   new stance and also by molding beliefs about the motives of the elite
   when repositioning. We present evidence supportive of this argument
   obtained from two large experiments conducted on samples of American
   adults. Ultimately, we show that elites offering a satisfactory
   justification for their change can avoid most, if not all, of the
   evaluative costs that would otherwise occur. This study thus has
   important implications not just for this particular element of elite
   behavior, but also related questions concerning governmental
   accountability and representation.},

Abstract = {In recent years a growing literature focuses on how and why some
   election processes are viewed as having integrity while others lack it.
   Some scholars examine how a state's characteristics (e.g. its economic
   development, the education levels of its citizens, and their experience
   with elections) shape the voting process while others study how
   individual voters view the process and their role in it. The relative
   importance of election dynamics themselves and the process of their
   evaluation, however, remain unclear. What stages of the election process
   are most important when people evaluate elections? We argue that a
   better understanding of how election dynamics shape perceptions of
   election integrity is crucial because theoretically this process is at
   the heart of democratic representation and because from a policymaking
   standpoint these dynamics vary more over time than individual and
   state-level factors. This paper explains why certain parts of the
   election cycle are critical to determining how an election is judged
   especially the fairness of election laws and media access, the conduct
   of election authorities, and the use of political violence. Empirical
   results using new data on 121 elections held in 109 countries during
   2013, 2014, and the first half of 2015 are supportive of our argument.

Abstract = {We consider the thesis of Alexis de Tocqueville (1856) that economic
   development and increased mobility may generate political discontent not
   present in more stagnant economies. For many citizens, as they become
   aware of the potential for improved living standards, their aspirations
   may increase faster than actual living standards. Expanded opportunity
   may then paradoxically result in dissatisfaction with government rather
   than greater confidence. We develop a formal model to capture
   Tocqueville's (1856) verbal theory and test its predictions using a
   2012-2013 face-to-face survey experiment conducted in Pakistan. The
   experiment utilizes established treatments to subtly manipulate either a
   participant's perceptions of her own economic well-being, her
   perceptions of society-wide mobility, or both. As predicted by the
   theory, political discontent rises when declining personal well-being
   coincides with high mobility to create unrealized aspirations. The
   results thus identify the conditions under which expanded economic
   opportunity can lead to political unrest.},

Abstract = {Why are certain Members of Parliament (MPs) more likely to get re
   -candidacy for national legislative elections, therefore having the
   possibility to continue their career? This article answers this question
   by comparing political elites' long -debated explanations with more
   legislative behaviour-related factors. By focusing on more than 25 years
   of the Italian Lower House's history, we have built a novel dataset on
   the legislative behaviour and career patterns of more than 3500 Italian
   MPs. A multilevel logistic regression analysis shows that, with the
   exception of party switching, legislative behaviour does not seem to
   exert a significant impact on MPs' re -candidacy. On the contrary, the
   career status of parliamentarians, i.e., their parliamentary position or
   their ministerial historical record, strongly influences their chances
   of obtaining re -candidacy. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {If decisions are made in democracies in open procedures, the rhetoric of
   There is no alternative (TINA) raises certain questions. Tracing back
   the idea of necessity to symptomatic discourses, this article analyzes
   TINA as a political strategy in contexts such as Thatcherism, Third Way
   politics, and European crisis management, and sheds light on the
   specific characteristics of politics in the name of TINA. The analysis
   identifies distinct models of `one way' discourses, reflecting political
   cultures and institutional settings and providing discursive
   trajectories. We examine the motivation for invoking necessity to
   justify unpalatable and normatively intricate policy decisions, and
   understand TINA politics in its double effect: as facilitating certain
   policies yet obstructing democratic and deliberative procedures. This
   allows us to address the question of whether the politics of our time
   shows a disposition to TINA as a means of responding to the rise and
   fall of political steering optimism.},

Abstract = {Public services have been externalised, in part, to the non-profit
   sector in France and in the United Kingdom. This article begins by
   reviewing relations between the public and non-profit sector in France
   before 2008, and its evolution since. This has been characterised by the
   slow reduction of public funding, the adaptation of non-profit
   associations and organisations, and their clearer positioning within a
   wider social and solidarity economy', which was consolidated by a
   framework Law in 2014. The article then examines the current sharing of
   responsibilities between the public and non-profit sectors in education,
   health and social services, pointing to the diverse historical and
   political conditions which have led to this shared organisation.},

Abstract = {It introduces the concept of virtue to Alasdair MacIntyre in his book
   ``After Virtue{''} (1981). It develops the problems of moral disorder in
   modernity. Discusses reasons for the recovery of virtue ethics in the
   face of atomism and fragmentation of the individual in modernity. Study
   the three stages of virtuous life to Alasdair MacIntyre, involving
   practices, unity of human life and tradition. Traces dogmatic aspects of
   tort law. The main goal is to reflects on the impact of the ethics of
   Alasdair MacIntyre in the tort law, particularly in the value of the
   compensatory damages and in the identification of values protected by
   the law. It concludes that the fight against the patrimonialisation of
   the law must be a diurnal task of all legal professionals, who can
   qualify this objective from the foundation of the ethics of virtues in
   the field of tort law.},

Abstract = {Growing up in a booming local economy can influence turnout in adulthood
   because family income influences the realization of cognitive abilities,
   investments in human capital and socio-economic status. Exploiting the
   discovery of oil outside the Norwegian county of Rogaland, this article
   identifies cohorts that experienced a shock in family income in
   childhood. This shock enables the effect of economic resources in
   childhood to be isolated from other characteristics of parents, such as
   their education level and personality traits. The study uses a
   differences-in-differences approach and finds that the affected cohorts
   are about 4 percentage points more likely to vote. The results suggest
   that potential mechanisms in addition to family income are changes in
   local public spending and in peers' political behaviour.},

Abstract = {Public servicesin the UK and elsewhereare under considerable pressure,
   not just from austerity, but also from a variety of social, demographic
   and technological changes (in effect austerity plus'). In this context,
   three broad options are open to policy-makers: continue with
   tried-and-tested approaches while spending less money, which in the UK
   means a reliance on New Public Management' (NPM); withdraw completely
   from certain public services; or develop new approaches to public
   administration. We argue that all of these approaches have been
   attempted in recent years, but it is the final option that is most
   interesting and potentially the most beneficial. In this article, we
   examine experiments with these new approaches in responding to austerity
   plus'. In particular, we examine various attempts at collaboration' in
   public services and discuss the risks associated with them. We conclude
   by setting out the extent to which policy-makers have moved beyond NPM
   and suggesting some of the benefits that this could bring.},

Journal = {AMERICAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {61},
Number = {3},
Pages = {575-590},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Spatial models of policymaking have evolved from the median voter
   theorem to the inclusion of institutional considerations such as
   committees, political parties, and various voting and amendment rules.
   Such models, however, implicitly assume that no policy is better than
   another at solving public policy problems and that all policy makers are
   equally effective at advancing proposals. We relax these assumptions,
   allowing some legislators to be more effective than others at creating
   high-quality proposals. The resulting Legislative Effectiveness Model
   (LEM) offers three main benefits. First, it can better account for
   policy changes based on the quality of the status quo, changing our
   understanding of how to overcome gridlock in polarized legislatures.
   Second, it generalizes canonical models of legislative politics, such as
   median voter, setter, and pivotal politics models, all of which emerge
   as special cases within the LEM. Third, the LEM offers significant new
   empirical predictions, some of which we test (and find support for)
   within the U.S. Congress.},

Abstract = {Outside groups now represent a major voice in US Senate campaigns, but
   it remains unclear to what degree outside groups are independent actors
   or are simply performing the same role once filled almost entirely by
   the parties. This article investigates whether independent groups
   distribute media expenditures in ways that mirror the objectives of
   parties, or if divergent interests cause independent groups to allocate
   these funds differently. Using a large original dataset of media
   spending in Senate campaigns from 2010 through 2014, this study
   specifies how a seat-maximizing strategy will go beyond simply directing
   money to the most competitive contests; that within similarly
   competitive races outside groups spend more on media when the candidates
   spend less. The observed pattern of outside group resource allocation
   reveals that outside group activity in the aggregate is consistent with
   the seat-maximizing strategy expected from parties, but one subgroup of
   outsiders, issue-based independent groups, are less sensitive to these
   considerations.},

Abstract = {Populist radical right parties place selective emphasis on immigration
   or minority issues, generally garnering support on the basis of their
   exclusionary agenda. However, populist radical right parties are not
   single-issue organisations and strenuously endeavour to come across as
   credible actors in different policy areas. It has been observed that,
   especially since the outbreak of the EU crisis, populist radical right
   parties have called new attention to socioeconomic issues. The article
   concentrates on one case in particular and tries to understand how these
   issues are framed by Jobbik the populist radical right party of Hungary.
   Whilst the article ascertains a `social' orientation in the ideology of
   the party, it also contributes to refine our understanding of the
   (inward and outward) secondary character of socioeconomic issues in the
   agenda of these parties.},

Abstract = {The modernization of the Armed Forces in the period of Alianza Pais is
   based on the disjunction between armed institution and national
   sovereignty, it combines several superimposed forms of sovereignty with
   new forms of discipline and control of the population, and is oriented
   to the passage of the State of law to the State of security at a global
   level. The modifications of the Armed Forces are articulated to the
   genealogical process of the national State. They go through four phases:
   first, the foundational moment in the Alfarista Revolution ordered
   around territorial-national-internal sovereignty. Second, with the
   incorporation into the IATRA (Inter-American Treaty of Reciprocal
   Assistance), the armed forces enter into the logic of continental
   defense as a device of alignment and dependence on American power,
   within the framework of the Cold War. Third, this order comes in its
   strong form with the Doctrine of National Security that transmutes the
   order of territorial sovereignty to the domain of internal subversion.
   And fourth, the neoliberal phase starts from the liquefaction of the
   national state.},

Abstract = {Partisan gridlock and ideological polarization at the federal level have
   elicited diverse responses from state and federal officials and have led
   citizens and groups in some states to respond to federal action or
   inaction by resorting to direct democratic institutions. A review of
   prominent ballot initiatives from 2010 to 2016 shows the varied reasons
   why citizens and groups turn to the initiative process in response to
   federal developments. Frustrated with the disconnect between public
   opinion and federal law, citizens in some states have approved
   initiatives that enact mostly liberal new gun control regulations.
   Meanwhile, supporters of marijuana legalization and minimum wage
   increases have relied on initiatives to compensate for lags in
   legislatures' responses to evolving public support for these positions.
   Ballot measures regarding same-sex marriage and abortion policy have
   also been triggered in part by federal developments. Through case
   studies of these areas, I also document the broader implications of
   initiative politics for voter turnout and mobilization, candidate
   evaluations, and policy agendas.},

Abstract = {The use of simulations in higher education teaching is burgeoning in
   political science curricula, particularly in international relations and
   European Union studies. This article contends that most simulations
   suffer from complexity bias and put too much emphasis on substantive
   knowledge. Drawing on the author's experience, two ideal types of
   simulations are developed. `Complex' simulations focusing on negotiating
   content and `simple' simulations focusing on negotiating dynamics. It is
   argued that the transmission of transferable skills is facilitated by
   multiple repetitions of similar negotiating contexts within the same
   module. This suggests that instructors face a trade-off between teaching
   transferable skills and substantive knowledge and should locate their
   simulations at either end of this continuum. Where students are not
   native speakers, not yet familiar with specialised terminology or simply
   unversed in negotiating dynamics, there is a particularly strong
   argument to make for carrying out simple simulations first, followed by
   complex simulations later in the curriculum. Finally, opportunities for
   collaborative research are highlighted. Gathering and pooling data from
   simple simulations bridges pedagogy and research at minimal additional
   cost.},

Abstract = {It is widely accepted that Judith Butler's work represents a fundamental
   departure from that of Luce Irigaray. However, in a 2001 essay, Butler
   suggests that Irigaray's work plays a formative role in her own, and
   that the problematization of the biological and cultural distinction
   that Irigaray's notion of sexual difference accomplishes must be
   rethought and multiplied rather than simply rejected. In this essay, I
   place the notion of precarity in the work of Butler alongside that of
   sexual difference in Irigaray, to show how together they seek to address
   violence to certain bodies through an approach that is at once
   ecological and political. I show that Butler's concept of precarity has
   deep, largely unappreciated, roots in the work of Irigaray. Butler
   explores precarity as bodily multiplicity in ways that pluralize
   Irigaray's own ethics and politics of difference. Butler is, in other
   words, rewriting sexual difference as precarity.},

Abstract = {Activist groups face a number of strategic challenges when pursuing
   social change. Among the most important is selecting the appropriate
   target for protest activity. Yet, scholars have typically focused on
   dissident-government interactions, rather than the entire range of
   potential targets. Why, then, do dissidents choose to target the state
   rather than other social actors such as firms, rival ethnic groups, the
   press, and so on? We argue that dissident target choice is shaped by the
   interaction of dissident demands and regime characteristics. When the
   state is highly central in generating particular grievances, dissidents
   will be more likely to target the state; however, this also depends on
   the degree of state responsiveness to opposition movements. We highlight
   how state control over the economy shapes economic protest, how
   democracy conditions political protest, and how ethnic discrimination
   discourages anti-state protest. The results of our quantitative analysis
   of protest events in Africa and Latin America demonstrate that there is
   an interactive effect between contextual features of the state and the
   specific demands of activists.},

Abstract = {In today's business environment and financial markets, banks are
   responsible for financial intermediaries and their relationships with
   customers are established in form of signed contracts. We are witnessing
   disputes in monetary transactions; thus, parties tend to resolve their
   conflicts outside the framework of court due to continue cooperation in
   the future and preserve the value of money and the principle of
   confidentiality. This research has been conducted to determine the
   position of commercial arbitration in resolving disputes among banks and
   customers. Research method is descriptive-analytical and its practical
   aspects can be used in the banking system. Data has been gathered from
   theoretical library discussions, the ideas of legal experts, the
   principles finance and banking sciences, and banking conventions. The
   results indicate that banks do not like to refer files to arbitration
   and monetary market has no arbitration committee to resolve disputes.
   Therefore, banks have used alternative methods such as negotiation and
   referral to banking expert; in some cases, the role of expert is close
   to arbitrator. In other cases, resolving the dispute does not
   arbitration with respect to social order and legislation. Based on
   findings, main banking services are provided in the form of a contract
   written by banks in the framework of the Article 10 of the civil law.
   This contract contains terms. Customers have to accept the terms and
   sign the contract; otherwise, banks will not provide the considered
   services.},

Abstract = {Rising inequality and pro-affluent housing policy have led affluent
   Americans to become increasingly isolated into neighborhoods that only
   they are able to afford. I use an under-utilized and unusually large
   dataset to measure the effects of this isolation on affluent Americans'
   perception of social conditions, including crime, healthcare
   accessibility, joblessness, and public school quality. I find that the
   affluent form perceptions of such social conditions by extrapolating
   from the conditions that exist in their own neighborhoods. When these
   neighborhoods are predominately affluent, offering little hint of the
   problems faced by the lower classes, the affluent take on perceptions of
   social conditions that are significantly more positive than the
   perceptions of everyone else in society. By leading politically and
   economically powerful affluent Americans to develop the false sense that
   others' lives are as problem-free as their own, class isolation may
   imperil the prospects for improving social conditions in the United
   States.},

Abstract = {Hannah Arendt has approached, in her study of totalitarianism, how
   sensitive it is for man to establish a dialogue, a bond, with himself.
   As the author has shown, this bond has been placed in the centre of
   interest of totalitarian power because its rupture derives in the
   abandonment of the person by the person himself enabling, thus, a form
   of total domination over the man. On the other hand, thinkers as Theodor
   Adorno and Michel Foucault have coincided in diagnosing that the logic
   that animates the social relations, in the context of our capitalists
   societies, has succeeded in making every bond that men could establish
   between themself - and each one of them with himselfvacuous and sterile.
   The present article intents to delve into some aspects of the
   dehumanizing logic of capitalism. The person's bond with itself has been
   a sensitive concern for all forms of power that would propose to annul
   the detachment of personality in man to make him, in this way, a
   biological being, unable to relate to other men and lacking of any form
   of will.},

Abstract = {In Politics without Vision, Tracy Strong claims that in order to
   adequately grasp the politics of the twentieth century, and so be
   capable of meeting the challenges of the present, political theory must
   think without banisters. In this article I take up the task of thinking
   without banisters through the work of Theodor W. Adorno. Following the
   startling claim made by Adorno in a lecture course in 1963 that the term
   `humanity' tends to `reify' and `falsify' important moral issues, I
   examine three different usages of the concept of humanity in Adorno's
   work, which I develop as a critique of foundations. I argue that
   understanding Adorno's critique of humanity and of foundations involves
   understanding the role played by art in connecting the concepts of
   morality and politics. In connecting morality and politics in this
   manner, Adorno moves from a moral theory of resistance to a political
   theory of transformation whose insistence on the radical discontinuity
   between the present and the future serves as a model of a political
   theory without banisters.},

Abstract = {Building on Brown (1997) and Field's (2001) research into religious
   decline and secularisation in Scotland in the later decades of the
   20(th)-century, this article uses data from recurrent social surveys,
   nationally-representative of the Scottish adult population, to assess
   the nature and extent of religious change in the 21(st)-century. It
   examines recent trends in religious affiliation and attendance in
   Scotland, compares key indicators in England and Scotland to assess
   areas of similarity and difference in terms of religion and secularity,
   and assesses the contemporary socio-demographic basis of affiliation and
   attendance in Scotland. The empirical results show that religious
   affiliation and attendance have further attenuated in Scotland in recent
   years, with a growing proportion of adults reporting that they were
   raised outside of any religious tradition. Indicators of secularity are
   most marked amongst younger age groups. The `haemorrhage of faith'
   documented in the latter part of the 20(th)-century in Scotland has
   continued into the early part of the 21(st)-century.},

Abstract = {Fedor Stepun (1884-1965) was one of the most important mediators between
   German and Russian culture in the 20th century. In 1922, he was expelled
   from his motherland along with other prominent Russian intellectuals.
   The Soviet leadership, turning Russia into an ideocratic dictatorship,
   considered those independent thinkers to be regime-obstructers. However,
   they were rarely noticed in the West as well, because the Western
   audience was more focused on the Bolshevik winners in the Russian Civil
   War rather than on those who had lost. So the later had to fight for
   their spiritual and material survival. Nevertheless, certain European
   groups were willing to listen to the Russian exile thinkers, e.g. the
   publishers of the Catholic journal ``Hochland{''} which became a tribune
   for a number of them in the 1920s and 1930s. Fedor Stepun was one of the
   most active ``Hochland{''}-authors. This contribution deals with
   Stepun's articles, dated 1924-1927, where he analysed the Russian
   revolution and the European crisis of the 20th century.},

Abstract = {Recent decades have witnessed a `middle classing of development' as
   global institutions hail the expansion of middle classes in the global
   South. Although the African continent has lagged behind in this regard,
   expanding middle classes have nonetheless been proclaimed as drivers of
   development and progress. However, such generalisation smoothes over the
   rough edges of history, for the emergence, evolution and character of
   middle classes have been shaped, historically as well as
   contemporaneously, by the timing and manner of their incorporation into
   the global system. In this article, it is demonstrated how the character
   and present prospects of middle classes in key countries in Southern
   Africa have been differentially shaped, not only by varying experiences
   under colonial rule, but also by significantly different policies
   pursued by the party-states of Angola, Mozambique, Zimbabwe and South
   Africa.},

Abstract = {This study examines the scholarly practice of ``knowledge sharing{''}
   and the extent to which it is rewarded by prevailing faculty-incentive
   structures. Following recent calls for greater connectivity between the
   academic and practitioner communities in both political science and
   public administration, there is a need for greater empirical evidence
   regarding the extent to which these practices are being employed across
   the discipline and how their use varies across institutional settings.
   Focusing on ``knowledge sharing{''} as a specific dimension of ``engaged
   scholarship,{''} this article reports the findings from a recent survey
   of public affairs and administration program leaders regarding current
   standards for earning tenure and promotion. Relevant scholarly practices
   are discussed and the reported value of these practices for earning
   tenure and promotion is presented. Institutional types are compared and
   recommendations are made for improving the dissemination of scholarly
   knowledge to the public administration practitioner community.},

Journal = {GLOBAL SOCIAL POLICY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {17},
Number = {1},
Pages = {21-37},

Abstract = {Despite the popularity of social investment, there remain ambiguities
   regarding how to design an effective social investment approach. We
   review evaluations of conditional cash transfers (CCTs) in Latin America
   in order to draw out lessons of how to improve the effectiveness of
   social investment. CCTs share many of the objectives of the social
   investment approach and are targeted at poorer groups. Since research
   shows that such groups are often not adequately supported through social
   investment policies, analyzing CCTs holds particular promise. Our
   analysis finds that architects of social investment policies should
   consider three questions when designing a social investment approach:
   how much investment is necessary to fulfill social investment functions,
   what is the causal mechanism through which the goals of social
   investment are to be achieved, and what array of policies are necessary

Abstract = {After the ``empirical turn{''} in deliberative theory, the renewed
   interest in parliamentary deliberation comes from quantitative research,
   which focuses on analysing the formal discourses delivered within the
   chambers. As an alternative to these studies, there is qualitative
   analysis based on the rhetorical dimension of parliamentary debate.
   However, both approaches are insufficient for grasping the
   interconnection of parliaments with other elements of the political
   system, and for explaining the internal and external determinants of
   deliberation in this forum. In this sense, a systemic approach in line
   with the model of Habermas (1998) offers a broader view on parliaments'
   contribution to deliberation in the public sphere.},

   Scottish independence referendum using betting odds},
Journal = {ELECTORAL STUDIES},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {46},
Pages = {39-47},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {This paper analyses campaign dynamics in the 2014 Scottish independence
   referendum by integrating time-stamped polling releases with highly
   granular evolving price data created by online political gambling
   markets. Our analysis models the relationship between poll releases and
   prices available on a Yes result, allowing us to measure the extent to
   which the release of each new poll represented an informational `shock'.
   We then seek to control for polling shocks in order to isolate and
   analyse the effects of key campaign events; combining a multivariate
   time series analysis with confirmatory testing based on a micro-analysis
   of the movement in gambling prices in the minutes and hours following
   these events. We conclude that the second leaders' debate between Alex
   Salmond and Alistair Darling was the most influential event of the
   campaign, initiating a surge in the Yes side's estimated probability of
   victory. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {The right of freedom of expression can be named as one of the most
   important rights and freedoms that have been emphasized on by all the
   international documents of human rights. Despite the fact that the
   aforementioned right is a universal right, most of the experts believe
   that it cannot be absolute and in order to be able to support the public
   and private rights, it must be restricted to some extent. Now the
   question is that the restrictions on the freedom of expression are
   needed to be implemented in what frameworks and based on what
   principles? In reply to that question we can say that ethics, national
   security, public order and preservation the rights and reputations of
   others are the key principles of restrictions on freedom of expression.},

Title = {measuring immigration policies: the impic database},
Journal = {EUROPEAN POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {16},
Number = {1},
Pages = {79-98},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Despite a growing interest in migration questions, it is still not
   possible to systematically analyse immigration policies across time and
   a large number of countries. Most studies in this field have heretofore
   focussed on individual cases. Recently, there have been a series of
   studies that have proposed policy indices that allow for large-N
   analyses. It appears, however, that these studies have not always
   adequately addressed the main challenges of index building, that is,
   conceptualisation, measurement and aggregation. Moreover, they are for
   the most part limited to individual policy fields or there is a
   trade-off between the number of countries and years that are covered.
   The aim of this article is to present the Immigration Policies in
   Comparison (IMPIC) project, which proposes a new and comprehensive way
   to measure immigration regulations. The data set covers all major fields
   and dimensions of immigration policies for thirty-three OECD countries
   between 1980 and 2010. This article discusses the way immigration
   policies have been conceptualised, how policies have been measured and
   aggregated and demonstrates the potential of such a new data set.},

Abstract = {What distinguishes a loyal appointee from a competent one? Applying
   novel methodological tools to a unique data set of 3,366 resumes of
   individuals appointed by Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama
   across 51 different federal institutions, we (1) provide an operational
   definition of loyalty and competence and (2) demonstrate that there are
   subdimensions of loyalty and competence. We also provide initial
   insights into how George W. Bush and Barack Obama employed the various
   subdimensions of competence and loyalty. Our most important contribution
   is to provide the missing element in principal-agent models and
   presidential appointment power, by identifying the background
   characteristics and subdimensions of loyalty and competence.},

Abstract = {Russia and China have closely interconnected histories and partially
   coinciding interests in the globalizing world. Disillusioned with the
   counteraction with the West, especially as a result of the `Ukrainian
   crisis', Moscow started to construct its `own world', consisting of its
   own partners. Under this scenario China, with its economic abilities and
   deep historic ties with the USSR/Russia, looked to be a very privileged
   partner. But the attempts to change the declared `strategic partnership'
   between Beijing and Moscow into a closer alliance did not coincide with
   China's policy of a `peaceful rise'which was intended to get the maximum
   possible advantage for Chinese national development from all
   participants of the world process, without complicating, except with
   very good reason, its relations with any state. This article analyses
   the developments in the principal fields of the Russian-Chinese
   cooperation in the context of the attitudes of the Russian political
   elite.},

Abstract = {The article examines the content of the constitutional amendments with
   respect to the Senate. While symmetric bicameralism would be abolished
   with respect to policymaking, it would be preserved and even exacerbated
   with respect to constitutional revisions. The consequences of the first
   would be a reduction of the number of institutional veto players, which
   would lead to the facilitation of policy change, and an increase in the
   power of the government (who is the agenda setter). The content of the
   new policies remains unknown, as are the economic consequences of the
   proposed changes. Constitutional revisions would become more difficult,
   because the ideological distance between the Chamber of Deputies and
   Senate would be likely to increase (because of the mode of selection of
   Senators), while article 138, which specifies the requirements for
   amendment to the constitution, would remain the same. As a result, the
   role of the Italian Constitutional Court would also likely increase.},

Abstract = {Observers of the European Union (EU) agree that it suffers from a
   leadership crisis. However, diagnoses of the precise nature of this
   crisis vary: some lament the lack of strong, visionary leaders, while
   others argue that the EU suffers from too much elite leadership. This
   article takes issue with both diagnoses and argues that the root of
   Europe's leadership crisis lies in the misfit between the nature of EU
   leadership and the legitimating logic it is rooted in. All leadership
   implies inequality and therefore requires solid justification especially
   in the democratic European context. However, at the European level, the
   vectors of legitimacy that provide such justification are weak and
   contradictory, thereby tempting leaders to overstep the level of
   justification bestowed on them. Making use of ideological and identity
   leadership may help European leaders overcome the misfit between
   leadership and legitimacy that lies at the root of the leadership
   crisis.},

   particular emphasis on patterns of change and continuity. The article
   presents a quantitative analysis of the articles published in the
   Journal/Revue, looking at, among other things, the balance of articles
   published in English and in French, the proportion of articles authored
   by women, the location and institutional affiliation of authors and the
   subject matter of published articles. Significant continuities emerge
   from the data, such as the predominance of Canadian-based authors
   writing on aspects of Canadian politics and the dominance of authors
   from large research-intensive universities. Yet change is also evident,
   for example in the number of women publishing in the Journal/Revue and
   in the emergence of articles in subfields not found in the
   Journal/Revue's earlier days, most notably Aboriginal politics, gender
   and politics, and race and ethnicity.
   Resume Cet article retrace les cinq premieres decennies de la RCSP
   (Journal/Revue), en portant une attention particuliere a des tendances
   de changement et de continuite. Il presente une analyse quantitative des
   articles publies dans la RCSP (Journal/Revue), en examinant, parmi
   d'autres elements, la proportion des articles publies en anglais et en
   francais et de ceux qui portent la signature des femmes, la provenance
   et l'affiliation institutionnelle des auteurs ainsi que la matiere
   traitee. Les donnees font apparaitre des continuites significatives,
   notamment la predominance d'auteurs canadiens qui ecrivent sur des
   aspects de la politique canadienne et le nombre preponderant des auteurs
   issues des grandes universites axees sur la recherche. Pourtant, le
   changement est egalement manifeste, par exemple dans le nombre de femmes
   publiant dans la RCSP (Journal/Revue) et dans l'emergence d'articles
   dans les sous-champs qui ne figuraient pas a ses debuts et tout
   particulierement la politique autochtone, le genre et la politique et la
   race et l'ethnicite.},

Abstract = {China's understanding of the Arctic covers two major dimensions. One is
   that the Arctic is an international sphere, and the other is that China
   should be regarded as a ``near Arctic state.{''} Based on such
   understanding, China's Arctic policy has been evolving along a variety
   of considerations, such as securing investment and resources, pursuing
   sealanes of communication and trade, and facilitating strategic reach
   and power projection. China seeks to increase its strengths by carrying
   forward its own national initiatives including scientific research,
   trade and investment, and power projection, as well as through
   participation in bilateral and multilateral cooperation and
   collaboration schemes. As China views the Arctic from the perspectives
   of both low and high politics, it is anticipated that China will be
   further engaged in Arctic affairs with a conceptually and materially
   sound Arctic strategy, under which a closer partnership with Arctic
   states, especially Russia, is a necessary step.},

Title = {Interlocuting classical realism and critical theory: Negotiating
   ``divides' in international relations theory},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL THEORY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {13},
Number = {1},
Pages = {3-17},

Abstract = {The history of the discipline of International Relations is usually
   narrated as a succession of theories that would pursue different
   ontologies and epistemologies and focus on different problems. This
   narrative provides some structure to a multifaceted field and its
   diverse discussions. However, it is also highly problematic as it
   ignores common problems, intersections and mutual inspirations and
   overemphasizes divides over eventual commonalities. Rather than such
   overemphasis, we suggest instead negotiating between IR theories' and
   elaborating their shared foci and philosophies of science in order to
   provide new perspectives on and approaches to international politics. We
   here negotiate between the two theoretical movements of classical
   realism and critical theories that are typically treated as opposites,
   yet which nonetheless are characterized by shared concerns about
   political and social crises, modernity and humanity.},

Abstract = {Media attention to earthquake risks linked to the underground injection
   of produced waters from oil and gas fracking operations has increased
   over the past few years. However, little scholarly attention has been
   devoted to newspaper coverage of events and state policy actions that
   are associated with induced seismicity. A key concern addressed in this
   article is whether newspaper coverage is largely unrestrained or is
   restricted by other factors. Is coverage by differing newspapers
   influenced by frames emphasizing the economic importance of oil and gas
   production within the state? We conclude that the answer is yes based on
   information gleaned from content analyses of newspapers in Ohio,
   Oklahoma, and Texas from 2009 through 2014.},

Title = {Turnout and weather disruptions: Survey evidence from the 2012
   presidential elections in the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy},
Journal = {ELECTORAL STUDIES},

Abstract = {This paper examines the rational choice reasoning that is used to
   explain the correlation between low voter turnout and the disruptions
   caused by weather related phenomena in the United States. Using in
   person as well as phone survey data collected in New York City where the
   damage and disruption caused by Hurricane Sandy varied by district and
   even by city blocks, we explore, more directly than one can with
   aggregate data, whether individuals who were more affected by the
   disruptions caused by Hurricane Sandy were more or less likely to vote
   in the 2012 Presidential Election that took place while voters still
   struggled with the devastation of the hurricane and unusually low
   temperatures. Contrary to the findings of other scholars who use
   aggregate data to examine similar questions, we find that there is no
   difference in the likelihood to vote between citizens who experienced
   greater discomfort and those who experienced no discomfort even in
   non-competitive districts. We theorize that this is in part due to the
   resilience to costs and higher levels of political engagement that
   vulnerable groups develop under certain institutional conditions. (C)

Number = {1},
Pages = {113-130},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {The article offers a critique of the `militarization of the police'
   discourse, which has gained substantial attention in both academia and
   the media. Particularly influential in the United States, proponents of
   this concept claim that the `traditional' boundaries between war and
   policing are blurring. However, this concept is both historically and
   politically problematic. The fact that right-wing libertarians have been
   at the forefront of calling attention to the militarization of the
   police highlights that while it is a thesis which critiques state power
   it fails to provide a critique of capital. As a result, it constantly
   falls back into a liberal frame of trying to delineate boundaries
   between military and police, rather than looking at how war and police
   power overlap and conjoin in everyday pacification.},

Abstract = {This article assesses the German party system and its development over
   time. Offering a systematic examination of elections at the national and
   sub-national levels and using a variety of qualitative and quantitative
   indicators, this article shows that unification has had a significant
   impact on party system development. While partisan dealignment among the
   western electorate and a lack of significant party alignment among
   eastern voters has led to converging behavioural patterns, there are
   still notable differences between the party systems in the two regions.
   The two parties that have dominated government formation at the federal
   level, the CDU/CSU and the SPD, still do better in the West, while the
   PDS/Die Linke continues to secure higher vote shares in the East. The
   FDP and the Greens consistently score higher results in the older states
   while the parties linked to the populist, radical, and/or extreme right
   have recently proven more successful in the younger ones. These
   differences are rooted in the distinctive voter bases of the respective
   parties and special characteristics attributed to the East German
   electorate.},

Abstract = {The strategies of building alternative measures of development have been
   established from a disconnected approach of very significant elements
   such as the legitimation or the dynamics of change of capitalism. In
   this research we study a particular case for a proposal of measuring
   development from the concept of Sumak Kawsay. This concept brings
   together very special properties which, although characterized by the
   same criteria as its alternatives (multidimensionality, segmentation,
   balance and subjectivity), resort to the novel use of a myth, that
   legitimizes communitary ways of living that are different to the most
   widespread lifestyles. This paper presents a discourse analysis of the
   conceptions about Good Living that can be extracted from the texts of
   interviews and other group dynamics carried out in the peasant
   communities of Nabon, a rural canton of the South of Ecuador. The
   analysis results a relational structure in which the limits and contents
   of an adaptive or hybrid discourse are defined, which is the product of
   the interaction between two opposing discourses: Sumak Kawsay (community
   and traditional) and goverment's Institutional Good Living (societal and
   modern). This interaction allows to expose and to explain the set of
   contradictions detected; and the emergence of new categories that
   establish the limits of this adaptive discourse on Good Living: bad
   living, good dying or quality of life. In this way, the positions of the
   internal fractures of the populations are explained, as well as their
   strategies for subsistence and negotiation with government authorities.},

Abstract = {This article explores the concept of transitional justice in democratic
   states dealing with political violence. Although transitional justice
   was designed for paradigmatic transitions (from war to peace and from
   dictatorship to democracy), conflicted democracies such as Northern
   Ireland and the Basque Country could also benefit from this framework
   which brings a comprehensive human rights approach to the past and
   promotes the principles of truth, justice, reparation and guarantees of
   non-repetition. The article compares the transition from conflict in
   Northern Ireland and the Basque Country. It explores some of the
   specific features which characterise processes of transitional justice
   within settled democracies, such as the blurred break with the past, the
   fragmentation of initiatives aimed at dealing with violence and the
   mixture of ordinary and transitional justice. As well as contributing to
   the conceptualisation of the field of transitional justice, the study
   proposes that the conflict vs. terrorism divide and the clash of
   narratives associated with it are the key to understanding these types
   of transitions.},

Abstract = {In Democratic Justice and the Social Contract, Weale defends a
   contractarian theory of social justice following what he calls the
   `empirical method', which consists in grounding ethics and politics on
   the observation of concrete examples of social contracts, rather than
   abstract speculations. In this paper, I will make three critical
   remarks. First, the empirical method is open to the same objections
   usually raised against more abstract approaches to social contract
   theory: by an appropriate choice of the starting point, one can justify
   any ethical or political position. Second, Weale's focus on the
   societies that were successful in managing common pool resources appears
   arbitrary: other social organizations (e.g. hunters and gatherers
   societies) would be a more obvious choice. Finally, in following the
   empirical method, philosophers must be willing to import into ethics and
   politics the same problems of interpretation one encounters in
   theoretical social sciences. As an example, I will show that Weale's
   position on the welfare state depends on the interpretation he gives of
   some practices observed in the societies he chooses as models. Different
   interpretations of the same practices would induce Weale to revise his
   positions.},

Journal = {WEST EUROPEAN POLITICS},

Abstract = {The European Union interest group population is often characterised as
   being biased towards business and detached from its constituency base.
   Many scholars attribute this to institutional factors unique to the EU.
   Yet, assessing whether or not the EU is indeed unique in this regard
   requires a comparative research design. We compare the EU interest group
   population with those in four member states: France, Great Britain,
   Germany and the Netherlands. We differentiate system, policy domain and
   organisational factors and examine their effects on interest group
   diversity. Our results show that the EU interest system is not more
   biased towards the representation of business interests than the other
   systems. Moreover, EU interest organisations are not more detached from
   their constituents than those in the studied countries. Everywhere,
   business interest associations seem to be better capable of representing
   their members' interests than civil society groups. These findings
   suggest that the EU is less of a sui generis system than commonly
   assumed and imply the need for more fine-grained analyses of interest
   group diversity.},

Title = {A multidimensional account of democratic legitimacy: how to make robust
   decisions in a non-idealized deliberative context},
Journal = {CRITICAL REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL SOCIAL AND POLITICAL PHILOSOPHY},

Volume = {20},

Abstract = {This paper analyses the possibility of granting legitimacy to democratic
   decision-making procedures in a context of deep pluralism. We defend a
   multidimensional account according to which a legitimate system needs to
   grant, on the one hand, that citizens should be included on an equal
   footing and acknowledged as reflexive political agents rather than mere
   beneficiaries of policies, and, on the other hand, that their decisions
   have an epistemic quality. While Estlund's account of imperfect
   epistemic proceduralism might seem to embody a dualistic conception of
   democratic legitimacy, we point out that it is not able to recognize
   citizens as reflexive political agents and is grounded in an idealized
   model of the circumstances of deliberation. To overcome these
   ambiguities, we develop an account of democratic legitimacy according to
   which disagreement is the proper expression of citizens' reflexive
   agency and the attribution of epistemic authority does not stem from a
   major expertise or specific ability, but it comes through the public
   confrontation among disagreeing agents. Consequently, the epistemic
   value of deliberation should be derived from the reasons-giving process
   rather than from the reference to the alleged quality of its outcomes.
   In this way, we demonstrate the validity of the multidimensional
   perspective of legitimacy, yet abstain from introducing any
   outcome-oriented criterion. Finally, we argue that this account of
   legitimacy is well suited for modeling deliberative democracy as a
   decision-making procedure that respects the agency of every citizen and
   grants her opportunity to influence public choices.},

Abstract = {Use of social media by political parties has become a part of their
   communication strategies. In Catalonia, where around 20\% of Internet
   users obtain political information through Facebook and Twitter, parties
   use these channels widely. This article has examined 814 posts, 5,772
   comments, 52,470 likes and 25,907 shares from the official Facebook
   pages of Catalan parties in order to ascertain the relevance of the
   classical party characteristics (party size, level of
   institutionalization, centralization of decision-making, position at the
   ideological cleavages) on how parties and their followers behave on
   Facebook. The data sustain that the characteristics of Catalan parties
   have an influence on their posting behaviour on Facebook, and mould the
   reactions (comments, likes and shares) of their Facebook followers to
   these posts. The results further show that small and new parties achieve
   greater engagement than bigger and more institutionalized parties.},

   to a white working class with clear political preferences, definitions
   in empirical literature are often wide ranging, suggesting differences

Abstract = {The crisis of communism and the collapse of the Soviet Union, and the
   accompanying shock waves felt in Cuba starting in 1991, intensified
   internal divisions within the regime. This article has a twofold
   purpose. First, it seeks to present and assess critically the changes
   that took place in Cuban society, economy, politics, and culture as Cuba
   emerged from the rectificacion and the crisis of the 1990s. Second, it
   analyzes the Constitution of 1992 connected with the new dynamic between
   state and society that is shaped by the characteristics of Cuba's
   national history, as well as the interactions between exogenous and
   endogenous factors during the ``Special Period{''}.},

Abstract = {Predictions that Brexit will precipitate the disintegration of the
   European Union (EU) have greatly overstated the prospect of such an
   event. Britain's centuries-long conflicted relationship with Europe and
   contemporary survey data - exhibiting marked differences between Britain
   and the rest of Europe with regard to Euroskepticism - suggest that
   Brexit is a sui generis event, unique to Britain, and is not a harbinger
   of things to come. Conversely, by triggering the departure of the EU's
   biggest obstacle to an ever deeper union, Brexit's most likely effect is
   to strengthen European integration and foster greater consolidation in

Abstract = {The reality of our Europe is changing, as well as the sole nature o f
   the leadership practices and styles. The old models are giving way to
   new concepts and theories, such as connected leadership, super
   leadership, spiritual visionary, political apostleship, etc. In the
   paper is made an attempt for revising some of the established notions of
   the political leadership in the light of the listed concepts. Along with
   that the scholars are witnessing a new phenomenon - mass movements
   without personalized leadership, such as ``The Indignant{''},
   ``Occupy{''}, ``Anonymous{''}, well known fact, which must be addressed
   properly. The analysis is looking for answers that can be used in the
   forthcoming major challenges in the 21st century. The author offers his
   own concept, this of the Political Apostleship as a way for leaders to
   reach values and visions beyond post-modernity.},

Abstract = {Spanish cities have suffered increasing social inequality after the 2008
   economic crisis and austerity policies. However, harshening social
   conditions have also led to `acts of citizenship'. Against the
   background of Marshallian and Tocquevillean takes on citizenship and
   civil society this paper analyses the emergence of the political
   confluence that gained office in the municipal elections of May 2015 in
   Barcelona incorporating citizens' organisations and advocacy groups.
   Barcelona en Comu claims a radical change in policy orientation with a
   renewed citizenship agenda. We argue that this is an example of urban
   citizenship that requires historical contextualisation. We see
   continuities and discontinuities between the current local governance
   model and agenda and the democratic local governance model established
   during the 1980s when civil society provided significant input. However,
   it is a challenge to implement an urban citizenship agenda in a
   globalised city with resources controlled elsewhere.},

Abstract = {Cinema is a powerful media that can shape people's minds about different
   issues. Movies can focus on very detailed or hidden matters in society,
   and critical issues that profoundly affect the lives of large
   populations are usually at the center of cinema's attention. Among these
   issues are wars that can affect tens of millions of people financially,
   mentally and of course physically.
   Films can question or justify wars. To answer if they questioned wars or
   justified them one should choose a specific war, a period and maybe a
   particular group of films and analyze their content and discourse.
   However, to do so, it would be helpful and maybe necessary to first
   better understand how films may question or justify wars.
   The present research is an effort to analyze a specific number of movies
   to see in what ways they may have justified the role of the United
   States in the Second World War. The results include eight issues that
   the movies raised regarding the legitimacy of the war and America's role
   in it.},

   areas to promote social cohesion in any society. Through a literature
   review and through the analysis of various cases of societies in
   situations of postconflict, this article aims at understanding the
   importance of such spaces in postconflict contexts. Thus, through a
   novel approach, because the role of green spaces in post-conflict as a
   tool of social cohesion had not been contemplated until now, the purpose
   is to suggest strategies applicable to the new sociopolitical context
   which Colombia will face with the implementation of the peace

Abstract = {Congruence between government policies and citizen preferences is a key
   element that increases the quality of democracy. While scholars have
   shown that governments generally adopt ideological positions and propose
   policies close to citizen preferences, they have neglected to consider
   whether citizens respond to promises or to actual enactments. The paper
   addresses this gap in two ways. First, we propose a new measure that
   captures how close a citizen is on average to the policies enacted by
   the incumbent government, namely retrospective ideological
   representation - the ideological distance between the position of a
   respondent and the incumbent government at the end of its term in
   office. We show that this measure captures retrospective information
   associated with governments' actions and in particular whether the
   government increases or decreases social spending during its mandate
   period. Second, we show that retrospective ideological representation
   has a substantial impact on citizens' democratic satisfaction and
   greater than prospective ideological representation - an established
   measure of congruence - which is the ideological distance between the
   positions of a respondent and the elected government after an election.},

Abstract = {Marx and Engels were convinced that an economic system without market
   relations would follow on from highly developed competitive capitalism.
   Instead of competing with each other, people would produce sensible
   plans for production and its distribution. Precisely because they
   largely followed the basic approach taken by Marx and Engels, the plans
   created for the overall economy by Soviet planning practitioners were
   neither consistent nor efficient. In the Soviet Union, instead of
   planned management of the economy, there was a chaotic juxtaposition of
   bureaucratic mechanisms, individual political demands and shadow economy
   practices, while attempts to form a theory of overall economic planning
   remained without any practical relevance.},

Abstract = {This speculative essay considers, from an American perspective, the
   state of Europe in late March 2017. With the United States seeming to
   distance itself from Europe both militarily and economically in the wake
   of the election of Donald Trump, the EU finds itself facing new
   challenges. Will member states seek closer cooperation on border and
   security matters owing to their inability to make further progress
   toward economic integration? Will populist opposition to the EU
   intensify the crisis provoked by the British vote to leave? What
   implications do impending elections in France and Germany hold for the
   future of ``ever closer union?{''}},

   overall the country's formation and its historical political regimes.
   Albeit their complexity and diversity, Angolan wars were characterized
   by low and medium intensity operations, interspersed with larger and
   violent battles. One political consequence of this dynamic relates to
   the emergence of popular mobilizations through impromptu forms of social

Abstract = {Parties coordinate on a range of activities. They invite leaders from
   other parties to their national meetings, run joint electoral platforms
   and even form parliamentary factions and coalition governments. The
   implications of regular cooperation such as the case of pre-electoral
   coalitions (PECs) for party positioning are unexplored. Parties form
   PECs to reduce competition for voters with ideologically close
   competitors and to signal their ability to cohesively govern. Building
   on this logic, we argue that parties' preferences converge in PECs to
   demonstrate their ability to govern together and diverge when parties
   observe that this tactic has failed to attract voter support in past
   elections. We demonstrate support for our approach using data on
   electoral coalition participation, party positions and parties' internal
   speeches. Additional evidence from an extreme case of an enduring
   electoral coalition in Germany shows that PECs have dramatic effects on
   parties' positions.},

Journal = {OSTEUROPA},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {67},
Number = {6-8},
Pages = {133+},
Abstract = {A century after the Russian revolution, light is finally being shed on
   the many consistencies between the Soviet and Tsarist regimes. The only
   real break with the past that resulted from nationalisation was with
   regard to property ownership. However, on closer inspection, there is
   continuity here, too. Since the age of Catherine the Great, the Russian
   state has been implementing radical changes to property ownership be it
   nationalisation or privatisation in order to stimulate modernisation.
   However, in the long term, this goal was never achieved. It was always
   the weakness of the state that prevented backwardness from being
   overcome. In the Tsarist Empire, the state was unable to assert the
   realisation of infrastructure projects against the absolute property
   rights of the nobility, while in the Soviet Union, the planned control
   of the economy remained a utopian vision. Equally utopian was the notion
   of stimulating progress through radical privatisation. In the
   neo-partimonial order under president Putin the authoritarian state has
   had renewed access to property, but the profits from the oil industry
   are mostly being used to support unproductive sectors of the economy.},

Abstract = {The article explains the ongoing resilience of the Chinese Communist
   Party (CCP) regime as a dynamic process of continual institutional
   adaptation of the CCP's threat-management system, which simultaneously
   must address vertical (popular) and horizontal (internal) challenges.
   The author finds that the CCP central leadership's current top-down
   intervention into subnational governments, featuring Xi Jinping's
   anti-corruption campaign, reform of local government financing platforms
   (LGFPs), and consolidation of personal power over the party-state, is
   the second of two major actions over the last thirty years designed to
   maintain the stability and survival of the single-party system. Notably,
   many of the contemporary challenges faced by the regime, such as a local
   government budgetary crisis and rampant official corruption within
   subnational governments, are in many respects the unforeseen
   consequences of an earlier intervention by the Center conducted in the
   mid-1990s under Jiang Zemin.},

Pages = {20-28},
Abstract = {Military exercises are rarely straightforward in either intention or
   outcome. Official policy and governance about exercises have not kept up
   with the complexity of the current national and international contexts.
   In addition to collective training, exercises are now used for a wide
   variety of purposes, such as fostering alliance cohesion and defence
   diplomacy. In this article, Beatrice Heuser and Harold Simpson argue
   that the diverse effects and outcomes of exercises merit further
   investigation, and future guidance for British practitioners will
   reflect this.},

Abstract = {Since the end of the 1990s, German historians and social scientists have
   been debating the entanglement of former professional colleagues in the
   National-Socialist system of rule and its policies of conquest and
   annihilation in Central and Eastern Europe. A recently published
   biography is devoted to Peter Scheibert (1915-1995), who served in the
   Foreign Office and in Special Commando Kunsberg, a unit that carried out
   the state-sponsored theft of art and cultural property in the occupied
   countries. The book provides hardly any indication of Scheibert's
   personal activities and his political views during the years before
   1945. Scheibert's political and moral convictions are analysed with
   reference to questionable concepts. A thorough, critical examination of
   his intellectual and political development, his role as a university
   teacher in Marburg, and his academic work remain desiderata.},

Abstract = {This article aims at exploring differences in the level and structure of
   political knowledge among citizens under the age of 18 and older
   segments of the population. It focuses on Austria, where the voting age
   in national elections was lowered to 16 in 2007. Drawing on data by the
   Austrian National Election Study (AUTNES), it is shown that 16 and 17
   year olds know comparatively little about political actors and the
   Austrian parties' positions, but that they are nevertheless mature
   enough to take part in elections. Moreover, regarding citizens'
   political knowledge, Austrians are rather specialists than generalists,
   independent of the age group. The results have important implications,
   in particular for the political education of adolescents.},

Abstract = {Published polls in the 2013 British Columbia provincial election
   conspicuously failed. This paper uses the Vote Compass Voter Advice
   Applications to shed light on the prediction failure. At the same time,
   it considers whether the dynamics of expressed vote intention in the
   Compass can be deployed as a rolling cross-section - in particular,
   whether the dynamics of participant self-selection are driven by
   temporally differentiated bias. Analysis will include selection effects
   within the Compass, as participants choose whether or not to proceed
   beyond the ``voter advice{''} component to the political perception and
   intention batteries.},

   key element of sustainable urban development, green areas should be used

   the president's party in midterm Congressional elections: (1) a
   presidential penalty, defined as a preference for supporting the
   opposition during midterm years, (2) a surge and decline in voter
   turnout, and (3) a reversion to the mean in voter partisanship. To
   quantify the contribution of each of these factors, an econometric model
   is developed in which voters jointly choose whether or not to
   participate and which party to support in both house and presidential
   elections. Estimated using ANES data from both presidential and midterm
   years, the model can fully explain the observed midterm gaps, and
   counterfactual simulations demonstrate that each factor makes a sizable
   contribution towards the midterm gap, with the presidential penalty
   playing the largest role.},

Abstract = {This paper argues that corruption in South Africa is a legacy of the
   governance practices of the apartheid and colonial past but has taken on
   a distinctly post-apartheid form. Public sector corruption in South
   Africa is similar and comparable to that found globally in both
   developed and developing countries. At the heart of the corruption
   problem resides a political party that has become reliant on the public
   sector to keep together a very disparate electoral and intra-party
   coalition and that enjoys an overwhelming electoral majority, partially
   because of its public sector largesse. In that sense, the African
   National Congress (ANC) is a quintessential example of one-party
   dominance and resulting party patronage in an electoral democracy.},

Abstract = {David Miller offers a liberal realist defence of immigration control
   grounded in cosmopolitan ideals of self-determination, fairness and
   integration. But a commitment to liberal values requires a commitment to
   more open borders than he admits. A part of the problem is that the
   notion of open borders Miller criticises is under-theorised. A deeper
   problem is that immigration control itself is inconsistent with
   important liberal values notably the values of freedom and equality.
   This is a concern because it is the freedom and equality not only of
   immigrants but also of citizens that is threatened by the closing of
   borders.},

Title = {The Ecuadorian Politico-Environmental Paradox},
Journal = {PROVINCIA},
Year = {2017},
Number = {37},
Pages = {29-73},
Month = {JAN-JUN},
Abstract = {Ecuador in times of the Rafael Correa government constitutes a perfect
   example of the politico-environmental paradox, which deals with
   conflicts in which all involved actors -State authorities as well as
   ecologist and Indigenous opposition- claim to represent the true
   vanguard concerning safeguarding of the environment and human
   conditions. On the one hand, Ecuador presents the most progressive
   Constitution in the world regarding the protection of nature and it also
   incorporates far-reaching recognition of Indigenous peoples. On the
   other hand, the developmentalist economy based on extractivism has
   continued during the period and the government argues that the revenues
   of extractive industries benefit the common good (welfare reforms).Based
   on several years of ethnographic fieldwork in Ecuador, combined with
   critical reading of previous literature and analysis of public
   discourses, political documents and material obtained through
   participatory observation, this article identifies and problematizes the
   dominant narratives among the actors of the contentious discursive
   scenarios. It also analyzes how State authorities and their adversaries
   aim at positioning themselves towards the other in relation to
   extractivism and ecological concerns.How are (progressive) environmental
   politics and ecological concernsperceived, defined and expressed by
   different actors?},

Pages = {317-334},
Abstract = {Australian Foreign Minister Julie Bishop and former Prime Minister Tony
   Abbott's Chief of Staff Peta Credlin have experienced very different
   political fortunes. Once the two most powerful women in the Australian
   Liberal Party, Credlin's political demise was mired in controversy,
   while Bishop continues to enjoy the support of her Party and the public.
   While there are many reasons for this, the article focuses on the
   gendered politics surrounding their experiences. Based on analysis of
   the media representations of Bishop and Credlin between 2011 and 2015,
   we argue that Bishop successfully negotiates gender politics by
   deploying the Iron Butterfly model of conservative femininity, while
   Credlin's fierce Political Warrior persona saw her pilloried.},

Abstract = {The announcement of 22 June 2014 from the World Heritage Committee that
   Pyu Ancient Cities had been added to the World Heritage List was
   significant for Myanmar, since it represented the country's first World
   Heritage site. The World Heritage listing was the culmination of a
   process driven by a convergence of forces originating from within and
   outside of Myanmar. An interpretation of Pyu Ancient Cities as involving
   a transnational network of supporters echoes the work on transnational
   advocacy networks, which looks to phenomena involving transnational
   efforts to advance particular issues on behalf of activists against
   their government. This study examines Pyu Ancient Cities by producing a
   model that helps to illuminate the efficacy of its social network to
   engage in transnational advocacy.},

Abstract = {This article discusses the issue of the right to health care for
   irregularised migrants in Sweden, from a human rights perspective. An
   extended right to health care for irregularised migrants came into
   effect through a legislative amendment in 2013. By exploring the
   legislative process before the new Act on Health Care to Some Foreigners
   Who Reside In Sweden Without the Necessary Permits in 2013, we show how
   the Act uses `deportability' as a legal category and basis for health
   care and why this is problematic. Our study reveals a variety of
   practices that reproduce inconsistencies entrenched in
   rights-mobilisation for non-citizens: separate legislations for
   different categories of persons, vague accounts of treaty-obligations,
   absence of discussions on liability, and shifting the responsibility of
   extending health care to the local government.},

Abstract = {Classic variables that have been explaining the electoral behavior
   throughout the 20th century are now in question in the context of
   contemporary societies. Neuroscience represents a very promising field
   of study for its application in the analysis of voter behavior,
   approaching the possibility of studying the role emotions play in it.
   Neuromarketing applied to political marketing is presented as a powerful
   tool that would allow us to observe how different electoral targets
   react neurologically to a given political nature stimulus, thus
   identifying new sharper elements of voting behavior. This article aims
   to discuss future applications and projection of neuroscience in the
   political science field as well as to highlight the need to take into
   account the role of emotions in the behavior of voters.},

Journal = {POLIS-POLITICHESKIYE ISSLEDOVANIYA},

Number = {6},
Pages = {178-188},
Abstract = {This article is a review of the textbook by A. I. Nikitin
   ``International Conflicts: Interference, Peacemaking, Settlement{''},
   dedicated to international conflicts, as well as international
   activities for their resolution and resolution, in the context of modern
   peacekeeping practice. The structure of the textbook is composed of
   three separate blocks with an independent educational and methodological
   significance: the theory of international conflicts; peacemaking: the
   regulatory framework, forms and methods of organizing and conducting
   peacekeeping operations; cases, that is, analysis of specific
   international and regional conflicts, arranged by region. Synthesis of
   these three blocks and directions provides for the desired synergistic
   effect. The reviewed textbook will be quite useful for a wide
   readership, for it is written on a high system and professional level.
   This is a complete, well-established work, based on a solid source base,
   demonstrating the author's excellent knowledge of the methodology of
   political science research and a highly professional style of presenting
   knowledge. In addition, this is one of the first works on international
   conflictology, which will be in demand by everyone studying
   international relations and conflictology. The book fills a huge gap in
   the educational literature on conflictology. The level of conclusions
   and generalizations presented in the book corresponds to the advanced
   level of development of modern political science. Numerous facts,
   information and reference data accompanying the analysis of conflicts
   make the book interesting not only for students and graduate students,
   but also for those who already have experience with research and
   practical work in this field.},

Journal = {POLITICA Y SOCIEDAD},

Volume = {54},
Number = {2},
Pages = {545-564},
Abstract = {This paper will interpret the meaning of the end of history, announced
   in different ways by Fukuyama and Jameson from a Modern political and
   Utopian angle. From various fragments by utopist novels, it is clear
   that imagined ideal societies designed during Modernity were based in
   the end of History. This end would conclude with the circumscription of
   time just to the present. With the aid of philosophical and sociological
   bibliography it seems clear to me that similar temporary patterns appear
   today. Posmodernity -often described as the time where utopia dies-shows
   in its temporality features considered as utopic (or dystopic following
   G. Orwell) in the recent past. That paradox speaks about continuities
   and breaks between Postmodernity and Modernity. Also the conclusion is
   that renovating utopia requires to abandon the project of history as
   something finished.},

Title = {How negative partisanship affects voting behavior in Europe: Evidence
   from an analysis of 17 European multi-party systems with proportional
   voting},
Journal = {RESEARCH \& POLITICS},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {4},

Month = {JAN 1},
Abstract = {While positive party identification is one of the most used concepts in
   election studies, negative partisanship (NPID) is rarely analyzed.
   Evidence from two-party systems or settings with majority voting shows
   that hostility towards one of the other parties has its own unique
   impact on voting behavior. However, this effect has not been analyzed in
   the context of European multi-party systems with proportional voting. In
   this paper, I utilize data from the Comparative Study of Electoral
   Systems, Module 3, which demonstrates that negative partisanship has its
   own positive effect on turnout (about nine percentage points). In
   addition, negative partisanship affects vote choice by 2-6 percentage
   points. However, contrary to previous findings, NPID does not always
   affect voting for one of the other parties; no significant relationship
   was found between NPID and vote choice for Conservative/Christian
   Democratic and Liberal parties. The results of this study add to the
   growing literature on negative partisanship and demonstrate its
   importance in the analysis of voting behavior in multi-party systems.},

Abstract = {The academic and media use of the notion of populism appeared in Quebec
   at the beginning of the 2000s, two decades later than in France. The
   authors who implement this notion in order to analyze Quebec's electoral
   scene navigate between references that are sometimes French, at other
   times North American, but that describe a ``people{''} with social
   characteristics different from the social group defined by this term in
   France. The understanding of the dynamics of circulation, translation,
   and reception of the notion of ``populism{''} in Quebec necessitates the
   simultaneous investigation of the trajectory of the intellectuals
   involved in these processes, as well as the specifics of the content of
   this statement. The lesser importance of the political sociology of
   social groups in Quebec notably influences the means of (self)
   representing the popular with the aid of this category.},

Abstract = {The Eurocrisis has generated a deep and ongoing politicization of the EU
   within and across national public spheres, fuelling age-old and new
   political and social conflicts, which in turn shape public perceptions
   of crisis and the legitimacy of `crisis government'. Focusing on Greece,
   an EU member state at the epicentre of the crisis, this paper examines
   how the European polity was contested in the first five years
   (2009-2013) of the `Eurocrisis'. During this period, anti-German
   stereotypes resurfaced in the Greek public sphere in parallel with
   increasingly mainstream Euroscepticism. Nevertheless, analysis of news
   and social media content from this period shows that beneath this
   new-found scepticism towards the EU and Germany's role in it lie two
   much broader narratives: that of the power struggle between the people
   and the political elites; and that of an epic clash between
   diametrically different political ideologies.},

Abstract = {The notion ``right to the city{''} arises to discuss collective action
   around urban megaprojects in Mexico City. It is argued that urban
   management has been transformed by ``concessioning{''} the public space
   to private companies for the development of commercial activities,
   through a private real estate development agency, new legal and action
   figures ``parallel{''} to the current legislation; the project
   Chapultepec-Zona Rosa Cultural Corridor (CCCH-ZR) is analyzed as a
   process of ``citizen scrutiny{''}, through mobilizations, this has
   implied a decrease in the participation of citizens in the design and
   implementation of urban policies. And institutional protests, has
   denounced the privatization and commercial nature of the project,
   revealing the limits of the public consultation as a mechanism to decide
   on the intervention of urban space, which can influence the demand for
   public information and social accountability as necessary elements, but
   not enough, to advance in the collective construction of the right to
   the city.},

Title = {RUSSIA, DEMOCRACY AND POST-SOVIET AREA - SOME ASPECTS OF POLITICAL
   THOUGHT OF ALEKSANDR SOLZHENITSYN},
Journal = {POLITICKE VEDY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {20},
Number = {3},
Pages = {28-44},
Abstract = {Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, one of the most prominent and widely known
   authors of the 20th century, winner of the Nobel Prize in Literature and
   also significant political thinker, surely does not require an extensive
   introduction. For decades, his famous novels have enjoyed popularity
   among a massive base of readers. We know that Solzhenitsyn's life
   journey ranged from a shift toward communism and involvement in
   operations during WWII to his experience in the gulag and his exile
   work, his departure to the West, and his return to Russia after the fall
   of the Soviet Empire, where he died in 2008. This paper does not focus
   on Solzhenitsyn's work from a literary-science perspective; its aim is
   to characterize the most important elements of the author's political
   thought, which is primarily present in a wide range of public political
   journalism articles. The first chapter of the paper focuses on
   Solzhenitsyn's critique of the Soviet establishment, while the second
   explores the author's attitude toward the West, liberalism, and
   democracy. In the last section of the paper, attention is given to the
   third important thematic field Solzhenitsyn's view of the relationship
   between Russia and post-Soviet states, evaluation of the legitimacy of
   their independence, and of Russian nationalism, which is unambiguously
   linked to this issue. As the author shows in this article,
   Solzhenitsyn's political thought is nationalistic, conservative and
   related to Orthodox Christianity and idea of Holy Rus{''} and legacy of
   Kievan Rus. In his view here is no place for independent Ukraine and
   Belorussia. This idea is shared by number of Russian politicians.
   Knowledge of his political thought thus contributes to understanding the
   wider context of East European politics.},

Abstract = {Schumpeter's highly influential theory of democracy, developed in
   Capitalism, Socialism and Democracy, is less a market-based theory of
   party competition than it is a theory of strong leadership, modeled
   after generalship. As such, it is a weak foundation for rebuilding a
   democratic theory of party politics. Moreover, Schumpeter's demolition
   of the Classical Doctrine of Democracy knocks down a straw-man theory: a
   hybrid of Bentham's utilitarianism and Rousseau's communitarianism that
   few contemporary theorists of democracy would be willing to defend.},

Journal = {RUSI JOURNAL},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {162},
Number = {3},
Pages = {60-72},
Abstract = {In this article, Elizabeth Pearson and Emily Winterbotham explore the
   role of gender in radicalisation to Daesh (also known as the Islamic
   State of Iraq and Syria, ISIS). They discuss possible factors in female
   radicalisation, and how radicalisation differs between men and women.
   They find that the gender of the recruit affects the enabling factors,
   mechanisms and locations relating to radicalisation. The article
   challenges assertions that the recruitment of young men and women to
   Daesh follows identical patterns, as well as the narrative of women as
   innately peaceful, or as actors coerced into joining Daesh, revealing
   the importance of female empowerment in the group's appeal.},

Abstract = {Egbert Jahn's and Inge Auerbach's slating of Esther Abel's book about

   dissolve the question of Scheibert's guilt and responsibility for his
   actions during the Second World War and his involvement in stealing art.
   In so doing, Jahn and Auerbach fall behind the latest developments in
   the historiographical discussion and legal assessment of guilt. Their
   comments express clear elements of a revisionist discourse which is of
   socio-political significance, since their article represents a call to
   bring to a halt all critical evaluation of the activities of historians

Abstract = {This article examines the role of political mandates in including or
   excluding civil society in the negotiation processes mediated by the
   Intergovernmental Authority on Development in South Sudan and by the
   Southern African Development Community in Zimbabwe. It argues that the
   mandates determined the issue of inclusivity by synthesizing the
   mediating organizations' normative considerations and practical
   requirements and by enabling the organizations' narrative of the
   conflict to dominate the negotiations at the expense of other
   narratives. The article concludes that the mandate led to the inclusion
   of civil society in the Madagascar case and the exclusion of civil
   society in the Zimbabwe mediation.},

Title = {Towards parliamentarisation of foreign and security policy?},
Journal = {WEST EUROPEAN POLITICS},

Volume = {40},

Abstract = {It is customary to argue that foreign policy is very much dominated by
   the executive, with parliaments wielding limited influence. However,
   with the exception of the US Congress, legislative. executive relations
   in the realm of foreign and security policy have attracted remarkably
   little scholarly attention. Drawing on a principal. agent framework,
   this collection scrutinises the conventional wisdom of `executive
   autonomy' in foreign affairs, indicating that even though parliaments
   have arguably become more involved in foreign and security policy over
   time, any notions of parliamentarisation need to be treated with
   caution. While expectations of consensus in the name of the national
   interest continue to play an important role in foreign policy
   decision-making, the papers highlight the role of party-political
   contestation structuring parliamentary debates and votes in this
   increasingly politicised issue area. This introductory paper introduces
   the analytical framework and hypotheses guiding the contributions in
   this collection, summarises their main findings and suggests avenues for
   future research.},

Abstract = {This study seeks to understand the conditions that led individuals to
   accept the risks associated with leaving the Lord's Resistance Army. To
   this end, a large participant survey of former rebels was conducted.
   Results from the survey suggest that the investment model offers a
   useful tool for capturing the factors that weigh into an individual's
   decision-making process as he or she considers disengaging from a group.
   However, the data also suggest that lack of investment does not equate
   to disengagement. The perceived opportunity for escape and the costs
   associated with the risk of escape play critical roles. Consequently,
   counterinsurgency campaigns and postconflict reconciliation efforts in
   Africa ought to be jointly calibrated to maximize the likelihood of
   disengagement.},

Title = {Impact of American Political Marketing on Israeli Society},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF POLITICAL MARKETING},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {16},
Number = {1},
Pages = {23-49},
Abstract = {The extensive literature examining the impact of American campaign
   styles in other countries generally attributes various political changes
   to the presence of American professionals and imported campaign
   techniques. Yet foreign professionals working on international campaigns
   may have more or less influence, and there is little systematic
   understanding of the factors that contribute to their actual influence
   over the local campaign. This paper examines the Israeli case as an
   example of strong penetration of American campaign professionals and
   techniques and analyzes the factors that contributed to their relatively
   high level of influence. Following this, a framework is proposed for
   assessing when imported American professionals and/or styles are likely
   to have a strong or weak influence on a campaign, based on factors
   leading to easy adoption or requiring more extensive adaptation. The
   study finds that in Israel, endogenous factors including social,
   political, cultural, and economic evolution contributed to the easy
   adoption of American campaign practices, creating a welcoming
   environment for American professionals. Thus, the major changes in
   campaigns often attributed to Americanization in other countries may be
   due at least in part to organic social, economic, and cultural changes
   of that society.},

Abstract = {At the end of 2014, a right-wing populist movement named PEGIDA emerged
   in Germany, starting in Dresden. Whereas branches of this movement
   disappeared within a few months all across the country, the movement in
   Dresden persists. This article seeks to uncover the attitudes behind
   this movement. Derived from literature regarding the voting of
   right-wing populist parties in Europe we built an analytic model
   considering group-focused enmity, political disenchantment, distrust in
   media, right-wing attitudes, fears of extremism, foreign domination as
   well as of economic decline, as conceivable predictors of support for
   PEGIDA. With a time lag of twelve months, we conducted a two-wave web
   survey with inhabitants of Dresden within a representative, recruited,
   online panel. Our results show that the most important factors driving
   the support for PEGIDA are hostility against foreigners, fears of
   foreign domination, distrust in the media and right-wing attitudes.
   However, political disenchantment and fears of economic decline do not
   play a role in explaining the support for PEGIDA.},

Abstract = {This chapter reviews major indicators of the party composition of
   governments in 21 advanced democratic nations from 1950 to 2015,
   discusses strength and weaknesses of the various measures, and portrays
   their estimates of the extent to which various families of parties have
   participated in government in this period. Using Social Democratic
   parties' participation in office as an example, the analysis of
   longitudinal and cross-sectional data reveals major correlates and
   causes of the variations in the partisan complexion of governments in
   advanced democracies in the post-World War II period. The data analysis
   suggests that five variables account for a substantial proportion of the
   share of cabinet seats controlled by Social Democratic parties from 1950
   to 2015: historical participation in government from the end of World
   War I until 1950, membership in the Nordic family of nations, cleavage
   systems which favour centre-left parties, the social democratic vote,
   and proportional representation.},

Abstract = {This paper examines the relationship between The Good Society by Walter
   Lippmann and the ordoliberal ideals. The first part analyses the core
   elements of a new liberalism - centered on the axiomatic theory of the
   competition to which the subjects and their jobs must be aligned by the
   representative government. The second part shows how this approach used
   by Lippman is in the background of the Colloque Walter Lippmann, that
   took place in Paris in 1938, and that is often considered as the moment
   in which the neoliberal discourse emerged. Eventually, the third part
   focuses on the idea of the neoliberal government of society and on the
   meaning of the Liberalism Agenda developed during the works of the
   aforementioned Colloque.},

Abstract = {Alexander Wendt's Quantum Mind and Social Science challenges social
   scientists to replace contemporary understandings of the individual and
   society with concepts better suited to quantum reality. This would mean
   replacing reductionist materialism with notions of consciousness as
   probabilistic, not strictly determined; and substituting, for
   individualistic models of society, new ones that acknowledged our
   connectedness to each other at a distance, i.e., without mediation by
   mechanisms modeled on Newtonian physics. His challenge is welcome, for
   in both respects, Wendt would have us replace ways of thinking that have
   long been inadequate to explain empirical reality.},

Abstract = {.Strong parties are critical for democracy, but under what conditions do
   strong parties emerge? Paradoxically, adverse conditions may facilitate
   successful party-building. Office-seekers with low access to state
   resources and mass media must undertake the difficult work of
   organization-building to contend for power. Because organization
   building is slow, laborious, sometimes risky, and usually
   non-remunerative, the process selects for ideologically committed
   activists. Low state and media access thus facilitates the construction
   of durable parties and is empirically associated with opposition to
   authoritarian rule. The article illustrates this argument through a
   comparison of three recently emerged left-wing parties in Latin America:
   two that survived early electoral crises, Brazil's Workers' Party and
   Mexico's Party of the Democratic Revolution, and one that did not,
   Argentina's Front for a Country in Solidarity.},

Abstract = {Among ancient Romans, tripalium could be both an instrument of torture,
   of a device to beat the wheat and yet of a kind of plow. This duality is
   inherent to the labour act itself, which for some may be just painfull,
   to others fully pleasant and, for most people, both pleasant and
   painfull. Over time, the Labour Law has tried its best to dose that
   mixture, often on the employee's benefit, though, up to date, it's been
   further focused on the economic aspect in spite of the human, sensitive
   aspect. That's the reason for the claiming for its repersonalization, so
   that freedom does not conceal a real necessity.},

Abstract = {Russia's political leaders have a different understanding of food
   security than traditional usage. The traditional usage of the term food
   security refers to access, availability, and nutritional aspects of
   food. According to the conventional application of food security, the
   vast majority of the Russian population is not food insecure by
   traditional measures. The Russian variant of food security connects food
   trade to national security. The Russian political leadership argues that
   Russia is food insecure based on food imports. Survey data are used to
   assess support for the government's food security policy, and to analyze
   the impact of the self-imposed food embargo on Russian consumers.},

Abstract = {Addressing violent extremism could potentially benefit from new
   initiatives that extend beyond criminal justice and are a part of public
   health policy and practice. This claim is based on knowledge from prior
   countering violent extremism (CVE) research and on immersion with
   communities, practitioners, and policymakers. This knowledge indicates
   that to date law enforcement-centered initiatives have not generated
   targeted evidence-based prevention or intervention initiatives, and they
   have had the unintended consequence of provoking community resistance.
   The Center for Disease Control's Ten Essential Public Health Services is
   proposed as a new conceptual framework for a public health approach to
   addressing violent extremism which aims for policy and practice shifts.
   The public health approach offers opportunities for multipurpose
   programming, avoiding stigma, and leveraging existing public health
   resources. Such shifts are illustrated by discussing the CVE program
   being further developed in Los Angeles, California, based in part upon
   the public health model.},

Journal = {DEMOCRATIZATION},

Volume = {24},

Pages = {1235-1252},
Abstract = {This introductory essay argues that patterns of diffusion and
   cooperation among non-democratic regimes differ significantly in goal,
   mode, impulse, and scope. Autocracies that are guided by a dynamic,
   missionary ideology, such as interwar fascism and, less fervently, the
   Bolivarianism of Hugo Chavez, actively promote their new credo in a wide
   range of countries. Moreover, these messianic belief systems stimulate
   diffusion processes across the globe. A wide range of political leaders
   take inspiration from these missionary ideologies and emulate their
   values and ideas to a greater or lesser extent. By contrast, most
   authoritarian regimes in the contemporary era lack an expansive ideology
   and are driven mostly by political interests. International diffusion
   and cooperation among these regimes reflects mainly the defensive goal
   of immunization against Western efforts at democracy promotion. To
   guarantee regime survival, authoritarian great powers in the post-Cold
   War world, such as Russia and China, concentrate on fortifying their
   regional sphere of influence. Thus, targeted, calculated collaboration
   and instrumental learning prevail.},

Abstract = {In contemporary Australian politics, challenges to the Prime Ministerial
   role have become more common. Australia saw five Prime Ministers from
   2010 to 2015 including Australia's first ever woman Prime Minister,
   Julia Gillard. A stark contrast is evident in media portrayals of
   Gillard and her male counterparts, apparent most recently in the
   response to Malcolm Turnbull's ascension to the Prime Ministership. A
   range of evidence has been produced, in disciplines including political
   science and media studies, suggesting the existence of systemic gender
   bias in the mainstream media in English-speaking democracies. This
   article is the first to compare the media portrayals of Gillard and
   Turnbull's respective ascensions to leadership, which it does drawing on
   Judith Butler's concept of gender performativity and using a content and
   discourse analysis. It contributes further evidence of gender bias in
   the coverage of political leaders.},

Abstract = {This article explores former President Joaquim Chissano's mediation in
   Madagascar after the 2009 political crisis that led to the ouster of
   President Marc Ravalomanana. It shows that there are inherent tensions
   in mediating the reestablishment of constitutional order in the context
   of the African Union's anti-coup policy. While espousing the ideal of
   mediation as an inclusive and locally owned process, Chissano's mandate
   contradicted both the realities on the ground and the prescriptions of
   the AU's anti-coup policy. The article analyzes the norms and principles
   inscribed in this mandate and their ambiguous translation into practice.
   The analysis offers inroads into understanding the normative and
   practical dilemmas of mediation in the context of unconstitutional
   changes of government.},

Abstract = {The paradigmatic migrant' in China is a worker of rural origin, but more
   than 30\% of the one-fifth of the population living and working away
   from their place of hukou registration are inter-urban migrants, a group
   mostly neglected by scholars. Based on ethnographic observation and
   interviews from two Chinese cities - one on the coast, one in the
   impoverished interior - this article examines how a range of types of
   migrants deal with citizenship and mobility. It shows that a key
   criterion for being able to settle in a new place and gain access to
   local social citizenship is migrants' level of culture,' expressed
   primarily through formal education. Linking access to local citizenship
   for migrants to their cultural quality' goes largely unquestioned, as it
   is connected to the legitimacy of education as a means of
   differentiating among citizens more generally. This logic shapes family
   migration strategies as parents seek to ensure that their children will
   receive an education that enables access to the kinds of good jobs and
   benefits that enable full citizenship wherever they live.},

Volume = {15},
Number = {4},
Pages = {967-987},

Abstract = {Over the last decade, organized criminal violence has reached
   unprecedented levels and has caused as much violent death globally as
   direct armed conflict. Nonetheless, the study of organized crime in
   political science remains limited because these organizations and their
   violence are not viewed as political. Building on recent innovations in
   the study of armed conflict, I argue that organized criminal violence
   should no longer be segregated from related forms of organized violence
   and incorporated within the political violence literature. While
   criminal organizations do not seek to replace or break away from the
   state, they have increasingly engaged in the politics of the state
   through the accumulation of the means of violence itself. Like other
   non-state armed groups, they have developed variously collaborative and
   competitive relationships with the state that have produced heightened
   levels of violence in many contexts and allowed these organizations to
   gather significant political authority. I propose a simple conceptual
   typology for incorporating the study of these organizations into the
   political violence literature and suggest several areas of future
   inquiry that will illuminate the relationship between violence and
   politics more generally.},

Abstract = {This study is concerned with welfare state development and the
   intersection between the twin global phenomena of sub-state nationalism
   and governance transitions'. Specifically, how minority nationalist
   parties (MNPs) use discourse to exert pressure for welfare change.
   Accordingly, here, we explore their discourse in Scottish and Welsh
   elections, and the UK Brexit' referendum on European Union membership.
   The findings reveal how pressure for welfare change is framed using key
   tropes including nation-building, extending social protection and
   resistance to central government programmes. The wider significance to
   understanding global social policy lies in the following: (1) revealing
   the discursive processes associated with multi-level welfare state
   dynamics, (2) demonstrating how MNPs and governance transitions combine
   to pressure for welfare state change, and (3) showing how the resultant
   territorialisation of policy discourse advances sub-state' models of
   social citizenship.},

Abstract = {Melville's Benito Cereno and the film Captain Phillips are both based on
   actual events in which black Africans unlawfully seized control of a
   ship led by whites; in both cases, (a kind of) order was eventually
   restored after Americans violently suppressed the Africans. Both the
   novella and the film take what at first glance might seem like a simple
   tale of American heroism and transform it into a story that is far more
   tragic and morally complex. Some readers of the novella in Melville's
   day and some viewers of the film may have been tempted to interpret the
   respective stories solely as thrilling adventure tales that
   unambiguously celebrate the triumph and the goodness of American power;
   at the same time, both Melville and the makers of Captain Phillips lead
   the perceptive reader and the perceptive viewer to ask critical
   questions about the degree to which American power actually promotes
   justice.},

   the Powerless},
Journal = {POLITICAL THEORY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {45},
Number = {6},
Pages = {801-823},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {While Foucault's work on biopolitics continues to inspire diverse
   studies in a variety of disciplines, it has largely been missing from
   the debates on the possibility of affirmative biopolitics which have
   been primarily influenced by the work of Agamben and Esposito. This
   article restores Foucault's work to these debates, proposing that his
   final lecture course at the College de France in 1983-1984 developed a
   paradigm of affirmative biopolitics in the reading of the Cynic practice
   of truth-telling (parrhesia). The Cynic problematization of the relation
   between truth and life and their transvaluation of conventional truths
   by relocating them to the domain of bare life not only seeks to
   transform one's life in accordance with the truth but also, through the
   confrontation with the existing conventions and norms, to transform the
   world as such. Cynic parrhesia is thus biopolitical, insofar as it
   reclaims the power of one's life from the social order and its
   rationalities of government and applies it to oneself, investing one's
   existence with truth. Since Foucault developed this reading of Cynicism
   in the context of his political engagement on behalf on East European
   dissidents, the article proceeds to analyse the resonances between
   parrhesia and Vaclav Havel's idea of living within the truth,
   elaborating the biopolitical significance of both practices. We conclude
   by addressing the implications of our interpretation for Foucault
   scholarship and the wider debates on biopolitics.},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Arbitration as an alternative method of dispute resolution intrinsically
   is considered an exceptional institution. Being exceptional the
   arbitration institution requires to form it under the agreement of the
   will of the parties in the form of the arbitration agreement and thus
   until the parties have not agreed, Judgment is not imposed on them.
   Arbitration agreement is a contract in term of nature, and like all
   contacts must be respected the general rules of contract in it. The
   noteworthy point about this is that how is the observation of these
   conditions in arbitration agreement? In addition, this contract has the
   contents and conditions that the contracting parties agree to it and the
   basis of action of arbitrator or arbitrators is in the dispute
   settlement that it is interpreted as the specific conditions of the
   contract. The most important cases that often are noticed them in
   arbitration agreements and in the case of silence of the parties, the
   law governing the arbitration is replaced with their will in this
   regard, as follow: competence of arbitrator, language arbitration, the
   arbitration time, the arbitration costs, location of investigation and
   the number of arbitrators. The main question in this regard is this, how
   is the mutual consent of the parties of agreement in this regard. The
   answer to these two questions is the subject of this paper, which has
   been dealt with it through library studies and with the content analysis
   method.},

Abstract = {Although signing statements have been touted as a powerful addition to
   the president's toolkit, their use has dropped off considerably in
   recent years. We argue that this decrease can be explained by the
   changing costs of using signing statements. In particular, we posit that
   Congress' response to signing statements, which included committee
   hearings on the use of signing statements, raised the costs of this tool
   above any potential benefits. Investigating over 650 presidential
   signing statements among over 1,800 public laws, we find that public and
   congressional outcry influenced the issuance of signing statements and
   helps explain their decreased use.},

Abstract = {After the Islamic revolution in Iran in 1979, fundamental changes
   occurred in Iran's political and legal system. Pursuant the referendum
   on creating the Islamic Republic in March 1979, the new constitution
   came into force in the same year and many of the ordinary laws of the
   country were also reformed. The purpose of this study is to consider the
   method of ratification of international treaties and the status of these
   instruments in the legal system of Iran. Firstly, the stages of the
   ratification of treaties in Iran's legal system have been explained.
   Secondly, the position of treaties among the other laws is discussed.
   This study concludes that, the international treaties, like ordinary
   laws, primarily should be passed by the Islamic Consultative Assembly;
   and after the approval of the Guardian Council, they should be signed by
   the President. Under the Constitution of Iran all international treaties
   should all be ratified by the Islamic Consultative Assembly (parliament)
   and the Guardian Council; however, based on the interpretations of the
   Guardian Council and the executive procedures, some treaties have been
   excluded from the ratification of the Islamic Consultative Assembly.
   International treaties may enjoy a higher position than that of the
   ordinary law through an objective interpretation, although they have
   been recognized as ordinary laws by the Article 9 of the Civil Code of
   Iran.},

Title = {The conditional effect of conspiracy thinking on attitudes toward
   climate change},
Journal = {RESEARCH \& POLITICS},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {4},
Number = {4},
Month = {NOV 27},
Abstract = {Even though climate scientists are nearly unanimous that climate change
   is real and manmade, about 40\% of Americans reject the scientific
   consensus. Why? The largest contributing factor is partisanship;
   however, recent studies argue that underlying conspiracy thinking exerts
   a positive, linear effect on climate change denial. In this article, we
   reexamine the effect of conspiracy thinking on climate change attitudes
   by accounting for the various pathways that conspiracy thinking could
   drive denialism in a politically polarized environment. We find the
   effects of conspiracy thinking on climate change denial are not only
   larger than previously suggested, but also non-monotonic and conditional
   on individuals' party identification. Moreover, we find evidence
   suggesting conspiracy thinking affects independents' positions, and even
   their partisan leanings. These findings further explain why people
   reject the scientific consensus on climate change, and suggest that
   climate change denial is not merely the product of partisan
   polarization.},

Abstract = {This article examines how parties organize legislative speech. Electoral
   incentives and legislative institutions affect speech participation.
   When electoral systems create personal vote-seeking incentives, parties
   are less concerned with screening speeches and more supportive of
   members seeking to garner name recognition. But in many countries,
   legislative rules and norms constrain opportunities for individual
   position taking during the lawmaking debates. We argue that parties
   resolve this dilemma by organizing speech participation into
   nonlegislative speeches and lawmaking debates. In each instance,
   different types of legislators are more likely to speak. We examine the
   case of Chile and test the implications of our theory with data on
   congressional speeches.},

Abstract = {The civil society is gaining a relevant role within the framework of the
   European Development Aid policy. However, the emphasis granted by the EU
   is in contrast with the practical experience of civil society
   organisations in specific contexts and their difficulties to make it
   effective. This article shows that the civil society's political
   influence depends on factors that differ widely among regional contexts.
   The very existence of institutional mechanisms and spaces for dialogue
   does not guarantee civil society participation or its effective impact
   on the EU development aid policy. Based on a qualitative research
   conducted in Senegal, we will illustrate the obstacles that are
   hindering the political influence of Senegalese civil society
   organisations and the deep gap between the institutional conception of
   political influence and the challenges encountered by civil society
   organisations in their daily work dynamics at the local level.},

Abstract = {In this paper we use latent class analysis to identify the four faces of
   political participation. Previous research has generally focused on
   conventional forms of political participation (for example, voting),
   with some research looking as well at unconventional forms of political
   participation, like protesting. Moreover, most research studies these
   forms of participation separately. However, citizens actually engage in
   both conventional and unconventional participation simultaneously, and
   here we present a methodology that can identify citizens who engage in
   both, neither, or only one form of participation. Using our approach, we
   examine a series of hypotheses about how social, political, and economic
   grievances lead citizens to engage in each face of political
   participation. We apply this methodology to recent survey data from
   Argentina, which we argue is an excellent case for studying both forms
   of participation simultaneously. This application demonstrates the
   utility of the latent class approach for studying the four faces of
   political participation.},

Abstract = {This article revisits Louis Hartz's distinctive contribution to American
   political thought. Pushing against his reputation as an overly
   complacent consensus historian, I highlight Hartz's forceful critique of
   America's liberal blindness, a critique reaching back to the Founding
   and culminating in an engagement with the politics of his own Cold War
   moment. Alarmed by the rise of McCarthyism, Hartz warned against an
   intensifying Americanism at home and advised increasing contact with
   cultures abroad in the hopes of facilitating the sense of relativity
   engendered by the experience of seeing oneself through the eyes of
   others. The result, I argue, is a genre of prophetic liberalism, which
   compels Americans to transcend their
   liberal-absolutism-cum-isolationism, and which still affirms core
   enlightenment values. Hartz underscores the need for political theory's
   comparative vocation-one that alerts Americans to crucial blind spots
   within their national experience.},

Abstract = {What societies choose to remember about the Past can pose challenges for
   professional gatekeepers in museums, archives and statutory bodies
   charged with managing national heritage. Recent examples examined in
   this article include the inauguration of the National Museum of African
   American History and Culture in Washington, the 2016 Capability Brown
   Festival, changing attitudes towards poppies and the Rhodes Must Fall
   movement. These are explored through establishing a taxonomy of the
   eight functions that lieux de memoire fulfil in the course of reflecting
   the Past to the Present. Drawing attention to the way in which the
   imperialism of the Past is buried beneath the pristine lawns of
   Capability Brown's gardens in the Present, this article concludes by
   warning that lieux de memoire can provide an aesthetic veneer, glossing
   over aspects of the Past that societies, or elites within those
   societies, would, for their own purposes, rather forget.},

Abstract = {Leaders are assumed to face fiscal constraints on their ability to
   remain in office by competitively distributing public and/or private
   goods. However, many leaders can relax this constraint by borrowing on
   sovereign credit markets. This article argues that states with the
   fiscal flexibility offered by favorable credit terms have the resources
   necessary to (1) respond to citizen demands with policies other than
   widespread repression and (2) avoid agency loss that may result in
   unauthorized repression by state agents. Empirical analyses indicate
   that creditworthy states have greater respect for physical integrity
   rights and are less likely to suffer diminished respect for those rights
   when facing violent dissent or negative shocks to government revenues.},

Abstract = {Why do challengers attack some states that have allies, while avoiding
   conflict with others? This article builds upon previous research by
   arguing that parity in the observable capabilities of opposing states
   and their allies generates greater uncertainty and miscalculations on
   the part of challengers, which leads to a higher probability of
   conflict. Unlike previous research, however, this article argues that
   military alliances among democracies are better able to overcome this
   uncertainty, making power distributions largely irrelevant. The results
   demonstrate that uncertainty generated at power parity is mitigated when
   a target state's allies are more democratic, resulting in no overall
   change in the probability of conflict. This study therefore emphasizes
   that the effectiveness of military alliances lies not necessarily in
   their aggregation of power, but in their ability to co-ordinate their
   power and communicate this co-ordination to potential challengers.},

Abstract = {While electoral clientelism is common, we know little about what
   determines vote prices, which often vary significantly within
   country-elections. Extant literature offers differing predictions of
   whether supporters of the incumbent or outsiders receive higher value
   outlays. I expect past supporters of the incumbent charge higher prices,
   as their ability to threaten defection helps them extract ``loyalty
   premiums.{''}Further, incumbent allied brokers will seek to provide
   higher payments to followers, to maintain their own networks, while
   parties will be loath to make high-value payments to outsiders, which
   might only encourage opponents' turnout. Analyzing original panel data
   from Uganda, I find that ruling-party affiliates' reports of vote prices
   are significantly higher than others', suggesting that electoral
   clientelist strategies reward loyalty, at least in noncompetitive
   settings.},

   Chinese President Xi Jinping also seems willing to improve ties. Yet,
   despite the recent agreement by the two countries to normalise
   relations, the pace and extent of this process bears watching.},

   Work of Love},
Journal = {POLITICAL THEORY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {45},
Number = {5},
Pages = {682-704},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {This essay argues for reading Rachel Carson's Silent Spring as a work of
   love that calls for an environmental politics of desire rather than
   self-preservation narrowly construed. I make this argument by reading
   Silent Spring in conjunction with the extant love letters of Carson and
   Dorothy Freeman, where they depict their love as a wondrous multispecies
   achievement constituted through encounters with birds. I argue that
   their example reveals that love need be neither worldless nor
   heteronormative, but may be a world-disclosing practice that leads
   individuals to live, and desire to live, differently. Reading Silent
   Spring through the lens of these letters, I argue that it calls us to
   see the threat insecticides pose not only to ``mere life{''} (Honig) but
   also to pleasurable lives of wonder and love. I build on Silent Spring
   to argue for an alternative politics of survival in the face of climate
   change: one that foregrounds the connections between inter-human affects
   and a vibrant multispecies world, between intimate and public feelings,
   and calls for preservation of a multispecies world through and on behalf
   of human pleasure.},

Abstract = {This article illustrates major trends in political science research and
   frames the progress of research agendas in comparative politics. Drawing
   on the titles and abstracts of every article published in eight major
   political science journals between 1906 and 2015, the study tracks the
   frequency of references to specific keywords over time. The analysis
   corresponds to and complements extant descriptions of how the field has
   developed, providing evidence of three `revolutions' that shaped
   comparative politics-the divorce of political science from, history
   during its early years, a behavioral revolution that lasted until the
   late 1960s, and a second scientific revolution after 1989 characterized
   by greater empiricism. Understanding the development of the
   subdiscipline, and viewing it through the research published in
   political science over the last 100 years, provides useful context for
   teaching future comparativists and encourages scholars to think more
   broadly about the research traditions to which they are contributing.},

Abstract = {The article deals with manifestations of power in the relations between
   managers and knowledge-workers and the challenges that managers face in
   that context.The data retrieval was based on qualitative methodology and
   nine semi-structured interviews were conducted, with three managers and
   six employees, within three different organizations, a ministry,
   university and a bank. The main conclusions indicate that power is an
   important factor in successful management of knowledge-workers and that
   effective managers rely on their personal power, that is their expert
   and referent power, rather than formal power. The conclusions also
   indicate that the specialities of knowledge-workers, among other things
   the power they possess, make certain demands to the manager and his
   governance. The managers viewed themselves as the equals rather than the
   managers of the knowledge-workers. The conclusions also demonstrate how
   important it is for the managers to have good communication skills.
   Among other things it appeared that the managers need to exercise their
   power through rhetoric and persuasion.},

Abstract = {After the Islamic Revolution, the issue of the powers of the supreme
   leader was only considered in terms of scientific attention. However,
   the importance of this issue was more obvious, when was brought from the
   scientific scope to the practice scope. Should adopt religious support
   of these principles in the Constitution of the Islamic sources,
   especially traditions, with the Islamic Revolution and the rule of the
   supreme leader at the helm of the Islamic Republic of Iran and his
   authority in the Constitution. In addition, investigate the opinions of
   jurists, especially those who opposed or believed to limitations in
   supreme leader's authority to come closer to what is right. In this
   study, two titles of supreme leader authority and judgment included,
   that both have high importance In Shi'a jurisprudence.
   Certainly, there are differences in the powers of the Plenipotentiary,
   and this case flows in the exercising sovereignty towards the general
   judicial policies. Since the judges permitted by Plenipotentiary, and in
   most cases are not religious jurisprudence, so the position and value of
   judgments rendered by them are evaluated, and even religious
   jurisprudential judges and above all Head of the Judiciary, all in the
   application of laws are obliged to comply with the Plenipotentiary. The
   main goals of this thesis are studying the power of plenipotentiary
   within the scope of form rules and establishing special courts and the
   substantive rules as retribution, amnesty and repent, that all show the
   extent of the powers of the Plenipotentiary in the judicial system.
   Judgments rendered can be very efficient, especially in cases of
   conflict between judgments rendered and his ratings and comments in the
   benefit observance of society and Islam.},

Abstract = {Studies of unilateral power typically analyze a single tool of
   presidential action (e.g., executive orders, memoranda, proclamations,
   and signing statements) in relative isolation. But scholars have long
   recognized that presidents boast a diverse toolkit with particular
   actions possessing variable suitability for a given political
   circumstance. We investigate one mechanism by which presidents may
   choose one tool over another: political cost. Specifically, we ask: does
   public perception of policy movement vary with the means used to alter
   the status quo? Leveraging a survey experiment conducted after the 2014
   midterm elections, we find support for the idea that presidents have
   strong incentives to take action-any action-but that more salient means
   like executive orders have the potential to damage respondents'
   evaluations of policy change. We report initial evidence that the means
   of unilateral action are endogenous to political circumstances and that
   studies that analyze them in isolation may be vulnerable to bias.},

Abstract = {In the two types of American nationalism, while the culture-based
   nationalism finds its origins in the American settlerism tradition, the
   belief-based nationalism finds its roots in the American liberal
   tradition; while the former type of American nationalism can result in a
   closed and exclusive society, the later one an open and inclusive
   society. Hence, there is the ``enemy'' complex of American populism out
   of the culture-based American nationalism, which is especially embodied
   in the ethnic politics in the United States. Accordingly, the ``enemy''
   complex embodied in the ethnic politics and beyond does have long
   lasting effects on Trump's policy in general and on his foreign policy
   in particular.},

Abstract = {This paper explores Ed Miliband's evocation of One Nation in his 2012
   Labour party conference speech. It first surveys the views of members of
   the Parliamentary Labour Party (PLP) and key advisors to Miliband on One
   Nation, with a focus on the debates surrounding its purpose and
   substance. What becomes clear is the amount of confusion amongst
   backbenchers and shadow cabinet members of the PLP regarding its
   purpose. Second, the paper explains the respective, and drastically
   different, positions of the Policy Review team and Ed Miliband and his
   leadership team over the purpose of One Nation. Third, this paper
   highlights that there was a fundamental disconnection between the two
   principal centres of policymaking under the tenure of Ed Miliband's
   leadership and that this ultimately undermined One Nation by allowing Ed
   Miliband quietly to drop it for a `cost of living' narrative. It
   concludes that the evocation of One Nation was a missed opportunity for
   the Labour party, which subsequently allowed the Conservatives to
   reclaim that territory.},

Abstract = {In this symposium, Alessandro Ferrara's recent book The Democratic
   Horizon: Hyperpluralism and the Renewal of Political Liberalism - an
   attempt to expand the framework of Rawls' political liberalism in order
   to enable it to meet the challenge of today's hyperpluralism - is
   discussed from a variety of angles by four contributors. Among the
   themes addressed are the potential of political liberalism for grounding
   a critical attitude; the different potential for accommodation offered
   by political liberalism for religious and moral, as opposed to economic,
   pluralism; Rawls' implicit understanding of truth; the prospects of true
   democracy in ethnically divided societies that embrace consociationalist
   and particularly consensualist forms of governance; and the proper role
   of human rights in paths from decency to democracy from the perspective
   of an expanded political liberalism. In the final section, Alessandro
   Ferrara replies to his critics and accepts some of their suggestions.},

Journal = {ELECTORAL STUDIES},

Volume = {48},

Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Are women and visible minorities more likely to contest and win
   municipal elections under different institutional and contextual
   circumstances? We examine this question using data collected on 934
   individual candidates who sought election in twenty-two large and
   mid-sized cities during the 2014 municipal election cycle in Ontario,
   Canada. The influence of three types of political opportunity structure
   on the `decision to run' for female and minority candidates is examined,
   as well as the ability of these candidates to win when they do stand for
   election. While we uncover no evidence that such structures affect
   candidacy, our results do indicate district magnitude is negatively
   correlated with the likelihood of female and minority victory. This
   finding conflicts with the existing literature on the topic and has
   implications for debates on electoral reform and the representation of
   women and minorities. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Political machines dominate many electoral democracies. Scholars argue
   that local party members, commonly called brokers, are crucial to the
   success of machines. This article enhances our understanding of party
   machines by developing a formal model that reveals how leaders extract
   services from brokers. The model also shows that leaders of machines
   face a dilemma: they need effective brokers, but these brokers create
   vulnerabilities that can ultimately reduce the party's vote share and
   even cause electoral loss. So, in addition to highlighting electoral
   strengths of political machines, this article reveals their
   organizational vulnerabilities. This argument is evaluated with a novel
   survey experiment from Argentina. The survey is the first to draw upon a
   probability sample of brokers in any country.},

Abstract = {The international context seems to be increasingly exposed to
   multidimensional and transnational challenges, ranging from irregular
   migration and piracy to the violation of basic human rights. Rather than
   excluding a potential role for the military, many European states rely
   on it to face a complex security scenario. What are the reasons behind
   this activism? Taking Italy as a case study, this article works out two
   main arguments (ideational factors and interests relating to the
   so-called military-industrial complex) and tries to intercept their
   weight in the national debate leading to the decision to intervene
   militarily (or not) in Sri Lanka (2004-05), Haiti (2010), and in the
   Central Mediterranean (2015-). Ultimately, this effort contributes to
   understanding the role of the military instrument in Italy, a state
   particularly exposed to the new challenges ahead, and offers tools for
   research to be potentially applied in other countries that make similar
   use of armed forces to deal with non-conventional security threats.},

Abstract = {Previous researchers have speculated that incumbency effects are larger
   when voters have weaker partisan preferences, but evidence for this
   relationship is surprisingly weak. We offer a fresh look at the question
   by examining the United Kingdom's multiparty system. In general, the
   electoral value of incumbency should depend on the proportion of voters
   who are nearly indifferent between the parties competing for incumbency;
   in a multiparty system, that proportion may differ across constituencies
   depending on which parties are locally competitive. After first showing
   that UK voters in recent decades have stronger preferences between
   Conservatives and Labour than between Conservatives and Liberals, we
   show that incumbency effects are larger in close contests between
   Conservatives and Liberals than in close contests between Conservatives
   and Labour. By documenting how partisanship influences incumbency
   effects, our analysis shows that the comparative study of incumbency
   effects offers broader insights into electoral accountability across
   political systems.},

Abstract = {Donald J. Trump's unexpected victory in the 2016 presidential election
   cast a long shadow over the American welfare state. With continued
   Republican control of the House and Senate, Trump's occupancy of the
   Oval Office removed a critical constraint on Republican efforts to
   dismantle key Democratic social policy achievements-both old and new.
   Despite the absence of these important institutional veto-points, the
   policies that were first identified and targeted by Republicans during
   the Trump era have proved to be more robust than many observers and
   policymakers initially believed. By applying the theoretical insights
   and methodological tools of American Political Development, this article
   explores how long-running policy processes have altered the political
   landscape in often underappreciated ways to narrow the prospects for
   large-scale policy reform. More specifically, this article examines the
   political dynamics of Medicare and the Affordable Care Act in the early
   days of the Trump administration. The pressures exerted on both programs
   by an unpredictable president and unified Republican control of Congress
   provides a unique opportunity to differentiate between and assess the
   prospects for policy sustainability and policy stability.},

Abstract = {The 2010 US Supreme Court's decision on Citizens United v. Federal
   Electoral Commission lifted restrictions on the funding by unions and
   corporations of groups engaging in independent political advertising
   (outside spending). Many have criticized the majority opinion's premise
   that outside spending cannot corrupt or distort the electoral process.
   Fewer have examined the implications of this decision under the Court's
   assumptions. Using a game-theoretic model of electoral competition, we
   show that informative outside spending by a group whose policy
   preferences are partially aligned with the electorate may reduce voter
   welfare. This negative effect is more likely when policy information is
   highly valuable for the electorate or congruence between the group and
   voters is high. We further show that the regulatory environment produced
   by the Court's decision is always suboptimal: the electorate would be
   better off if either groups were allowed to coordinated with candidates
   or if outside spending was banned altogether.},

Title = {Strategic Hedging and Unipolarity's Demise: The Case of China's
   Strategic Hedging},
Journal = {ASIAN POLITICS \& POLICY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {9},
Number = {3},
Pages = {354-377},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Strategic hedging is used by second-tier states in order to improve
   their relative position vis-a-vis the system leader. It is most likely
   to occur in unipolar systems that are experiencing power diffusion, and
   it involves the improvement of both military and economic capability
   while simultaneously avoiding a direct confrontation with the system
   leader. Strategic hedging takes place against the backdrop of key system
   dynamics involving the diffusion of hard and soft power away from the
   system leader toward various second-tier states. In this article, I
   argue that strategic hedging by second-tier states involves a gradual,
   multistage process, starting with a significant power difference between
   the hedging state and the system leader, and possibly leading to the
   disappearance of this difference as a result of successful hedging
   policies. I provide a four-stage transformation mechanism that allows
   the analyst to gauge the level of transition to the second phase of
   strategic hedging by second-tier states. I use China as a case to
   illustrate our hypothesis. The results show that the transition to the
   second phase is not yet complete in the case of China, but, that this
   could be the case in the next few years. As the second-tier state
   evolves to the second phase, its relative military capability increases
   while its relative economic growth slows down. Progressing through the
   stages of strategic hedging, the second-tier state's fears of upsetting
   the system leader fade as the power difference between itself and the
   system leader declines. Given the importance of strategic hedging as a
   new structural theory in international relations, this study not only
   contributes to the development of this theory, but also provides
   systematic indications of Great Power dynamics in the foreseeable
   future.},

Abstract = {The high unemployment rate in China's Uighur community has been cited as
   a factor for the occurrence of a series of ethnic violence. Uighurs are
   disadvantaged in the job market mainly because of their poor Mandarin
   language ability. They are socially insulated from the Han-dominated
   business networks, and are less proactive and enterprising in work than
   Han. Overall, the unemployment issue of Uighurs is a product of multiple
   causes, which requires a comprehensive policy plan.},

Abstract = {The US Supreme Court has developed a doctrine on the political
   neutrality of public institutions, through the concept of ``government
   speech{''}. The central idea of this doctrine is that when the
   government talks ideologically, through its policies, it is not limited
   by the Constitution and therefore its control is not legal but through
   the political process. This paper studies the jurisprudential evolution
   of this doctrine, paying particular attention to how the constitutional
   concept ``public forum{''} operates as an internal limit on the idea of
   government speech. Similarly, we focus attention on the criteria used by
   the Supreme Court to set limits on government discretion to
   discriminate, for ideological motives, in its public spending policies.
   Finally, we conclude with a reflection on the problems of this doctrine
   in a context where, through the internet and the development of web 2.0,
   the presence and dissemination of government speech and its interaction
   with citizens has changed radically.},

Volume = {10},
Number = {3},
Pages = {26-37},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Nowadays, wide span and diversity of new types of crime have provoked a
   social crisis. To prevent the crime, various reactions have been
   revealed in different societies. However, such responses are originated
   in retributive and intimidation thoughts. Public opinion and lack of
   knowledge in properly treating with crimes have been the main reasons
   why governments tend to repressive reactions, while prevention of crime
   occurrence topics should be considered in the first priority of crime
   policies of countries. Attorney general's appearance in prevention realm
   is complicated and sensitive and deemed as a most challenging subject.
   Because he in charge of public prosecutor is the keeper of individuals,
   social, government, people's benefits and guardian of social security.
   But his range of intervention is under question and is a serious and
   challenging argument. The present study aims to know the different kinds
   of challenges and available solutions in the light of explaining the
   dissuasive methods and also to prevent the increasing of crimes number
   and social security threat by the most effective tools and prevention
   methods and perform our duties favorably and properly in accordance with
   meet the needs of criminal justice goals. The method used in this study
   is analytic-descriptive and is prepared using library valid documents
   and books. We conclude that in social prevention level, the governmental
   organizations are not the only effective and responsible but by
   considering international experiences in performing patterns of
   prevention management, it seems that performing prevention plans through
   social institutions and NGOs (particularly in social prevention) is
   highly effective in crime occurrence prevention.},

   affairs crucially contributes to the functioning of democratic
   accountability in the EU. While our knowledge about the extent of
   control activities has increased, we know little about their content.
   This article investigates the policy issues that opposition parties
   address in parliamentary questions about the EU. I argue that
   Eurosceptic opposition parties follow vote-maximizing strategies and
   selectively scrutinize very general aspects of the EU. My expectation is
   tested using a unique data collection of written questions in the Danish
   Folketing (1973-2013). I find evidence that the content of questions has
   been broadened over time and that Eurosceptic parties strongly emphasize
   general EU matters. The results point to the importance of political
   parties in making democratic accountability in the EU work.},

Abstract = {If utopia is, in part, a project of reimagining-fashioning hoped-for
   better ways of performing everyday activities, and addressing the
   challenges and limits that come from a utopian politics that has
   abandoned perfection, can play contribute something to this process?
   This essay explores the reimagining of two socially dominant
   institutions: market and states. While many on the left argue for the
   abandonment of both institutions, this essay considers the part play
   might play in their retrieval (as a retrieval that is also necessarily a
   revisioning). It does so in two different ways. First, working from the
   premise that markets are not adequate structures for fairly and
   fruitfully organising the distribution of resources, the essay explores
   whether the social architecture of the market has something to offer
   play, particularly playing with strangers. Speakers' Corner is the focus
   for this discussion, which focuses less on the Corner's famed status as
   a ``marketplace of ideas{''} and more on its resemblance to other
   community marketplaces. Second, the essay considers whether imitative
   role-play, that deliberately revises or reverses the structures it
   imitates, can help to reimagine states and state institutional
   practices. With examples that range from ``pretend{''} citizen republics
   to feminist academics ``play-acting{''} judges, the essay asks what play
   can bring to critical state politics.},

Abstract = {There are numerous existing political atheologies that can be
   characterised by three movements - negative, positive and critical
   atheological projects. By focusing on the critical atheologies of two
   political theorists, Richard Rorty and William Connolly, this article
   presents an insider's view of the influence that atheism has on
   political thought. After drawing out just what makes Rorty's and
   Connolly's philosophies atheological, this article sets itself the task
   of drawing the consequences of a critical atheology for two fundamental
   concepts of contemporary political theory: secularism and toleration.
   These Enlightenment ideals can be rescued and re-framed following a
   pluralist critique. By refining our understanding of secularism beyond a
   strict church-state separation, an agonistic secularism that promotes an
   ethos of engagement is defended therein. Second, toleration is then
   defended in its agonistic form to include the practice of critique
   against conceptions of indifference or respect. Finally, the hard case
   of the French ban on veils in public schools is discussed in order to
   highlight the contribution of this political atheology to an important
   social issue.},

Abstract = {Individual-level studies of electoral turnout and vote choice have
   focused largely on personal attributes as explanatory variables. We
   argue that scholars should also consider the social network in which
   individuals are embedded, which may influence voting through variation
   in individuals' social proximity to elites. Our analysis rests on newly
   discovered historical records revealing the individual votes of all
   electors in the 1859 statewide elections in Alexandria, Virginia and the
   1874 municipal elections in Newport, Kentucky, paired with archival work
   identifying the social relations of the cities' populations. We also
   replicate our core findings using survey data from a modern municipal
   election. We show that individuals more socially proximate to elites
   turn out at a higher rate and individuals more socially proximate to a
   given political party's elites vote disproportionately for that party.
   These results suggest an overlooked social component of voting and
   provide a rare nineteenth-century test of modern voting theories.},

Abstract = {The aim of this paper is to offer a philosophical reconstruction of the
   Marxian category generally referred to as ``fetishism{''}. The first
   section analyses this idea as presented in The Capital. From this
   starting point, a brief definition of ``fetishism{''} is offered. The
   second part focuses in particular on the category of technology
   fetishism and reflects on the the role of technical apparatuses in the
   Fordist period of capitalism. This section investigates how the capital
   becomes embodied within machines. The third part addresses some
   propositions for the rebuilding of the critical category of fetishism in
   relation to the cognitive transformation of contemporary production
   systems. Some possible paths for future research are shown, aiming at
   exploring the new social illusion born in contemporary capitalistic
   societies.},

Abstract = {Previous studies identified several domestic factors that may influence
   a country's level of structural coup-proofing, i.e., counterbalancing
   strategies that shall prevent internal groups from seizing power via a
   coup d'etat. We suggest that a country's level of counterbalancing is
   also affected by such policies in what we term countries' ``peer
   groups.{''} When deciding the appropriate level of counterbalancing,
   rulers may be affected by external information flows from a ``peer
   group{''} with similar structural coup-risk characteristics
   (institutions) or a similar coup-risk experience (coup history). Using
   maximum likelihood spatial lag models and data in 1976-2005, we find
   that leaders learn from and emulate counterbalancing in other states,
   but rather only through an ``experiential peer group.{''}},

Abstract = {Our article investigates the role of congressional candidates during the
   era of party ballots in nineteenth-century congressional elections. We
   examine how these candidates contributed to the overall quality of the
   party ballot and the means by which nationalization of elections served
   to mitigate candidate attributes. In our analysis, we take advantage of
   two unique features of elections during this era. First, election timing
   was quite variable before 1872, as many House races were not held
   concurrently with presidential elections. Second, House candidates'
   position on the ballot varied depending on whether a presidential or
   gubernatorial race was also being contested at the same time. To
   investigate these factors, we examine House elections prior to the
   adoption of the Australian ballot and find strong evidence of candidate
   effects during this period. Our findings raise important implications
   about candidate influence and electoral accountability in a more
   party-centered era.},

Abstract = {This article argues for the recovery and re-incorporation of lost voices
   and debates into the history of political thought by focusing on the
   issue of sovereignty. It begins by examining why such a narrow
   understanding of the canon has come to dominate the sub-discipline and
   argues for critical approaches that treat the past as a contested
   terrain rather than an unfolding plot. It then turns to early
   twentieth-century Britain as an example of an era when thinkers who have
   been largely forgotten by today's political theorists argued loudly
   about the future of state sovereignty. It next focuses on a 1916
   exchange of essays entitled The Nature of the State in View of Its
   External Relations by Delisle Burns, Bertrand Russell, and G.D.H. Cole,
   as an example of some of the most innovative and radical ideas to emerge
   from the period. The article concludes by arguing that re-engaging the
   work of these forgotten thinkers can broaden our conceptual horizons
   about sovereignty, speak to some of the most urgent issues of our time,
   and force open the concept of the political to radical reinterpretation.},

Abstract = {This paper is an investigation of identity politics and its relevance.
   It engages the instrumentalist model' in understanding the causal chains
   that can either stabilise or destabilise multi-ethnic societies. It
   employs a comparative case analysis of Zambia and Kenya. A substantial
   similarity in our cases is that identity politics has a hold in both
   nations and the extreme difference is ethnic identity cleavages appear
   divisive among Kenya's elites, thus spilling into communities, whereas
   Zambia shows positive ethnic cohesion trends due to responsible elite
   conduct. The central proposition of this paper is that politics founded
   on identity fosters societal stability as opposed to instability.
   Politicised identities appear to promote division in a multi-ethnic
   society only because of instrumentalist causes. Thus, with the aid of
   cases, we analytically illustrate how and why identity politics' is not
   necessarily bad and we demonstrate its relevance in enhancing governing
   capacity which then translates into social harmony.},

Abstract = {Both political science and electoral geography scholars have
   demonstrated that locally rooted candidates matter in parliamentary
   elections. This article examines whether parties change the
   within-district distribution of party candidates to respond to local
   electoral volatility. If parties significantly lose votes in an area,
   they might consider compensating for this loss by increasing the number
   of local candidates in that area. Using data on the composition of
   candidate lists and election results for the Belgian Lower House
   (1987-2010) of eight political parties, we analyze the relationship
   between local vote shares and local candidate shares. In addition, we
   examine whether parties' nomination strategies are determined by the
   nature of their candidate selection processes. The OLS regression model
   shows that Belgian parties generally increase local candidate shares in
   response to local electoral setbacks. We found weak support for the
   argument that strategies on the within-district distribution of party
   candidates are related to intra-party candidate selection processes.},

Title = {Social pressure and voting: A field experiment conducted in a

Journal = {ELECTORAL STUDIES},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {46},

Month = {APR},
Abstract = {A large-scale experiment assessed the turnout effects of the
   ``Neighbors{''} mailer, which exerts social pressure to vote by
   disclosing the past turnout records of recipients and their neighbors. A
   prior large-scale experiment conducted in a low salience election found
   that this mailer increased turnout substantially. The experiment
   reported here gauges the effects of this mailer in the context of a
   hotly contested recall election. We find smaller but still sizable
   effects, especially for low-propensity voters. Turnout increases
   significantly in the presidential election several months later, and the
   immediate and downstream effects are similar regardless of whether the
   mailer is worded in partisan or nonpartisan terms. Using data furnished
   by the Obama campaign and several nonpartisan organizations, we find
   little evidence that receiving the Neighbors mailer caused people to
   become the targets of subsequent mobilizing activity, suggesting that
   the downstream effects of social pressure cannot be attributed to
   subsequent campaign contacts. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {This study examines the effect of the demographic trend on the breakdown
   of authoritarian regimes in the Middle East. Several scholars have
   pointed out that the combination of youth's disproportionate share of
   the total population, the ``youth bulge,{''} and high unemployment
   throws a society into turmoil. The demographic change determines not
   only how human activities are conducted but also how a society embarks
   on a political transition, such as a revolution, a state breakdown, or a
   regime change.
   I conduct two levels of empirical analysis of the political implications
   of the demographic dynamics in the Middle East. First, the macro-level
   analysis is based on cross-sectional data over two decades. This
   analysis will clarify whether the youth population had a significant
   effect on the Arab uprisings. Second, the micro-level analysis uses
   survey data from the Arab Democracy Barometer wave III to examine
   whether there is a significant correlation between youth and
   participation in protest. This analytical approach integrates the macro
   level with the micro level in order to avoid an ecological inference.
   My empirical analysis finds evidence to support Jack Goldstone's
   revolution theory: it is built on demographic changes accompanied by
   rising food prices. The hypothesis is tested by examining the
   interactive effect of youth bulge and the deteriorating economic
   situation in the two decades following the end of the Cold War. The
   empirical tests at both the macro and micro levels identify a
   statistically significant effect.},

Abstract = {Whereas many advanced democracies have a long-standing tradition of
   collaboration between parties and interest groups, it is still contested
   what drives such collaboration. Linking data on political parties with
   survey data from over 750 Danish and Dutch interest groups we find
   evidence of groups focusing on collaboration with large and
   ideologically moderate parties in both systems. However, our findings
   also indicate that the importance of power and ideology for interest
   group-party collaboration is conditioned by crucial aspects of the
   institutional context in which such collaboration occurs related to
   party system dynamics and coalition governance. In Denmark, where
   governments tend to alternate between left and right, collaboration
   between parties and interest groups is more likely to follow a similar
   left-right division. In contrast, such collaboration is more likely to
   reflect a division between core and marginal parties in the Netherlands,
   where change in government composition is typically only partial.},

Abstract = {How does fact-checking influence individuals' attitudes and evaluations
   of political candidates? Fact-checking plays an increasingly important
   role in U.S. elections, yet we know little about its impact on voters.
   To answer this question, I conduct an experiment utilizing one political
   debate from the 2013 New Jersey Gubernatorial race in combination with
   fact-checks that offer either confirming information or corrective
   information to determine how fact-checking influences evaluations of
   candidates. I find that evaluations of the candidate's debate
   performance and evaluations of the debate winner are improved by the
   presence of a fact-check that confirms the accuracy of a candidates'
   statement and lowered by fact-checks that state that a candidate is
   being dishonest. Moreover, respondents indicate greater willingness to
   vote for a candidate when the fact-check indicates that the candidate is
   being honest. These findings suggest that fact-checking can influence
   people's evaluations of political events.},

Abstract = {How do varying levels of inter-group contact affect voter preferences in
   connection with ethnically radical political candidates and parties? Two
   competing hypotheses have emerged in the last 60 years: the first, known
   as the group threat hypothesis, argues that voters from an ethnic or
   religious group in more ethnically or racially heterogeneous districts
   will exhibit stronger preferences for ethnically radical political
   candidates. The contact hypothesis argues that groups living in mixed
   localities are actually less likely to support ethnic radicals. Both
   perspectives have found empirical support, but no previous study has
   offered a theoretical explanation for two seemingly contradictory
   conclusions. We specify just such a theory, arguing that the effect of
   district level integration is conditioned by the direction of a group's
   share of the national population. We test this theory quantitatively
   using electoral data from Northern Ireland between 1983 and 2010.},

Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL RESEARCH},

Volume = {56},

Pages = {23-45},

Abstract = {In the study of deliberation, a largely under-explored area is why some
   participants polarise their opinion after deliberation and why others
   moderate them. Opinion polarisation is usually considered a suspicious
   outcome of deliberation, while moderation is seen as a desirable one.
   This article takes issue with this view. Results from a Finnish
   deliberative experiment on immigration show that polarisers and
   moderators were not different in socioeconomic, cognitive or affective
   profiles. Moreover, both polarisation and moderation can entail
   deliberatively desired pathways: in the experiment, both polarisers and
   moderators learned during deliberation, levels of empathy were fairly
   high on both sides, and group pressures barely mattered. Finally, the
   low physical presence of immigrants in some discussion groups was
   associated with polarisation in the anti-immigrant direction, bolstering
   longstanding claims regarding the importance of presence for democratic
   politics.},

   Florentine Histories continues to delineate the ways through which
   Niccol Machiavelli, in The Prince and the Discourses, advised potential
   founders or reformers to exploit, for their own benefit and that of
   their patria, the inevitable social conflicts between elites and the
   people that arise in all polities. Machiavelli demonstrates that, in
   particular, Giano della Bella and Michele di Lando could and should have
   attempted to imitate exemplary ancient founders and reformers whom he
   praises in previous works, especially Moses, Romulus, and Brutus.
   Machiavelli implicitly criticizes Giano and Michele for failing to
   spiritedly invigorate new laws with necessary and salutary violence; for
   neglecting to effectively manage the envy of rival peers; for not
   resisting the allure of middle ways between difficult political choices;
   and for failing to militarily organize or mobilize the entirety of
   Florence's common people.},

Abstract = {Most of social sciences' research on Israel emphasizes ethnicity,
   status, nationality, identity, gender or coloniality as the central
   explanatory concepts. This article argues that in order to understand
   the emergence (as well as the limitations) of phenomena such as the 2011
   social protest, the analysis must incorporate a class perspective. In
   answering questions such as which social groups initiated and supported
   the protest, what the socio-economic causes of the protest were and what
   explains the characteristic political patterns of the protest, the
   article proposes the following theses: (1) The protest was launched and
   led by the `bohemian-bourgeois' sector of the middle class, but was
   joined by other groups; (2) The protest was the first large-scale
   display of class resistance to the post-Fordist, neoliberal
   socio-economic system; and (3) The protest manifested the emergence of a
   new kind of `post-postmodern' politics, in response to both the
   representation crisis of the political system and to the failure of
   postmodern politics to address socio-economic concerns.},

Abstract = {This paper examines the effects of elections on the conduct of central
   governments' fiscal policies. To do so, it uses a unique panel database
   that includes disaggregated spending and revenue series at the central
   government level for multiple countries over the 1975-2010 period.
   Examining political environments under which incumbent governments
   generate political budget cycles (PBCs), and comparing the relative
   importance of factors influencing cycles, we identify media freedom as
   the factor that plays the most critical role. This result provides a
   micro-foundation for rational opportunistic models for PBCs that rely on
   asymmetry of information about politicians' competence, and also offers
   a way to relate different conditioning factors of PBCs, including fiscal
   transparency and the maturity of democracies. Further, we show that the
   election-year rise in budget deficits under low media freedom is
   primarily driven by an increase in the current, not capital, component
   of public expenditure. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Authors of the presented contribution put their attention on the
   relationship between the central government and the local
   self-government in connection with the constantly on-going processes of
   centralization and decentralization. Moreover, they take into
   consideration priorities as well as negative aspects of both levels of
   governing, the central government and the local self-government. Problem
   areas, such as the tension between the centralization and self-governing
   and the democratic mode of governing in relation to the local
   governments are dealt as well. An inseparable part of the article is
   created by the presentation of the lack of ethical aspects which are
   evident on all public administration levels in the Slovak Republic
   including the local self-governing bodies. Besides that it is emphasized
   the aspect of inevitability to leave the unethical practices or at least
   to eliminate them and thus create the more favorable conditions for the
   further improvement of the professional and ethical cultivation of
   public sector which is one of the basic preconditions if a democratic
   society has to live on.},

Journal = {REGIONAL AND FEDERAL STUDIES},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {27},
Number = {4},
Pages = {441-463},
Abstract = {After more than half a century as a leading oil-producing nation in
   Africa, Nigeria followed the footsteps of most natural resources rich
   countries (particularly crude-oil) by establishing the Sovereign Wealth
   Fund (SWF). SWF is a large pool of state-owned investment fund composed
   of diverse financial instruments, invested in whole or in part, outside
   home countries. Since 2004, `Special funds', of which SWF is part, have
   become issues of serious contention between the Federal and state
   governments in Nigeria. On 22 May 2011, the 36 state Governors
   approached the Nigerian Supreme Court, requesting the Court to use its
   judicial powers to squash plans by the Federal Government of Nigeria to
   withdraw \$1 billion from the Excess Crude Account to float the planned
   SWF. The bone of contention surrounds issues of constitutionality,
   ownership and prudency in the management of the fund. Relying on extant
   literature, Acts of Parliament as well as commentaries, opinion pieces,
   editorials and news articles from Nigerian newspapers, this paper
   examines the controversies that surround the establishment of SWF in
   Nigeria within the context of the 1999 Constitution (as amended), and
   assesses the conflict mitigating capacity of the Nigeria's federalism
   especially in the light of the nation's fiscal practices.},

Title = {The republican project of Giuseppe Mazzini and England: from ethical
   democracy to social democracy, 1845-1850},
Journal = {LABORATOIRE ITALIEN-POLITIQUE ET SOCIETE},
Year = {2017},
Number = {19},
Abstract = {Over at least the last fifteen years, one of the founding fathers of
   Italian unity Giuseppe Mazzini (1805-1872) has acquired the status of
   European democratic and republican thinker. Most part of scholarship on
   Mazzini's democratic republicanism has pointed out the centrality of the
   ethical-religious dimension of his political project. This essay argues
   that from the publication of his Thoughts upon democracy in Europe
   (1846-1847) to the Mazzini's Manifesto (1850), the languages used by
   Mazzini assumed a more distinctively social meaning although never a
   socialist one. Whereas its intellectual origins dated back to the period
   of Mazzini's exile in France - when he was fascinated by the political
   ideas of Buonarroti, Lamennais, Leroux and Saint-Simon - it was
   especially during the many years spent in England (1837-48, 1851, 1857,
   1860) that the republican and democratic lexicon of the exile, in which
   a particular relevance assumed words like ``association{''},
   ``people{''} and ``nation{''}, acquired a distinctly social meaning.},

Abstract = {The rise in the parliamentary presence of politicians of immigrant
   origin raises the question of whether they represent citizens
   substantially different from native politicians. For the first time, a
   content analysis of all speeches given in the Deutscher Bundestag
   between 1996 and 2013 analyzes this research question systematically.
   There are two main results': First, in their speeches, parliamentarians
   of immigrant origin use some words more often, especially pertaining to
   matters of migration and integration. They put more emphasis on
   migration-related issues. Second, the analysis shows that parliamentary
   and mandate-specific factors do also structure discussions on migration
   and integration issues in the Bundestag.},

Abstract = {The paper suggests an epistemic re-reading of Utopia. Usually dismissed
   as a pathological form of politics, it deals with the borders of modern
   political semantics and raises important issues about contemporary
   political theory. Bloch's notion of Utopia helps to reframe the
   discussion about the ambiguous meaning of this term and introduce
   philosophical interpretations of this concept. Drawing from
   heterogeneous philosophical material (in particular Ernst Bloch's theory
   of the ``Possible{''} and Hans Blumenberg's theory of ``Fiction of
   Possibility{''}), it is argued that the problem of the death of Utopia
   arises when a particular form of subjective cognition, confronting
   contingency, is asked to open up for the prospect of progressive and
   democratic expectations. Utopia thus acquires an ambivalent position by
   articulating contemporary political reason.},

   just in the UK but throughout the Western world, with few exceptions

Abstract = {The article presents the main results of a survey on voting behavior at
   the State Participatory Budgeting of Rio Grande do Sul (also known as

   all residents in San Borja, city in the western border of Rio Grande do

   Consulta popular, considered its role of social inclusion and promotion
   of political participation. After a brief descriptive analysis, in order
   to get a better synthetic overview of the data, we submitted the
   considered characters to two different multidimensional analyses, in
   search of possible relations among them. The analyses performed were an
   exploratory one (a Multiple Correspondence Analysis, MCA) and a

   A NEW PARTICIPATION SPACE TO A MISSED OPPORTUNITY?},
Journal = {REVISTA ANDINA DE ESTUDIOS POLITICOS},

Abstract = {The article analyses the first years after the Previous Consultation Law
   was passed and the difficulties confronted for the implementation of ILO
   169 Convention in the Peruvian Andes. Based on a three level analysis (
   international, national and local), the main focus is to understand how
   an international piece of legislation becomes a euphemism at a local
   level. To do so, we have chosen the Canaris case because it showed how
   the dynamics at the national level, where the decision of who has the
   right to be consulted is made, worked.
   Previous Consultation will be defined as a new space of participation
   where different actors with different levels of power interact. The
   relationships among them will be analysed. Then, we will focus on the
   historic relationship between the State and the Andean populations to
   understand the discourse that tried to exclude them from this process.
   We will explain why Previous Consultation did not have any conditions
   for a successful new participatory governance space. Finally, we will
   consider the Previous Consultation Law as an ongoing process the might
   lead to changes of the political authoritarian habitus that exists in
   Peru.},

Journal = {PARTECIPAZIONE E CONFLITTO},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {10},

Abstract = {After decades of political passivity, Italian students have massively
   mobilized in the years 2008 and 2010 to protest the implementation of
   two political measures fostering a neoliberal conception of higher
   education. More notably, the casus belli of these mobilizations
   concerned the implementation of a financial measure cutting public
   funding for higher education in 2008, accompanied by a New Public
   Management (NPM) reform of university governance in 2010. Despite a high
   rate of participation, none of the two mobilizations managed to alter
   the political course of events. The Italian government approved and
   implemented the two measures and the Italian student movement lost this
   political battle. In short, recent student mobilizations failed to
   produce any policy impact on the Italian field of higher education. Why
   was this the case? My argument is that organizationally and politically
   fragmented protests are not able to influence policy issues that have a
   low public relevance, especially in periods of economic crisis and
   political austerity. I contend that this was precisely the case of the
   Italian student protests of 2008 and 2010.},

Abstract = {The volatile and unstable party systems in East Central Europe are
   associated with the emergence of new parties. However, some such new
   parties survive and become part of the party system they entered while
   other newcomers fade away even after they record major electoral success
   or gain government participation. How can we explain the contrasting
   fortunes of new parties? What explains their persistence and
   organizational survival? In this paper, we try to find the answers to
   these questions by linking the organizational success of new parties to
   the composition of their elites. We suggest that the similarity in
   professional and career backgrounds contributes to parties'
   organizational success by increasing party cohesion, especially at the
   level of party leadership. We demonstrate our arguments on three new
   Czech parties - Public Affairs (VV), Dawn of Direct Democracy (Dawn) and
   ANO - with contrasting political and organizational fortunes. Using data
   on elites' career and political pasts we show that, unlike ANO, VV and
   Dawn have comparatively more heterogeneous elite circles which, we
   suggest, make them more vulnerable to internal conflicts.},

Abstract = {In this paper, we focus on difference as a feature of political
   community, in Greek Ancient thought. There usually describes the Greek
   conception of polis as a community of equals. This is a very important
   legacy. However, this is not the same as to (misleadingly) state it as a
   homogeneous community (as Emile Durkhein does in De la division du
   travail social, 1893). The tension between equality and diversity is a
   paramount political theme, and there is a lot to learn about this from
   Aristotle. His investigations on the nature of polis propose an original
   combination of equality and difference to ground human associations.
   This is my point: how can we say that polis is, at the same time, an
   association of equal but different people ? This is relevant for
   understanding justice as a central feature and task of political life.
   Although there is a lot elsewhere to consider, we explore this question
   from some selected arguments presented in Aristotle's Nicomachean Ethics
   (Book V), and Politics (Books I and II). Methodically, we try to
   understand every statement from its dialectical context of inquiry. This
   makes Topics a relevant background (or even a guide) to the approach we
   propose.},

Abstract = {Eugeniusz Romer is considered the founder of modern Polish geography. As
   a geographer, he also participated in the peace negotiations after the
   First World War. He did not see himself as a neutral expert, but
   committed himself to the restoration of the Polish state. The Polish
   delegation's successes at the 1919 Paris conference are in no small part
   attributed to his preliminary cartographic work. At the Riga conference
   in 1920-21, Romer's primary objective was no longer the largest national
   territory possible, but rather the most ethnically homogenous population
   possible. Here, however, his influence was already waning. Military
   interests gained the upper hand.},

Abstract = {Ethnographic approaches are beginning to percolate through political

   gender, I explain how theory and method were interwoven and how
   reflexivity improves rigour. Dealing with the methodological challenge
   of disjunctions and contradictions is explored through the case studies
   of constituency work, law-making and ceremonies. Finally, I remark on
   how ethnographic approaches to ethics entail attention to process and

   Fate of Russia},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL CRITICAL THOUGHT},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {7},
Number = {3, SI},
Pages = {385-401},
Abstract = {The scholarship devoted to the Marx-Weber relationship has so far
   neglected to compare the attitudes of the two thinkers about Russia.
   This paper seeks to fill that gap, focusing in particular on Marx's late
   writings from the 1870s about the revolutionary prospects in Russia and
   Weber's essays on the Russian Revolution of 1905. Marx and Weber's
   approaches to Russia reveal significant similarities: above all, a
   radically critical view of capitalist development. The study of the
   Russian situation, marked by the surviving village commune, drove Marx
   to question the positive assessment of capitalism's historical role,
   which had been his firm belief for a long time, and to welcome the
   possibility that a backward country might move directly to socialism,
   skipping the capitalist stage. Not surprisingly, such conclusions were
   ignored by Marx's Russian followers such as Plekhanov and Struve, who
   regarded capitalist industrialisation as an essential precondition for
   social revolution in Russia. As for Weber, the events of the First
   Russian Revolution, which he followed with a particularly intense
   interest, confirmed a crucial argument of his sociological theory,
   namely that advanced capitalism hindered the achievement and
   preservation of civil liberties and constitutional rights.},

Journal = {POLITY},

Abstract = {Scholarship on policy transfer has readily described the movement of
   policy from states to the national government and, vice versa, from the
   national government to the states. However, little is known about the
   interaction between these processes or instances in which a state
   inspires national reform but is then required to implement the national
   government's version of the same policy. This paper considers the extent
   to which policy remodeling the recalibration of an existing policy in
   the face of national demands leads to changes in how a policy is
   implemented in ``model{''} states. We specifically examine
   Massachusetts's implementation of the Patient Protection and Affordable
   Care Act, the 2010 national health reform law that borrowed heavily from
   the near-universal insurance system created in Massachusetts in 2006.
   Although policy remodeling did not upend model policy arrangements, it
   did necessitate a blend of policy maintenance and reinvention, which, in
   turn, posed distinctive political and administrative challenges for the
   state's existing universal health insurance program.},

Abstract = {The author, a recognized classic of the French school of regional
   geography, expresses animadversion regarding the new German political
   geography (Geopolitik). For that purpose, he performs a textual analysis
   of seven works published between 1925 and 1930 by the most distinguished
   authors of the new discipline of vast ambitions that abandons, largely,
   the tradition of the Politische Geographie teacher Friedrich Ratzel, as
   the author tries to explain. In the last section, he adopts a critical
   position against ideas and explanations given in the analyzed books and
   in the group's magazine, as they try to put their knowledge to the
   service of nationalist politics and of military and ideological
   expansionism. The article, that will afterwards constitute a closing of
   ranks of French geography against the German political geography,
   concludes with this allegation of Geopolitics.},

Abstract = {The article aims to answer a key question that arises ill the context of
   the Colombian peace process: in what sense is it possible to talk about
   ``justice{''} or establish a ``fair{''} situation within a conflictive
   background like the one that has distinguished the history of Colombia?
   It addresses this question from two different perspectives, being the
   first one a philosophical-moral perspective, while the second is mainly
   a sociological one. Bearing in mind the last perspective, the article
   proposes that legitimation of the projected social order and power
   structures might be achieved by basing it on symbolic ideas and by
   presenting a socio-constructive reasoning.},

Abstract = {In art restitution, traumatic history and dramatic present are densely
   intertwined. This applies in particular to the relationship between
   Germany and Russia. A look back over 30 years of cooperation and
   conflicting actions in relation to looted and stolen art reveals a
   history of opening and gift -giving, struggle and failure. Academia and
   society have shown (sic) settlement was missed. However, time and again,
   in individual cases, it has been possible, through skill and commitment,
   to circumnavigate the legal barriers. Thus, in culture, social relations
   remain that have not been destroyed by the current political upheaval.
   These relations cannot overcome the conflict between Russia and Germany,
   but are at least able to resist the process of drifting apart.},

Abstract = {It is often argued that unemployment depresses political involvement
   because unemployment deprives workers of important workplace-related
   resources. We challenge this argument from two sides. Theoretically, we
   argue that the resource approach neglects life cycle stages.
   Socialization theory suggests that workplace-related resources influence
   political involvement mostly during adolescence and early adulthood but
   not later in life. Ignoring life cycle stages therefore risks
   underestimating unemployment effects on young workers and overestimating
   them for older workers. Our second criticism is methodological. Existing
   literature on unemployment and political involvement largely uses
   cross-sectional data, which makes it impossible to eliminate unobserved
   heterogeneity. Using German panel data, we show that unemployment
   depresses the growth of political interest in early adulthood, while it
   does not have an effect later in life. Moreover, we find that early
   unemployment experiences have scarring effects that reduce the long-term
   level of political interest and participation.},

Abstract = {Feminist theory is not only about women; it is about the world, engaged
   through critical intersectional perspectives. Despite many significant
   differences, most feminist theory is reliably suspicious of dualistic
   thinking, generally oriented toward fluid processes of emergence rather
   than static entities in one-way relationships, and committed to being a
   political as well as an intellectual enterprise. It is rooted in and
   responsible to movements for equality, freedom, and justice. Three
   important contemporary questions within feminist theory concern (a)
   subjectivity, narrative, and materiality; (b) global neoliberal
   geopolitics; and (c) global ecologies. Feminist theorists employ the
   tools of intersectionality, interdisciplinarity, and the intertwinings
   of scholarship and activism to address these questions. While we labor
   to contribute to our academic fields, our primary responsibility is to
   contribute to positive social change.},

Journal = {CITIZENSHIP STUDIES},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {21},
Number = {4, SI},
Pages = {455-467},
Abstract = {The crisis in Spain has generated new forms of solidarity that have
   become new ways of being and living the city. Streets and houses have
   been taken by the population in protests and direct actions. Lack of
   alternatives and the government's `do-nothing' policy have pushed people
   to perform the `right to the city' on their own and in collective ways.
   The 15M movement, with its assemblies in every public square and park,
   the `mareas' (waves), which occupied hospitals and schools to create
   dialogue between parents and teachers and between doctors and patients,
   and the Platform of Mortgage Victims, the leading force in the struggle
   against evictions, are three examples of new ways of understanding the
   city. In the context of these experiments in self-management of the
   social reproduction of life, proposals for the transformation of
   government have also emerged, pointing precisely to the strengthening of
   citizen self-government. The most progressive experiments have taken
   place at the municipal level through popular electoral platforms that
   won 2015 elections in many cities. we can state that a new form of
   citizenship seems to be emerging according to which, citizens understand
   the city as their own, fight for the use and control of urban
   infrastructures and seek to institutionalise new forms of people's
   control, participation and decision-making.},

Year = {2017},
Volume = {40},
Pages = {317-347},
Abstract = {Political parties remain indispensable instruments of mass democracy,
   but their organisational drift needs to be stopped in order to ensure
   freedom of participation in the political process. In view of the
   failure of self-regulation, there is a pressing need for legal
   intervention. The legislator must re-establish the balance of power
   inside political parties, preserving conditions for democratic
   governance and opening up practical channels for internal participation
   and accountability. Reform of the Organic Law on Political Parties
   (LOPP) cannot be postponed any longer, in some aspects by following the
   model of the Parteiengesetz, and in other matters, such as the selection
   of electoral candidates, by either adopting the most firmly established
   compared experiences, such as the detailed regulation of the selection
   process included in German and Finnish electoral laws, or more
   innovative experiences, such as the general implementation of open
   primary elections regulated by law, as adopted by many countries. That
   is how part of legal doctrine defends it. And that is how civil society
   has also demanded it, since the outrage that crystallised on 15th May
   2011 served as a catalyst for various demands for democratic
   regeneration. This study focuses on the analysis of these proposals,
   after analysing the shortcomings of the weak legal discipline of
   political parties and their barely democratic internal functioning.},

   TTIP},
Journal = {POLITICS AND GOVERNANCE},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {5},
Number = {3},
Pages = {16-28},
Abstract = {Transparency has been a central issue in the debate regarding the
   Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP), especially on the
   side of the European Union (EU). The lack of transparency in the
   negotiating process has been one of the main criticisms of civil society
   organizations (CSOs). The European Commission (EC) has tried to gain
   support for the negotiations through various `transparency initiatives'.
   Nonetheless, criticism by CSOs with regard to TTIP in general and the
   lack of transparency in specific remained prevalent. In this article, we
   explain this gap between various transparency initiatives implemented by
   the EC in TTIP and the expectations on the side of European CSOs. We
   perform a content analysis of position papers on transparency produced
   by CSOs, mainly in response to a European Ombudsman consultation,
   complemented by a number of official documents and targeted interviews.
   We find that the gap between the TTIP transparency initiatives and the
   expectations of CSOs can be explained by different views on what
   constitutes legitimate trade governance, and the role of transparency,
   participation, and accountability herein.},

Journal = {CITIZENSHIP STUDIES},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {21},
Number = {5},
Pages = {527-546},
Abstract = {An association of strangers with danger and criminality is one of the
   most enduring social myths. However, in the UK,it was only after a media
   outcry 10 years ago over the release of foreign nationals from British
   prisons, that the Foreign Criminal' exploded into political and popular
   consciousness. Despite the small numbersof people involved, the location
   of this folk devil at the intersection of legal and moral assessments of
   wickedness' and alterity imbues it with considerable potency and has
   ensured that its reverberations are still felt strongly a decade later.
   Drawing on qualitative research with immigration detainees, deportees
   and irregular migrants, the article considers some of the many faces of
   the Foreign Criminal and illuminates theirracialised, classed and
   gendered natures.Itargues that a twin set of developments - coalescing
   aroundOperation Nexus and curtailed Article 8 right protections - work
   together to tainta growing number of non-citizens with criminality,
   whilst simultaneously undermining their claim to belong. Case studies
   are presented todemonstrate the fault lines of this malleable and
   expanding category, andto argue that the Foreign Criminal is
   paradigmatic of both social disorder and national boundaries, and is
   fundamentally shifting the lines of citizenship and belonging.},

Abstract = {Research on electoral participation at the individual level in Latin
   America remains scarce. This article extends our knowledge about the
   individual-level factors that impact citizens' propensity to vote in the
   region. Specifically, I assess the link between citizens' trust in the
   electoral process and voter turnout using recent survey data from 19
   Latin American countries between 2004 and 2014. Using logistic models I
   show that trust in the fairness of elections has a significant and
   positive effect on voter turnout across the region, and that this effect
   is mediated by the existence of compulsory voting laws.},

Abstract = {In Russia, it has been alleged for some years now that western
   historiography is distorting the history of the Russian Empire and the
   Soviet Union. Two books about Russian rule in the Caucasus disprove this
   assertion. Jeronim Perovic presents a nuanced picture of rebellion and
   adaptation in the multi-ethnic region of the Northern Caucasus. Philipp
   Ammon looks to the Southern Caucasus and illustrates how in Georgia,
   Russia has been perceived sometimes as a protector and sometimes as a
   colonial power.},

Abstract = {Electoral and competitive authoritarian regimes have become a major
   focus of comparative research. Yet, finding measures that distinguish
   these regimes from democracies is challenging, especially for scholars
   conducting large-N cross-national research, as this conceptual
   distinction rests on incumbent abuses that are difficult to
   systematically observe. This article reviews common measures that simply
   utilize extant regime indicators to draw the line with democracy,
   demonstrates their poor performance in mirroring a benchmark from
   case-based measurement, and illustrates the adverse implications for
   theory building. The article then shows how data on incumbent abuse from
   the National Elections Across Democracy and Dictatorship (NELDA) and
   Varieties of Democracy (VDEM) projects can be utilized to construct
   alternative measures. A NELDA-based measure far outperforms extant
   alternatives in mirroring the case-based benchmark. The article then
   discusses why a VDEM-based alternative should be a superior option once
   data is available and how one might be constructed.},

Title = {Immigrant Engagement in Participatory Budgeting in New York City},
Journal = {NEW POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {39},
Number = {1},
Pages = {76-94},
Abstract = {Participatory Budgeting (PB) is a welcome experiment in participatory
   democracy in New York City (NYC), one that could produce greater civic
   engagement of traditionally marginalized groups and more equitable
   resource distribution. By engaging immigrants, PB aims to affirm and
   elevate their voices, help develop their civic capacities, and promote
   their political participation and community empowerment. During the past
   four years, participation by immigrants (foreign-born residents) in New
   York City's PB process (PBNYC) has steadily increased, growing from
   nineteen to twenty-eight percent of all PB voters. Yet, immigrant
   participation lags compared to their numbers, with great variation among
   PB districts. Using a mixed methods approach that incorporates surveys
   of and interviews with immigrant community members, staff at immigrant
   serving community-based organizations, and City Council staff, this
   article aims to parse out the logistical and affective barriers to
   participation immigrants face in PB districts and how PBNYC's design
   attempts to circumvent said barriers and facilitate participation.
   Ultimately, our study reveals a complex mix of promising practices and
   structural constraints involved in working toward PB's ``inclusive{''}
   and ``equitable{''} aims.},

Abstract = {The paper examines the consistency of recent Kantian justifications of
   state authority through reflection on the normative implications of
   states' territorial nature. I claim that their conceptual structure
   leaves these accounts unable to close the justificatory gap that emerges
   at the transition from legitimate authority simpliciter, to legitimate
   state authority. None of the strategies Kantian statists have come up
   with in order to solve this problem - based on the proximity, occupancy
   and permissive principles - provides the needed grounds on which to
   carve up the earth's surface into jurisdictional domains. Yet, I
   conclude that this does not require Kantians to cede statist grounds
   altogether but to take a distinctly `global perspective' on states.},

Journal = {POLITICS GROUPS AND IDENTITIES},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {5},
Number = {2},
Pages = {343-352},
Abstract = {The estimated 52\% of white female voters who supported Donald Trump for
   President of the United States in 2016 animates this dialogue on the
   politics of groups and identities. The Trump majority among white women
   exists in contrast to strong support of Democratic Party candidate
   Hillary Clinton among women of color as well as minority men. While many
   observers were surprised at the high proportion of white female Trump
   voters, this pattern of electoral behavior supporting Republican Party
   candidates is a consistent phenomenon since the 1950s in U.S.
   Presidential elections. The pattern is both clear and easily visible,
   and provides an important clue to better understand the dynamics of race
   and gender in electoral politics. I argue for political scientists to
   pursue intersectional analytical perspectives by situating voting
   behavior within the context of a polity beyond the black-white binary of
   race and ethnicity. I suggest analysts consider the positionality of
   white women as second in sex to men, but first in race to minorities,
   and the invocation of white womanhood in political rhetoric and practice
   as a potential explanation of the Trump majority.},

Journal = {IRISH POLITICAL STUDIES},

Volume = {32},
Number = {3},
Pages = {382-403},
Abstract = {Candidate gender quotas were passed into law in the Republic of Ireland
   in 2012. This paper examines support for this quota amongst three
   different groups: local election candidates, a sample of professionals
   and the general public. Using responses from three different datasets,
   we identify the key ideological, partisan and demographic predictors of
   support for the quota. We find that the best predictors of support for
   the quota are, not surprisingly, the gender of the respondent and being
   a feminist. There is a weak effect for left-wing ideology and
   partisanship and for beliefs regarding the causes of women's absence
   from political life. Overall, the results suggest that resistance to the
   quota is still relatively strong amongst both potential candidates for
   Dail Eireann and the Irish electorate.},

Abstract = {In a previous study, we provided a novel empirical test that indicated
   that alliance formation is often a poor means of deterring militarized
   disputes or preventing war. In this issue, Leeds and Johnson respond,
   arguing that our results differ from their previous work because we
   analyze the time surrounding alliance formation, which they claim is
   inappropriate when testing deterrence theory. Here we outline the
   reasons why examining alliance formation is critical to the analysis of
   deterrence. We also demonstrate that the empirical concerns raised by
   Leeds and Johnson are largely inconsequential by reproducing our results
   using the same design implemented in existing studies that uncover
   evidence of deterrence success. We find additional support for our
   primary conclusion that alliance formation often fails to deter
   adversaries and instead increases likelihood of militarized conflict.},

Abstract = {In terms of gamification within political science, some
   fields-particularly international relations and American politics-have
   received more attention than others. One of the most underserved parts
   of the discipline is research methods; a course that, coincidentally, is
   frequently cited as one that instructors hate to teach and students hate
   to take. Given the well-documented merits of games in promoting student
   engagement and the key role of methods as a building block to student
   understanding of political science, this article attempts to rectify
   this oversight by introducing three games-Zendo, Murder Mystery, and the
   Archeologist's Quandary-geared at teaching key concepts and approaches
   in research methods.},

Abstract = {There is an on-going scholarly dispute about the consequences of
   communal political mobilization, yet not all-communal mobilization is
   created equal. Parties of national majorities and parties o f national
   minorities significantly differ with regard to issue positions;
   axiological framing of the issues; and rhetoric. As for issues,
   majority-nationalist parties tend to situate on the right of the
   political spectrum, while minority parties are leftist or centrist.
   Minority parties are also more internationalist, less militaristic, and
   more supportive of European integration. As for axiology, majority
   nationalism relies on the conservative values of tradition and national
   interest, while minority activism invokes a human rights framework. The
   rhetoric of majority nationalist parties often targets other communal
   groups, as such, while minority parties avoid stereotyping communal
   groups. Empirically, the study draws on the MARPOR project and on
   content analysis of a sample o f six majority and six minority party
   programs from the UK.(2)},

Abstract = {The extent of the destruction of culture and looting of art in Eastern
   Europe under the National Socialists continues to be downplayed even
   today. Strategies for exoneration and justification that emerged during
   the Second World War continue to be pursued without critical reflection.
   Several rival German institutions were involved in art theft in the
   Soviet Union. This provided the perpetrators and their accomplices with
   the opportunity to transfer culpability to others, and to present their
   own actions as ``securing{''} or ``saving{''} cultural assets. In many
   cases, the theft was semantically discarded and presented as being a
   normal aspect of war. For decades, the looting of cultural assets and
   the destruction of culture by the Germans in the Soviet Union was
   blanked out from awareness. In the German political and public spheres,
   the issue of art theft under the National Socialists in the Soviet Union
   is not given the weight that it is due.},

Abstract = {This article studies the socialist ``fronde{''} at the French national
   Assembly during the 14th parliamentary term (2012-2017). The
   ``fronde{''} was an episode of high voting indiscipline within the
   (majority) socialist group on a string of votes pertaining to the core
   of the government's economic policy. The article gives a chronological
   account of the episode, emphasizing the actors' own narrative (members
   of parliament and their collaborators). Combining an ethnographic
   approach with prosopographical data and historical data on roll-call
   votes at the Assembly since 1993, it confronts the indigenous accounts
   to a statistical objectivation of the determinants of voting
   indiscipline, and puts it in historical perspective. By its magnitude,
   its actors and its practices, the ``fronde{''} is shown to be an
   exceptional episode, characteristic of the 14th term. However, it is
   also shown to take place in the context of a long-term waning of party
   discipline within the socialist parliamentary group, and to reflect
   progressive changes in the management of internal dissent within the
   socialist group and party.},

Abstract = {Over the last two decades, as the number of media choices available to
   consumers has exploded, so too have worries over self-selection into
   media audiences. Some fear greater apathy, others heightened
   polarization. In this article, we shed light on the latter possibility.
   We identify the impact of access to broadband Internet on affective
   polarization by exploiting differences in broadband availability brought
   about by variation in state right-of-way regulations (ROW). We merge
   state-level regulation data with county-level broadband penetration data
   and a large-N sample of survey data from 2004 to 2008 and find that
   access to broadband Internet increases partisan hostility. The effect
   occurs in both years and is stable across levels of political interest.
   We also find that access to broadband Internet boosts partisans'
   consumption of partisan media, a likely cause of increased polarization.},

Abstract = {Compliant activism - that is, political activity of the population,
   either fully supporting the regime, or merely criticizing individual
   shortcomings of its policies - strengthens authoritarian rule. However,
   compliant activism can over time turn into non-compliant one. Hence, the
   regimes need to ensure that the norms of compliant activism are
   internalized by the society and become self-enforcing. We use the case
   of the Communist legacies in Russia to show that compliant activism can,
   indeed, become highly persistent and outlive the regime, where it
   emerged. Using cross-regional variation in the levels of compliant
   activism in the contemporary Russia, we demonstrate that it is strongly
   affected by the variation in the membership share of the Communist Party
   of the Soviet Union in the 1970s. The results have broader implications
   beyond the Russian case and provide relevant insights for studying
   political activism in autocracies.},

Abstract = {Alan Patten defends a novel principle of neutrality according to which
   the state must accommodate all conceptions of the good equally. This
   principle rests on the claim that the state must be equally responsive
   to the interests of all citizens. I introduce a competing principle -
   neutrality of disposition - according to which the state must be
   disposed to treat citizens with different conceptions of the good alike
   in relevantly similar situations. The requirement of the equal
   responsiveness of the state is neutral between these two conceptions of
   neutrality. Moreover, neutrality of disposition, unlike neutrality of
   treatment, is compatible with a plausible luck egalitarian view of
   cultural justice according to which justice requires the state to be
   more accommodating of some conceptions of the good than of others in
   situations where not being so will result in members of minority
   cultures being worse off than others through no responsibility of their
   own.},

Journal = {NEW POLITICAL SCIENCE},

Volume = {39},

Pages = {487-510},
Abstract = {This analysis provisionally outlines a critical analysis of the American
   presidential elections of 1912 and 2016. While the 1912 contest is not
   identical to 2016, Wilson's victory introduced a Progressive politics
   into government after pitting the Democratic Party against strong
   candidates from the Progressive, Republican, and Socialist Parties.
   Taking ideas from his challengers, Wilson during WWI developed a more
   centralized administrative state grounded on professional expertise and
   progressive activism. By the 1930s, this state anchored a bi-partisan
   government more supportive of professional expert elites running the two
   major parties, which Hillary Clinton seemed to typify in 2016, and less
   interested in helping ordinary working Americans. Donald Trump in 2016
   attacked this habitus of progressivism, using it against Clinton to
   delegitimize the administrative. By questioning the Democratic and GOP
   establishments, Trump won 2016 as ``an outsider,{''} who defends
   forgotten silent Americans. In keeping with the radical critique made by
   the Caucus for a New Political Science since 1967, this analysis
   re-examines how progressive experts fostered these self-defeating
   practices for `` popular government,{''} which have enhanced elite
   control over ``the people{''} rather than enabling open democratic rule
   by ``the people{''} in the twenty-first century.},

Abstract = {The paper analyzes Mozambique's political trajectory through the prism
   of the relationship between state and society. It argues that a
   political culture deeply rooted in millennial thinking -based on the
   eschatological belief that political intervention settles societal
   problems once and for all - has fostered a deep hostility towards
   citizenship rights and, for this reason, has regularly brought democracy
   to the brink of collapse. Thus, the paper is an attempt at identifying a
   conceptual framework on the basis of which empirically grounded
   descriptions of Mozambique's recent political history can be conducted.},

   in a way that limits the options available to national governments is
   not new. However, the European Parliamentary (EP) term that ended in

   electorates with previously unseen potency. This study explores the
   implications of this for the logic of voting in the 2014 EP elections.
   Defection from government parties in EP elections is known to result
   from a combination of sincere/ideological and performance/protest voting
   logics. However, this study argues that fiscal tightening policies
   functioned, in the most affected countries, as a signal leading voters
   to discount the ideological positions of parties and to behave mostly
   under a purely protest logic.},

Abstract = {The Bolsheviks introduced ``red funerals{''} after the October
   Revolution. These civilian rituals were designed to replace Christian
   rites and spread the worldview of the new state. Outside of the major
   cities, however, this type of ceremony never took hold. It was abandoned
   at the latest after the Great Patriotic War, and religious customs were
   revived. Only state funerals at the Kremlin necropolis had to be
   conducted in observance of official Soviet rites. However, even these
   apparently worldly rituals were rooted in the Christian tradition. At
   the same time, many people regarded the Soviet practices, particularly
   the cremation of important individuals, as being a severe breach of
   cultural traditions.},

Title = {Against the Current: Deconstructing the Upstream/Downstream Binary in
   Hydropolitical Security Complexes},
Journal = {NEW PERSPECTIVES},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {25},
Number = {3},
Pages = {15-41},
Abstract = {Hydropolitics, established as the ``study of conflict and cooperation
   between states over (predominantly riverine) water resources that
   transcend international borders{''} (Elhance, 1999: 3), is a discourse
   that often serves to empower states - as the owners of waters above
   other actors. Departing from this point, and taking a critical
   perspective on the subject, combined with an interest in the spatial
   aspects and spatial dynamics of security issues, we shed light on a
   `virtual vertical' aspect of riverine hydropolitics. Hydropolitics is
   often framed, through a binary and distorted representation of empirical
   reality, as upstream-downstream state relations. In this article we
   challenge the presumed straightforward validity of this
   upstream-downstream framework in universal terms as well as in a case
   study of Hungary, to draw attention to the arbitrary tendency to
   construct downstream identities as a feature of hydropolitical security
   complexes (HSCs). We find that whether or not this is the motive behind
   the desire to project a downstream identity, per implication of its
   discursive enactment, governments as well as societies may be
   insufficiently sensitive to their `upstream' responsibilities arising
   from the relativity of what is, respectively, upstream and downstream
   along a river.},

Abstract = {We constructed a co-authorship network of the global political science
   community. Two scientists are connected if they have co-authored a
   paper. We drew on more than 67,000 papers published from 1990 to 2013 in
   one of today's 96 core journals. The network consists of more than
   40,000 authors located worldwide. We found that the community forms a
   single, interconnected component as well as numerous unconnected
   authors. Whereas some are highly productive in terms of publications,
   the majority of authors published only a single paper, which suggests
   significant turnover in the community. Using information from the papers
   (e.g., title, journal, and abstract), we investigated how different
   subcommunities organize and interconnect, how journals reach out into
   the community, and how individual scientists cooperate. We also
   investigated how the network has evolved in the last two decades. Our
   analysis is supplemented by a bibliographic analysis that describes
   major changes in publication patterns.},

Abstract = {The importance of incumbent evaluations for voting and the existence of
   an incumbency effect are well-established. However, there is limited
   research on the effect incumbency has on voters' engagement with
   election campaigns. This paper examines whether the use of incumbency as
   a cue when voting is associated with there being less interest in an
   election and whether campaign period attentiveness affects incumbent
   support. We consider these questions using data from the Toronto
   Election Study, a large-N, two-wave survey of Torontonians conducted
   around the time of the 2014 Toronto Municipal Election. We find that
   attentiveness, on its own, does not make voters more likely to support
   an incumbent or non-incumbent candidate. However, among individuals with
   high knowledge, attentiveness decreases the likelihood of supporting the
   incumbent, as opposed to a non-incumbent candidate.},

Abstract = {This article argues that social patterns of inequality and structures of
   partisan competition play central roles in shaping support for
   redistribution, offering three important insights concerning
   redistribution attitude formation. First, pronounced income disparities
   between ethnic/racial groups reduce support for redistribution. Second,
   for members of marginalized ethnic groups, entrenched discrimination
   reflected in large between-group inequalities provokes skepticism
   regarding state redistributive efforts, undermining their generally
   favorable attitudes toward redistribution. Third, when party systems
   feature programmatic competition around distributional issues, citizens
   are more likely to view government redistribution favorably,
   particularly where meaningful left options are present, while in systems
   without programmatic parties advocating pro-poor policy, support for
   redistribution is weaker. The results based on multilevel analysis of
   survey data from 18 Latin American countries suggest that building
   political support for redistribution is more difficult when economic and
   ethnic inequalities overlap and when party systems lack programmatic
   appeals emphasizing distributive issues.},

Abstract = {Kenwick, Vasquez, and Powers contend that defensive alliances provoke
   conflict; Leeds and Johnson argue that they deter conflict. I use a
   formal model to deduce conditions under which alliances provoke and
   those under which they deter, allowing us to distinguish the two
   effects. The model shows that both sets of analyses include cases that
   should be left out of an analysis of whether alliances are more likely
   to provoke or deter. I re-analyze both sides' data and find evidence
   suggestive that alliances provoke only when the two sides do not have a
   recent history of conflict or alliances but deter when they do.},

Abstract = {In Chile, the difficulty of winning both district seats under the
   binominal electoral system has generated opposite motivations for
   office-seeking political parties, which want to maximize their seat
   share, and individual candidates who want to win. Carey and Siavelis
   (2003) argue that the Concertacion rewarded good losers who contributed
   to its overall vote share. We apply that explanation to the 2009
   election, when the right-wing Alianza coalition was ahead and,
   therefore, any future rewards would be most likely to be distributed
   among its good losers. Our contribution clarifies doubts about the
   causes of strong legislative tickets at the district level in the
   coalition that would most likely win. In showing that the Alianza had
   stronger tickets in 2009 than in previous elections, we support the
   thesis of good losers' insurance.},

Abstract = {This essay explores some aspects of the debate led by Louis Althusser
   and Etienne Balibar on the strategy of the French Communist Party (PCF)
   in the 1970s. They saw the Eurocommunist turn of the party as a strategy
   that accepted the influence of social democrats without addressing the
   crucial question of mass participation in the party. Their criticism of
   the PCF was also a criticism of the statist strategy in socialist
   countries at that time, which they saw as a fusion of the socialist
   state with the working-class party. Althusser radicalized his stance
   when he demanded that a revolutionary party should stay outside the
   state, both before and after a socialist revolution. In this text, the
   references made by Balibar and Althusser to works of Marx and Engels are
   compared with the political positions developed in the original texts,
   and some conclusions for contemporary political strategies are hinted
   at.},

   of Peru},
Journal = {POLITICS AND GOVERNANCE},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {5},
Number = {4},
Pages = {6-18},
Abstract = {While the inclusion of labour rights in European Union (EU) trade
   agreements has become an `unobjectionable norm', analyses of their
   impact have been largely absent from the literature. This article aims
   to partly fill this gap in existing research by examining the impact of
   labour rights commitments in the EU-Peru-Colombia agreement, with
   particular reference to the agricultural sector in Peru. Following a
   brief background overview of labour rights in agriculture in Peru, we
   draw up the analytical framework for assessing the impact of these
   commitments. We discern three distinctive legal commitments and find
   that they are flexible and conservative, also compared to provisions in
   other EU trade agreements. Subsequently, we assess the impact of these
   commitments by analysing to what extent they are being upheld in
   practice. Empirical evidence from several sources, including field
   research, shows that the Peruvian government has failed to implement the
   labour rights commitments in several respects. In the conclusions, we
   point to the cautious role of the EU, which has scope to monitor Peru's
   labour rights compliance more proactively.},

Abstract = {This article analyzes the cohesion of the Pacific Alliance in terms of
   its consolidation as a regional player. From its creation with the
   signing of the Framework Agreement in 2012, the formative process starts
   from a passive object to an active subject according to the levels of
   regionality. The Pacific Alliance is considered as an embryonic project
   that seeks to respond to the challenges of globalization towards the
   common projection of its member-states and platform for their
   international insertion. However, its consolidation as a regional player
   in Latin America faces major challenges given the weaknesses and
   strengths in leadership, interdependence, convergence, identity and
   institutions as success factors for regional cohesion in order to pool
   member-states `potentials for opportunities and against threats in the
   international system.},

Abstract = {The negative perception of the Revolution of 1917 in today's Russia has
   its roots in the Perestroika era. At that time, the writings of
   opponents of the Revolution, such as Nikolai Berdyaev, were published
   and read in huge numbers of copies for the first time. A key role was
   played by the re-issued collective volume ``De profundis{''} (1918), the
   authors of which reflected on the metaphysical ``meaning{''} of the
   Revolution. Many of them regarded the social cataclysm as being a
   punishment for the moral failures of the intelligentsia, and hoped for a
   national rebirth. This conservative ``philosophy of the
   counter-revolution{''} strongly influenced the political mindset of
   post-Soviet Russia. Key elements are politics created in the spirit of
   religion, separate national paths of progress and the rejection of
   communism and liberal democracy in equal measure.},

Abstract = {The article analyzes the role of emotions in the experience of a
   grassroots Mexican group, that is defending an urban forest threated by
   residential developments. The resistance of this group, started in 2005,
   is marked by significant place attachment, which has been nurtured and
   enhanced all along the struggle.
   The aim of the article is to understand how place attachment is
   strengthened in urban contexts and why it is a core affective bond for
   defending the territory. Our hypothesis is that it is a dynamic and
   mobilizing bond, and its relevance resides in the emotions it generates,
   which in turn have different effects on the protest.
   In order to confirm our hypothesis we have analyzed the emotional
   dimension of the resistances in defense of the forest, through in-depth
   interviews. The analysis will specifically focus on emotions that
   strengthen and go together with place attachment.},

Abstract = {Partial political liberalization presents a double-edged sword for
   authoritarian regimes: it can increase the risk of democratization and
   it can also facilitate regime adaptability. This article examines this
   phenomenon through the prism of the mediaan important yet an
   understudied variable in the study of transition processes.
   Specifically, the article compares two opposite cases of media opening
   up: the Soviet policy of glasnost, which facilitated a democratic
   movement, and China's reform-era policy of media supervision, or yulun
   jiandu, which has thus far contributed to regime durability. The paper
   demonstrates how the two policies, while similar on the surface,
   differed significantly in their modes of implementation. In particular,
   the Chinese approach of allowing media to take on an oversight role has
   featured a more careful strategic calculus as well as more ambiguity
   combined with continuous, intensive guidance over the media. The
   article, therefore, highlights the importance of the practices of
   implementation of media liberalization, in order to explain political
   outcomes.},

Abstract = {This paper examines the social media strategies of candidates seeking
   their party's nomination for the 2016 U.S. presidential election. We use
   textual analysis to understand what candidates focused on. We assess
   eight themes covered in Twitter posts. For example, Clinton focused on
   GUN CONTROL, while Sanders focused on climate change. Using Facebook
   data, we introduce a topic modeling approach, latent Dirichlet
   allocation, to the political marketing literature. This allows us to
   uncover what topics the candidates focus on without researcher
   intervention and, using a dynamic model, show how this changes over
   time. We note that Clinton's focus on Trump increases toward the end of
   the primary campaign.},

Abstract = {The crisis in relations between Russia and the European Union (EU) is
   part of the broader breakdown of the post-Cold War peace and security
   order. The cold peace between 1989 and 2014 increasingly demonstrated
   the tensions in that order, and the Ukraine crisis was a symptom of that
   breakdown. Four fundamental interlinked processes shape the crisis: the
   logic of non-negotiated enlargement; the radicalisation of a monist
   vision of Europe; the failure to develop the ideational or institutional
   framework for some sort of greater European integration project; and the
   ensuing attempts to create the foundations of an anti-hegemonic
   alignment as part of a nascent multipolar world order. The involution of
   pan-European idealism created a divided continent and accelerated
   strivings for multipolarity. Russia's neo-revisionism seeks to temper
   the practical application of moral universalism in what are perceived to
   be arbitrary and punitive ways, while ensuring that the instruments of
   global governance really do reflect global concerns. The clash in Europe
   is only part of the broader challenge of representing pluralism at the
   global level. Eurasian and greater Asia developments represent a way for
   Russia to escape entrapment in the monism of the Atlantic system and the
   attendant involution of Europe. The failure to create a unified Europe
   means that Europe can no longer be considered an autonomous subject of
   global politics. The lack of one Europe means no substantive Europe in
   global affairs.},

Abstract = {In this essay the author focuses on some problematic questions of the
   political reflection of Alberico Gentili (1552-1608). He was an Italian
   jurist and he was well-known for his contribution to modern
   international law. Gentili's juridical and internationalist theory,
   consecrated to the individuation of a system of laws to rule the
   relations between sovereign actors, is based on a concept of sovereignty
   inspired by Bodin's doctrine but it also elaborates classical
   cosmopolitanism ideal of an universal societas hominum. However, these
   models seem difficult to conciliate. How can the interests of the State
   be harmonized with the natural principles of justice innate to human
   reason? This contradiction emerges widely in Gentili's writings,
   witnessing the critical aspects of the relation between ethics and
   political power in the Modern age.},

Abstract = {The complete edition of Thompson's work in French is an invitation, to
   the social sciences, to debate the theoretical relevance of his
   historical analysis. For twenty years, the social sciences in France
   have limited their discussion on the comparative uses of Thompson's
   concept of the ``moral economy of the crowd.{''} But Thompson's work can
   be read, in its internal coherence, within a specific critical method.
   This method, strictly related to an original demonstrative style, can be
   analyzed with a double ``key{''}: a sociological comprehension of
   ``popular politics{''} and a theoretical analysis of social experience,
   which gives the method of the ``history from below{''} its full meaning.
   This double key allows the social sciences to understand the
   anthropological meaning of ``politics{''} in Thompson's work, as the
   possibility, in every human society, from the past to the present, of
   freedom and emancipation.},

   Balancing},
Journal = {POLITIKON},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {44},
Number = {3},
Pages = {387-403},
Abstract = {BRICS was ostensibly established to counter the global dominance of the
   US. With the waning of military power and increasing reluctance to
   engage in hard balancing in the international system, some scholars
   observe that the BRICS countries are harnessing their non-military power
   to challenge US global hegemony through soft balancing. South Africa's
   membership of BRICS has generated heated debate with many considering
   the African powerhouse as a minnow in the grouping. Against this
   backdrop, this article explores if, in common with the other BRICS
   members, South Africa has the resources to engage in subtle means to
   balance the influence of the US, particularly in its region. It explores
   the sources of South Africa's soft power and the extent to which, if at
   all, the country relies on soft-balancing techniques to counter US
   influence. The article employs soft balancing, the soft side of balance
   of power theory and concludes that, like other BRICS countries, South
   Africa wields remarkable soft power and engages in soft balancing to
   counter the US' influence in Africa and (in concert with other BRICS
   states) at the global level.},

Abstract = {Polish society has not processed the trauma of the war. As a result,
   emotions spill over into bitter conflicts when it comes to history and
   remembrance. The year of 1945 stands for the return from the horrors of
   war. However, society was marked by poverty, disintegration and
   atomisation for years to come. Institutions had fallen apart, the social
   order and the system of values were shattered. The only experience that
   bound people together was a sense of Polishness defined along pre-war
   lines. However, countless Poles had lost their homes in the east of the
   country, while others were forcibly repatriated to the western
   territories, which were referred to as the ``Recovered Territories{''}.
   And among those few Polish Jews who had managed to survive the
   Holocaust, some were confronted with the experience of being unwelcome
   guests in their own houses, which their Polish neighbours had made their
   home. In reality, there is no such thing as a ``return{''} of the Poles.
   Trauma and taboos have settled like sediment in Polish society. They
   demand to be examined and processed.},

Abstract = {In the battle of narratives to give meaning to the international system
   in the twenty-first century, emerging powers are actively engaged. In
   particular, the BRICS group, comprising Brazil, Russia, India, China and
   South Africa, have advanced their claim to reconstitute international
   affairs to make it more just and fair. What if their narratives about
   the international system effectively contest narratives constituting the
   Liberal World Order? For understanding the battle more profoundly, this
   study examines the strategic narratives of the BRICS. A documentary
   methodology was employed to elicit themes and narratives in BRICS joint
   communiques of 2009 to 2016 for the identification of its strategic
   narratives. I have identified a system narrative of global recovery, an
   identity narrative of inclusive participation and an issue narrative of
   infrastructural development. A narrative grammar was used to relate
   BRICS strategic narratives with their narrative environment of symbolic,
   institutional and material practices. Due to a partial compliance with
   the narrative grammatical rules, the BRICS group may not effectively
   influence and gain public support.},

Abstract = {The aim of this article is to offer a contribution to the understanding
   of what occurs when `culture' and `Europe' meet in a local context.
   Specifically, the subject of study is the Festival of Europe (Festival
   d'Europa), a biennial event dedicated to European themes held in the
   city of Florence (Italy). The article analyzes the origins of the
   Festival, the idea of culture embraced by its organizers, and cultural
   performances staged by local actors during the 2015 edition, combining
   top-down and bottom-up perspectives. The article provides evidence-based
   reflections on how European-centered cultural repertoires are developed
   and experienced using qualitative methods of data collection and
   analysis.},

Year = {2017},
Volume = {17},
Number = {2},
Pages = {9-40},
Abstract = {Kenya has since the re-introduction of multiparty politics in 1991
   experienced periodic electoral conflicts. In the analysis of these
   conflicts, however, there is an evolving tendency to perceive their
   causes as merely, or mainly, manifestations of negative ethnicity. In
   other words, there is the tendency on the part of the state, and
   non-state actors, to deliberately `ethnify' extra-ethnic conflicts in
   the country in a phenomenon herein conceptualised as ethnification. The
   ethnification of extra-ethnic conflicts has caused the country to
   continually drift into an electoral-conflict trap. The failure to
   address substantive extra-ethnic factors which have historical,
   structural, institutional, legal, and cultural standpoints has
   constrained the pursuit of positive peace in the country. This paper,
   therefore, examines the evolving tendency to treat extra-ethnic
   electoral conflicts from the ethnic-identity premise. The centrality of
   underlying causes and rationales of electoral conflict that are
   extra-ethnic is highlighted, and a way forward for the pursuit of
   positive peace in the country is recommended.},

Title = {The European Commission and fiscal governance reform: a strategic actor?},
Journal = {WEST EUROPEAN POLITICS},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {40},
Number = {6},
Pages = {1310-1330},
Abstract = {The intensification of the financial and economic crisis in Europe has
   added a new impetus to the debate over the possibilities for securing
   supranational fiscal integration within the Economic and Monetary Union
   (EMU). Since the literature on the European Union's response to the
   crisis is dominated by the study of intergovernmental politics, this
   article considers the previously neglected role of the Commission. A
   framing analysis of the Commission's crisis discourse is operationalised
   here, which is supplemented by interviews with senior officials located
   in the Directorate General for Economic and Financial Affairs (DG ECFIN)
   during key phases of the crisis. It is found that a supranational reform
   agenda was never internalised by the Commission. Instead, the Commission
   acted strategically by framing the crisis around intergovernmental
   fiscal discipline. These findings suggest that, in line with the new
   intergovernmentalist' thesis, supranational institutions themselves may
   not be as hard-wired' towards supranationalism as is often assumed.},

Title = {Introduction: practicing citizenship in contemporary China},
Journal = {CITIZENSHIP STUDIES},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {21},
Number = {7},
Pages = {737-754},
Abstract = {Citizenship in China - and elsewhere in the global South - has been
   perceived as either a distorted echo of the real' democratic version in
   Europe and North America, or an orientalized other' that defines what
   citizenship is not. In contrast, adopting a connected histories'
   perspective makes Chinese citizenship a constitutive part of a modernity
   that is still unfolding. Since the nineteenth century, concerns about
   citizenship have been central to debates about the building of state and
   society in China. Some of these concerns are echoed in key tensions
   related to the practices of citizenship in China today, particularly in
   three areas: a state preference for sedentarism and governing citizens
   in place vs. growing mobility, sometimes facilitated by the state; a
   perception that state-building and development requires a strong state
   vs. ideas and practices of participatory citizenship; and submission of
   the individual to the collective' (state, community, village, family
   etc.) vs. the rising salience of conceptions of self-development and
   self-making projects. Exploring manifestations of these tensions can
   contribute to thinking about citizenship beyond China, including the
   role of the local in forming citizenship orders; how individualization
   works in the absence of liberal individualism; and how social
   citizenship' is increasingly becoming a reward to good citizens', rather
   than a mechanism for achieving citizen equality.},

Abstract = {The conspiracy theories are for losers argument suggests that
   out-of-power groups use conspiracy theories to sensitize minds, close
   ranks, and encourage collective action. Two necessary conditions of this
   argument are that (1) group members subscribe mostly to conspiracy
   theories that malign out-groups or bolster their in-group, and (2) group
   members must recognize whether conspiracy theories emanate from their
   own group, an opposing group, or are outside of partisan conflict. Using
   representative survey data from the 2012 Cooperative Congressional
   Election Study, we show that conspiracy accusations follow the contours
   of partisan conflict: partisans accuse opposing groups, rather than
   co-partisans or non-partisans, of conspiring. Using MTurk data, we show
   that partisans can differentiate between the conspiracy theories coming
   from members of each party. We suggest that many conspiracy beliefs
   behave like most partisan attitudes; they follow the contours of
   partisan conflict and act as calling cards that send clear signals to
   co-partisans.},

Abstract = {This note provides a retrospective on lessons learned in research on
   conflict forecasting, motivated by reflections around the retirement of
   Professor Michael D. Ward from Duke University. I argue that an
   excessive focus on ``black swans{''} or surprising events that are hard
   to forecast detracts from considering the more frequent ``white
   swans{''} or regularities in conflict. It is often more useful to focus
   on modal conflicts than exceptions, and substantial progress has been
   made in recent research. I identify some key lessons learned and
   highlight the need for researchers to distinguish between features that
   are more or less difficult to forecast.},

Abstract = {Can the theory and practice of the yogic tradition serve as a challenge
   to dominant cultural and political norms in the Western world? In this
   essay I demonstrate that modern yoga is a creature of fabrication, while
   arguing that yogic norms can simultaneously reinforce and challenge the
   norms of contemporary Western neoliberal societies. In its current and
   most common iteration in the West, yoga practice does stand in danger of
   reinforcing neoliberal constructions of selfhood. However, yoga does
   contain ample resources for challenging neoliberal subjectivity, but
   this requires reading the yogic tradition in a particular way, to
   emphasize certain philosophical elements over others, while directing
   its practice toward an inward-oriented detachment from material outcomes
   and desires. Contemporary claims about yoga's counterhegemonic status
   often rely on exaggerated notions of its former purity and authenticity,
   which belie its invented and retrospectively reconstructed nature.
   Rather than engaging in these debates about authenticity, scholars and
   practitioners may productively turn their energies toward enacting a
   resistant, anti-neoliberal practice of yoga, while remaining
   self-conscious about the particularity and partiality of the
   interpretive position on which such a practice is founded.},

Abstract = {Turkey's security sector is at a critical juncture due to hasty reforms
   and mass purges after the failed coup attempt on 15 July 2016. This
   article aims to elucidate the impact of reforms and purges on the
   organizational structures and institutional identities of the actors
   within the Turkish security sector - the Turkish Armed Forces, National
   Intelligence Agency, the Gendarmerie Command, the National Police,
   private security companies, and village guards - under the state of
   emergency in effect since 20 July 2016. The absence of a
   coordinator/agent to synchronize the reform process, problems related to
   the capacity of and increasingly visible politicization within the
   Turkish security sector, and the democracy deficit in Turkey are
   discussed as inherent symptoms of the present security crisis and
   subsequent terror attacks on Turkish soil. These can most effectively be
   remedied through a holistic approach to transformation: a gradual
   institutional change of Turkey's security sector.},

Abstract = {This contribution extends research on coalition politics and
   foreign-policy decision-making to non-democratic settings and, in
   particular, anocratic regimes. Anocracies have a complexmixture of
   authoritarian and democratic elements that fragments authority across
   politically autonomous actors. As in multi-party cabinets in
   parliamentary democracies, coalition politics thus potentially pervades
   foreign-policy decision-making. To illustrate this argument, several
   prominent historical cases of anocracies resorting to war are examined.
   These well-documented cases provide conceptual and theoretical insights
   into how coalition decision units and related political considerations
   can drive and/ or distort crisis diplomacy, even at the height of
   international crisis.},

Abstract = {In this article, I investigate whether the growth of special districts
   in the fifty states from 1972 to 2002 can be explained by choices made
   by local general-purpose governments in response to different degrees of
   government autonomy in the fiscal, institutional, and political system.
   Focusing on three dimensions of government autonomy-local government
   capacity, local government discretion, and local government importance-I
   find that the growth of certain types of special districts is in part a
   response to state laws constraining government autonomy of general
   purpose governments. The findings also suggest that reliance on special
   districts by local general purpose governments would decrease if they
   had stronger own-source revenue-raising capacities and more diversified
   tax revenue bases. In contrast with prior studies, the analysis provides
   limited evidence to support the notion that special districts are formed
   by general-purpose governments to circumvent fiscal restrictions, such
   as debt limits and tax and expenditure limitations.},

Journal = {POLITICAL STUDIES REVIEW},

Volume = {15},
Number = {4},

Abstract = {The argument that representative democracies are experiencing an age of
   depoliticisation has become increasingly prominent. However, there has
   been too little reflection on the assumptions made about politics within
   the depoliticisation literature. This has led to a lack of precision in
   terms of how we identify (de)politicisation empirically and the grounds
   upon which we can normatively critique it. To address this, the article
   changes the terms of the depoliticisation debate and asks not what we
   can learn about politics by thinking more about depoliticisation, but
   what we can learn about depoliticisation if we think more about
   politics. How politics is defined, in spatial, temporal and activity
   terms, hugely influences how we might understand depoliticisation. Three
   prominent and contrasting definitions of politics are shown: politics as
   the institutions of government (politics lens 1), politics as choice and
   contingency (politics lens 2) and politics as the apparatus of order and
   consensus versus political' moments of antagonism (politics lens 3). By
   considering these ontologies of politics, the article teases out some of
   their strengths and weaknesses in capturing the depoliticisation
   crisis'. The article concludes by considering the benefits of a
   multi-lens approach to depoliticisation as a preliminary step to
   encourage greater reflexivity and debate.},

   action from an interpretation of William Shakespeare's Julius Caesar
   through a Machiavellian perspective. It argues that Shakespeare's
   reflections on fortune, virtu and the potentialities of action are
   similar to those of the Florentine. We believe this perspective enlarges
   Shakespearian analysis on fortune -limited mainly to the images of the
   wheel and the emblem books-and puts forward an eminently political

Abstract = {The Responsibility to Protect (RtoP) represents one of the key normative
   developments towards mitigating global human rights violations.
   Normatively, the RtoP advances the notion of responsible sovereignty by
   obligating states to protect their people from humanitarian catastrophe
   and emphasises the residual role of the international community in the
   event of lack of capacity or the state's unwillingness to protect. It is
   in this context that this article examines the RtoP mitigation measures
   instituted by the Southern African Development Community (SADC) and the
   African Union (AU) as regional multilateral institutions in responding
   to the crisis in Zimbabwe. The article considers the extent to which the
   responses have been guided implicitly or explicitly by RtoP principles.
   The evolution and consolidation of the humanitarian crisis has been
   considered, with specific focus on the human security impact of
   government policies, in particular, Operation Murambatsvina (the
   destruction of what were deemed illegal housing structures in major
   cities in Zimbabwe in May 2005) and the unprecedented 2008 electoral
   violence as a result of increased militarisation of governance
   structures. Debate on the applicability of RtoP to the crisis in
   Zimbabwe is thus located within the broader framework of the normative
   theories of international relations that forms the basis of RtoP. The
   article argues that escalation of the government induced humanitarian
   crisis was as a result of lack of timeous or effective responses by both
   the AU and SADC. Again, the AU and SADC responses were significantly
   influenced by diverse, often mutually exclusive, interpretations of the
   main causes of the crisis. Another salient finding is the extent to
   which politicisation of RtoP and lack of political will undermined RtoP
   operationalisation.},

Abstract = {The literature on far right parties emphasizes the importance of party
   organization for electoral persistence. Yet, a lot is still unknown
   about the organizational development of these parties. This article
   examines the microdynamics of organizational development and explores
   why some party organizations succeed and others fail. It focuses on the
   local rather than the national level and analyzes grassroots activities
   rather than party leadership, institutions, or members. To analyze
   organizational development, the article uses an original and unique data
   set of 3594 activities of the Greek Golden Dawn (GD) supplemented by
   interviews with the GD leadership and activists as well as with evidence
   from hundreds of newspaper reports. It uses this evidence to trace local
   party activism and to document variation in local organizational
   outcomes. To account for why some local party organizations succeed or
   fail, it suggests that, rather than solely following electoral logic,
   the organizational development of far right parties also relates to the
   way they respond to challenges from antifascist groups and state
   authorities.},

   authoritarian regimes very often prohibit. Thus, the case of Chile is
   exceptional. The Center for Studies of Contemporary Reality (CERC)
   conducted surveys prior to the successor plebiscite held in 1988 to
   decide the continuity of General Pinochet in power for eight more years.
   Based on this information, we identified the political and social
   determinants that explained the triumph of the opposition. Through a
   series of binomial and multinomial models, we verified that the ``No{''}
   option had greater support among men, young people and people of low
   socioeconomic status, clearly marking a continuity with the voting
   patterns for the center-left parties before the 1973 coup d'etat.
   Moreover, we maintain that the ``No{''} option was the preferred one
   even before the broadcast of television propaganda. Thus, the case of
   Chile is useful to evaluate electoral behavior models in undemocratic
   scenarios, identifying the long and shortterm factors that explain
   political outcomes.},

Abstract = {While ethnic quotas are primarily used to increase minority political
   representation, they also act like term-limits for majority-group
   incumbents, who cannot seek reelection after quota implementation. As
   such, quotas may have the perverse effect of making incumbents less
   accountable during their last term, particularly to minorities. Although
   majority-group incumbents may still have social reasons to distribute
   benefits to their coethnics, they have less reason to do so for
   minorities, from whom they derive little social reward. Using the
   systematic rotation of caste quotas in south India, this article shows
   that village presidents who expect to be ousted by quota spend
   significantly less on minorities than those who can run again; however,
   they do not reduce spending on goods that benefit their own communities.
   These findings suggest that quota policies must be evaluated not just by
   whom they bring into office but also by whom they force out.},

Title = {Reevaluating the Middle-Class Protest Paradigm: A Case-Control Study of

Journal = {AMERICAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW},

Abstract = {A large literature expects rising middle classes to promote democracy.
   However, few studies provide direct evidence on this group in
   nondemocratic settings. This article focuses on politically important
   differentiation within the middle classes, arguing that middle-class
   growth in state-dependent sectors weakens potential coalitions in
   support of democratization. I test this argument using surveys conducted
   at mass demonstrations in Russia and detailed population data. I also
   present a new approach to studying protest based on case-control methods
   from epidemiology. The results reveal that state-sector professionals
   were significantly less likely to mobilize against electoral fraud, even
   after controlling for ideology. If this group had participated at the
   same rate as middle-class professionals from the private sector, I
   estimate that another 90,000 protesters would have taken to the streets.
   I trace these patterns of participation to the interaction of individual
   resources and selective incentives. These findings have implications for
   authoritarian stability and democratic transitions.},

Title = {``To be human, nonetheless, remains a decision'': Humanism as
   decisionism in contemporary critical political theory},
Journal = {CONTEMPORARY POLITICAL THEORY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {16},
Number = {4},
Pages = {439-458},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {This article suggests that humanism is a decisionism in contemporary
   critical political theory. Despite obvious and multiple differences,
   leading critical theorists like Giorgio Agamben, Slavoj Zizek, Eric
   Santner, and Jurgen Habermas, among others, share an investment in
   stabilizing the human being as a ground of the political. This
   stabilization of the human should concern political theorists, as this
   article argues, because it uncritically reproduces conceptual affinities
   between the notion of the human being and sovereign authority. By
   investing in the stability and centrality of the human being, these
   theorists perform what will be called, paraphrasing an often neglected
   argument by Carl Schmitt, a decision to be human. Contrary to
   conventional wisdom, I argue that Schmitt's decisionism is not merely
   circumscribed to sovereignty's juridico-political dimension, but that it
   also includes a peculiar commitment to God's decision to become human in
   Christ. Against this decisionism as humanism, the article draws on
   Walter Benjamin, Roberto Esposito, and Jacques Derrida to propose an
   alternative politics that destabilizes humanity and sovereignty through
   the emergence of the animal, or what will be called melancholic
   lycanthropy.},

Abstract = {Why do some leaders eliminate rivals from authoritarian regimes and
   therefore diminish elites' capabilities to remove them via coup, while
   others do not? By examining both dictators' incentives and opportunities
   to weaken regime elites, I show that dictators are more likely to
   eliminate rivals when elites' capabilities to oust dictators are
   temporarily low. Thus, somewhat paradoxically, my theory predicts that
   dictators are more likely to weaken elites' capabilities as the threat
   of coup decreases rather than when coup risk is high. Furthermore, I
   argue that successful coups that put new dictators in power temporarily
   diminish elites' capabilities to remove dictators and, thus, provide a
   window of opportunity for the dictators to take steps to consolidate
   power. Empirical results using a new dataset on purges of militaries
   from 1969 to 2003 provide strong evidence for my hypotheses.},

Abstract = {How does information about the presence of foreign financing in a
   development project change people's perceptions of that project? Using
   an informational experiment in Bangladesh, we find that information
   about US financing of a specific development intervention sends a
   positive signal about project quality; this effect is concentrated among
   individuals who are the least likely to have been exposed to the
   information ex ante. The information does not change the already high
   demand for foreign aid but does help citizens target their demands
   toward the existing donor. That foreign funding can be a signal of
   project quality helps explain an existing finding in the literature that
   individuals prefer foreign aid projects to government projects.},

Abstract = {The 2010 Wright Reforms are the most significant changes to the Select
   Committee system in the UK House of Commons since their inauguration in
   their modern form in 1979. We use interrupted time series techniques
   (ARIMA) to test the impact of the Wright Report on the level of
   parliamentarians' engagement with those Select Committees covered by the
   Wright Reforms using proxy measures of membership attendance and
   turnover rates. We find little or no evidence that the Wright Report had
   an impact on these outcomes. In light of these findings, we argue that
   some of the claims made regarding the successes of Select Committees and
   the Wright Reforms are overblown or, at least, premature and
   inadequately supported by evidence, and that further reforms may be
   needed if the aims of the Wright Committee are to be realised more
   fully.},

Abstract = {What explains the changing policymaking process for abortion law in
   Mexico over the past century? From the 1930s until the 1970s, abortion
   laws across the thirty-two federal entities in Mexico were nearly
   identical. Between 1979 and 1987, almost half of the states liberalized
   abortion laws, but very little attention was paid to the reforms.
   Abortion suddenly emerged as a central polarizing conflict in the
   aftermath of the 2000 presidential elections that ushered in multiparty
   democracy. This article provides a comparative analysis of criminal
   codes and abortion law through time and across the Mexican states. It
   builds on the theoretical insights of U.S. public policy research on
   federalism and Mexican research on policymaking to present a comparative
   framework for understanding policymaking in federal systems. The article
   argues that policy salience and policy autonomy are key variables for
   understanding different types of policymaking processes.},

Abstract = {Studies of bargaining and war generally focus on two sources of
   incomplete information: uncertainty over the probability of victory and
   uncertainty over the costs of fighting. We introduce uncertainty over
   preferences of a spatial policy and argue for its relevance in crisis
   bargaining. Under these conditions, standard results from the bargaining
   model of war break down: peace can be Pareto inefficient and it may be
   impossible to avoid war. We then extend the model to allow for cheap
   talk pre-play communication. Whereas incentives to misrepresent normally
   render cheap talk irrelevant, here communication can cause peace and
   ensure that agreements are efficient. Moreover, peace can become more
   likely as (1) the variance in the proposer's belief about its opponent's
   type increases and (2) the costs of war decrease. Our results indicate
   that one major purpose of diplomacy is simply to communicate preferences
   and that such communications can be credible.},

Abstract = {This article presents a categorization theory of spatial voting, which
   postulates that voters perceive political stances through coarse
   classifications. Because voters think in terms of categories defined by
   the ideological center, their behavior deviates from standard models of
   utility maximization along ideological continua. Their preferences are
   characterized by discontinuities, rewarding parties on their side of the
   ideological space more than existing spatial models would predict. While
   this study concurs with prior studies suggesting that voters tend to use
   a proximity rule, it argues that this rule mainly serves to distinguish
   among parties of the same side. Overall, the results suggest that
   voters' party evaluations are characterized by a nontrivial identity
   component, generating in-group biases not captured by the existing
   spatial models of voting.},

Abstract = {This paper focuses on the link between alienation, commodity fetishism
   and human development. Alienation and commodity fetishism appear in
   different ways, very abstract and invisibly. People engage innocently
   with these phenomenon without being aware of how they relate to their
   well-being. Difficulty in living conditions indicates the interaction of
   human development, alienation and commodity fetishism. These issues are
   investigated in this article in the specific context of economic crisis
   in Vietnam, which provides a useful opportunity to examine the way
   people's lives are affected, and how they adapt to their situations.
   Based on this, the research contained here contributes additional
   understanding to human development discourse.},

Abstract = {How does the structure of the peer review process, which can vary among
   journals, influence the quality of papers published in a journal? This
   article studies multiple systems of peer review using computational
   simulation, I find that, under any of the systems I study, a majority of
   accepted papers are evaluated by an average reader as not meeting the
   standards of the journal. Moreover, all systems allow random chance to
   play a strong role in the acceptance decision. Heterogeneous reviewer
   and reader standards for scientific quality drive both results. A peer
   review system with an active editor-that is, one who uses desk rejection
   before review and does not rely strictly on reviewer votes to make
   decisions-can mitigate some of these effects.},

Abstract = {Between 1890 and 1914, the United States acquired overseas colonies,
   built a battleship fleet, and intervened increasingly often in Latin
   America and East Asia. This activism is often seen as the precursor to
   the country's role as a superpower after 1945 but actually served very
   different goals. In contrast to its pursuit of a relatively liberal
   international economic order after 1945, the United States remained
   committed to trade protection before 1914. Protectionism had several
   important consequences for American foreign policy on both economic and
   security issues. It led to a focus on less developed areas of the world
   that would not export manufactured goods to the United States instead of
   on wealthier European markets. It limited the tactics available for
   promoting American exports, forcing policymakers to seek exclusive
   bilateral agreements or unilateral concessions from trading partners
   instead of multilateral arrangements. It inhibited political cooperation
   with other major powers and implied an aggressive posture toward these
   states. The differences between this foreign policy and the one the
   United States adopted after 1945 underscore the critical importance not
   just of the search for overseas markets but also of efforts to protect
   the domestic market.},

Abstract = {Europe is home to a globally unique area where the barriers of
   transnational migration have been largely removed. This article focuses
   on Finnish highly skilled, intra-European migrants and their labour
   market situation immediately following the economic crisis of 2008.
   Based on two consecutive online surveys (carried out in spring 2008 and
   summer 2010) of tertiary educated Finns living in other EU countries,
   the article examines the effects of the global economic downturn on the
   careers of these highly skilled migrants. Only 16 per cent of the
   respondents report that their labour market situation had worsened. A
   higher percentage (24\%) felt that their situation had improved and the
   majority (54\%) had either experienced no change in their situation or
   stated that their reasons for changing jobs or moving had nothing to do
   with the crisis. The article concludes that these migrants were
   protected from the full force of the crisis by their high human capital,
   flexibility of alternating between studying and work, employment in
   international workplaces and their intra-European migrant status.},

Title = {The relative weight of character traits in political candidate
   evaluations: Warmth is more important than competence, leadership and
   integrity},
Journal = {ELECTORAL STUDIES},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {49},
Pages = {96-107},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Decades of research has found that voters' electoral decisions to a
   significant degree are affected by character evaluations of candidates.
   Yet it remains unresolved which specific candidate traits voters find
   most important. In political science it is often argued that
   competence-related traits are most influential, whereas work in social
   psychology suggests that warmth-related traits are more influential.
   Here we test which character trait is the more influential in global
   candidate evaluations and vote choice using observational data from the
   ANES 1984-2008 and an original experiment conducted on a representative
   sample of English partisan respondents. Across the two studies we find
   that warmth is more influential than competence, leadership and
   integrity. Importantly, results hold across a wide range of alternative
   specifications and robustness analyses. We conclude by discussing
   theoretical and practical implications of the results. (C) 2017 Elsevier

Abstract = {These days, the study of soft power and public diplomacy is relatively
   advanced. The present article complements this growing body of work by
   focusing on the relationship between two institutions that are generally
   geared toward minimizing friction in international affairs: sport and
   diplomacy. Over the past five years, the study of sports diplomacy has
   grown but the same cannot be said about scholarship assessing its
   practice, that is, how theory is reconciled in practice. This is a gap
   this research seeks to overcome. It describes and critiques the efforts,
   challenges, and vicissitudes Australia's Department of Foreign Affairs
   and Trade faced when building and implementing the world's first Sports
   Diplomacy Strategy in 2015. The study finds that with appropriate
   ministerial support and innovative diplomats, both the theory and
   practice of sports diplomacy have a bright, promising future. Such
   analysis is useful because it encourages greater dialog between the
   ivory towers and the beltway of diplomacy.},

Abstract = {Voters are often highly dependent on partisanship to structure their
   preferences toward political candidates and policy proposals. What
   conditions enable partisan cues to ``dominate{''} public opinion? Here I
   theorize that variation in voters' reliance on partisanship results, in
   part, from the opportunities their environment provides to learn about
   politics. A conjoint experiment and an observational study of voting in
   congressional elections both support the expectation that more detailed
   information environments reduce the role of partisanship in candidate
   choice. These findings clarify previously unexplained cross-study
   variation in party cue effects. They also challenge competing claims
   that partisan cues inhibit responsiveness to such a degree that voters
   fail to use other information or that high-information environments
   increase voter reliance on partisanship.},

Abstract = {A common interpretation of the principle of subsidiarity in the
   federalism literature is that decentralized government, which is closer
   to the people, is better able to respond to the preferences of its
   citizens. However, when the principle is denuded of its moral
   foundations in this fashion it not only fails to provide the grounding
   for achieving human dignity and the common good, but may also become the
   harbinger of fiscal crises and social dysfunction. We provide a more
   comprehensive account of the principle of subsidiarity and contrast this
   with various conceptions prominently presented in the federalism
   literature. We then explore how this more comprehensive view of
   subsidiarity would look in practice. In short, we argue that mere
   decentralization of government fails to capture the ontology and
   desirable outcomes of the principle of subsidiarity.},

Abstract = {Accusations of dishonourable campaigning have featured in every
   Argentine presidential election since the return to democracy in 1983.
   Yet, allegations made in the elections this October and November looked
   different from earlier ones. The campaign team for the centre-leftist
   candidate Daniel Scioli argued that Cambiemos, the centre-right
   coalition led by Mauricio Macri, was abusing the political affordances
   of social media by running a Twitter campaign via `50,000' fake
   accounts. This paper presents evidence suggesting that both teams
   promoted their campaigns through automation on Twitter. Although the
   Macri campaign was subtler, both teams appear to have used automation to
   the same end: maximizing the diffusion of party content and creating an
   inflated image of their popularity. Neither team attempted to muffle or
   engage with opposing voices through automation. We argue that in a
   political culture fixated on the appearance of popularity, the use of
   automation to simulate mass support appears an organic development as
   campaigning enters the still unregulated Twittersphere. We compare our
   findings to the uses of automation in the Russian Twittersphere and
   conclude that there may be greater variation in the political usage of
   Twitter between political contexts than between different types of
   political event occurring in the same country.},

Volume = {38},

Pages = {441-455},

Abstract = {There has been a renewed interest in populism in Latin America, sparked
   by the social mobilization against neoliberalism usually referred to as
   the Pink Tide'. Governments brought to power by the Pink Tide have been
   successful in reconstructing the conditions of capital accumulation as
   well as incorporating a new set of social movement demands. This article
   puts forward an interpretation of Pink Tide neopopulism' based on a
   political economy approach. It argues that the two factors of a crisis
   of neoliberalism in the region and the existence of social movements
   with unmet demands are not enough to explain the rise and demise of
   populism. The commodity boom needs to be added as an enabling condition
   for these transformations. By revisiting the debate in Latin America and
   proposing a different reading, the article redefines an overloaded term
   and provides a new analytical viewpoint from which to understand the
   historical task' of populism in Brazil and Argentina.},

Abstract = {This article explores the working conditions of Icelandic local
   councillors in relation to voluntary retirement from the council. In the
   past three elections, the turnover in councils has been very high, with
   approximately six out of every 10 council members being new recruits at
   the beginning of each term. The turnover has also highlighted possible
   gender issues, as more women than men (proportionally) leave the council
   after their first term. The findings reveal a significant difference
   between the councillors who plan to stay and those who opt to leave.
   This is in relation to the local authorities' population size,
   satisfaction with remuneration, and seniority in the council. Thus,
   councillors in larger municipalities or councillors satisfied with their
   remuneration are more likely to run for council versus councillors from
   smaller municipalities and those less happy with their remuneration.
   Seniority is also a decisive factor, as the majority of all councillors
   leave after the first term. Significant differences were not found
   between the female and male councillors in relation to voluntary
   retirement. However, gendered differences were found in relation to
   institutional position and working conditions, suggesting a gender-based
   division of labour in local councils.},

Abstract = {This paper examines the consequences of the far-right in shaping
   foreign-born immigrants' satisfaction with the way democracy works in
   their host country. It posits that while electorally successful
   far-right parties undermine democracy satisfaction, the magnitude of
   this effect is not uniform across all first-generation immigrants.
   Instead, it depends on newcomers' citizenship status in their adopted
   homeland. The analyses using individual-level data collected as part of
   the five-round European Social Survey (ESS) 2002-2012 in 16 West
   European democracies reveal that the electoral strength of far-right
   parties in a form of vote and seat shares won in national elections is
   indeed powerfully linked to democracy satisfaction among foreign-born
   individuals. However, this relationship is limited to foreign-born
   non-citizens, as we have no evidence that far-right parties influence
   democracy attitudes among foreign-born individuals who have acquired
   citizenship in their adopted homeland.},

Abstract = {Most studies of amicus influence in both federal and state courts assume
   that the information provided in these briefs is the mechanism through
   which amici influence court outcomes. However, the question of how
   individual state supreme court judges respond to this third-party
   information and whether or not judicial responses are conditioned by
   differing methods of judicial retention is rarely theorized. Using
   social-psychological theories of confirmation bias and motivated
   reasoning, this article investigates how ideological predispositions and
   electoral institutions structure the responsiveness of state high-court
   judges to amicus brief information. Utilizing an original dataset of
   more than 14,000 votes of state high-court judges across three distinct
   areas of law, this article tests competing theories of amicus influence
   to determine how state high-court judges utilize amicus information to
   render judicial decisions. Results are generally supportive of the
   informational theory of amicus influence in complex areas of law.
   However, a conditioning relationship of retention method suggests that
   competitive elections may alter the mechanism of amicus brief influence
   such that judicial responsiveness to third-party briefs is more closely
   tied to the reelection and campaign fundraising considerations of
   individual judges in politically contentious areas of law.},

Abstract = {In this article we analyze the debates and political disputes in the
   Second International about the Jewish Question as a national question.
   We focus on different political organizations of various zones of
   Eastern Europe: The Russian Empire, where we address the relations
   between the Bund and the rest of Russian Social Democracy; the polish
   zone of the Empire (Congress Poland), where we analyze the relations
   between the Bund, Polish Social Democracy and the Polish Socialist Party
   (PPS); finally, we focus on the Province of Galitzia, in that moment a
   part of Austria, to assess the struggle between the Polish Social
   Democratic Party of Austria (part of the All-Austrian party) and the
   Jewish activists that, coming from this party, broke with it to create a
   Jewish party of bundist orientation. In all the examined cases we
   combine an analysis of the positions that these different organizations
   developed over time about the Jewish national question, framed in their
   general disputes and debates. We focus in their positions about the
   existence of a Jewish nationality, their position on the future of
   Jewish population (assimilationist, neutralist, nationalist, etc.) and
   the relationship of these questions with a general position on the
   national question. This work focuses in analyzing the regions where
   different positions on the convenience of a separate Jewish socialist
   organization emerged, a factor that stimulated the whole debate on the
   Jewish National Question. We finish by analyzing the struggle that some
   socialist Jewish organizations fought to be recognized by the Second
   International and the international connections between the different
   postures.},

Abstract = {The increasingly common involvement of the United States in military
   conflict resonates throughout American political institutions and
   affects the balance of power in important ways. We examine one
   particular aspect of executive augmentation of power in times of
   warlegislative deferenceand move beyond a binary approach to the effect
   of war. Instead, we contend that executive advantage depends on the
   salience and severity of the conflict. Matters of war often drive upward
   the prevalence of security concerns in public discourse. Although this
   can leave the president to compete with Congress on a much more friendly
   playing field, perceptions of the war's development can turn the tide.
   We empirically test our hypotheses with data spanning a 50-year period
   and find that the salience and severity of war matter, though not
   equally for both chambers of Congress. The findings hold implications
   for how we understand the institutional balance of power within and
   across conflicts, which represents a major aspect of American
   constitutional design and function.},

Abstract = {This paper proposes a new genealogy of law, which is opposed to the
   Modern theory of sovereignty. The principal founders of this new
   perspective are Gabriel Tarde and Gilles Deleuze, as they consider the
   law as a flow of beliefs and desires that is able to propagate through a
   process of imitation. This does not mean that the law is a kind of model
   that is simply copied by the social actors, because the imitative
   propagation is an operation not only of repetition, but also of
   differentiation. In this way, a law always coincides with an action of
   invention of new social relationships, which have the opportunity to
   expand and to create new communities and new institutions. The
   micro-social origin of the law allows political philosophy to abandon
   modern contractualism and to rethink society as a positive encounter of
   flows and singularities, which interact according to a principle of
   sympathy. Therefore, Tarde and Deleuze, building on an ontology of
   difference, show an original way of thinking law as a practice of social
   integration and inclusion.},

Abstract = {This essay analyzes what Alexis de Tocqueville calls an application of
   linguistics to history. Beginning with Tocqueville's position that
   language is the ground of meaningful bonds between people, I argue that
   the internal logic of a languagethe grammaris correlated with the
   internal logic governing the social order that both begets and is
   begotten by that language. Social orders therefore have both linguistic
   and political grammars and, as the internal logic of language changes,
   so too can the political grammar. This essay thus traces what
   Tocqueville envisions as the historical importance of language: from the
   language of aristocracy and the grammar of difference, to revolutionary
   language and the grammar of concurrence, to democratic language and the
   grammar of indifference. It concludes with Tocqueville's suggestion of
   how good grammar might be taught in democratic ages.},

Abstract = {Can a directly elected European Parliament help deliver standards by
   which the European Union can be indirectly legitimated through its
   component national democracies? This article argues that the Union can
   be indirectly legitimate where it helps member state democracies meet
   their own obligations to their own publics. The Union can do just that
   by managing externalities in ways needed to secure core values of
   justice, democracy and freedom from arbitrary domination within member
   states. Yet that poses a predicament: for if any one member state has an
   interest in imposing negative externalities or in freeriding on positive
   externalities provided by another, then so may its voters and democratic
   institutions. The article argues a directly elected European Parliament
   can help manage that predicament both by identifying externalities and
   by ensuring their regulation meets standards of public control,
   political equality and justification owed to individual national
   democracies.},

Abstract = {Do voters hold local officials accountable for government performance?
   Using over a decade of panel data on school district elections and
   academic achievement in California, I causally identify the effect of
   test score changes on school board incumbent re-election rates and show
   that incumbents are more likely to win re-election when test scores
   improve in their districtsbut only in presidential election years. This
   effect disappears in midterm and off-years, indicating that election
   timing might facilitate local government accountability.},

Abstract = {Influential recent scholarship assumes that authoritarian rulers act as
   perfect agents of economic elites, foreclosing the possibility that
   economic elites may at times prefer democracy absent a popular threat
   from below. Motivated by a puzzling set of democratic transitions, we
   relax this assumption and examine how elite uncertainty about
   dictatorshipa novel and generalizable causal mechanism impacting
   democratizationcan induce elite support for democracy. We construct a
   noisy signaling model in which a potential autocrat attempts to convince
   economic elites that he will be a faithful partner should elites install
   him in power. The model generates clear predictions about how two major
   types of elite uncertaintyuncertainty in a potential autocratic
   successor's policies produced by variance in the pool of would-be
   dictator types, and uncertainty in the truthfulness of policy promises
   made by potential autocratic successorsimpact the likelihood of
   elite-driven democratization. We demonstrate the model's plausibility in
   a series of cases of democratic transition.},

Abstract = {There is a joint development towards Europeanisation of public policies
   and an increasing visibility and politicisation of European issues in EU
   member states. In this context, the degree of fit between individuals'
   policy preferences and European norms could be expected to influence
   support for the EU: this support might increase when Europeanisation
   makes the desired policies more likely, and decrease when it hinders
   these policies. Multilevel analyses of the 2014 wave of the European
   Election Study confirms the existence of such instrumental support for
   the EU. The findings demonstrate that this support is shaped by policy
   preferences on state intervention, immigration, moral issues and
   environmental protection. The results also show that the impact of these
   policy preferences is modulated by the level of integration of the
   designated policy, by the weight of the policy issue in the country and,
   in some cases, by the level of individual political knowledge.},

Abstract = {Since the establishment of devolution in 1999, Northern Ireland's
   power-sharing governments have been fragile and prone to crisis.
   However, following a decade of relative stability and cooperation
   between Nationalists and Unionists at Stormont, hopes were high that the
   devolved arrangements had finally become embedded and more resistant to
   collapse. This optimism was dashed when Sinn Fein brought down the
   devolved institutions in January 2017. A snap election once again
   returned the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) and Sinn Fein as the
   largest parties and their inability to form a government resulted in yet
   another political stalemate. This article begins by outlining the
   pattern of political crises in Northern Ireland and assesses both the
   trigger factors and the responses. It then goes beyond the most obvious
   explanation for this continuing instabilitythat of the deep sectarian
   based divisionsand points to a number of other reasons for the
   volatility. These include issues such as the incomplete implementation
   of previous agreements, the impact of broader UK policies and the shadow
   of Direct Rule.},

Title = {What to do with Western Universalisms? Some Remarks concerning the
   ``Decolonial Turn{''}},
Journal = {ANALECTA POLITICA},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {7},
Number = {13},
Pages = {249-272},
Month = {JUL-DEC},
Abstract = {Some academic circles in Latin America support the idea that the main
   purpose of a ``decolonial theory{''} is to denounce eurocentrism. Such
   circles also argue that ``decolonization{''} of social sciences, art,
   and philosophy consists in the recovery of the ancient knowledge of
   indigenous and afro-descendant communities. Finally, they state that the
   purpose of a critical theory ``pursued in Latin America{''} would
   consist in denying any aspiration for universality. In this paper, I
   would like to present some arguments that question such positions.
   First, I will ask if it is possible to consider cultural identities
   within particularism. Then, I will address the issue of eurocentrism in
   order to clarify to what kind of phenomena this term might apply.
   Afterwards, I will address the issue of universalism by showing that
   emancipation politics cannot give up the gesture of the universalization
   of interests. In the end, I would like to express some thoughts
   concerning the idea of ``transmodernism{''}, which was developed in
   Latin America by the Argentinian philosopher Enrique Dussel.},

Abstract = {The ride-hailing company Uber has achieved extremely rapid global
   expansion by means of outmanoeuvring governments, regulators and
   competitors. The rise of the company has been based on a deliberate
   strategy of acting as a market disruptive innovator through a user
   friendly technology and making use of the sharing economy'. These
   attributes are not unique, but are distinctively augmented by a
   relentless expansionary ambition and an ability to maintain the capacity
   to innovate. Uber has generated great political controversy, but the
   challenge for governments and regulators is to embrace the benefits of
   the disruptive innovator, while adopting an approach that takes into
   account the full range of impacts. For Uber, the challenge is to
   maintain its expansionary style as a disruptive innovator, while also
   redefining on its terms the political and public debate. The case study
   of London provides important insights into the dynamics of these
   processes.},

Journal = {PARLIAMENTARY AFFAIRS},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {70},
Number = {3},
Pages = {530-547},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {As in other countries, the Spanish upper chamber is facing harsh
   criticisms. It has failed to fulfil its constitutional task as a chamber
   of territorial representation. Notwithstanding a number of proposed
   reforms, the Senado has remained almost unchanged since its creation in
   1978. So why is it so difficult to restructure this chamber? This
   research aims to explain the impasse of the reform of the Senate through
   evaluating three approaches. After stressing the qualities and defects
   of the legal inheritance and party bargaining frameworks, this article
   argues that the joint-decision trap perspective can help to understand
   the two-fold dynamic of institutional obstruction and incremental change
   that has affected the Spanish Senate for the last 20 years.},

Abstract = {This article describes the collection of views from political science
   alumni via a web-based survey as a central part of efforts to review and
   improve the curriculum and the broader political science program at a
   public university. Based on the literature and on interviews with
   faculty members and former students, we iteratively constructed a
   questionnaire containing five categories of items: program structure,
   content/knowledge, skills, outcomes, and learning environment. These
   categories were intended to capture curricular elements and outcomes
   that include but extend beyond employment and professional-skill
   attainment. Graduate students contributed in meaningful ways to the
   effort through a research-methods course. The article discusses how
   results of the survey fed into the curriculum-revision process
   specifically and program review and assessment considerations more
   generally.},

Abstract = {Political realism criticises the putative abstraction, foundationalism
   and neglect of the agonistic dimension of political practice in the work
   of John Rawls. This paper argues that had Rawls not fully specified the
   implementation of his theory of justice in one particular form of
   political economy then he would be vulnerable to a realist critique. But
   he did present such an implementation: a property-owning democracy. An
   appreciation of Rawls s specificationist method undercuts the realist
   critique of his conception of justice as fairness.},

Abstract = {Trade relations between China and the United States continue to
   strengthen. Meanwhile, widening bilateral imbalance persists, as China
   becomes increasingly central in the Asian production network. New trends

   have weakened in relative terms and the importance of process trade
   declined. China's surging trade surplus is increasingly domestically
   originated. Bilateral economic relations face many challenges,

Abstract = {Political trust is an important indicator of regime support. However, we
   have yet to fully understand the sources and consequence of varying
   levels of trust in specific political institutions. Difference in
   political trust at national and local levels is especially important for
   understanding authoritarian systems. Focusing on China, this article
   examines different levels of trust in the central and local governments.
   Building on existing research that consistently finds high central trust
   with lower local trust, this article investigates whether the trust
   sources differ and the consequence on regime support. Using survey data,
   it finds that national economic evaluation is positively associated with
   trust at both levels. Perceived corruption at respective levels is
   negatively correlated with trust. Citizens who use the Internet more
   tend to trust the central government less, while those who perceive high
   quality of public services tend to trust their local governments more.
   However, citizens who trust the central government but distrust their
   local governments tend to show less regime support. This suggests that
   instead of simply blaming local governments for incompetency or
   wrongdoing, citizens' local distrust weakens regime support.},

Abstract = {This article compares and contrasts Gandhi's and Fanon's views on
   violence by placing these ideas within a larger framework of how each
   viewed the Self and its relationship with the Other. I argue in the
   article that Gandhi did not view the Self as clearly separable from the
   Other; the Self was internal to the Other and hence violence to the
   Other would also affect the Self. This was one of the underlying reasons
   behind his adopting a philosophy of non-violence. In the case of Fanon,
   I argue that one can identify a dominant Fanon who makes a clear
   separation between Self and Other in contrast to Gandhi and hence can
   justify violence inflicted on the colonizer. But, the article also
   teases out a marginal or Other Fanon who comes much closer to Gandhi in
   the manner in which he views the Other as implicated within the Self
   particularly through his own lived experience, his activism, his views
   on psychiatry, and his other writings apart from Wretched of the Earth.},

Abstract = {Islamic republic of Iran and Saudi Arabia are identified as two
   effective countries in sub-region of the Persian Gulf, that the radius
   of their influence covers whole great region of the Middle East. The
   relationship between the two countries have been full of tension during
   last decade, and during this period changes of political authorities of
   these countries were not able to improve this relationship. The cause is
   the resources of foreign policy behavior of the two countries,
   historical backgrounds of each country, as well as conflict of interest
   of each in the region of the Persian Gulf and the Middle East. The most
   competition atmosphere between the two countries is inside the three
   climacteric countries of Iraq, Syria and Yemen. Accordingly, the
   prospect of bilateral relations is a consequence of their behaviors in
   the region and also their dealings with these three countries. Three
   scenarios presented regarding the two countries' foreign policy in the
   region can be discussed: efforts to establish governments, attempts to
   maintain political structures of collapsing countries, and finally,
   continuation of current trends that may lead to disintegration of these
   climacteric countries. By studying these scenarios and drivers, blockers
   and their wild cards, this paper considers the second scenario best for
   both countries, which is consistent with their national interests, and
   with the region's history and general situation.},

Abstract = {In Libya high hopes for change, experienced in 2012 and 2013 after
   Muammar Qaddafi was overthrown in 2011 by a civil rebellion following a
   42-year rule, were lost in the civil war which broke out as a result of
   a coup attempt in 2014 by Khalifa Haftar. This article aims to
   investigate the Libyan crisis by taking into consideration the actors
   involved in the crisis, the causes, bottlenecks and the positions of
   regional and international actors. The article argues that the Libyan
   crisis, in a sense, was shaped under the deep impact of the competition
   experienced among the regional actors in the Arab World following the
   Arab Spring and suggests that the support for Khalifa Haftar especially
   provided by some of the countries in the region deepened the Libyan
   crisis and prevented the Presidential Council established under the
   leadership of UN Libya Mission from guiding the political transition
   process in Libya.},

Abstract = {What determines whether militaries will defect from authoritarian
   incumbents during regime crises? Variance in military behavior in the
   Arab Spring has given rise to a debate around this issue. This article
   highlights weaknesses of the dominant explanation and develops an
   alternative account of military behavior in endgame scenarios'. If
   militaries are politicized institutions that play a major role in
   regulating access to power under authoritarianism, they are more likely
   to intervene during normal times, but less likely to defect during mass
   uprisings. I quantitatively test this argument against data on military
   coups between 1975 and 2000 drawing on a new variable that allows me to
   explicitly model the impact of major regime crises. I illustrate the
   emergence of different forms of political-military relations and their
   consequences in the Arab Spring by drawing on evidence from Syria,
   Egypt, and Tunisia.},

Abstract = {The 2016 referendum in Northern Ireland on the United Kingdom's
   membership of the European Union took place in the familiar context of
   historic and political divides. At the same time, perspectives on
   European integration, long-standing and evolving, were to the fore as
   political parties, lobby groups and various organisations campaigned
   around key issues such as the economic impact, migration, sovereignty,
   North-South relations, the reintroduction of a hard' border and the EU
   budget. The Remain campaigners in Northern Ireland were successful in
   winning the overall majority of votes cast but they found themselves on
   the losing side of the overall UK result. With a 62.69 per cent turnout,
   the outcome in Northern Ireland saw 55.8 per cent voting to remain and
   44.2 per cent voting for the UK to leave the EU. This article draws on
   campaign literature, party activity, media coverage, governmental and
   specialist reports to assess the run up to, the result and the aftermath
   of the vote in Northern Ireland.},

Abstract = {This paper investigates the financialization of regions in the European
   Union. It zooms in on the regional level and provides and systemic and
   macrostructural analysis of the factors that account an increase in
   finance and insurance activities. Theoretically, the argument highlights
   the crucial importance of various forms of indebtedness as the social,
   economic and political relationship that constitutes financialization
   processes. Empirically, the paper stresses the subnational dimension and
   thus contributes to fill an important, yet largely underappreciated gap
   in the political economy of finance. In order to fully grasp the extent
   to which financialization has transformed capitalism throughout the last
   three decades, it seems indispensable to include regions into the
   analysis. By injecting geography into the political economic debate, the
   paper might animate future research and a renewed discussion on regional
   specificities.},

Abstract = {The aim of this text is to undertake a state-of-the-art review of
   contemporary political theory. To this end, I will contribute
   systematically to political theory excluding the historical trajectory,
   which I, nevertheless, consider essential. Thus, to achieve this goal, I
   will organize the text in terms of what I regard a three-fold consensus
   to develop a state-of-the-art review of contemporary political theory.
   In the first section, I will show how politics is an unstable object
   that renders political theory a field with fuzzy borders. In the second
   section, I will analyze the different political theory perspectives,
   theories and methods in terms of a radical disagreement. Last, I will
   indicate to what extent political theory emerges from a process of
   institutionalization.},

Abstract = {During the last two decades, scholars from a variety of disciplines have
   argued that civil society is structurally deficient in postcommunist
   countries. Yet why have the seemingly strong, active and mobilised civic
   movements of the transition period become so weak after democracy was
   established? And why have there been diverging political trajectories
   across the postcommunist space if civil society structures were
   universally weak? This article uses a new, broader range of data to show
   that civil societies in Central and Eastern European countries are not
   as feeble as commonly assumed. Many postcommunist countries possess
   vigorous public spheres and active civil society organisations strongly
   connected to transnational civic networks able to shape domestic
   policies. In a series of time-series cross-section models, the article
   shows that broader measures of civic and social institutions are able to
   predict the diverging transition paths among postcommunist regimes, and
   in particular the growing gap between democratic East Central Europe and
   the increasingly authoritarian post-Soviet space.},

Abstract = {The contribution focuses on the fate of the First Republic of Georgia
   (1917-1921), from Karl Kautsky's point of view, and on the German Social
   Democrats' changing view of the October Revolution. Starting out from
   the dictum: ``Who addresses Stalin, must also address Lenin, who speaks
   of Stalinist crimes, must also discuss the October Revolution{''},
   Kautsky's view of the ``Menshevist{''} Social Democratic Workers Party,
   which ruled Georgia between 1917 and 1921 and was the German Social
   Democrats' ``brother party{''}, and of the ``Social Democratic Farmers
   Republic of Georgia{''} and its sad end is presented. For Kautsky, the
   fate of Georgia was exemplary evidence for the correctness of his
   scathing criticism of the Bolshevik ``October putsch{''} which, as he
   said, had annihilated the achievements of the February Revolution.},

Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Although the welfare state is a core theme in most national elections in
   Western democracies, surprisingly little attention has been paid to the
   causes of welfare state pledge-breaking. This article presents an
   argument that explains when governments do not do what they promised and
   tests it using an innovative research design with data covering four
   decades and 18 countries. The argument is able to account for several
   important but, until now, undescribed phenomena. First, nowadays,
   governments, on average, deliver less welfare than they promised,
   whereas in the 1970s they used to deliver more than promised. Second,
   the pledge-breaking of governments has become highly dependent on the
   parliamentary opposition's position on the welfare issue. When the
   opposition favours fiscal and economic responsibility, governments'
   tendency to deliver less welfare than promised is amplified. In
   contrast, when the opposition emphasises the positive benefits of
   generous welfare, such as equality and social justice, governments
   become more prone to keep their promises. Third, this conditional effect
   of the opposition is a recent occurrence that only emerged after the
   number of potential swing voters increased as class-based voting
   gradually declined from the 1970s onwards.},

Abstract = {Although theoretically contentious, most empirical studies contend that
   electoral-political factors structure the welfare state. In practice,
   most studies concentrate on government partisanship', that is the
   ideological character of the government. We agree that politics matters
   but also seek to expand our understanding of what politics' should be
   taken to mean. Drawing on recent comparative research on agenda-setting,
   we study the impact of whether welfare state issues were broadly salient
   in the public sphere during the election campaign that produced the
   government. We formulate hypotheses about how such systemic campaign
   salience and government partisanship (separately and interactively)
   affect welfare generosity. We also consider how such effects might have
   changed, taking into account challenges to standard assumptions of
   representative democracy coming from the new politics of the welfare
   state' framework. We combine well-known, but updated, data on welfare
   state generosity and government partisanship, with original contextual
   data on campaign salience from 16 West European countries for the years
   1980-2008. We find that campaigns matter but also that their impact has
   changed. During the first half of the examined period (the 1980s and
   early 1990s), it mainly served to facilitate government partisanship
   effects on the welfare state. More recently, big-time campaign attention
   to welfare state issues results in some retrenchment (almost) regardless
   of who forms the postelection government. This raises concerns about the
   democratic status of the politics of welfare state reform in Europe.},

Abstract = {In this paper we try to present some of the proposals of Machiavelli on
   politics and government. We are encouraged by the debate between his
   thought and its exegetes more than five hundred years after the
   publication of Il principe and the first pages of Discorsi sopra la
   prima deca di Tito Livio. From a methodological perspective, they are
   part of Machiavelli's attempt to think the political reality of
   fifteenthcentury Italy considering the specific problems that emerge
   between the idea of government and his own political experience. This
   choice reflects the government as the core concept of the definition of
   his own political experience. For Machiavelli, and this is the thesis
   here studies, the role of government constitutes the specific dimension
   of political science; it represents the constant element of its varied
   phenomenology. In addition, his commitment with governmental actions is
   the proof of a practical and theoretical vision of politics, defined in
   terms of need and chance.},

Abstract = {African countries have warmed up to foreign direct investment (FDI) in
   the past two decades. In an attempt to attract more FDI, most countries
   have reformed their FDI policies and institutions. However, the national
   structures governing FDI have not been studied in-depth. This
   policy-science research uses a unique conceptual framework and an
   institutionalist approach to expose and critique national policies and
   institutions for FDI in Africa. The current African structures governing
   FDI reflect a messy web, difficult to decipher and inadequate to form a
   foundation for a continental regime. Policy learning and structural
   convergence may be essential for better FDI governance.},

Abstract = {This article systematically investigates the relationship between
   internet use and protests in authoritarian states and democracies. It
   argues that unlike in democracies, internet use has facilitated the
   occurrence of protests in authoritarian regimes, developing a
   theoretical rationale for this claim and substantiating it with robust
   empirical evidence. The article argues that whereas information could
   already flow relatively freely in democracies, the use of the internet
   has increased access to information in authoritarian regimes despite
   authoritarian attempts to control cyberspace. The article suggests this
   increased access to information positively affects protesting in
   authoritarian states via four complementary causal pathways: (1) by
   reducing the communication costs for oppositional movements; (2) by
   instigating attitudinal change; (3) decreasing the informational
   uncertainty for potential protesters; and (4) through the mobilizing
   effect of the spread of dramatic videos and images. These causal
   pathways are illustrated using anecdotal evidence from the Tunisian
   revolution (2010-2011). The general claim that internet use has
   facilitated the occurrence of protests under authoritarian rule is
   systematically tested in a global quantitative study using country-year
   data from 1990 to 2013. Internet use increases the expected number of
   protests in authoritarian states as hypothesized. This effect remains
   robust across a number of model specifications.},
