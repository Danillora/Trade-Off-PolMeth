Abstract = {Keith Dowding's book is a tour de force through some important debates
   in the philosophy of the social sciences. In this short comment I focus
   on the role of explanation and how (if at all) causation is or should be
   related to explanation in political science. By appealing to the
   difference between predictive and explanatory power, I critically engage
   with Dowding's proposal that explanation is the reduction of surprise.
   This leads me to a brief detour to the philosophy of models before I
   return to the issue of causation, especially the difference between
   causation as dependence and causation as production and how this
   distinction can inform methodological debates in political science.},

Abstract = {Gender diversity is good for the study of international relations (IR)
   and political science. Graduate training is an opportunity for scholars
   to affect the demographics of their field and the gendered practices
   within it. This article presents a first-cut investigation of the degree
   to which gender bias exists in graduate IR syllabi. The author found
   that the gender of the instructor for graduate courses matters
   significantly for what type of research is taught, in two ways. First,
   on average, female instructors assign significantly more research by
   female authors than male instructors. Second, women appear to be
   considerably more reluctant than men about assigning their own research
   as required readings. Some but not all of the difference between
   male-and female-taught courses might be explained by differences in
   course composition.},

Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Van Deth's comprehensive `conceptual map of political participation' has
   reinstated a lively debate about the concept of political participation,
   and provides some compelling solutions to it. However, an important
   question that has been raised is whether van Deth's map actually
   achieves its main goal of unambiguously identifying and classifying
   emerging, complex types of participation, like online political activism
   - or lifestyle politics. To contribute to this debate, this article aims
   to evaluate the usefulness of van Deth's approach for the analysis of
   lifestyle politics. Such an evaluation requires a clear classification
   of lifestyle politics. This, however, is still missing from the
   literature. The second aim of this article, therefore, is to identify
   and classify different types of lifestyle politics. On the basis of a
   literature review, this article argues that lifestyle politics are often
   enacted throughout different private, public and institutional arenas,
   and that they are often targeted at various social, economic and
   political actors at once. Applying van Deth's conceptual map to these
   empirical realities, then, suggests that it cannot always account for
   their complexity sufficiently. Therefore, this article proposes a
   modification of van Deth's framework that increases its usefulness for
   analyzing emerging, complex political participation repertoires.},

Abstract = {This article will argue that at the heart of the governance failures of
   many African independence and liberation movements turned governments
   was, and still is, their inability to effectively transform from
   resistance movements into effective democratic governing parties. Many
   African independence and liberation movements often have inherent
   organisational, ideological and historical inefficiencies - which in the
   context of an independence and liberation struggle were often strengths,
   but once in government reinforce anti-democratic practices. This essay
   reflects on the culture' of African independence and liberation
   movements, which it argues is replicated within the state. It further
   argues that this culture' undermines these movements' ability to build
   viable, quality and lasting democracies in the countries they govern and
   should therefore be transformed for improved governance.},

Abstract = {Members of the British Labour party have, not for the first time,
   criticised the Boundary Commissions' proposals for new constituency
   boundaries as gerrymandering. This represents a misuse of the term: the
   Commissions have produced recommended constituencies in the context of
   new rules for such redistributions that give precedence to equality of
   electorates across all seats and the boundaries of those constituencies
   have been defined without any reference to the likely electoral
   consequences. The Conservatives, who were responsible for the change in
   the rules to emphasise electoral equality, wanted to remove a
   decades-long Labour advantage in the translation of votes into seats
   because of variations in constituency size, and the Commissions'
   implementation of those rules has achieved that. A Labour advantage has
   been removed but not replaced by a Conservative advantage: in terms of
   electoral equality between the two, the playing field has been levelled.
   Labour's claim to have been disadvantaged by decisions on the electoral
   register is also examined; the disadvantage is probably only small.},

Abstract = {The British and Canadian Parliaments have no legal control over military
   deployment decisions. Recently, however, governments in both countries
   have held votes in the House of Commons on expeditionary missions
   involving combat. In the United Kingdom, this has led to a convention of
   legislative control of the executive's prerogative to deploy the armed
   forces. In Canada, the votes have benefited and enabled the executive,
   rather than strengthening legislative control. Using Mahoney and
   Thelen's (2010) theory of gradual institutional change, this article
   analyses how and why war prerogative reforms in the United Kingdom and
   Canada have resulted in different outcomes.},

Month = {APR-JUN},
Abstract = {Enns et al. respond to recent work by Grant and Lebo and Lebo and Grant
   that raises a number of concerns with political scientists' use of the
   general error correction model (GECM). While agreeing with the
   particular rules one should apply when using unit root data in the GECM,
   Enns et al. still advocate procedures that will lead researchers astray.
   Most especially, they fail to recognize the difficulty in interpreting
   the GECM's ``error correction coefficient.{''} Without being certain of
   the univariate properties of one's data it is extremely difficult (or
   perhaps impossible) to know whether or not cointegration exists and
   error correction is occurring. We demonstrate the crucial differences
   for the GECM between having evidence of a unit root (from Dickey-Fuller
   tests) versus actually having a unit root. Looking at simulations and
   two applied examples we show how overblown findings of error correction
   await the uncareful researcher.},

Abstract = {This essay argues that Plato's Republic includes a widely overlooked
   meditation on the affective dimension of political judgment. This
   meditation occurs in the passages on music. In music, Plato identifies
   the possibility of an extra-rational aesthetic activity that prepares
   the soul for reasoned judgment: he makes musical mimesis the
   precondition to logos (speech, reasoned account) because of its ability
   to actualize in the soul the very ethos required of sound judgment.
   Music is able to do this because it is not imagistic; music does not
   produce mediated representations but rather produces alterations in the
   condition of the soul itself. These alterations are made possible
   because the soul itself is structured musically. If music actualizes the
   conditions of the soul, so too does the soul instantiate the conditions
   of music. In his treatment of musical mimesis, Plato thereby makes
   disposition, or affect, the defining feature of sound judgment.},

   Discrimination in Local Elections in Britain},
Journal = {BRITISH JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {47},
Number = {2},
Pages = {413-435},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {This article examines the relationship between candidate names as they
   appear on the ballot paper and voting patterns in British local
   elections. Specifically, it explores whether some voters favour
   candidates with British-sounding names over those whose names suggest
   either European or non-European ethnic origins. Name classification
   software identifies three categories of candidate: British, other
   European and non-European. Separate analyses of aggregate voting data
   are undertaken of multi-member and single-member electoral districts.
   Data cover the period 1973-2012, and votes for more than 400,000
   candidates are examined. In multi-member districts, after comparing
   within-party slates and finishing order generally, candidates whose
   surnames suggest a British ethnic origin perform best, while
   non-Europeans attract fewer votes. The analysis of single-member
   districts focuses on a party's vote share after taking into account the
   pattern of candidate recruitment across electoral cycles. It shows that
   vote share is adversely affected when British candidates are replaced by
   those with European and non-European surnames, while the opposite
   pattern of succession is associated with a boost in votes. It is clear
   that the outcome of some elections has been determined by the parties'
   choice of candidates.},

Title = {So who really does the donkey work in `multi-speed membership parties'?
   Comparing the election campaign activity of party members and party
   supporters},
Journal = {ELECTORAL STUDIES},
Year = {2017},

Abstract = {One of the traditional functions of party members is to campaign on
   behalf of their party at general elections. However, they are not the
   only people who volunteer for the job. In the context of the growing
   literature on `multi-speed membership' parties, it is important to ask
   what non-members do for parties they support. This paper examines how
   different actors contributed to the electoral campaigns of six parties
   at the 2015 UK General Election, using survey data covering not only
   members of the Labour, Conservative, Liberal Democrat, United Kingdom
   Independence, Scottish Nationalist, and Green parties, but also voters
   who identified themselves as being close to one of those parties but did
   not formally belong to them. As well as exploring how much work they do
   during campaigns, we ask whether the two groups choose different
   activities and are differently motivated. We find that, at the
   individual level, party members do more than non-member supporters, and
   that this is especially true of more intensive forms of activity. We
   also find that constituency context and political attitudes influence
   levels of activity in similar ways for members and supporters. However,
   we find no consistent impact from demographic factors or ideological
   incongruence. At the aggregate level, we estimate that the campaign work
   done by supporters may match or even exceed that done by party members.

Abstract = {This paper examines truth and reconciliation processes in stable,
   democratic societies. Its focus is on the work of the Truth and
   Reconciliation Commission of Canada, which assumed that historical
   knowledge can lead directly to new understanding and then to
   reconciliation, a social change involving improved relations between
   Aboriginal and other peoples. The paper argues that institutions such as
   the Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada - here called
   discursive institutions - require more careful explanations of how
   discourse might be related to change. Discursive institutions mobilize
   prior orientations and existing social, cultural and institutional
   levers for change; they do not create new mechanisms for doing so.},

Abstract = {This analysis challenges the consensus that, in post-war Italy the
   Catholic party {[}Democrazia Cristiana (Dc)], actively supported by the
   Catholic Church, fostered a process of vote nationalization. The paper,
   drawing upon a more fine-grained level of analysis, different
   statistical measures, and within and across regional models, provides a
   more nuanced interpretation. According to our analysis, although the Dc
   effectively acted as a homogenizing agent until the late 1970s, after
   that decade the processes of modernization and secularization fostered
   the decline of religious-based politics, and of the Dc itself. Such
   decline opened the way for the re-emergence of a territorial cleavage
   and a consequent dis-homogenization of Italian electoral politics. The
   paper demonstrated that the impact of modernization and secularization
   on the vote for the Catholic party is more significant considering the
   five Italy's geo-political areas rather than the country as a whole.
   Moreover, the divergent path in the five areas testifies the
   re-emergence of territory in the Italian electoral behaviour.
   Territorial heterogeneity, modernization, and secularization were
   central to the collapse of the Dc.},

Abstract = {The ascendency of immigration as an issue in elections has been
   concomitant with massive increases in the Hispanic population in the
   U.S. We examine how immigration cues prompt greater or lesser levels of
   restrictionist sentiment among individuals, showing demographic context
   conditions the effect of candidates cues. Using data from the 2010 U.S.
   House elections, we illustrate cues presented in new destination states-
   states with massive increases in the size of the Hispanic population
   from 1990 to 2010-have a larger impact on individuals' immigration
   preferences than cues presented in non-new destination contexts. We show
   candidates with more extreme immigration positions are more likely to
   prioritize the issue of immigration in their campaigns, suggesting
   campaign prioritization of immigration has a directional cue. We
   conclude these directional cues from Republican candidates in new
   destination contexts move individual attitudes toward restrictionist
   preferences.},

Abstract = {The place of reconciliation in processes of conflict transformation is a
   deeply contested political issue. Reconciliation has played differing
   strategic roles in a variety of conflictual contexts. In some instances,
   such as Northern Ireland in the 1990s, the demands of reconciliation and
   the pursuit of truth seemed a step too far in the process of reducing
   political violence. In others, such as South Africa, it was a pivotal
   part of the transformative dynamic offering hope for a more unified
   post-apartheid settlement. Meanwhile in contemporary Australia, the idea
   of reconciliation continues to provide a rhetorical framing for the
   renegotiation of indigenous politics. This paper analyses these
   differing approaches to and uses of reconciliation and contends that
   they are underpinned by political narratives which invoke emotions of
   fear, hope and disappointment. This suggests that understanding these
   sentiments is fundamental to addressing the temporal challenges of the
   politics of reconciliation and the structural-agential dynamics of
   conflict transformation.},

Abstract = {Over the last several decades, scholars have lamented the lack of a
   clear definition of genocide, and many have then proposed one of their
   own in an attempt to fill this gap. The majority of the definitions put
   forward, and the discomfort from which they arise, express an explicit
   or implicit attachment to essentialism, the assumption that the
   definition need reflect, in an unadulterated fashion, the objective
   reality out in the world. In other words, many take our failure to
   settle on a single definition of genocide across fields as a sign that
   we don't yet know what it is. We seem to want to know not so much what
   genocide means to us and how this construct might be more useful in our
   attempts to create a better world, but rather, what it really is at its
   core. In what follows, we will examine our ongoing attachment to
   essentialist understandings of genocide, some of the problems that arise
   as a result, how we have attempted to free ourselves from this approach,
   and how we might go further in doing so.},

Abstract = {Given the relativity principle of contracts their impacts in proportion
   to third parties are an exceptional issue. In a possible assumption
   there is a possibility of harm and damage to a third party because of
   the contract between two people. In our juridical texts, some religious
   experts have sporadically in a topic of jurisprudence stated the
   instances of these contracts and have considered two theories of
   validity and invalidity about them. On the basis of this assumption,
   although the law of the way of implementing financial sentences
   considered hanged in 2014 but its 21st article with a bit of expansion
   has considered the former result. Therefore concerning these contracts
   by considering the valuable rule of the principle of no harm, we can
   accept the theory of relative lack of influence. Given the importance
   and role of the contracts in the life of community members and the lack
   of determining the influence of such contracts in legal and juridical
   texts the analysis of these impacts seems to be necessary. In the
   present article by analyzing the subject in legal and juridical texts of
   Iran the influence of these contracts in the relation between the
   parties and in proportion to third party is analyzed.},

Abstract = {The first and foremost task of all governments is to make decisions.
   Consequently, studies on governments should deal above all with their
   ability to produce legislation. To this respect, this article analyses
   the legislative productivity of 112 parliamentary governments in 12
   Western European democracies (Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland,
   Germany, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Spain, Sweden and
   United Kingdom) from 1990 to 2013. My independent variable is an index
   offering an immediate picture of the decision-making potential of
   parliamentary governments, while the dependent variable is the `
   detailed' legislative production of those governments. If we are able to
   differentiate between governments who decide, and governments who do
   not, we could answer a considerable number of interesting questions:
   which Western European parliamentary democracies tend to produce more
   (detailed) laws and which-on the contrary are used to facing greater
   difficulties for achieving that goal? What are the reasons behind these
   opposing trends? The empirical results largely confirms that the more a
   parliamentary government has got decision-making potential (in terms of
   the proposed index), the more likely it will pass `detailed'
   legislation.},

Abstract = {The majority of the 26-year contemporary Russia-West relationship has
   been a mixed bag of mutual accusations, occasional crises, and rocky
   cooperation. What Russian President Vladimir Putin called the ``Crimea
   Spring{''} of 2014 dramatically shifted Russia's political thinking
   regarding its relations with the West, and set the course of the
   country's foreign policy toward ensuring a ``post-West world order.{''}
   The contours of the ``new world{''} are merely being outlined, but it in
   any case implies greater interaction with ``non-Western{''} states for
   Russia. Turkey has been a core player in this regard and historically
   one of Russia's best ``frenemies.{''} Engaging with Ankara has not
   proven easy, but Moscow seems to be positive that it is an inevitable
   must for any future security arrangement.},

Title = {Representing the national economic agenda in Latin America: Variation by
   fat and lean times and party brands},
Journal = {ELECTORAL STUDIES},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {45},
Pages = {208-218},

Abstract = {Representation is greater when legislators and voters agree on the
   national agenda. Under what conditions are higher degrees of ``issue
   priority representation{''} more likely? Our answer focuses on economic
   conditions and party branding dynamics, and the case of Latin America.
   With mass and elite survey data we show that economic hard times and
   left-leaning preferences increase the prioritization of economic issues.
   We likewise document fairly high levels of economic issue priority
   representation in most of Latin America. From the perspective of
   democratic quality, evidence of representation in this domain is good
   news; yet, variation does exist. Consistent with our argument that party
   branding dynamics matter, we find that leftist and centrist parties tend
   to over-prioritize economic issues relative to their supporters, and the
   reverse for rightist parties. Further, we find a significant interaction
   between economic conditions and the ideological brand of parties: in
   economic downturns the left and the center are more likely to express a
   strong commitment to economic performance, whereas the right is less
   responsive to lean times. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {The EJPR article A rising generation of Europeans?' provided systematic
   evidence for the existence of generational differences in attitudes
   towards the European Union (EU). In this research note, it is argued
   that identifying generational differences in specifically affective
   orientations is the crucial issue for the future of the EU. Drawing on
   and extending the earlier work expectations in respect to generational
   and life-cycle differences in affective orientations are developed and
   tested, highlighting the existence of the former, their consistency
   across a range of indicators, and the absence of the latter. The results
   are an important counterpoint to the growth in ambivalence in attitudes
   towards the EU.},

Journal = {EUROPEAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW},

Abstract = {The study of clientelism has pointed in the direction of a pyramid
   structure in which selective benefits are distributed with the help of
   brokers to individuals or groups in exchange for political support. This
   approach treats the resources aimed to enhance electoral mobilization as
   endogenous and fails to explain what happens when brokers have very low
   capacity. To address these problems this article proposes a
   bi-dimensional model of clientelism that emphasizes the role of
   exogenous resources. Accordingly, the vertical linkage between political
   parties and the electorate is complemented by a horizontal nexus between
   parties and private contributors. In an environment characterized by low
   internal resources, parties involve external actors to get the necessary
   money. To illustrate how this mechanism works we focus on Romania
   between 2008 and 2012, a crucial case for the study of clientelism.},

Abstract = {Given their powerful positions in presidential cabinets, technocrats are
   an important transmission mechanism for explaining economic policy
   choices, but have received less attention compared to other
   well-established channels such as elections or democratic tenure. I
   incorporate the role of technocratic advisors into a domestic
   policymaking framework. Specifically, I contend that left governments
   tend to appoint technocrats, or ministers with mainstream economics
   training, to signal their commitment to sound governance to the
   electorate. This partisan technocratic pattern, however, is conditioned
   by a country's place in its business cycle. During periods of high
   growth, left governments are more likely to align with their partisan
   preferences and appoint heterodox advisors that drift from fiscal
   discipline. Employing an originally constructed data index, the Index of
   Economic Advisors, I conduct a statistical test of 16 Latin American
   countries from 1960 to 2011, finding partisan shifts in technocratic
   appointments and fiscal governance that are conditioned by national
   business cycles. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

   (Part II): conformity and remedies for lack of conformity},

Abstract = {This article aims to critically analyse the two proposals for Directives
   that the European Commission launched on 9 December 2015: the Online
   Sales Directive and the Digital Content Directive. Both proposals are
   part of the Digital Single Market Strategy for Europe. Their main
   objective is to eliminate one of the barriers to cross-border trade:
   differences in contract law between Member States. This article is
   structured in two parts, published separately. This second part of the
   article highlights the most significant rules governing conformity and
   the remedies for lack of such conformity with regard to each proposed
   Directive. It also raises questions as to the justification of their
   particular format. It can be concluded that the Online Sales Directive
   introduces some improvements and clarifications to the Consumer Sales
   Directive that will either increase or maintain the current level of
   consumer protection in most Member States. Nevertheless, in some Member
   States the Online Sales Directive will undoubtedly lead to a reduction
   in the existing level of protection. The Digital Content Directive rules
   on conformity and the remedies for lack of conformity of digital content
   also raise some significant issues. It can be argued that some rules
   need to be clarified or revised. They include the rule under which
   contractual terms take precedence over objective criteria when assessing
   the conformity of digital content and the provision on damages that
   limits the consumer's right to seek compensation for damages incurred in
   their digital environment.},

Abstract = {The 2016 parliamentary elections in Slovakia brought important changes
   to the composition of parliament and resulted in an innovative
   four-party government. The leftist Smer-SD came on top but suffered
   substantial losses compared to 2012. It managed to form a government
   with three other parties, one of them representing the traditional
   Slovak nationalists while another being the leading representative of
   Slovakia's largest ethnic minority. The new coalition government
   downplays its internal divisions and claims it can provide stability in
   difficult international political situations, innovative policies in
   fighting corruption, and rejection of political extremism and
   radicalism. The opposition is fragmented and divided: it is composed of
   the two new radical right parties and two more moderate
   conservative-liberal groupings. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {Although many African governments introduced provisions for subnational
   elections in the early 1990s, there is variation in the extent to which
   these reforms were implemented and sustained. Our inductive analysis of
   three post-conflict cases - Angola, Ethiopia and South Africa - suggests
   that one factor explaining this variation is elite discontinuity when an
   insurgent group wins power in the aftermath of conflict. Systems of
   subnational elections adopted by new governments with an extensive
   social base derived from an insurgency, as in South Africa and Ethiopia,
   have proved relatively robust. By contrast, in Angola, where there was
   no change of executive power after the conflict ended, routinised
   subnational elections have not been implemented. The identified causal
   mechanism is that, for the new governments in the first two cases,
   subnational elections served as opportunities to mobilise party support
   and to consolidate control by sidelining local elites aligned with the
   previous regime.},

Journal = {AUSTRIAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {46},
Number = {1},
Pages = {83-88},
Abstract = {This contribution takes a look at the phenomenon of `gender-nationalism
   `. It argues that references about gender equality and women's rights
   play an important role in contemporary politics of belonging: these
   references are used as boundary markers in nationalist narratives,
   constructing the self versus the immigrant other. The contribution
   traces the emergence of this phenomenon in Europe, and focuses on its
   occurrence in recent debates. It concludes that whilst gender equality
   is a crucial claim that needs to be upheld in the public sphere, we also
   need to pay attention to intersectional mechanisms of exclusion and
   oppression which are at play in contemporary versions of gender
   nationalism.},

Abstract = {The press was assumed as a means of mass communication since the
   mid-twentieth century, however, its role transcended as an educational
   mechanism to incorporate the discourse of a particular political party,
   in this case, the corresponding to the Liberal Party, as a pedagogical
   strategy to educate the electorate politically. El Diario de Pereira and
   Vanguardia Liberal de Bucaramanga emerged as bastions of liberalism.
   Through their pages they communicated to their followers the need to
   strengthen democracy, but the decades of the 30s and 40s of the 20th
   century will be marked by the defense of the ``rag{''}. The emergence of
   violence was fostered by the iron defense of the color blue or red in
   the midst of the intransigence of the Catholic Church and the political
   and ``civilizing{''} role played by the main newspapers of the country.},

Abstract = {The objective of the present research is to find the level of incidence
   of innovation on the foreign trade in San Luis Potosi based on three
   variables: Research \& Development (R\&D), Foreign Direct Investment
   (IED) and technological conduct. The study was based in a qualitative
   approach given the lack of statistical information that would allow a
   meaningful quantitative analysis. The study was carried out from
   interviews with semi-structured questions made to a panel of experts of
   three sectors: academic, governmental and private. The information
   obtained was analyzed with Atlas TI in order to understand the way that
   innovation impacts on foreign trade in San Luis Potosi. Results show
   that innovation has not played an important role in the performance of
   foreign trade in San Luis Potosi therefore, the State is more
   susceptible to international political changes that limit trade with the
   main current trading partners.},

Abstract = {This article presents biographies of three activists of the Student
   Islamic Movement of India (SIMI). Following 9/11, the Indian state
   banned SIMI for fomenting ``terrorism{''}, ``sedition{''} and
   ``destroying Indian nationalism{''}. Of the three SIMI activists, Qasim
   Omar had spent 30 months in prison and Samin Patel, a US citizen of
   Indian origin, 27 months. Both these prominent SIMI leaders were charged
   with denigrating the photo of India's flag and making provocative
   speeches. I interviewed them after their release. The third was an
   ordinary (non-office bearer) activist. Drawing on their biographies, I
   argue that Islamist radicalism or ``terrorism{''} should be construed
   politically. Contrary to the prevalent politics, the pivot of which is
   bare rationality of profit and loss and ruthless pursuit of national
   interests, the kind of politics SIMI actors enact is best understood as
   a profound act of ethics manifest in the quest for justice. As such,
   they are not enemies of freedom, democracy and human rights; on the
   contrary, activists such as those in SIMI strive to rescue freedom and
   human rights from being monopolised and molested by the mighty few and
   thereby truly universalise them. Against methodological nationalism, I
   take the postWorld War II global order as the human condition in which
   to situate the radical politics of these young SIMI activists.},

Abstract = {The article considers from the perspective of Political Science and
   Economics the problem of ``development traps{''} - mechanisms that block
   welfare growth in backward countries and preclude their transition to
   the category of prosperous states. On the basis of the existing theories
   such as the ``middle income trap{''}, ``Malthusian trap{''} etc., A.
   Akhremenko, I.Lokshin and Ye.Yureskul offer an integrated approach to
   solving this problem based on total factor productivity (TFP). With the
   support of mathematical models and theoretical constructions, they
   reveal a mechanism of economic growth blocking: the decreasing returns
   to economic productivity from increasing state potential for violence.
   The authors empirically test their hypotheses about the relationship
   between development barriers, political institutions and economic
   productivity on 149 countries across the time span of 1990-2013.},

Journal = {POLIS-POLITICHESKIYE ISSLEDOVANIYA},
Year = {2017},
Number = {2},
Pages = {26-41},
Abstract = {This paper tracks the evolution and interactions of Western policy and
   academic discourses on statehood. With help of scientometrics it
   demonstrates that dynamics and trajectory of conceptualization of these
   terms were first framed by the end of the Cold War and later by the
   terrorist attacks of 9/11. However, the adoption of the first doctrinal
   documents on international engagement in fragile states in 2005
   substantially altered the discourse. Instrumentalization of the `fragile
   state' concept made it subject to a rigorous critique that revealed
   several drawbacks -political bias, normativity, state-centrism
   etc.Seeking to mitigate these limitations, scholars, experts and
   policymakers switched attention from `fragile states' to `states of
   fragility', elaborated multi-dimensional typology of fragility and
   borrowed the `resilience' concept and a number of related terms from the
   theory of complex adaptive systems. These changes -influenced partly by
   geopolitical shifts - might help abandon outdated reductionist
   interpretations of state failure and de-dogmatize the discourse. Use of
   such concepts as `resilience', `stability', `external disruptions',
   `risks' favors a holistic approach to political systems which will take
   into account their complex interactions with the international system
   and the environment. However, it seems highly probable that the new
   concept might suffer from the same drawbacks, such as ambivalence. To
   avoid this risk, scholars will have to develop new techniques of
   measuring resilience of social systems to various kinds of disruptions,
   which, in turn, might help build efficient systems of early warning.},

Abstract = {This study analyzes the uses of the Canadian model by French penal
   critics and reformers since the 2000s. First, in the 2000s, the Canadian
   mixture of recognition of prisoners' rights, risk assessment, and
   correctional classification was seen by French prison reformers as an
   answer to the contradictory demands they were receiving regarding
   improving prisoners' conditions and the safe management of an
   overcrowded prison population. Then, after the 2012 election, the
   Canadian model was used again for its production of expert knowledge on
   the assessment of penal measures, in order to promote non-custodial
   sentences. But the use of Canada as a reference is thwarted by the
   intensity of the politicization of insecurity. Canada is less a model
   than a country facing very similar tensions in the definition of its
   penal policies.},

Abstract = {This article assesses the influence of radical right populist parties on
   policy-making in Europe. Much scientific research has been conducted on
   populism, theoretically and empirically, through different facets: their
   history, their leaders, their discourses, or their electorate. Yet the
   populist phenomenon has barely been studied by policy analysts by policy
   analysis. What influence do populist parties have on policy-making? This
   question is crucial since these parties are on the rise in Europe and
   are often perceived as dangerous for democracy. This article
   investigates the case of the Swiss `Schweizerische Volkspartei' (SVP)
   and analyzes its influence on the policy-making in a typical ` radical
   right populist' issue: law and order. The SVP has always been a member
   of the federal government and even became the first Swiss political
   party at the Lower House in 2003. In addition, its electoral weight was
   strengthened in the recent elections of 2015. To assess its influence,
   SVP electoral pledges (2011-2015) are qualitatively traced through the
   institutional arenas, thanks to a document analysis, interviews
   conducted with elected officials and direct observations. The study
   suggests that the SVP can influence policy-making in the law and order
   sector. However, this influence significantly evolves according to the
   policy-making stage under analysis. Only an indirect influence can be
   exercised by the SVP in order to fully translate its electoral pledges
   into decisions.},

Abstract = {In their transition to college, students often struggle to identify and
   make connections between the main arguments, evidence, and empirical
   findings of articles from academic journals commonly assigned on
   political science syllabi. Which active learning techniques are most
   effective for teaching students to recognize and evaluate social science
   evidence? To address this question, we conducted an experiment with
   students from two first-year writing seminars in political science.
   Students were randomly assigned to either an in-class writing activity
   or a group discussion, both of which required them to summarize an
   article's use of evidence. We find limited evidence that group
   discussions are more effective for teaching students to engage with
   evidence.},

Title = {Why do states change positions in the United Nations General Assembly?},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW},

Abstract = {Many international organizations deal with repeated items on their
   agendas. The United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) is no exception as
   many of its resolutions reoccur over time. A novel dataset on UNGA
   voting on repeated resolutions reveals considerable, but variable,
   amounts of change on resolutions by states over time. To shed light on
   underlying causes for voting (in)consistency, this paper draws on IR
   literature on negotiations and foreign policy changes to develop
   hypotheses on the role of domestic and international constraints. Our
   findings suggest that states with limited financial capacity cannot
   develop their own, principled, voting positions on all norms on the
   negotiation agenda. Consequently, these states can be more flexible in
   adjusting their voting position for reoccurring IO norms and are more
   prone to change their positions over time. Moreover, states with
   constrained decision-makers change position less frequently due to
   pluralistic gridlock. Finally, while large and rich states make a small
   number of purposive vote shifts, poor and aid-recipient states engage in
   serial shifting' on the same resolutions, a finding suggestive of
   vote-buying. The prevalence of position changes suggests that the
   international norm environment may be more fragile and susceptible to a
   revisionist agenda than is commonly assumed.},

Abstract = {Scholars have long been fascinated by the role of international courts
   in the enforcement of international rule of law. They start with a
   foundational question: Can international courts affect how international
   law is implemented? In this review, we lay out four of the most common
   theoretical arguments for why international courts matter. We then
   interrogate these accounts. In particular, we examine their views on how
   much influence courts have and what the likely welfare consequences are
   for the signatories of an agreement. In so doing, we identify critical
   conditions that must obtain for court influence under each of the
   arguments. We then bring more recent scholarship to bear on the
   plausibility of these conditions. In particular, we examine what
   research on the structure of law, the preferences of judges, and
   institutional design implies about the efficacy of international courts
   based on the four foundational arguments. We conclude with suggestions
   for future research.},

Abstract = {In 2016, a scandal that involved President Park Geun-hye and her
   confidante shook the country. Cases of bribery, corruption, nepotism,
   cronyism, illegal persecution of dissenters and so on surfaced.
   Confidence in Park's leadership began to waver when she closed the
   chapter on `comfort women' issue with Japan in December 2015 without
   public consultation. The deal was unacceptable to the Korean public in
   the absence of a formal apology from the Japanese government. The speed
   with which President Park sealed the agreement with the United States to
   deploy Thermal High Altitude Area Defence also took the country by
   surprise. These foreign affairs endeavours have wiped out her diplomatic
   success achieved in 2015.},

Journal = {NEW POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {39},
Number = {3},
Pages = {369-392},
Abstract = {In 2013, Gezi Park housed perhaps the most significant democratic
   protest of the Turkish Republic's history. The Gezi protests have drawn
   the attention of many democratic theorists since then. What is
   surprising about these theorists' commentaries on Gezi is that in none
   of them is it possible to find an account of political practices that
   enabled actors with such different interests and worldviews to act in
   concert during this moment of popular action. This article argues that
   to attend fully to the unique features of events such as Gezi, we need
   to develop an alternative conceptualization of democratic action that
   brings to light such mediatory political practices. To develop that
   alternative, I turn to Aristotle and creatively appropriate his notion
   of ``political friendship.{''} Interpreted as an ethico-political
   notion, which refers to a set of mediating practices, political
   friendship becomes a rich conceptual resource that lays bare the
   dynamics of democratic popular action.},

   concept of nationalism to (re) think the (re) configuration of the State

   government of the Citizens' Revolution granted to national identity, and
   the claim of the material and symbolic values of the nation through the
   country brand, is to understand if this process is aligned with the
   guidelines of the global market, or it is an exercise of nationalism.},

Abstract = {This article critically reviews scholarship on the role of conflict and
   cooperation in conditioning nuclear proliferation. We start by laying
   out the trajectory of scholarship on the causes of proliferation,
   organizing it in three waves: (a) security and (b) nonsecurity drivers
   of proliferation, and (c) supply constraints on nuclear acquisition. We
   then examine the recent turn in the proliferation literature toward a
   strategic interaction approach, focusing on how conflict and cooperation
   between proliferators, their adversaries, and their allies shape the
   spread of nuclear weapons. We argue for an integrated framework for
   analyzing the tools states can deploy to foster or stymie proliferation.
   Finally, we sketch an agenda for research on nuclear proliferation.
   Here, we argue that scholarship should (a) incorporate nonsecurity
   dynamics into the strategic interaction approach to the study of
   proliferation and (b) combine rigorous theory with careful historical
   research to further our understanding of the causes of proliferation.},

Abstract = {The party literature largely agrees on the fact that electoral democracy
   is not in a good shape. Traditional parties have changed and adapted
   themselves to become very much parties of government. And because their
   focus is on government, where for many policies the choices are now
   limited by past decisions and by the demands of other agents like - in
   particular - the European Union, traditional parties fail in their role
   as representatives. This is the gap in which new political parties have
   developed, very much claiming that they do understand and represent
   their electorate better than the old parties. Among new parties though
   the mortality rate is very high. And the research on new parties so far
   does not reveal important transformations in the way in which they
   govern. New political parties are therefore more like the canaries in a
   coalmine. They are very good at signalling the danger. New political
   parties are good indicators of the malaise with democratic governance,
   but so far not the remedy.},

   Observers suspect that he is being persecuted for his work on behalf of
   the victims of political repression. He identifies those who have been
   murdered, who were hastily buried in mass graves on the White Sea-Baltic
   Sea canal. During his time in prison, Yuri Dmitrev was treated
   respectfully. His credo is that any individual who knows their ancestors
   and who is aware of what they achieved for the country must take a
   critical view of any rule.},

Journal = {STUDIES IN SOCIAL JUSTICE},

Volume = {11},
Number = {2, SI},
Pages = {221-237},
Abstract = {In this paper, we explore the relevance of graphic novels to
   understanding and responding to the complex nature of traumatic
   experiences. We argue that graphic narratives of trauma, which combine
   visual images and written text, significantly differ from biomedical and
   legal accounts by presenting the nuances of traumatic experiences that
   escape the conventions of written testimony. Building on the literature
   that integrates social justice concerns with visual methods and graphic
   medicine, we contend that graphic narratives effectively convey the
   complexities of traumatic experiences, including embodied experiences
   that are not always apparent, intelligible, or representable in written
   form, leading to greater social recognition of the dynamics and
   consequences of trauma. To illustrate this claim, we analyze Una's
   Becoming Unbecoming (2015), a graphic novel that explores themes
   relating to trauma and social justice. Una relies on the graphic medium
   to explore the interconnections between personal and collective
   experiences of gender-based violence, and to show how physical embodied
   experience is central to her own experience of trauma. Graphic
   narratives like Becoming Unbecoming also offer a space for addressing
   the emotional, physical and financial costs of survivorship that usually
   are not available in legal written testimonies, potentially leading to
   better justice outcomes for trauma survivors in terms of social
   intelligibility and recognition, and access to social resources for
   healing.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE EDUCATION},

Abstract = {This article demonstrates that the purposeful subject design,
   incorporating a Model United Nations (MUN), facilitated deep learning
   and professional skills attainment in the field of International
   Relations. Deep learning was promoted in subject design by linking
   learning objectives to Anderson and Krathwohl's (2001) four levels of
   knowledge or cognition: factual, conceptual, procedural, and
   metacognitive. Students demonstrated improvement in all four areas;
   however, this article focuses on outcomes in the conceptual and
   metacognitive realms as these were where students showed the most
   growth. In the conceptual realm, the subject aimed to increase students'
   capacity to apply international relations theories. Students tended to
   utilize the traditional theories of realism and liberalism; however,
   their explanations and applications of these theories showed deep
   learning. In the metacognitive realm, students were able to analyze
   their own negotiation styles and to explain how it influenced their
   approach to the Model UN, thus demonstrating strong professional skills
   development and metacognitive growth. Learning was enhanced by the use
   of open access online subject materials and online communications. The
   subject was designed and run in a context where simulations in teaching
   politics and international relations are not common.},

Abstract = {This article examines the issue of democratic deterioration by
   revisiting the Venezuelan case (1974-1998). Using sequence elaboration
   and alternative case-focused theories, it tests and confirms the
   hypothesis that presidential partyarchy was the main contextual
   explanatory factor behind the crisis that led to Venezuela's democratic
   deterioration. Building on elite conflict theory, it also aims to
   integrate previous studies' insights and better explain the timing of
   factors to illustrate how economic presidentialism (the highly
   autonomous executive control of a state-controlled economy) was the main
   mechanism leading to democratic deterioration.},

Abstract = {One might argue that political science has gone further than any other
   social science in developing a rigorous field of study devoted to
   qualitative methods. This review article begins by discussing the
   time-honored qualitative/quantitative distinction. What is qualitative
   data and analysis, and how does it differ from quantitative data and
   analysis? I propose a narrow definition of ``qualitative{''} and explore
   its implications. I also explore in a speculative vein some of the
   factors underlying the ongoing Methodenstreit between scholars who
   identify with quantitative and qualitative approaches to social science.
   In the remainder of the article I discuss areas of qualitative research
   that have been especially fecund over the past decade. These include
   case selection, causal inference, and multimethod research.},

Abstract = {The article presents an overview of the main theoretical approaches to
   judicial politics revealing the impact of institutional and
   non-institutional factors. On the basis of the analysis of the existing
   theoretical models of judicial politics and the relationships between
   the court and key political players, the author hypothesizes that,
   despite common theoretical grounds, there is an important distinction
   between constitutional courts in authoritarian and democratic regimes.
   Under authoritarianism, judges possess fundamentally different
   expectations about the prospects for a regime change and therefore are
   guided by a different yardstick when building internal judicial
   institutions. While under democracies courts have to succumb to
   government needs only in some ad hoc cases, such as at times of highly
   consolidated power, under autocracies this has to be a stable
   institutional solution.},

Abstract = {Many African politics courses rely heavily on readings authored by North
   American and European scholars. Scholarly and primary sources written or
   created by Africans are often underrepresented, and a similar problem
   persists across regionally focused politics courses. Yet a diversity of
   sources and perspectives are essential to providing students with a
   well-rounded understanding of African politics. This article offers a
   brief argument for the pedagogical benefits of increasing the number of
   African-authored materials in African politics courses and provides a
   list of suggested resources for instructors eager to diversify their own
   courses.},

Pages = {606-624},
Abstract = {The neighboring countries of Denmark, Sweden, and Norway represent three
   very similar societies that differ markedly with respect to
   naturalization policy. While the general trend of a civic turn has
   brought about some of Europe's strictest residence and citizenship
   requirements in Denmark, it has left the liberal Swedish policy largely
   untouched and the Norwegian somewhere in between the other two. How
   might such divergence in otherwise very similar societies be explained?
   This article investigates the role different conceptions of nationhood
   have played. It is argued that different conceptions of nationhood have
   mattered, but that the national differences have less to do with the
   normative content of nationhood than with how politicians tend to
   conceive of the integration process that newcomers must commit to in
   order to develop a strong sense of national belonging.},

Journal = {CRITICAL STUDIES ON TERRORISM},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {10},
Number = {1},
Pages = {44-66},
Abstract = {This article illustrates how the well-known norm life cycle model has
   been under-utilised for understanding global political behaviour. The
   model has generally been applied to norms advancing human rights or
   prohibiting certain behaviour. This article uses the norm life cycle,
   modified to account for norm fluidity, to examine a practice which
   enables the state to pursue its security interests, at times by
   violating human rights. Specifically, this study explores variation in
   global responses to targeted killings, with Osama bin Laden's death
   serving as a focal point. These reactions generally range from
   condemnation of targeted killings occurring before his death, to
   widespread acceptance of his death, to subsequent efforts to regulate
   the practice. This article concludes that this variation could be
   understood as consistent with the initial stages of the norm life cycle.
   Through this analysis, the article demonstrates how the norm life cycle
   model can helpfully shed light on very diverse political behaviour.},

Abstract = {While evidence-based policy-making is increasingly in demand, as new
   policies are required to bring effective results to targeted groups in
   South Korea and China, few studies have investigated the progress of
   quantitative impact evaluation that focuses on causality. This paper
   studies the trends of quantitative impact evaluation of public policy in
   South Korea and China by surveying major public administration and
   public policy journals in these two countries from 2000 to 2015. Among
   published articles in the major journals, our study pool includes
   research articles directly related to quantitative impact evaluation.
   Our study found that there has been considerable progress in impact
   evaluation research in South Korea and China in both data quality and
   empirical methods. However, empirical impact evaluation still comprises
   a small fraction (only one to two percent) of all research in public
   administration and public policy in both countries. We also found
   limited discussion on the selection mechanism and related bias in South
   Korea even in recent years, while causality and selection bias have been
   more commonly discussed in China. Also, advanced empirical methods are
   more frequently observed in journal articles in China than those in
   South Korea.},

Abstract = {The article is devoted to the phenomenon of political trust. Drawing an
   analogy with the role of presuppositions in a language, A. Kaniukov
   analyzes the role of trust in a political space and identifies a number
   of ways to further our understanding of this concept. The article raises
   a series of questions, including whether political trust is real, in
   what ways the concept of trust relates to the concept of confidence, how
   this phenomenon relates to religion and fanaticism, and whether trust
   can be viewed as a process of communication. Particular attention is
   paid to understanding the relationship between trust and faith. The
   author concludes that recognizing the enormous role of faith in the
   political process should increase the society's ability to resist
   political manipulation. Understanding that there is no place for
   knowledge in the political space, and there is only faith, will promote
   the development of critical thinking and tolerance and, as a result,
   contribute to the development of civil society.},

Abstract = {Political parties provide an attitudinal linkage between citizen and the
   state, but in Germany, partisan ties are weakening. We know little about
   what this decline implies for citizens' attitudes towards the party
   system and democracy more generally. Relying on data from the German
   Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP), a longitudinal multilevel analysis was
   conducted to investigate whether the effect of partisanship on
   satisfaction with democracy has changed over a period of 23 years
   (1987-2010). The results show that the effect of party attachments on
   satisfaction with the functioning of democracy has strengthened.
   However, it also shows that the link between partisan ties and
   satisfaction with democracy depends on whether citizens support winners
   of the electoral competition.},

Abstract = {A key question regarding ideology is how we might explain or understand
   its ability to attract and maintain support from human subjects - in
   other words what has been called the `grip' of ideology. In the
   following, we aim to show that such a grip needs to be understood as
   operating in three different modes. While most contemporary theories of
   ideology conceive of these modes as symbolic systems and thus understand
   their grip as generated through the structural inertia of being `taken
   for granted' as the very fabric of our social lives, other scholars have
   instead emphasized the imaginary dimension of ideology - its ability to
   offer utopian horizons - and have elaborated on another kind of grip
   which focuses on the emotional attachment subjects may experience
   towards a certain ideological vision of the ideal society. But beyond
   these two modes, we argue that it is also necessary to consider a third
   in which the grip of ideology is constituted neither by its structural
   inertia, nor by its utopian eschatology, but in and through the offering
   of intense momentary experiences, sometimes of a transgressive or
   excessive nature, such as celebrations, political rituals or
   demonstrations.},

Abstract = {In this article, we first test theories on immigrant rights across 29
   countries from Europe, Africa, the Middle East, East Asia, Oceania, and
   the Americas, using our Indicators of Citizenship Rights for Immigrants
   (ICRI) data set. We focus on trajectories of nationhood and current
   institutional features to explain cross-national difference. We find
   that former colonial powers, former colonies that developed as settler
   countries, as well as democracies have been more likely to extend rights
   to immigrants. Strikingly, once we account for involvement in
   colonialism, we find no difference between supposedly civic-nationalist
   early nation-states and supposedly ethnic-nationalist latecomer nations,
   refuting a widely held belief in the literature on citizenship. We find
   no effect of a country's degree of political globalization. We replicate
   these findings on a sample of 35 mainly European countries, using the
   migrant Integration Policy Index (MIPEX).},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF CIVIL SOCIETY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {13},
Number = {1},
Pages = {1-17},
Abstract = {This article focuses on forms of opposition to `othering' and far-right
   politics in present-day Greece. This opposition takes a variety of
   forms, comes from a range of actors, and is motivated by a number of
   concerns with differing assessments of what should be done. More
   specifically, the article focuses on the far right in Greece and
   discrimination, hate speech, and hate crime against the `other' from the
   perspectives of those who are active in mobilizing against racism and
   counteracting the country's populist and neo-nationalist turn.
   Concentrating on the forces opposing discrimination, the analysis
   describes present-day social movements and actions from grassroots to
   governmental level, their strategies and politics, their diversity of
   thought and action, and their contribution in providing the resources
   for social change, and the production of new meaning in the context of
   anti-racism in Greece. Trying to provide answers as to how social
   movements and activists produce meaning, we argue that activists develop
   less intentional, inadvertent meanings which emerge in the course of the
   not-always conscious schemas of their struggle. This calls for a more
   dynamic explanation of the relationship between practice and
   meaning-making in social movement contexts.},

Journal = {CRITICAL REVIEW},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {29},
Number = {3},
Pages = {351-361},
Abstract = {In Inventing the Individual, Larry Siedentop traces the origins of
   Western liberal individualism to Christianity, which broke the hold of
   classical religiosity. In the classical view, according to Siedentop,
   there was no conceptual space for individuals, as society was seen as
   consisting of families, each worshipping its own god. Paul's doctrine
   that everyone is equally a child of God enabled an individual- focused
   understanding of society to emerge. This began to happen with the rise
   of the Roman Empire and then the Church, which (at least conceptually)
   placed all the equal individuals under a single sovereign. This story is
   magnificent in its simplicity, but questionable because of the same
   quality.},

Abstract = {In the 2010 midterm elections Republicans won in a landslide, making
   major gains in the Senate and winning the majority in the House. In this
   article, I assess one factor that contributed to the Republican Party's
   landslide in 2010: the political salience of racial animosity in the
   Obama era. In a historical analysis of voting in midterm elections, I
   find that racial animosity had a substantially larger effect on vote
   choice in 2010 than in past midterm elections. This effect persists in
   the face of many short-term factors and regardless of the race of the
   candidates themselves. I also show that racial animosity affected voter
   turnout in 2010, stimulating turnout among Republicans and diminishing
   turnout among Democrats. Consistent with research on presidential voting
   and opinion formation in the Obama era, these results suggest that one
   consequence of Obama's presidency was to increase the relevance of
   racial animosity in American politics.},

Abstract = {This article begins via an exploration of Jean Baudrillard's provocative
   claim that we dreamed of the `events of 9/11' prior to their occurrence.
   Baudrillard's particular quote is introduced to raise questions about
   the politics of knowing and un-knowing in International Relations, with
   specific reference to risk and the ``war on terror{''}. Building on
   postcolonial scholarship, this article points to the limits of
   contemporary approaches to risk and offers an alternative methodological
   approach -one it argues better identifies the power relations that
   structure the daily forms of knowing and un-knowing that give meaning to
   and invigorate articulations of risk.},

Journal = {ASIAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE},

Volume = {25},

Abstract = {Is more institutional coup-proofing (ICP) better or worse for leaders'
   chances of political survival? Are coups less or more likely to occur
   and succeed as a state's military structure becomes increasingly divided
   into rival branches, organizations, and factions? The article evaluates
   two competing perspectives on the effectiveness of counterbalancing as a
   regime protection measure. Seeing strength in numbers and the prospects
   for divide-and-conquer tactics, most scholars take a more-is-better
   view, suggesting that higher levels of ICP should increase the
   effectiveness of counterbalancing. Some scholars, however, advance a
   more-is-worse perspective, suggesting that collective action problems
   confronting larger numbers of military organizations decrease the
   effectiveness of counterbalancing. Through a qualitative analysis of
   eight coup events in the Philippines during 1986-1987, strong evidence
   is found in support of the causal mechanisms and predicted outcomes for
   the more-is-better view.},

Abstract = {Monarchy and nationalism are embedded in a complex relationship, and
   many of Europe's ruling dynasties crumbled in the nationalist upsurge of
   the modern era. Yet, the Danish royal house managed to get through the
   upheavals and gradually turned into a national rallying point. The
   article explores this historical development, focusing on the interplay
   between monarchy and media from 1933 to 1945, when the process of
   mediatization prompted a merging of royalist and egalitarian narratives
   of the nation.},

Pages = {1-24},
Abstract = {This article offers a brief conceptual framework for understanding the
   allocation of the right to vote in a democratic community. It explores
   one of the main reasons for setting the electoral age at 18 years. The
   article focuses on the popular argument that minors lack electoral
   capacity, critically analyzing the consistency with which rules on
   electoral capacity are applied, and exploring alternatives to the use of
   a minimum age restriction. It concludes that there are good reasons to
   believe that this age could be lowered 16 years, as the capacity of
   individuals is already clearly recognized by the legal system at that
   age. This may be a powerful argument in support of the hypothesis that a
   democracy attributes democratic rights as a consequence of the
   recognition of deliberative personality, on which the attribution of
   legal capacity associated with the legal subject is also based.},

Journal = {REGIONAL AND FEDERAL STUDIES},

Abstract = {This paper provides a comparative examination of Third (non-public,
   non-profit) sector cross-border cooperation contributing to conflict
   transformation in the Basque (France/Spain) and Irish (UK/Ireland)
   borderscapes. The comparison is based on the premise that the European
   Union (EU) played a different role in both cases. In the Irish case, the
   EU contributed to the institutionalization of a peace process that
   included cross-border cooperation between Third sector organizations
   among its policy instruments contributing to conflict transformation. In
   the Basque case, the unilateral renunciation of violence by ETA (Euskadi
   eta Askatasuna) in 2010 did not generate the consistent involvement of
   the EU in an institutional peace process. However, some Third sector
   organizations became secondary foreign policy actors using EU
   instruments for cross-border economic, social, and cultural cooperation
   between France and Spain in order to reinforce their cross-border
   networks, which indirectly impacted on conflict transformation.},

Number = {3},
Pages = {296-313},
Abstract = {Appeals to a `tradition' stretching back to Thucydides have been central
   to the recent emergence of realism in political theory. This article
   asks what work these appeals to tradition are doing and whether they are
   consistent with contemporary political realism's contextualist
   commitments. I argue that they are not and that realists also have
   independent epistemic reasons to attend to contextualist worries.
   Ultimately, I make the case for an account of the realist tradition that
   is at once consistent with moderate contextualist commitments and that
   preserves the classificatory and analytical value of tradition-building.},

Abstract = {Since the 2010s, bottom-up anti-corruption mobilizations have broken out
   in different countries of south-eastern Europe. Bosnia-Herzegovina in
   2014 and Macedonia in 2015 and 2016 were amongst the states in
   democratic and economic transition in which thousands of people took to
   the streets to express their discontent against a ruling class blamed
   for corruption. Although triggered by different events, these
   mobilizations present a number of similarities. Building on qualitative
   interviews and ethnographic observation of interactions on social media
   platforms, this article investigates the discursive strategies that
   movement organizers used to frame their claims and the protestors'
   identity in both countries. The article explores the ways in which
   protest leaders in the two countries appropriated the topic of
   corruption ``from below{''} to delegitimize the ruling class using
   similar motivational, identity and diagnostic frames, notwithstanding
   the protests being spurred by diverse events. Furthermore, it elucidates
   the similarities and differences among the prognostic frames, that is,
   the proposed solutions to the problem of political corruption.},

   Comprehensive Approach to Promote Critical Reading and Student
   Participation},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE EDUCATION},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {13},
Number = {2},
Pages = {121-137},
Abstract = {This article presents the Critical Reading Topics approach, a
   pedagogical method employed to promote deep thinking in a variety of
   politics courses. Derived from principles articulated in active
   learning, critical thinking, backward design, and flipped classroom
   literature, this method utilizes Bloom's Taxonomy as the scaffolding for
   students to create and evaluate pointed and relevant discussion topics
   written by themselves and their peers. By utilizing this method, faculty
   can increase students' contemplation of the course texts, enhance
   students' classroom contributions and quickly gauge the extent to which
   students understand the readings' main ideas. This approach also enables
   students to gain authorship of the material, and it gives them
   additional in-class time to process the complex information they
   encounter. Evidence collected from six different political science
   courses is provided to document the approach's effectiveness. Key
   findings include an improvement in the quality of relevant and focused
   discussion topics, a high percentage of students completing reading
   assignments with corresponding high quiz grades, and significant
   participation and recognition for all students, even those who are
   traditionally quiet in class.},

   that candidates most frequently employ the ideal candidate frame in
   their images, which also garnered the highest number of user likes and
   comments. Results also reveal that among Instagram image attributes,
   candidates frequently and successfully used text within their images,

Abstract = {Under the auspices of ``psychological warfare{''}, a new field of
   expertise came into being during the early Cold War. Regional and
   communication studies formed a close bond. Social scientists began to
   illuminate the structure of Soviet society in a systematic manner and
   marketed basic research as useful for ``psychological warfare{''}.
   Scientific expertise competed with knowledge of public relations and the
   practical experience of veterans from the Second World War who had
   worked in propaganda. Political consulting based on basic research,
   however, found little resonance.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF ELECTIONS PUBLIC OPINION AND PARTIES},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {27},
Number = {4},
Pages = {413-432},
Abstract = {This contribution investigates how the structure of new political
   parties' success influences their survival. Improving on the standard of
   previous studies, we argue in particular that there is no simple linear
   relationship between vote shares and the likelihood of party survival.
   Rather, the probability of survival increases sharply if new parties
   gain enough votes to secure representation. Furthermore, we argue that
   new parties should be more likely to survive when they are successful at
   the subordinate (local) level. We test our expectations using a new data
   set that includes information on 107 newly founded Czech regional
   parties. Our results show that studies on party lifespans and the
   electoral success of new political parties require an understanding of
   the impact of representational thresholds. Most importantly, the
   reported analyses indicate that models of party survival need to
   consider the significance of parliamentary representation and the
   multilevel structure of party competition.},

Number = {2, SI},

Abstract = {This article proposes an alternative categorization of the populist
   phenomena, by elaborating the distinction between electoral-delegative
   and participative-mobilising populisms. All the populist phenomena share
   some common traits, such as a polarising and antagonist discourse
   dividing the society into a ``People{''} and some ``elites{''} or
   privileged sectors, their reliance on a strong leadership, a pretension
   to be majoritarian and to achieve the power at the national level in
   order to restore the sovereignty of the People. Nonetheless, the
   strategies for achieving these goals vary according to the specific
   diagnoses that would correct the perceived deficiencies of the
   representative democracies in terms of accountability of the
   representatives. The populisms closer to the electoral-delegative pole
   stress the symbolic dimension of the concept of representation, thus
   relying on a strong leader able to ``truly interpret{''} the general
   will of the People. Those closer to the participative-mobilising pole
   call for an active involvement of the People in the decision-making
   process in order to effectively control the public institutions,
   stressing the descriptive dimension of the concept of representation and
   sometimes questioning the theoretical bases sustaining the
   representative democracy. I provide a brief discussion on four
   participative-mobilising populist experiences, i.e. the MAS-IPSP, the
   Kirchnerism, the M5S and Podemos, focusing on their internal
   organizations and relying on an extensive fieldwork (consisting in one
   hundred in-depth interviews with country experts and party's
   representatives at regional and national levels) that I conducted for a
   broader research project.},

Abstract = {Literature on diaspora engagement policies, transnational and
   extra-territorial citizenship has painted the increasing recognition of
   dual nationality and the extension of state policies to the diaspora as
   a signal of states leaving behind the paradigms of exclusive nationality
   and residence as conditions to exercise citizenship. In doing this, this
   literature tends to treat citizenship and nationality as synonyms. By
   analysing the citizenship policies of 22 Latin American and Caribbean
   states towards their nationals who reside abroad and/or acquire another
   nationality, we add key nuances to such consideration: nationality and
   citizenship may relate to different legal statuses - with important
   consequences for migrants - and there might be differences also between
   the citizen rights of nationals by origin and of nationals by
   naturalization. In particular, we show that citizenship and nationality
   interact in different ways when it comes to the preservation of rights
   for emigrants: the distinctions allow restricting the portability of
   citizenship rights for nationals by birth, and other groups of
   nationals, depending on the exclusivity, and origin, of their national
   belonging. These distinctions tell a potentially different story of how
   citizenship is conceived of by states as they approach the challenges of
   membership and participation posed by emigration, and paint a less
   rosypicture with regard to the demise of exclusive nationality.},

Abstract = {The article studies the causes of the crisis in local self-government.
   According to the author, the difficulties with the development of this
   political institution are related not so much to the lack of financial
   and human resources, as to the discrepancy between the theory of local
   self-government and the real practice of municipal government. As an
   argument in support of his hypothesis, the author cites research data
   from the Institute of Sociology of the Russian Academy of Sciences,
   indicating an extremely low level of trust in local authorities. These
   results are discordant to the theoretical notions of local
   self-government, as the power closest to ordinary citizens. The appeal
   to the concept of ``trust{''} allows the author to link the negative
   attitude of society towards local self-government bodies with such
   factors as, firstly, the residents' lack of confidence in the
   professionalism of these structures, secondly, the reduction in the
   number of municipal deputies and officials directly elected by citizens,
   and, finally, alienation of local authorities from ordinary citizens.
   The data of sociological research presented in the article show that for
   today the society does not perceive local authorities as
   ``self-governing bodies{''}, but the theoretical concept ``local
   self-government{''} is estimated rather positively so far. According to
   the author's position, the state of democracy in the country exerts more
   influence on the attitude of society towards local self-government. The
   development of plebiscite factors in the political regime and the
   concentration of attention on the figure of the head of state change the
   attitude towards all other institutions. For public opinion, they become
   insignificant and insignificant. The author ends the article with the
   conclusion that local self-government can regain public confidence only
   after a democratic political culture and rights and freedoms are rooted
   in the country. Achieving these conditions will ensure the wide
   participation of citizens in the activities of local authorities.},

Abstract = {While research has already focused on power-sharing agreements by
   assessing specific effects of political, economic, territorial and
   military provisions, some provisions might be more important than
   others. This paper argues that the content of an agreement is crucial
   for the cohesion of a signatory rebel group since these are strongly
   affected by resource-distribution and the way in which the underlying
   conflict is managed. Investigating on the Free Aceh Movement and the
   Moro National Liberation Front, this study concludes that the
   implementation of power-sharing is decisive. When inner-core provisions
   and single factions are addressed, groups tend to stay united.},

Abstract = {Intraparty politics is a precursor to political parties' policy
   proposals, manifestos, selected leaders and candidates, which often
   involves many actors and is regularly accompanied by tensions. This
   essay introduces the contents of a special issue devoted to the internal
   dynamics of political parties in Europe. We connect each contribution of
   the issue to three key aspects of intraparty research: (1) sources of
   information on internal party politics and methods of analysis, (2) how
   contemporary parties reconcile or otherwise address disagreements within
   the party and (3) the electoral and other ramifications of internal
   party tensions or divisions. Overall, the comparative case studies and
   cross-national comparisons across Western and Eastern Europe included in
   this issue show that considerations of intraparty dynamics advance
   scholarly research on alliances and coalitions, party organizations and
   party competition.},

Title = {IDEAS AND VALUES AS A METHOD OF CONSTRUCTING SYMBOLIC SPACE OF THE
   NATIONAL IDENTITY},
Journal = {POLIS-POLITICHESKIYE ISSLEDOVANIYA},
Year = {2017},
Number = {5},
Pages = {156-173},
Abstract = {The nation is seen as an ``imaginary political community{''} {[}Anderson
   2001] whose construction is carried out using symbols that form the
   national symbolic space. National identity is defined as a special kind
   of psychological connection of a person with a political nation that
   makes an individual sensitive to what concerns his state, his country.
   The main hypothesis of the study: if formation of a nation is the
   creation of symbolic forms in which the jointly created representations
   are embodied, then the national identity is formed in the process of
   interiorization of these symbolic forms, their reflection in the psyche
   of people. The paper distinguishes between two types of symbols:
   symbols-significators that perform a nominative function, and
   symbols-integrators (mythologems and ideologemes) that carry semantic
   interpretations of the image of the nation. It is shown that
   symbols-significators, unlike simple signs, can cause certain emotional
   states in which the individual's sensate attitude to his nation is
   displayed. Symbols-integrators form a symbolic universe of the nation,
   i.e. a complex of structures that can be deployed in areas that are
   inaccessible to actual perception and that are beyond the immediate
   human experience. The significance of the symbolic universe for the
   formation of national identity is not only in its special role in
   constructing the image of a nation, a kind of collective We, but also in
   its inherent ability to recreate, actualize in the human psyche an
   emotional attitude to this image. The inevitability and contradictory
   nature of the renewal of the symbolic universe is substantiated. The
   conditions under which the symbolic universe is unable to maintain a
   unified system of representations, the image of the collective We are
   determined. It is shown that, as a result of the emergence of such
   conditions, the symbolic universe loses the function of forming a
   national identity. The special role of the state in maintaining the
   integrity of the national symbolic universe is revealed. The Russian
   symbolic universe is characterized as problematic, experiencing a period
   of heated discussions on issues of national self-determination; however,
   it has not lost its consolidating function. It is shown that the
   national identity of most Russians is formed through the interiorization
   of the symbols of statehood.},

Abstract = {This article addresses the question of whether, in the course of
   increasing digital action and decision-making programs, the concept of
   responsibility is still adequate to describe relations between actors,
   reference objects and normativity, as it was the case in classical
   situations of division of labor. The first chapter sketches out the
   difference between social division of labor and digital social action,
   based on the approach of distributed social agency. In a second, more
   detailed section, theoretical approaches of diffused responsibility are
   outlined and subjected to plausibility checks using illustrative cases
   from the context of autonomous robotic weapon systems. Finally, a
   summary is given with regard to the question of the consequences for the
   theory of responsibility in the face of the digitalization of social
   action.},

   emphasizing and questioning the specifi city of the 2014 European
   Parliament (EP) election. It explains how the European issue gained
   saliency, showing the normalization of EU criticism in the French
   political space and then its radicalization in 2014. The analysis
   reveals the weight of electoral rules in the shaping of the
   ``eurosceptic{''} landscape, placing the 2014 success of the
   extreme-right National Front (FN) into that perspective. Assessing the
   effects of European integration on domestic political spaces, the
   chapter underlines how EP elections and the development of oppositions
   have contributed to reshaping the French domestic political arena while
   maintaining political conflicts there. Finally, in this perspective, the
   chapter questions the second-order model.},

Journal = {POLITICA Y SOCIEDAD},

Volume = {54},

Pages = {665-682},
Abstract = {Based on Joas' creative action theory, which presents a novel character
   and rescues the notion of creativity as an essential theme of
   sociological theory, this article aims to analyze whether the global
   economic system has commercialized and de-tradized the creativity,
   emptying it of meaning and collaborating, in this way, in the deepening
   of the crisis of representative democracies and their values. To do so
   previously, they will be defined and interrelate the concepts of
   ``crisis{''}, ``representative democracy{''} and ``creativity{''}.
   It will be seen that the creative economy has created new inequalities
   between rich and poor and between creative and non-creative states,
   widening the gap between market and state, between politics and economy,
   between capitalism and representative democracy. And it has even
   activated the contradictions of capitalism, that is, it has deepened the
   crisis, the decay and the collapse of democracy. In this sense,
   creativity can not today be seen only as a lifeline for the many
   difficulties and uncertainties that plague representative democracies.
   It is also, and should not forget, a source of intensification of these
   same problems, while generating new ones, not foreseen.},

Abstract = {This article directs attention to the use of Instagram by political
   parties in the Swedish national elections in 2014. It investigates how
   political parties used Instagram - a platform that is centered around
   images - when engaging in interaction with their followers on the
   platform. Therefore, the article analyses Instagram images including
   their captions and comments (posts) that Swedish parties published four
   weeks prior to Election Day. A particular focus is on the deliberative
   potential of Instagram. The results suggest that not much changes on
   Instagram compared to other social media platforms: Political parties
   hardly used Instagram to interact with their followers and the few
   interactions taking place on parties Instagram accounts did not
   contribute to the exchange of relevant and substantive information about
   politics (i.e., deliberation). Interaction and deliberation is also not
   enhanced by the images.},

Abstract = {One of the most important signs of a dynamic economy is commercial
   advertisement and presentation of products. Advertisement in fact, helps
   consumers to become aware of various goods and make a move for buying
   those needed. However, it should be noted here that whatever intended to
   be advertised should not be harmful to people and society;
   advertisement, if restricted to goods and products, would not lead to so
   much negative criticism, but in reality it embraces selling of
   imaginations, dreams, and idealistic life styles. Therefore wrong
   components can lead to a liability. On the other hand advertisement is
   increasingly related to society's health. This study aims at
   investigating propagandists' liability in light of the theories of civil
   liability. Therefore, in facing the fundamentals of civil liability in
   this area, the theories of guilt and strict liability are able to be
   examined. Studied the running rules of national and transnational
   domain, however, the approach considered as the basis of civil liability
   in this area is the theory of guilt. In the legal system of Iran,
   according to what was pointed out and considering the exclusive nature
   of tobacco, the guilt theory is ruling on the process and cycle of
   tobacco including production, distribution, and promotion. Considering
   American rules have also revealed that some rules suggest the fact that
   the theory of strict liability has executive capability in light of
   damage compensation, but the recent approach of American legislator has
   deviated from this standpoint and inclined toward the theory of guilt.
   In any case, the writer strives at investigating the position of damage
   compensation and fundamentals of advertisement liability, through
   explaining the ruling theories in this area.},

Pages = {311-328},
Abstract = {This article examines the structural level developments in the Russian
   nationalities policy, focusing on the (dis) similarities between the
   Yeltsin's and Putin's periods. Although Putin's administration made
   certain interventions in the domain of nationalities policy, this
   approach cannot be compared with the Soviet time policy: recent
   developments cannot be interpreted as a new pro-assimilating policy.
   Finally, the authors examine the structural changes for the rise of
   latent nationalism using a structural equation modeling approach on a
   unique data set consisting of political and cultural nationalism indices
   for 21 Russian republics. These findings show that there is some
   consistency on the structural level of nationalities policy.},

Title = {A conspiracy to murder: explaining the dynamics of Romanian `policy'
   towards Jews in Transnistria},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF GENOCIDE RESEARCH},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {19},
Number = {1},
Pages = {1-21},
Abstract = {This article offers a comprehensive interpretation of the Romanian
   `policy' towards Jews in Transnistria in 1941-44. This region in
   southwestern Ukraine witnessed both a monstrous number of Jewish
   victims, usually estimated as no fewer than 350,000 and possibly more,
   and an unusually high survival rate by the standards of the occupied
   Soviet territory. The article argues that what is sometimes referred to
   as `inconsistency' in Romanian policy can be best explained within the
   framework of the structuralist/ functionalist approach to the history of
   the Holocaust that was first developed on German material. The article
   argues that Romanian leaders never adopted the policy of complete
   annihilation of Jews; rather, their aim was to expel them from Romania's
   national territory. However, they were not opposed to murdering Jews en
   masse when they believed it was `necessary' from a military point of
   view or advisable for any other reason. Given the scarcity of resources
   in the region and the fear of epidemics, murdering interned Jews in the
   areas of their greatest concentration appeared to be the way to `solve'
   a number of problems. At the same time, the absence of a fanatical
   paramilitary force such as the SS in Nazi Germany and Romanian leaders'
   unwillingness to leave a paper trail of their criminal orders
   complicated the logistics of mass murder. Mass murder required either
   the ready participation of the gendarmerie and police, which was not
   always forthcoming, or the mobilization of the ethnic German militia,
   which was not available everywhere. In the absence of pressure from the
   authorities to kill, some officers and individual gendarmes, cognizant
   of the criminal nature of such actions, hesitated or even avoided
   participation in mass murder.},

Abstract = {One of the great contributions of the Journal of Political Ideologies to
   the study of politics has been the emphasis it has given to recovering
   lost ideological traditions or subtraditions. With regard to the recent
   history of the United Kingdom, contributions to the Journal have long
   argued that there is far greater ideological complexity in British
   politics than is usually credited and that analysis of this complexity
   might throw up powerful arguments for contemporary political argument.
   In this essay, I take inspiration from that notion in order to establish
   whether a lost tradition of twentieth century British socialist thinking
   - that associated with a series of inter-war and mid-century thinkers
   who were sceptical of both modernism and the state - might throw new
   light on the failings of recent British Labour ideology, especially that
   associated with Ed Miliband's failed attempt to secure victory in the
   2015 general election. The essay contends that the arguments of these
   earlier thinkers - and especially their obsession with crafting a
   `socialism of the everyday' - could have provided a vital warning to
   Miliband's Labour, had it chosen to heed it.},

Title = {Ethnic politics and election campaigns in contemporary Africa: evidence
   from Ghana and Kenya},
Journal = {DEMOCRATIZATION},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {24},
Number = {6},
Pages = {951-969},
Abstract = {Why do some political parties in new democracies base their campaigns on
   promises of national public goods while others do not? Parties in new
   democracies often eschew programmatic policy proposals in favour of
   appealing to voters' ethnic identities, distributing non-programmatic
   benefits, or emphasizing the personalities of their candidates. However,
   this is not universally the case. This article examines recent campaign
   strategies in two nascent democracies in Africa: Ghana and Kenya. The
   findings suggest that programmatic campaigning is much more common than
   is assumed, but that parties have different preferences for how much
   programmatic content they include in their campaigns. The article argues
   that differences in campaign strategies are largely due to differences
   in the composition of ethnic support for competing parties. Parties that
   draw a majority of their support from a single large ethnic group are
   more likely to develop campaign strategies based on programmatic,
   policy-based appeals in the form of specific proposals for national
   public goods than are parties with a more diverse ethnic base of
   supporters. I argue that these appeals serve as a pre-election
   commitment to counteract fears among the electorate of domination by the
   large ethnic core of the party.},

Journal = {POLITICKE VEDY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {20},
Number = {1},
Pages = {105-131},
Abstract = {Power potential and its attributes lay down the fundamental
   prerequisites enabling a state to achieve the highest positions within
   the power pyramid. In the case of the United states, democracy and free
   market contributed to the US global leadership, yet a significant role
   was played also by the character of the society and ideology. The aim of
   the article is to point out to the ideological sources of the US foreign
   policy that have led to the US rise as the global leader. The study
   begins with an explanation of the history of changes in the
   classification of powers, continues with models of power structure and
   the cycles of world hegemony. Special attention is paid to development
   of US foreign policy, focusing particularly on several contexts of the
   decision making process how to assume the role of a global power. This
   paper is approaching sources of American power in the second decade of
   the 21st century and outlines the potential and limits of American
   leadership.The study concludes that the military, economic and soft
   power resources have made the United States central to the workings of
   the global balance of power. But the potential domestic decline in the
   near future could bring the lost of capacity to convert the power
   resources into effective leadership. However, the American leadership in
   21st century will not look like it did in the 20th century.},

Abstract = {In this article, the question I answer is why did so many white women
   vote for Donald Trump? I reexamine the gender gap in voting to answer
   this question and to better understand the 2016 election results. The
   gender gap in voting and party identification is a real political
   phenomenon; the question remains to determine what kind of phenomenon it
   is. I advance the discussion by examining the racial component of the
   gender gap, show that there is a racial gap in the voting gender gap,
   and examine the sources of support for Donald Trump and other Republican
   candidates among white women using 2016 American National Election
   Studies Pilot Study data. I find that support for Republican candidates
   including most especially Donald Trump was surprisingly strong in 2016
   among white women, and the source of that support showed to have a
   strong racial component.},

Abstract = {The article surveys issues relevant to the Russia-U.S. relations crisis
   under Donald Trump that reverberate throughout the globe. Analyzing the
   situation from a variety of perspectives, including ideological, social,
   and political points of view, the author investigates comprehension of
   what went wrong in the world politics during the year after the
   presidential elections and how to get it right. The author explores
   diverse scenarios, the influence of international actors. The author
   points at the pending overwhelming crisis that can blow up the
   management of global affairs, like including anthropogenic catastrophes
   like a Fukushima-1 disaster. The institutions of global governance like
   the U.N. are challenged as never before, accompanied by conflicts
   ranging from Syria to Ukraine. The author presents analysis of
   geopolitical scenarios pessimistic, optimistic, and realistic ones - as
   well as their possible solutions and predictions for the future. One of
   the main issues of our time, according to the author, is the question
   whether global politics will move from the stage of competition towards
   the state of cooperation between such global superpowers as the U.S.,
   China, and Russia, each of which has alternative project of its own. Or
   will each of these three countries realize that none of them enjoys such
   a sum of advantages that outweighs what other countries can counter them
   (alone or within an unofficial coalition)? Consequently, it is a
   question of making a dramatic choice between their joint activities and
   global conflict.},

Journal = {ASIAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {25},
Number = {2},
Pages = {194-211},
Abstract = {The rich and complex recent International Political Sociology (IPS)
   literature on state recognition has completely ignored the process of
   de-recognition. The present article uses the case study of Taiwan's
   efforts to preserve its `diplomatic allies' in the Caribbean in order to
   fill this gap. Taking advantage of the IPS development of the
   constitutive theory of recognition, it introduces and analyses the
   concept of state de-recognition while emphasizing the deep contradiction
   between present international law principles and the political reality
   of national identity building as well as the de-linking of political
   science and international law understandings of recognition made
   possible by the progress of the constitutive theory. De-recognition is
   perceived as resulting in a hierarchical relationship between recognized
   and de-recognized political entities that is arbitrary and ethically
   questionable as it ultimately reflects the denial of the right to
   self-determination of peoples.},

   It will be proposed to distinguish between the initial meanings of S \&

   context, and where priorities appeared to be in other areas of
   government, followed by a cycle of growth of investment and expansion of
   the area, concomitant with the decision to give greater visibility to
   the link between S \& T and economic development (period 2007-2010).
   Finally, the cycle of adjustments on this idea of growth, which are
   deployed from 2010 to the end of the presidential term, and which seek
   to explore ways of building governance on the research community.},

Journal = {REGIONAL AND FEDERAL STUDIES},

Pages = {219-237},
Abstract = {Since the 1950s, cross-border cooperation has been operating as a tool
   for reconciliation in Europe. However, this secondary foreign policy was
   implemented differently in each border region and did not take place
   simultaneously. While it started as both a top-down and bottom-up
   movement shortly after the end of the Second World War in Western
   Europe, it was limited to communist party organized symbolism in Central
   and Eastern Europe. Here, cross-border cooperation could only truly be
   employed as an instrument of reconciliation after the end of the Cold
   War. This paper emphasizes the historical development of cross-border
   cooperation as a peace-building instrument and assesses its potential
   model function for other regions in the world: shifting from
   reconciliation in specific border regions after the Second World War to
   a more generalized approach to `secondary foreign policy' used as a tool
   for the European Integration process, the changing functions of
   cross-border cooperation will be shown.},

Volume = {64},
Number = {5, SI},
Pages = {228-241},
Abstract = {This article investigates how two processes of externalization-deeper
   integration into European institutions, and the extension of citizenship
   and voting rights offered by neighboring kin-states-impact national
   minority politics using the critical case of the ethnic Hungarian
   political community in Romania. It finds that external citizenship and
   voting rights may help strengthen ethnic political identity, but also
   reorients resources away from minority political projects toward the
   kin-state and encourages intra-minority stratification. Access to
   European political spaces offers additional arenas through which
   minority political actors can make claims and gain allies, but is of
   limited use as a mobilizational resource.},

Abstract = {This article disentangles the complex relationship between
   depoliticisation and anti-politics in public-private partnership (PPP)
   policies and practices. By identifying three social mechanisms that
   underlie dynamics of depoliticisation in PPPs, namely consultocracy,
   yield bias, and complex contracting, it contributes to the growing
   interdisciplinary literature on depoliticisation. The article argues
   that as depoliticisation continues to evolve, it further increases the
   unbalance between depoliticisation and politicisation, which has
   negative implications for democratic governance. The depoliticised logic
   behind PPPs feeds broad sentiments of political distrust and
   disappointment, because political decision makers tend to use PPPs as
   miracle solutions for the delivery of public infrastructure without
   bearing the long-term budgetary consequences of their own decisions.
   This constitutes an expectations gap: the difference between what is
   promised or expected by politicians on the one hand, and what they can
   actually deliver on the other. It is here that the short-term rationales
   and incentives of political decision makers collide with the wider
   public interest in the longer term.},

Abstract = {The UK's FOI Act came into force in 2005. Three linked research projects
   were conducted to evaluate its overall impact and assess to what extent
   FOI has met its objectives across central and local government and
   Parliament. They conclude that FOI has met its `core' objectives, making
   central government more transparent and accountable. However, it has not
   improved decision-making, public understanding, participation or trust.
   Nor has FOI significantly changed how government works, despite
   politicians' fears of a chilling effect. The article concludes with a
   look at the key issues that will shape the future of FOI.},

Abstract = {The author, an eminent economist and politician, analyzes alarming
   trends in global development that found their reflection in the voting
   for Brexit in the United Kingdom, in the outcome of the 2016
   presidential elections in the United States, in the migration crisis in
   Europe and in a number of other landmark events and phenomena of our
   times. As a follow-up to the concept proposed in his book
   ``Realeconomik{''}, he notes that what is happening now is far from
   being accidental. The current tremendous amount of events derive from
   the factors that have gained strength in the last quarter of the
   twentieth century. Among them were the following: a) the growth of
   global inequality in its various manifestations combined with a sense of
   inability to surmount them; b) the disorganization of the world order
   that emerged after the World War 2; c) the transformation in the sphere
   of information and communication technologies that outstrip the
   development of human consciousness; d) the change in the laws governing
   the functioning of the world economy. The author critically examines the
   urge for a political ``U-turn{''}, which has become a spontaneous
   response to a severe contemporary issues. He believes that the
   thoughtful attitude of global and national elites toward the factors he
   suggested for consideration, the awareness of political leaders of the
   world of their responsibility for its development can prevent an
   inaccurate reaction that inevitably will result in the growth of chaos.
   In the second part of the article, the author provides us with a short,
   but an in-depth analysis of serious changes in the global ratio of
   centers of political and economic power. He considers the large-scale
   changes in the world order, called differently ({''}change of
   leadership{''}, the formation of a ``multipolar{''} (polycentric) world,
   ``new normality{''} in international relations, etc.). In his opinion,
   all the above terms express the same essence, i.e. the back-pedaling to
   the past models of global equilibrium. His special concern is the
   increasingly diminishing role of Europe, which loses not only political
   and economic power, but also value-oriented and sense-oriented guidance,
   which is fraught with negative implications for the civilization based -
   in one way or another - on the ideals of European modernity. The author
   expresses and substantiates doubts about the existence in the modern
   world of an integral alternative concept that could replace them, and
   sees the eventual starting point for overcoming the global crisis in a
   qualitatively new comprehension of the current situation on the basis of
   European values.},

Title = {Populism, Voters and Cleavages in Bulgarian Politics},
Journal = {POLITOLOGICKY CASOPIS-CZECH JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2017},
Number = {1},
Pages = {56-71},
Abstract = {The growing success of populist parties from across the political
   spectrum in Europe calls for an examination of the link between populist
   parties and voters and the new (if new indeed) cleavages that such
   parties exploit. Scholars have pointed to the erosion of traditional
   cleavages as one reason for the success of populist parties. Such
   analysis fits well with the established democracies of Europe but has
   little application in the East European context. Traditional cleavages
   have taken root in few places in Eastern Europe before communist
   takeover and became even less relevant following four and a half decades
   of communist rule. With the fall of communist regimes across Eastern
   Europe, the only meaningful division within society was that of
   anti-communists and supporters of the old regime. Similarly, concepts of
   Left and Right had (and to a great extend continue to have) little
   relevance in the East European context where the Left came to be
   dominated by former communist parties and the Right engulfed an
   ideologically incoherent opposition. The stronger the former communists
   were (such as in Bulgaria and Romania) the more fragmented the Right
   was, as it was the only available space for political competition. The
   present paper aims to examine voter support for populist parties in
   Bulgaria and analyze on the cleavages that those parties exploit or
   create. Thus, the paper examines the impact of populist parties on the
   political landscape in terms of the changes that those parties result in
   in voter behavior and cleavage formation. The paper utilizes exit-poll
   surveys, focusing on voter demographic profiles and the mobility of the
   vote. The findings indicate that populist parties are most successful in
   mobilizing non-voters when they first appear, but that their support
   quickly wanes afterwards. At the same time, there is voter mobility from
   one populist party to a newer populist party, which makes for a prolong
   trend of populist politics.},

Abstract = {This paper examines why the German Free Democratic Party (FDP) failed to
   gain electoral success in 2013 despite being well positioned in terms of
   left-right ideology. Indeed, its vote share dropped from its highest
   ever point in 2009 (14.6 per cent of the national vote) to its lowest
   ever in 2013 (4.8 per cent of the vote). The paper shows that the FDP's
   valence dropped dramatically between 2009 and 2013. In addition, voting
   simulations show that the FDP was positioned close to its
   vote-maximising positions on policy and ideology. However, given the
   FDP's extremely low valence it could not have taken any set of policy
   positions that would have significantly increased its vote share.},

Abstract = {Smuggling of goods, known as one of the most obvious instances of
   economic crimes, has done irreversible harms to the economic systems of
   countries through placing obstacles in the way of productive investment,
   undermining healthy competitions in business, and finally forming and
   expanding underground and hidden economies. Creating the areas of money
   laundering and committing transnationally organized crimes, smuggling
   jeopardizes the economic and political security of countries seriously.
   On the other hand, committing smuggling crimes in groups has led to the
   expansion and intensification of such actions and made it quite
   difficult for the criminal justice systems to identify and deal with
   them. Organized crimes, which are among more evolved forms of group
   crimes, influence different areas of society because such crimes are
   compulsorily accompanied by the prevalence of bureaucratic and financial
   corruption. In addition, such crimes have negative impacts on the
   cultures of societies. Based on the proportionality of crimes,
   punishments, and distributive justice and the theory of punishment,
   criminal policy makers, therefore, have considered the quality of
   committing smuggling crime, such as organization, in order to
   effectively deal with this phenomenon in different countries. They have
   also showed differentiating and strict reactions to this type of crime.
   The aim of the current study was to investigate the theoretical concepts
   and foundations of organized smuggling of goods in Iran and Turkey. It
   was also intended to study the legal approaches adopted by these
   countries to this type of crime along with the similarities and
   differences of their legal systems.},

Abstract = {According to reformers, legislative term limits should increase voter
   turnout by enhancing electoral competitiveness for legislative seats.
   However, this claim has been largely untested. The only existing study
   of the effect of legislative term limits on voter turnout, to date,
   finds that turnout in California did not increase after the imposition
   of term limits and may have decreased turnout. Yet, it is unclear
   whether this result generalizes to other states. This study employs a
   comparative state analysis of both aggregate turnout and district-level
   turnout rates in state legislative elections. We find that term limits
   significantly increase voting rates in state legislative elections.},

Abstract = {The lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender (LGBT) community includes a
   diverse set of groups, including distinct groups based on sexual
   orientation and/or gender identity, but it is not clear whether the
   public makes distinctions in their attitudes toward these subgroups. If
   they do, what factors motivate individuals to evaluate gays and lesbians
   differently from transgender people? This study analyzes Americans'
   attitudes toward these communities, and it evaluates their support for
   nondiscrimination protections. We find that public attitudes are
   significantly more negative toward transgender people and policies
   pertaining to them than they are toward gay men and lesbians and related
   policies. The analyses reveal that differences in these attitudes are
   associated with social contact effects, variation in cognitive
   consistency, elite cues, and the varying magnitudes of key political
   factors, such as religiosity and partisanship.},

Abstract = {Due to the particular characteristics of the world in which we find
   ourselves, intelligence analysis becomes especially important. This
   paper discusses how the human mind works in intelligence analysis,
   focusing on uncertainty, trial ratings, judgments under pressure and
   time constraints, analyzing how the structure of our mental machinery
   influences and constrict intelligence analysis. We will deal with the
   functioning of the human mind, and what limitations it finds by focusing
   on how these cognitive characteristics affect intelligence analysts when
   they are not based on biased facts; as well as the impact of time and
   pressure on the accuracy of results.},

Abstract = {This article analyzes the political factors that crossed the definition
   of Argentine ` s military intelligence policy between 1990 and 2015. The
   argument is that this activity was conditioned by two assumptions widely
   held by the governments of this period: that military intelligence is
   dangerous for democratic stability; and that Argentina does not have
   external problems that may require this type of knowledge in the medium
   term. These elements not only made ``unnecessary{''} the definition of
   an intelligence policy -from the perspective of the local elites- but
   also shaped a status quo that maintained the subordination of the
   country's defense interests to foreign strategic perceptions.},

Abstract = {The article probes the independence of vote choice among Indian voters
   during national elections. Analyzing Lokniti's election survey data it
   highlights that even as a majority of voters take an independent call on
   who they are going to vote for, there is still a significant proportion
   that votes according to someone else's advice. While this counsel has
   always come from a family member mostly, voters are increasingly paying
   attention to a community leaders' opinion as well, particularly those
   voters who belong to marginalized and minority social groups. Dependent
   voting is also more prevalent among women and voters in
   socio-economically backward states.},

Abstract = {UN-broked peace talks with Cyrpiot leader Nicos Anastasiades and Turkish
   Cypriot leader Mustafa Akinci have brought the Cyrpus problem once again
   to the edge of resolution. However, the thorny issue of security and
   guarantees presents a significant challenge to reaching a deal. The
   author argues that the key to solving the security and guarantees issue
   is to start with a ``common vision{''} that would be agreeable to all
   relevant parties. This common vision should be based upon establishing
   the right institutions in the future united federal Cyprus, so that it
   can have the capacity and the resilience to deal with its security
   problems without outside assistance. In that regard, it is high time
   that the two Cypriot leaders earnestly focus on designing those internal
   security mechanisms and institutions, while the three guarantors should
   work on the external security and guarantees, and related transitional
   arrangements.},

Abstract = {This study investigates the voting behavior of Korean the electorate
   using Dalton's four concepts of contemporary voters. We demonstrate that
   cognitive partisans, who possess strong party identification and high
   levels of cognitive skills, respond to regional party cue and ideology
   when voting. Ritual partisans and cognitive partisans behave alike but,
   for ritual partisans, ideology plays a diminished role due to their low
   cognitive skills. Two independent groupsapartisans and apoliticalsare
   prone to swing votes from election to election. Unlike apoliticals,
   apartisans are influenced by ideology as they possess higher levels of
   cognitive abilities. Our findings suggest that Dalton's framework can be
   useful to understand voting patterns of electorates in new democracies
   as well as advanced democracies.},

Abstract = {Negative campaigning presents parties with a collective action problem.
   While parties would prefer to have their competitors attacked, potential
   backlash effects from negative messages mean that individual politicians
   typically lack the incentives to carry out such attacks. We theorize
   that parties solve this problem by implementing a division of labour
   that takes into account the incentives of individual office holders,
   their availability for campaign activity, and media relevance. Drawing
   on these arguments we expect that holders of high public office and
   party leaders are less likely to issue attacks, leaving the bulk of the
   dirty work' to be carried out by party floor leaders and general
   secretaries. Examining almost 8000 press releases issued by over 600
   individual politicians during four election campaigns in Austria, we
   find strong support for our theoretical expectations.},

Abstract = {Why are some states polarized and others not? This article argues that
   state legislators are provided with more information by lobbyists and
   the media about national policies, or state-level bills that are
   prominent in the national political discourse. Compared with
   state-specific issues, this additional information encourages
   legislators to vote along party lines to secure reelection or prepare
   for a run for higher office. It identifies national policies using
   lobbying registrations in state legislatures and Congress to show there
   is more party difference on roll-call votes on national policies in 25
   states over 2011 to 2014. It also argues that the notoriety of national
   issues may encourage party leaders to put these bills on the agenda to
   build their party brand, or for individual legislators to raise their
   profiles. It finds that states with more national agendas have more
   polarized sessions.},

Abstract = {To paint a fuller picture of economic voters, we combine personal income
   records with a representative election survey. We examine three central
   topics in the economic voting literature: pocketbook versus sociotropic
   voting, the effects of partisanship on economic evaluations, and voter
   myopia. First, we show that voters who appear in survey data to be
   voting based on the national economy are, in fact, voting equally on the
   basis of their personal financial conditions. Second, there is strong
   evidence of both partisan bias and economic information in economic
   evaluations, but personal economic data is required to separate the two.
   Third, although in experiments and aggregate historical data recent
   economic conditions appear to drive vote choice, we find no evidence of
   myopia when we examine actual personal economic data.},

Abstract = {This is the first article to examine the rhetoric of Alex Salmond using
   the Aristotelian modes of persuasion (ethos, pathos, logos) during the
   2014 independence referendum. The article examines Salmond's persuasive
   style, his political discourses and construction of a specific form of
   Scottishness between January and September 2014. The article argues that
   Salmond's rhetorical style was driven in large part by a concern to
   reassure voters about the consequences of independence (logos-centred),
   combined with a positive vision informed by both civic nationalism and
   anti-Toryism (pathos-centred), which he constructed around his own
   character and credibility (ethos-centred). We conclude that Salmond's
   rhetoric over the course of the referendum campaign can be understood as
   part of a wider political transformation in which the legitimacy of
   Westminster decisions over Scotland is subject to regular scrutiny and
   doubt.},

Abstract = {By means of a split-ballot survey experiment, we study whether a
   normative instruction not to use the internet when answering political
   knowledge questions reduces cheating in web surveys. The knowledge
   questions refer to basic facts about the European Union and the data
   come from the Italian National Election Study web panel carried out in
   Italy before the 2014 European Election. Our analysis shows that a
   simple normative instruction significantly reduces cheating. We also
   show that reducing cheating is important to achieve a correct assessment
   of reliability of knowledge scales, while a decrease of cheating leaves
   unaltered the knowledge gap between lower and higher educated
   respondents. These results invite caution when including political
   knowledge questions in an online survey. Our advice is to include a
   normative instruction not to search the internet to reduce cheating and
   obtain more genuine answers. More generally, we conclude by stressing
   the need to consider the implications of online data collection when
   building questionnaires for public opinion research.},

Abstract = {There is an influential tradition in political science that social
   capital, defined as mutual trust and civic engagement, is linked to
   better substantive outcomes for citizens in democracies. Recently,
   scholars who link social capital to race and inequality have challenged
   this favorable picture of social capital. This study draws from the
   scholarly discussion on how social capital affects inequality in diverse
   societies. Focusing on the health care domain, I use a new dynamic
   measure of social capital to evaluate the social capital thesis and
   racial diversity thesis of inequality. Moreover, I explore how these two
   political forces are intertwined with each other in shaping the unequal
   health care access across American states. Key empirical findings
   confirm that social capital and racial diversity are counterbalancing
   forces shaping health care inequality. Despite it reduces health care
   inequality, the impact of social capital is tempered with high level of
   racial diversity.},

Abstract = {What are the incentives for parties to personalize electoral
   competition? This paper proposes that both open and closed lists give
   congruity, rather than tension, to the interests of party leaders and
   candidates. However, the efficacy of each list type depends on the
   electoral returns expected from promoting the partisan and personal
   vote. To test this argument, we analyze the choices of parties over the
   ballot structure by leveraging an unusual institutional feature of the
   Colombian legislative elections, wherein parties are allowed to present
   either an open or a closed list, varying their choices across electoral
   districts and contests. Our empirical analysis shows that parties are
   more likely to open their lists in high-magnitude districts and wherever
   they have a strong, local electoral organization. We also find a
   positive relationship between the selection of closed lists among
   personalist parties, providing evidence to previous arguments proposing
   a closed list as a tool to concentrate campaign efforts behind a
   particular candidate. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Climate change is a global social dilemma. Mitigating it is partly a
   political problemcreated by inequitable distributions of the benefits of
   carbon emissions and the costs of climate change; that is, the people
   who benefit the most are not the same set of people who pay the most
   costs. Here we use an experimental economic approach to political
   science to study these inequities. In two experiments, we show that
   people willingly create climate problems when those problems are passed
   along to others. Surprisingly, this is not further exacerbated if those
   others are from another country. We also show that, with increasing
   relative losses fromclimate change, people aremore likely to contribute
   to its mitigation. Thus, we identify a factor that makes preventing
   climate change difficult and a factor that may lead citizens to
   contribute to mitigation.},

Abstract = {We introduce a Downsian model in which policy-relevant information is
   revealed to the elected politician after the election. The electorate
   benefits from giving the elected politician discretion to adapt policies
   to his information. But limits on discretion are desirable when
   politicians do not share the electorate's policy preferences. Optimal
   political representation generally consists of a mixture of the delegate
   (no discretion) and trustee (full discretion) models. Ambiguous
   electoral platforms are essential for achieving beneficial
   representation. Nevertheless, electoral competition does not ensure
   optimal representation: The winning candidate's platform is generally
   overly ambiguous. While our theory rationalizes a positive correlation
   between ambiguity and electoral success, it shows that the relationship
   need not be causal.},

   in 2006, China has begun to regard North Korea as a strategic liability
   and supported UN sanctions against it. This policy, however, is limited

Abstract = {Discourse on the Six Party Talks has focused solely on denuclearisation.
   Through the power struggles of the members and the refusal of the
   People's Democratic Republic of Korea (DPRK) to return to negotiations,
   the Six Party Talks have been stalled since 2008. Due to current
   increased tensions and the use of brinkmanship tactics the Talks must be
   restarted, albeit under a reformed shape. This paper analyses the
   potential role of the EU in furthering the peace process in Northeast
   Asia. This paper suggests that the EU needs to be more assertive and the
   Talks should focus on building trust and cooperation, not on the DPRK's
   nuclear program. With its impartiality, experience in integration and
   use of soft power, the EU can act as an effective mediator building
   trust.},

Journal = {ELECTORAL STUDIES},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {49},
Pages = {65-74},

Abstract = {In the aftermath of elections or ballots, the legitimacy of the result
   is regularly debated if voter turnout was considered to be low. Hence,
   discussions about legal reforms to increase turnout are common in most
   democracies. We analyze the impact of a very small change in voting
   costs on voter turnout. Some municipalities in the Swiss Canton of Bern
   reduced voting costs by prepaying the postage of the return envelope
   (CHF 0.85). Prepaid postage is associated with a statistically
   significant 1.8 percentage points increase in voter turnout. Overall,
   this amounts to 4 percent more voters participating in the ballots.
   Moreover, we estimate the influence of this increase in turnout on party
   support in popular ballots. We find that social democrats and
   environmentalists see their relative support decline. (C) 2017 Elsevier

Abstract = {Analyzing the British Election Study from 1964 to 2010, we examine the
   influence of electoral context on turnout, focusing on the closeness of
   elections in terms of lagged seat and constituency-level winning
   margins. Using cross-classified multilevel models to account for
   individual and contextual factors and disentangle life cycle, cohort-
   and election-specific effects, we find that closeness strongly affects
   voting behavior, particularly among new electors. Widening seat margins
   in British elections over the last decades have had a persistent impact
   on turnout. Respondents who faced less competitive environments when
   young are more likely to abstain in subsequent elections than those
   reaching voting age after close-fought races. We conclude that
   variations in competitiveness have had both short- and long-term effects
   on turnout.},

Abstract = {Past comparative research has argued that presidential systems may
   impose a constraint on parties' ambitions in the presence of
   presidential coattails: if a party intends to become a large national
   organization, then it must be able to effectively compete for the
   presidency. In this article, we argue that this is not necessarily the
   case in multilevel presidential countries. Some parties, in fact,
   nationalize through ``presidentialization,{''} tying the party's
   fortunes in lower level elections to presidential candidates'
   performance. However, in the absence of a competitive presidential
   candidate, adapting to local electoral markets to maximize performance
   in gubernatorial races across a wide number of provinces may be the most
   effective path to nationalization. We rely on statistical analyses of
   party strategies in two presidential countries with strong federal
   institutions-Brazil and Argentina-to show that parties in multilevel
   presidential countries can pursue distinct but equally effective paths
   to nationalization.},

Abstract = {This article critically assesses the claim that smaller states may be
   structurally and socially pre-disposed towards more effective government
   performance. A review of recent experience in Iceland and Ireland
   indicates that the domestic characteristics that have been argued to
   foster superior small state performance can, under certain conditions of
   size and homogeneity, contribute to government failures. Furthermore,
   experience in these states suggests that high levels of social cohesion
   and homogeneity may increase the risk of a specific social
   phenomenon('Volkthink') with adverse consequences for public policy.},

Abstract = {We present a new, more transnational, networked perspective on
   corruption. It is premised on the importance of professional
   intermediaries who constitute networks facilitating cross-border illicit
   finance, the blurring of legal and illegal capital flows, and the
   globalization of the individual via multiple claims of residence and
   citizenship. This perspective contrasts with notions of corruption as
   epitomized by direct, unmediated transfers between bribe-givers and
   bribe-takers, disproportionately a problem of the developing world, and
   as bounded within national units. We argue that the professionals in
   major financial centers serve to lower the transaction costs of
   transnational corruption by senior foreign officials. Wealthy,
   politically powerful individuals on the margins of the law are
   increasingly globalized as they secure financial access, physical
   residence, and citizenship rights in major OECD countries. These trends
   are evidenced by an analysis of the main components of the relevant
   transnational networks: banks, shell companies, foreign real estate, and
   investor citizenship programs, based on extensive interviews with key
   informants across multiple sites.},

   History. Here, specifically, we present the relationship between teacher
   resistance and the casualization process observed by literature review
   and mainly of retired teachers memories and meanings attributed by
   teachers in activities, unveiling the category mobilization scenario in
   size of crisis, reflection and recreation of resistance. It is concluded
   that the crisis of teacher mobilization is another element to be
   understood as an instrument of the precariousness of teachers' work,
   since it is engendered for the fragmentation of the category and, in
   this perspective, it is realized.},

Abstract = {The China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) will not only enhance the
   strategic cooperation between Beijing and Islamabad, but also open up
   new avenues of economic development for the people of Balochistan.
   Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif has declared that Gwadar will be
   connected with main cities to expose the full potential of Balochistan.
   According to statistics from the Ministry of Planning, Development and
   Reform, Balochistan is estimated to receive \$7.1 billion initial
   investments through the CPEC, ranking second in its share from the total
   of \$46 billion. The CPEC will connect Pakistan to Central Asia via the
   Eurasian Land Bridge planned under China's ``Belt and Road{''}
   initiative. The Pakistani government plans to hook up the country with
   Central Asia via Termiz (Uzbekistan), making Balochistan the central
   point of economic activities in the region. Balochistan, in general, and
   Gwadar, in particular, will hopefully become the linchpin of the CPEC.
   Significantly rich in mineral resources, Balochistan can contribute to
   regional economic integration and, in turn, benefit from this economic
   opportunity greatly.},

Abstract = {Throughout history, major powers have been playing significant roles in
   leading the development of globalization. There have been three waves of
   globalization since the age of the Great Voyage, and the latest
   American-style globalization featuring neo-liberalism has suffered from
   its own institutional constraints as a result of imbalanced global
   economy and social-economic dynamics, which contributed to the election
   of President Trump and the ensuing protectionism of the United States.
   With the rise of emerging economies, the new round of globalization will
   no longer be dominated by a single major power. Given the scale of
   outbound investment and agenda-setting capabilities, emerging powers
   represented by BRICS countries are increasingly proactive in promoting
   industrialization and post-industrialization worldwide. China, in
   particular, with its institutional advantages, is endowed with
   far-reaching capabilities in pushing forward the new round of
   globalization.},

Abstract = {This essay reexamines the famous 1831 prison tours of Alexis de
   Tocqueville and Gustave de Beaumont. It reads the three texts that
   emerged from their collective research practice as a trilogy, one
   conventionally read in different disciplinary homes (Democracy in
   America in political science, On the Penitentiary in criminology, and
   Marie, Or Slavery: A Novel of Jacksonian America in literature). I argue
   that in marginalizing the trilogy's important critique of slavery and
   punishment, scholars have overemphasized the centrality of free
   institutions and ignored the unfree institutions that also anchor
   American political life. The article urges scholars in political theory
   and political science to attend to this formative moment in mass
   incarceration and carceral democracy.},

Abstract = {This article expands our knowledge about the role of civil society in
   the formulation and implementation of social policy at the regional
   level, and it focuses on the issue of HIV/AIDS in the Southern African
   Development Community (SADC). The analysis critically examines the
   conventional view that the involvement of civil society organizations in
   regional social policy contributes to participatory processes and
   reduces the democratic deficit of regional intergovernmental
   organizations. There are three key questions. Firstly, to what extent
   and how do civil society actors participate in SADC policy making and
   decision making in the field of HIV/AIDS? Secondly, what functions do
   civil society actors perform in regional policy design and
   implementation? Thirdly, what patterns of inclusion and exclusion exist?
   The study is based upon in-depth fieldwork and numerous semi-structured
   interviews with a range of policy makers, donors and civil society
   representatives. From these, it is concluded that SADC member states,
   and to some extent also the SADC Secretariat, limit and even undermine
   civil society involvement in decision making and policy formulation. By
   implication, civil society's main role lies in service delivery and
   legitimating state-steered regional social policy at the expense of
   deeper, more genuinely participatory processes.},

Journal = {ELECTORAL STUDIES},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {48},
Pages = {57-69},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Will the rising share of ethnic minorities in western societies spark a
   backlash or lead to greater acceptance of diversity? This paper examines
   this question through the prism of the UK Independence Party (UKIP), the
   most successful populist right party in British history. The paper
   contributes to work on contextual effects by arguing that ethnic levels
   and changes cross-pressure white opinion and voting. It argues that high
   levels of established ethnic minorities reduce opposition to immigration
   and support for UKIP among White Britons. Conversely, more rapid ethnic
   changes increase opposition to immigration and support for UKIP.
   Longitudinal data demonstrates that these effects are not produced by
   selfselection. The data further illustrate that with time, diversity
   levels increase their threat-reducing power while the threatening
   effects of ethnic change fade. Results suggest that the contextual
   effects literature needs to routinely unpack levels from changes. This
   also suggests that if the pace of immigration slows, immigration
   attitudes should soften and populist right voting decline. Crown

Abstract = {Institutionalizing civilian control over the military is a crucial
   challenge for newly democratized nations. This paper aims to answer the
   question under which conditions civilian control can be established
   after the transition to democracy, and under which conditions civilian
   control fails. To answer this question, we draw on original data on
   civil-military relations in 28 new democracies in Africa, Asia, Europe,
   and Latin America and run a fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis.
   We find that no single explanatory factor can be considered necessary
   for the success or failure of civilian control in new democracies, but
   identify a number of sufficient variable combinations to explain the
   development of civil-military relations after the transition to
   democracy.},

Abstract = {This article analyses the contextual determinants of parliamentary
   elites' methods of selection. Using survey data from a representative
   sample of 500 Spanish MPs, we empirically demonstrate that different
   district characteristics generate different ways of MPs' selection.
   Specifically, parties implement more exclusive ways of candidate
   selection in more competitive districts and in regional chambers. On the
   contrary, selection processes are more participative at the national
   level and where electoral competition is low.},

   number of conflicts. This helps to develop ways to resolve them, which
   in some cases, results in the appearance of the resilience. This study's
   goal was, precisely, to identify the degree, the factors, and the
   characteristics and sources of resilience used to face conflicts by
   Colombian youth leaving the foster care system.
   A mixed design was used with a concurrent triangulation strategy. A
   total of 53 youth, which had been under protection for at least two
   years and had left the system being of legal age, took part of the
   study. The instruments used were the resilience scale RS-25 and the
   phenomenological interview. The data from the scale was processed from
   descriptive statistics through SPSS and the data from the interview from
   open and axial coding through Atlas Ti.
   The results showed how this group presented a moderately high level of
   resilience, getting the best score on the factor of personal competence
   and features such as: independence, self-trust and persistence. They
   used sources as reflection and change, network building, spiritual life,
   work and education and the support from professionals to resolve
   problematic situations. The findings are key for interventions, which
   can be developed by professionals for this youth group and others with
   similar characteristics.},

Abstract = {Air pollution from vehicles has significant respiratory and
   cardiovascular effects in the population, especially in children, people
   with chronic diseases and elders. Carbon monoxide (CO) is the pollutant
   with the highest volume of emissions from car exhaust. This has
   motivated local government to implement vehicle verification programs,
   as a preventive and corrective measure to reduce pollution. The present
   research examines the average monthly concentration of CO in five cities
   from Guanajuato: Celaya, Irapuato, Leon, Salamanca, and Silao, in the
   period 1996-2016. Even though this study does not examine the causality
   relationship between the implementation of the State Program of Vehicle
   Verification (PEVV), and CO concentrations, it seeks to approximate to
   observe if the levels of CO have decreased each year, because of the
   adjustments made to the PEVV. Six paired t-test were performed for each
   city under study. The results do not indicate a clear trend, over time,
   in the reductions, or increase, of the average CO concentrations.},

Abstract = {Previous research examining the outcomes of free votes concludes that
   voting behaviour is determined in large part by MPs' personal
   preferences. However, most studies do not measure preferences directly
   and ignore other possible determinants of voting behaviour. This article
   illustrates the need to address these shortcomings before one concludes
   that preferences explain the outcomes of free votes. I illustrate this
   by examining a series of divisions on the issue of House of Lords
   reform. Using direct measures of preferences and controlling for
   alternative explanations, the analysis suggests MPs' preferences had
   little effect on voting behaviour on this issue.},

Abstract = {Democratic and Republican partisans dislike the opposing party and its
   leaders far more than in the past. However, recent studies have argued
   that the rise of affective polarization in the electorate does not
   reflect growing policy or ideological differences between supporters of
   the two parties. According to this view, though Democratic and
   Republican elites are sharply divided along ideological lines,
   differences between the policy preferences of rank-and-file partisans
   remain modest. In this article, we show that there is a close connection
   between ideological and affective polarization. We present evidence from
   American National Election Studies surveys that opinions on social
   welfare issues have become increasingly consistent and divided along
   party lines and that social welfare ideology is now strongly related to
   feelings about the opposing party and its leaders. In addition, we
   present results from a survey experiment showing that ideological
   distance strongly influences feelings toward opposing party candidates
   and the party as a whole.},

Abstract = {As a consequence of the international crisis in 2008-2009, the role of
   exports in economic growth came into focus in most countries. Exports of
   EU Member States gained momentum from 2010 onward but with certain
   changes in their structure and direction. In several countries, the turn
   towards non-EU areas, such as China or Latin America was part of the
   state export strategy. On the one hand, our article describes these
   foreign trade strategies and their institutional framework of the
   Iberian, Baltic and Central European governments, detecting possible
   similarities. On the other hand, we analyse recent export data. This way
   we can get a picture on the structure and direction of exports of
   periphery economies and this can be compared to the aims of the given
   states. Our hypothesis is that there is a gap between the reality and
   the intentions of the governments. The size of this gap varies and is
   influenced by certain factors such as the different involvement of
   multinational companies in foreign trade or the different economic
   structure of these countries. In our paper we list which countries
   adopted a government strategy and with what aim. We provide a short
   literature review on state trade promotion policies and discuss these
   policies and their institutions in the Baltic, Visegrad and Iberian
   countries.},

Abstract = {Unified Republican Party control of the federal government after the
   2016 election brought a reversal of several Obama administration
   policies, especially those adopted via executive and administrative
   action in areas such as immigration, energy, the environment, and LGBT
   rights. The 2016 election also prompted a reversal of partisan
   perspectives with respect to federal-state relations, as Republicans in
   Washington moved to preempt state discretion in various areas, whereas
   Democrats in state capitols challenged the legality of presidential
   actions and resisted federal efforts to constrain state and local
   discretion. In this essay, we discuss these themes through an analysis
   of developments in 2016 and early 2017 regarding health care,
   immigration, education, marijuana, and energy and environmental policy.
   We also consider key U.S. Supreme Court decisions affecting the contours
   of state policymaking.},

Abstract = {This article seeks to describe the interference of cybernetics as a key
   intervening factor in the consolidation of information as a power
   resource in the 21st century. Aware that information is the main
   substrate for the practice of intelligence, the studies carried out also
   seek to understand the transformations generated by the inclusion of
   cyberspace in this practice, highlighting how the particular
   characteristics of this domain are responsible for generating new
   demands to States in terms of defense and security. In order to achieve
   the proposed objectives, this paper is structured into three main
   discussion topics. The first one will hold a brief discussion about the
   particular characteristics of this new domain and its political
   significance to International Relations. The second topic will deal
   directly with the issues of intelligence and an evaluation of the
   interference of cyberspace in the intelligence practice will be carried
   out focusing on the study of the North American - dedicating a third
   topic to such discussion. In methodological terms it is a descriptive
   work; therefore, it will be guide by the analysis of international
   events that approach this subject, as well as by the literature that
   dedicated to such discussions. This article does not seek to end with
   such questions, but to present itself as a north to future discussions
   on this subject.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this article is to determine whether degenerative
   politics, a central proposition of democratic policy design theory or
   social constructivism, has been evident in Canadian youth criminal
   justice policy. Using a synchronic and diachronic case study design, the
   article conducts a rigorous content analysis of the legislative debates
   leading to the Young Offenders Act in 1982 and the Youth Criminal
   Justice Act in 2002. Policy makers' social constructions of violent and
   nonviolent young offenders are measured, along with the benefit/burden
   content of the legislation, to determine whether young offenders have
   been caught in the downward spiral of degenerative politics. It finds
   evidence of degenerative politics for violent young offenders but not
   for nonviolent young offenders and explores some of the reasons for this
   divergence.},

   responses to immigrant welfare dependence in 15 West European welfare

Abstract = {Academics have long predicted the tension between immigration and
   welfare to lead to the erosion of redistributive institutions, but
   empirical studies have found little evidence for that prediction. This
   paper argues that concerns about immigrant welfare dependence are more
   likely to lead to one or more of the following three responses: (1)
   changes to admission policies aimed at attracting those immigrants who
   are least likely to turn to the state for financial support; (2)
   restrictions on immigrants' access to social programmes and benefits;
   and (3) extensive integration services and immigrant-targeted labour
   market programmes. Combining a content analysis of party manifestoes and
   secondary analysis of cross-national survey data, this paper maps the
   views of parties and voters on these possible strategies in 15 Western
   European welfare states. The analysis reaches three main conclusions.
   First, the currency these responses enjoy differs strikingly from one
   country to another. Second, ideological affiliation helps to explain
   some of the variation within countries. Third, by and large the views of
   voters and the position of political parties seem to be in line with
   each other, albeit with important exceptions.},

Abstract = {This article offers one possible answer to the question ``What is the
   future of feminist political science?{''} by outlining and defending an
   expansionist agenda that is centred on challenging the male-female
   binary that has been upheld and replicated in the discipline to date.
   Such an approach draws heavily on the insights of intersectional
   analyses, transgender, queer and gender-fluid articulations of identity
   and requires that the field of political science investigate the varied
   and complex gendered experiences of ``men.{''} Overall, this article
   argues that such as expansionist agenda is key to responding to the
   interrelated challenges presented by the perceived ``crisis{''} of
   feminism and the ongoing ``masculinity{''} of the discipline of
   political science.},

   Theories},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF POLITICS AND LAW},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {10},
Number = {3},
Pages = {1-12},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {With the expansion of Islamism, a wave of Islam phobia was launched by
   western Orientalists and intensified subsequent to September 11 Attacks.
   Theoretically, the subject of adaptation and compatibility or contrast
   between Islam and democracy has drawn the attention of academic circles.
   Using a comparative and analytical research procedure, the current
   article seeks to provide an answer to this question: In the area of
   Adaptation and Contrast Theories, what is the nature of the relationship
   between Islam and democracy? The research's hypothesis is that: from
   Contrast perspective, adaptation between democracy and Islam is not
   possible due to ontological and epistemological differences. In
   contrast, given the existing rational and democratic potentials within
   the framework of genuine Islamic fundamentals, democratic empirical
   examples such as democratic attitudes and demands in Islam world and
   democratic governance in the Middle East countries and Islam world,
   adaptation oriented parties believe in the existence of contextualized
   democracy within the framework of Islam. Using a critical reappraisal,
   it must be noted that, in spite of some deficits, Adaptation is more
   tenable, while Contrast and Essentialism are not sufficiently tenable
   due to some causes including failure to make a distinction between
   Islam's basic fundamentals and history of Islam, the performance of
   authoritarian regimes and radical Islamists, universalization of
   liberal-secular democracy discourse and its combination with western
   ethnic chauvinism and propaganda of Islam phobia and defamation to
   Islam.},

Abstract = {This article analyzes the Every Student Succeeds Act of 2015 and the
   evolving role of the federal government in educational policy. We rely
   on John Kingdon's policy window framework to evaluate how key political
   constituencies on both the political right and left pressured Congress
   to limit both the executive branch and federal roles in educational
   policy. We find that policies during the Obama Administration shifted
   political attitudes on key issues and within key constituencies that had
   previously supported a stronger federal role. We conclude with a
   discussion of how this shift in federal education policy can yield
   insights applicable to other policy areas and also how this informs the
   current direction of federal-state relations.},

Abstract = {Vanguardism has generally been studied in the context of the Cuban
   Revolution, as a guiding framework for revolutionary movements around
   the world. In Guevara's conception, the vanguard group is ideologically
   more advanced than the masses; the masses understand the new values, but
   not sufficiently, while among the vanguard group there has been a
   qualitative change that allows it to make sacrifices in its capacity as
   an advance guard. A vanguardist organization exhibits distinctive
   characteristics; it is capable of rapid change; it has the necessary
   tactics and can plan insurrection and military operations; and it
   requires a centralized authority and discipline of the highest order and
   strong leadership developed over a long period. Historical context and
   legitimacy are central elements in vanguardism. The vanguardist
   organization seeks social fitness and legitimacy that is compatible with
   the dominant social class to gain political control and governmental
   power. This study describes the vanguardist organization through an
   examination of the rise of the Sandinista National Liberation Front to
   power in Nicaragua during the 1970s.},

Abstract = {This article briefly examines the political and ideological aspects of
   Western countries' post-Cold War approach to the world order. The
   Western triumph in the ColdWar is generally attributed to reasons that
   are largely erroneous. The ongoing crises in international relations
   reveal structural inconsistencies, which have been present in the United
   States' foreign strategy since the collapse of the Soviet Union and have
   contributed to the subsequent erosion of the global order. The article
   analyzes the new trends of globalization resulting from the unexpected
   victory of Donald Trump in the 2016 U. S. presidential election. It
   concludes that Russia and China have now largely recognized Washington's
   failure to establish a unipolar world system and to legitimize it
   through various political and media mechanisms and techniques. It
   suggests that it is only through the solidary development that both
   China and Russia are currently championing with their recent grand
   integration initiatives that a more successful and sustainable
   multipolar world benefiting every nation on the planet can be built and
   maintained.},

Abstract = {The U.S. Constitution is best understood not as a ``social contract,{''}
   but as a popularly issued corporate charter. The earliest American
   colonies were literal corporations of the Crown and, like all
   corporations, were ruled by limited governments established by their
   charters. From this, Americans derived their understanding of what a
   constitution is-the written charter of a sovereign that ordains and
   limits a government. The key Federalist innovation was to substitute the
   People for the King as the chartering sovereign. This effectively
   transferred the `` governance technology{''} of the corporation to the
   civil government-including the practice of delegating authority via a
   written charter, charter amendment, and judicial review. Federalists
   used these corporate practices to frame a government that united seeming
   irreconcilables-a government energetic yet limited, republican yet
   mixed, popular yet antipopulist-yielding a corporate solution to the
   problem of arbitrary rule. Leading founders considered this new
   government a literal chartered corporation of the People..},

Abstract = {This paper offers some new results in a long-run research in the area of
   Political Rhetoric. The chief aim has been to elucidate the nature of
   discourse hegemony and political identities in XXI Century Argentina.
   The specific aim is to describe the foundational gestures of two winning
   electoral coalitions, the Peronist-Kircherist FPV and the insurgent
   Cambiemos-PRO (nowadays in office). We assume they offer clues, within
   the framework of constitutive rhetoric, in order to understand which
   discourse space new governments are designing for the Argentine
   political field to cope with the global challenges of the post-2001
   crisis. In short, we aim to study how political discourses bet through
   rhetoric on performing groups. Our research suggests that each political
   formation constructs a present narrative in relation both to a
   vindicated past and a repudiated one, as well as in relation with a
   desired future. For Kirchnerists, this meant building a clear-cut
   rhetorical antinomy, based upon the trope of anachronism, between the
   prophetical figment of national capitalism and the neo liberal utopia of
   the previous years. On the other hand, Cambiemos-Pro designs a
   `futuristic' discourse space that envisions a ``21st Century
   Argentina{''} laboriously built on the ruins left by the Kirchner's
   dynastic cleptocracy and crony-capitalism. The apologetics of the future
   is, in this sense, proportional to the alleged uselessness of a rejected
   past.},

Abstract = {Post-war constitution-making touches the future identity of the
   concerned society. In externally led democratization, it can turn into a
   challenging negotiation process between international and so-called
   local actors. But who can claim the authority to define and interpret
   identity and fundamental norms of society, and on what grounds? Based on
   an analysis of the Joint Working Group on the Constitutional Framework
   held in spring 2001 in Kosovo, the article argues that external actors
   have a structural disadvantage in the authoritative communication with
   local actors, even if equipped with a strong international mandate.
   While external actors can set the opportunity structures to negotiate
   constitutional politics, local actors will use every chance to
   publically claim authority on their behalf in the process. Guided by the
   theoretical framework of interpretative authority (Deutungsmacht), the
   article concludes that we have to understand authority in statebuilding
   primarily, not as an attribute of actors, but as an outcome of
   communicative practices.},

Abstract = {In times of political effervescence, the number of pamphlets and
   newspapers editions tends to increase. Accordingly, the different
   instances in the life of a political movement can be traced through the
   type of intervention proposed by its publications. The rise of the
   anarchist movement publishing activity in Buenos Aires preceded its
   relevance within trade union during the first years of the 20th century.
   Until that moment the few ``popular editions{''} published in the
   country consisted in literary works. In that context, Anarchism
   generated a novel circuit of texts through which an unprecedented
   relationship between printers, politics, authors, publishers and readers
   was established. Therefore, the decentralized financing and
   dissemination practices of the anarchist publishing movement revealed a
   broad thematic range of political concerns, that would finally shape,
   over the decades, the editorial interests of the libertarian movement:
   gremialism, sexuality, emancipation of women, naturism, education,
   anti-nationalism, anti-militarism and anticlericalism. This work
   provides an itinerary for the main libertarian publishing projects La
   questione sociale, Sociological Library, La Protesta, Fueyo, Angel
   Zucarrelli, Argonauta, Atlas, La Palestra, Nero, Iman, Tupac, Rebuild,
   Americalee and Projection in order to determine the specific
   characteristics of these publishers within the history of the book and
   textual editing in Argentina.},

Abstract = {The ideational narrative power of law has now solidified, and continues
   to solidify, `European Union health law', into an entity with a
   distinctive legal identity. EU health law was previously seen as either
   non-existent, or so broad as to be meaningless, or as existing only in
   relations between EU law and health (the `and' approach), or as
   consisting of a body of barely or loosely connected policy domains (the
   `patchwork' approach). The process of bringing EU health law into being
   is a process of narration. The ways in which EU health law is narrated
   (and continues to be narrated) involve three main groups of actors: the
   legislature, courts and the academy.},

Abstract = {In mixed-member electoral systems, voters usually have two votes: a
   nominal and a list vote. According to some studies, voters are
   increasingly using them to cast a split-ticket vote. However, very
   little is known about whether the type of mixed-member system, and in
   particular whether the allocation of seats across tiers is linked or
   not, creates different sets of incentives for this behaviour. This
   article provides new insights into the topic by analysing survey data
   from seven countries and 18 elections since 1990. It is found that the
   proportion of splitticket votes is greater in mixed-member proportional
   than in mixed-member majoritarian systems. The results suggest that
   voters understand the operation of the electoral system and its
   consequences for the distribution of seats among parties, and adapt
   their behaviour accordingly.},

Abstract = {What was the impact of Machiavelli's political thought on early-modern
   Dutch colonialism? This article zooms in on Dutch Brazil between 1630
   and 1654 to argue that the Dutch employed a distinctive notion of
   Machiavellian reason of state to theorize and legitimize their expansion
   overseas. Discussing the work of the prominent humanist scholar Caspar
   Barlaeus and his presentation of governor-general Johan Maurits of
   Nassau as a colonial prince, the article shows that the period of Dutch
   rule in Brazil provided the setting where Machiavelli was adapted to the
   concerns of a modern commercial empire.},

Abstract = {When elections are free and fair, why do some political parties rule for
   prolonged periods of time? Most explanations for single-party dominance
   focus on the dominant party's origins, resources, or strategies. In this
   article, we show how opposition parties can undermine or sustain
   single-party dominance. Specifically, opposition parties should be
   central in explaining single-party dominance in countries with highly
   disproportional electoral systems and a dominant party whose vote share
   falls short of a popular majority. Employing a quantitative analysis of
   Indian legislative elections as well as a paired case study, we show
   that opposition coordination plays a crucial part in undermining
   single-party dominance.},

Abstract = {In the relevant literature, policy convergence is broadly defined as the
   gradual process through which countries acquire similar traits in terms
   of one or more policy characteristics such as objectives, inputs,
   instruments, outputs. Within the broader policy convergence discourse,
   this paper empirically investigates the presence of a defence policy
   convergence in the NATO alliance. Defence spending expressed as a share
   of GDP represents the resources countries allocate to the production of
   military capabilities and is adopted as the variable through which the
   question at hand is examined. In broad terms, results reported herein
   from beta and sigma-convergence methodologies as well as from Markov
   chains, suggest the presence of a defence policy convergence process.},

Abstract = {Basic income advocates propose a model that they believe will
   dramatically improve on current welfare programmes by alleviating
   poverty, reducing involuntary unemployment and social exclusion,
   redistributing care work, achieving a better work-life balance, and so
   on. Whether these expected social effects materialise in practice
   critically depends on how the model is implemented, but on this topic
   the basic income debate remains largely silent. Few advocates explicitly
   consider questions of implementation, and those that do are typically
   dismissive of the administrative challenges of implementing a basic
   income and critical (even overtly hostile) towards bureaucracy. In this
   contribution we briefly examine (and rebut) several reasons that have
   led basic income advocates to ignore administration. The main peril of
   such neglect, we argue, is that it misleads basic income advocates into
   a form of Panglossian optimism that risks causing basic income advocacy
   to become self-defeating.},

Abstract = {This article applies the concept of mediatization to the French
   presidential office, with a comparative focus on the two most recent
   incumbents, Nicolas Sarkozy and Francois Hollande. The central argument
   is that Sarkozy's presidential leadership, both symbolically and
   substantively, was more influenced by media logic than that of Hollande,
   notably during the first two years of the latter's tenure. The paper
   thus emphasizes the relative autonomy of the presidential incumbent as
   the principal executive actor operating within a significantly bounded
   national political communication system. In so doing it stresses the
   importance of agency as a key variable in any assessment of the
   mediatization of executive leadership, not just in France, but by
   extension in other established democracies.},

Abstract = {Coalition parties have to reconcile two competing logics: they need to
   demonstrate unity to govern together, but also have to emphasize their
   own profile to succeed in elections. We argue that the electoral cycle
   explains whether unity or differentiation prevails. While
   differentiation dominates at the beginning and the end of the
   legislative term in close proximity to elections, compromise dominates
   the middle of the term when coalition governments focus on enacting a
   common policy agenda. To test our theoretical claims, we draw on an
   innovative quantitative text analysis of more than 21,000 press releases
   published by coalition parties from 2000 until 2010.},

Abstract = {The Cameron government has recently negotiated a deal with the EU which
   permits the UK (temporarily) to restrict access to in-work benefits for
   recent EU migrants in the first four years of residence. Withdrawing
   access to in-work benefits will lead to significant inequalities in pay
   between British workers and their EU equivalents working at the same
   job, in the same general situation. The proposal has been widely decried
   as discriminatory. Is it? I do not, in this article, ask the legal
   question: Does it violate anti-discrimination norms implicit in the
   treaties (or wider human rights law)? Rather, I will ask the moral
   question underlying the legal one: Would, say, Polish citizens denied
   in-work benefits that British citizens receive be victims of wrongful
   discrimination? This question deserves consideration not simply because
   it will help us to evaluate some of the central concerns at stake in the
   Brexit debates but also because it will allow us to explore the role of
   norms against discrimination according to nationality within the EU, to
   address the nature of the European commitment to freedom of movement,
   and, in the reverse direction, to better understand our own moral
   commitment to anti-discrimination norms.},

   deployed in an unfriendly location and most of time it works without
   human management; individual node may possibly be compromised by the
   adversary due to some constraints. In this manner, the security of a
   wireless sensor network is critical. This work will focus on evaluation
   of mining techniques that can be used to find malicious nodes. The
   detection mechanisms provide the accuracy of the classification using
   different algorithm to detect the malicious node. Pragmatically the
   detection accuracy of J48 is 99.17\%, Random Forest is 80.83\%, NF Tree
   is 81.67\% and BF Tree is 72.33\%. J48 have very high detection accuracy
   as compared with BF Tree, NF Tree Random Forest.},

Abstract = {There is widespread agreement that the European Union is presently
   suffering from a lack of social justice. Yet there is significant
   disagreement about what the relevant injustice consists in: Federalists
   believe the EU can only remedy its justice deficit through the
   introduction of direct interpersonal transfers between people living in
   separate states. Intergovernmentalists believe the justice-related
   purpose of the EU is to enable states to cooperate fairly, and to remain
   internally just and democratic in the face of increased global pressure
   on welfare states. I suggest that despite their fundamental differences,
   many of the most reasonable and prominent philosophical accounts of
   social justice in the EU nonetheless converge in their institutional
   prescriptions. In particular, they may each serve as a justificatory
   basis for introducing the European social minimum, an EU-wide income
   support scheme.},

Abstract = {This study investigates soft' forms of direct democracy and identifies
   factors that explain their occurrence. Soft direct democracy refers to
   non-binding referendum motions and advisory referendums, which the
   literature on direct democracy has largely ignored. Strategic motives
   have dominated previous explanations of the occurrence of initiatives
   and referendums, but are less useful in exploring non-binding procedures
   of direct democracy. The article distinguishes four types of factors -
   socio-structural, party system, political support and learning - and
   tests hypotheses on their effects with sub-national data from Finland.
   The data enable us to compare two different types of instruments -
   non-binding referendum motions and advisory referendums - while
   controlling for many unobserved factors. The findings show that erosion
   of political support, participatory traditions and policy diffusion
   explain the occurrence of bottom-up referendum motions, while the last
   two together with small population and party system factors predict the
   occurrence of advisory government-initiated referendums.},

Abstract = {Cadaster refers to a system involving comprehensive geometric data on
   real estate across a country along with full details of properties,
   owners and respective rights. It can provide a dynamic administration of
   real estate datasets so that tasks are carried out at maximum efficiency
   and quality. From the legal point of view, a cadaster survey seeks to
   specify 4 essential characteristics concerning immovable property,
   including owner, ownership transfer practices, geographic location,
   dimensions (area) based on primary and secondary registration numbers,
   quality and quantity of properties. By determining these parameters and
   registering them in single- sheet cadastral deeds as well as an online
   database, a great step can be taken to mitigate the rate of violations
   and crimes related to property registration, and subsequently reduce the
   lawsuits. Nowadays, it is critical to implement a land and real estate
   registration system in any country, since it can facilitate the
   sustainable development of the central government, provide security of
   tenure and property ownership rights, facilitate investment in the real
   estate market and the transactions, guarantee a transparent, efficient
   property evaluation and ultimately set the groundwork for planning and
   utilizing lands and achieving sustainable development. It is crucial to
   emphasize the fact that the Iranian economic and industrial development
   has posed numerous new obstacles against authorities in charge of the
   cadaster survey and registration of land ownership, since they have to
   take caution about the potential demand and dynamism of the cadaster
   expansion in the future. As a result, the cadaster expansion should be
   constantly monitored to ensure its compliance and support for adopting
   appropriate decisions, optimally managing the lands, minimizing the
   detrimental consequences of environmental changes and their consistency
   with the current and upcoming requirements. The continuous development
   of cadaster systems and their capability to cooperate with other
   national databases is vital for ensuring all needs are met in various
   economic sectors and providing reliable data update on real estate.},

Title = {The Historical Presidency: A Theoretical Critique of the Unitary

Abstract = {The unitary executive framework assumes that all presidents hold the
   same structural advantages relative to Congress or the Courta
   first-mover advantage, a collective-action advantage, and an
   informational advantage. Therefore, variation is sought in changes in
   peripheral institutional conditions such as party control of the
   presidency, congressional support, and public approval. In this article,
   I provide a theoretical critique of the unitary executive framework. I
   show that its foundational assumptions do not hold in practice, and I
   develop an argument based on the simple idea that systems of
   administration for individual policy domains change substantially from
   time to time. Specifically, I contend that when the president relies on
   the established collective-action and informational arrangement, it
   often obstructs or compromises his first-mover advantage. Conversely,
   the president's first-mover advantage in a policy domain is strengthened
   when he restructures the established collective-action and informational
   arrangement.},

Title = {China's Soft Power in Tanzania: Opportunities and Challenges},
Journal = {CHINA QUARTERLY OF INTERNATIONAL STRATEGIC STUDIES},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {3},
Number = {1},
Pages = {79-100},
Month = {SPR},
Abstract = {In recent years, China has embraced the idea of soft power with ever
   more keen interest. Today, soft power is Beijing's key strategy in
   international politics, albeit not in the way the concept is understood
   and applied in the West. However, this strategy can hardly be said to
   have yielded fruit in Africa despite China's growing visibility and
   presence over the last two decades. This article aims at probing this
   issue by examining how China's soft power is manifested in Tanzania. In
   an attempt to show that soft power is not entirely a new practice in
   international politics, the article first applies a historical
   perspective to illustrate that it has been part and parcel of Chinese
   diplomacy, long before the term was coined by Joseph Nye in 1990. The
   article then analyzes Chinese activities in Tanzania and how they have
   shaped perceptions of Tanzanians of China in the era of globalization.
   These activities are structured in line with three traditional sources
   of soft power as postulated by Nye, namely culture, political values and
   foreign policy. As a supplement to Nye's definition, however, elements
   of hard power are also included in the article, such as the use of
   economic inducements to produce, bolster and wield soft power. In
   general, China has made headway in its soft power ambitions by gaining
   positive reviews in Tanzania. While the current achievement is crucial
   as an initial step, there is still a long way to go for China in
   consolidating its soft power. Although China has earned admiration in
   some quarters of Tanzanian society, it is still premature to assume that
   in the long run Beijing will continue to enjoy increasing soft power in
   the country. Indeed, in some cases, such admiration only exists in
   verbal recognition. In the meantime, activities that damage China's
   image have further complicated matters and undermined China's soft power
   in Tanzania.},

Journal = {JAPANESE JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE},

Volume = {18},
Number = {1},
Pages = {41-66},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {It has been one of the most debated puzzles in the study of political
   economy of terrorism whether economic development can curb terrorism. In
   Xinjiang, a multi-ethnic region in West China, it is widely believed
   that higher income levels can decrease the likelihood of terrorism
   conducted by Uyghur separatists or Islamic extremists. However, the
   county-level data for the year of 2013 show that better economic
   performance may not work as is expected. Instead, empirical evidence
   indicates that income is positively associated with the probability of
   terrorist attacks, and the effect is statistically significant. Projects
   that are aimed at boosting local economic growth result in a flood of
   migrants, and the local Uyghurs are disadvantaged in the employment
   market. Consequently, economic grievances will be generated. Some, but
   not all, Uyghurs have a shared motivation to resist, but tight social
   control in the region constrains the form of resistance, in the sense
   that neither mass protests nor armed rebellion are feasible. Terrorist
   attacks that come at a lower cost become a preferable choice. In
   addition to economic grievances and tight control, external factors also
   help to boost terrorist activities in Xinjiang, but more empirical and
   field research is needed before we could clarify how external factors,
   such as the international jihadist movement, interact with local
   conditions and result in terrorism in the region.},

Abstract = {The relatively low proportion of people in ethnic and national minority
   groups in Scotland has been an obstacle for social research concerning
   these minorities, especially in characterising and comparing these
   populations using large scale data. The 2011 census offers an invaluable
   resource in this regard, especially at a time when minorities are
   growing to represent a more prominent and significant element in
   Scotland's population. This paper uses standard aggregate census data
   and data derived from a 5\% sample of census returns to provide an
   overview and comparison of the six largest minority groups in Scotland,
   focusing on the origins, identities and socio-economic status of people
   within these groups. It not only highlights how different minorities
   contrast with each other and the majority population, but also
   illuminates the diversity that exists within these groups.},

Abstract = {The problem of trolls exemplifies the challenges of building democratic
   communities in the digital environment of social media. Distinguishing
   trolls from activists can be difficult; democratic theorists have yet to
   adequately address how to prevent the former while remaining open to the
   latter. In this article, I outline a theory of democratic politics that
   takes space as a central element in shaping democratic interactions.
   Using the work of John Dewey, I draw out two key characteristics of
   democratic space: boundedness and flexibility. Using these criteria, I
   then evaluate Kinja, Gawker Media's commenting platform, both before and
   after trolls attacked the site in 2014. I find that in altering its
   boundaries to successfully protect against trolls, Kinja introduced a
   new problem: a lack of flexibility that continues to affect the
   possibility for democratic discourse on the platform. I conclude by
   suggesting how this theory of democratic space might shape future
   research.},

   Accountability},
Journal = {AMERICAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {111},
Number = {1},
Pages = {129-148},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {We study how representation works in a context where accountability to
   voters is restricted because of term limits and accountability to
   parties is limited because of party weakness. Analyzing all Brazilian
   mayoral elections between 1996 and 2012 using a regression discontinuity
   design, we show that becoming the incumbent party results in large
   subsequent electoral losses. We theorize that the presence of term
   limits, combined with political parties to which politicians are only
   weakly attached, affects the incentives and behavior of individual
   politicians in such a way that their parties' suffer systematic losses.
   A descriptive analysis of an original dataset on the career paths of
   Brazilian mayors suggests that our assumptions are an accurate
   description of Brazil's political context, and we find support for three
   central empirical implications of our theoretical explanation. Moreover,
   based on an analysis of additional data from Mexico, Peru, Chile, Costa
   Rica, and Colombia, we show that the negative effects found in Brazil
   also exist in other democracies.},

Abstract = {Vetting/lustration/purging is one of many transitional justice
   mechanisms, designed for addressing the atrocities of a former regime,
   restoring peace, providing justice and engendering unity and
   reconciliation. It specifically aims to purify the public sphere of
   former regime members or of people who lack integrity. de-Ba'thification
   of Iraq is one of the latest transitional justice mechanism that can be
   examined under this category. The process of de-Ba'thification holds
   lessons and provides valuable insight into policy-making well beyond the
   Iraqi context. This article presents a detailed analysis of the
   implementation of de-Ba'thification process in Iraq and a number of
   lessons to be learned/relearned by policy-makers. Data gathering
   involves in-depth and formal interviews with the designers and
   implementers of de-Ba'thification project including Coalition
   Provisional Authority (CPA) administrator and advisors; Higher National
   de-Ba'thification Commission (HNDBC) and Accountability and Justice
   Commission (AJC) members; other US and Iraqi officials.},

Abstract = {Biotechnology has many applications in environment (clean up or prevent
   its degradation), agriculture (increased efficiency and productivity),
   medical (new methods of treatment or new drugs) and various industries,
   including Oil industry (elimination of oil pollution), textile products
   (increasing the quality of textiles) and food industry (raising the
   quantity and quality of food). But there are also concerns relating to
   some unknown aspects, effects and consequence of biotechnology in a way
   that the long-term effects are not so clear on human health or on the
   environment in the agriculture and in the food industry on the health of
   consumers. For example, gene therapy and genetic drugs, can cause some
   genetic complications or biotechnological product may cause growth of
   useless or harmful like weeds resistant to pesticides and even pollute
   the environment by disrupting the function in agriculture. Of course to
   address this concern, there are some principles such as biological
   safety and the necessity assess the risks arising from the use of this
   product, and prudent use of these innovations on the domestic and
   international level. Ethical considerations and objections have been
   raised by the moralists in terms of loss of intrinsic value of life due
   to manipulate by biotechnology or threaten the dignity of living
   creatures with dominance and monopoly over them. These considerations
   will be strongly when we are confronted with the fact that the granting
   of monopoly to biotechnology can lead to the misuse of this knowledge
   against humans and other organisms. Of course, there are ways to prevent
   or address these abuses, including the abolition of the patent or
   parallel import of product or granting licenses to others. In addition,
   human rights lovers also believe that the granting of monopoly and
   patent to the achievements of this science is In some cases contrary to
   human rights So have objected to it. Like threaten the right to health
   and healthy food (in terms of risk to human health resulting from
   biotechnology. Threaten the right to work (due to market monopolization
   by big companies and unemployment and the gradual elimination of small
   farmers) and threaten the right to a healthy environment (due to
   possible adverse effects on the environment and biodiversity). Of
   course, these concerns can be reduced by international regulations such
   as the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety. Another challenge is on how to
   prove damages resulting from biotech crops to the environment, people
   and their property and also proving the causal relationship between the
   biotech and damage is difficult because their harmful and unknown
   effects usually becomes apparent in long-term and this makes it hard to
   prove a causality relationship. Also in such damages, the best way of
   compensation (i.e. restore the former state) is difficult or impossible.
   Because the reproducibility of biotechnology can reduce the ability to
   control on extent of damage and the harmful effects. However, concerns
   have been reduced slightly by stipulating strict liability for the
   damage in international regulations.},

Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {This research analyzes the similarities and differences between The
   Islamic State ( IS) and Boko Haram in order to enrich the growing debate
   on the threat they pose to international security. Using the relative
   deprivation theory, the research argues that both groups are similar in
   their use of radical Islamic ideology to mobilize political, economic
   and socially aggrieved communities towards violence via hybrid warfare
   against status quo forces deemed unjust. However, they differ in their
   strategic goal, organizational structure, membership, financing and
   capabilities. These differences stem from the different strategic
   outlook of the two groups, with Boko Haram more focused on change in
   Nigeria and its immediate environs while IS has an ambitious global
   agenda of an Islamic Caliphate. Understanding these similarities and
   differences are necessary to effectively combat the security threats
   they both pose.},

Pages = {192-204},
Abstract = {The African Union's mediation mandate for the Libya crisis of 2011
   derived from the organization's Constitutive Act and the United Nations
   Charter. The African Union activated this constitutional mandate by
   designing a roadmap to end the crisis peacefully. However, the roadmap's
   incompatibility with the UN Security Council mandate on the use of force
   and its lack of clarity on the future of Muamar Gaddafi discredited it
   in the eyes of the rebels and the United Nations. The African Union
   obtained a mandate to mediate from Gaddafi but not from the rebels, and
   its mediation proved ill-designed to deal with the crisis. These factors
   contributed to the failure of the mediation effort.},

Title = {TRANSFORMATION OF GLOBAL WORLD ORDER: DYNAMICS OF SYSTEMIC CHANGES},
Journal = {POLIS-POLITICHESKIYE ISSLEDOVANIYA},
Year = {2017},
Number = {3},
Pages = {71-91},
Abstract = {The author considers the global changes to be an intrinsic part of the
   continuing formation of a new international political system, which is
   replacing the classical bipolarity; thereby, he opposes the approaches
   that describe the global changes as a process of destruction of the
   previous world order and the entry into an unstable era of the universal
   collapse of the ``game by the rules{''}. The author pays particular
   attention to an in-depth analysis of the current configuration of the
   international system, as well as to various scenarios of its
   development, such as: the revival of the unipolar world order or some
   kind of ``new bipolarity{''}; slipping down to chaos; recreation of the
   ``concert of nations{''} or multipolarity as a fundamentally new global
   configuration of power. The article analyzes the dynamics of the global
   centers of development, the corresponding downward and upward trends,
   the transformation of geopolitical space, and formation of the new
   actors of the global politics. Upon studying the structural shifts in
   the transforming inner hierarchy of the international system (including
   the expansion of the pool of countries aspiring to the core of the world
   international political system), the author concludes that a new
   configuration and a new balance of power are taking their shape on the
   global and the regional level. The author sees the global balance of
   this emerging new global hierarchy, in the context of virtually
   inevitable new global cleavages, as one of the key challenges facing the
   world community. In this framework, crucial role is played by the
   existing and newly built mechanisms and formats of the global
   regulation. In conclusion, the author discusses the most acute problems
   of international political development, namely provision of the global
   security, the nuclear nonproliferation regime, the mechanisms for
   containing transboundary use of force, the country status of
   territories, as well as sets forth the task and criteria for achieving a
   mature world order.},

Abstract = {Indigenous and non-indigenous communities in Latin America make land
   claims and support them with a variety of arguments. Some, such as

   Other groups, such as MST in Brazil, have appealed to the extremely
   unequal distribution of the land and the effects of this on the poor;
   the land in this case is seen mainly as a means for securing a decent
   standard of living for members of disadvantaged groups. Although there
   is a large literature on the history as well as the social and political
   dimensions of land contestations and conflicts in Latin America, the
   question of whether the land claims put forward by disadvantaged groups
   can be morally justified has not been adequately examined. In this
   essay, we investigate the scope and limits of appeals to what we shall
   call assistance-based, contribution-based, and benefitting-based moral
   reasons with respect to land claims made by these disadvantaged groups.},

Abstract = {This article analyzes the political, economic, and social events that
   occurred in Uruguay in 2016. This was a key year in Uruguayan politics
   given that a series of political and economic challenges put the ruling
   Frente Amplio (FA) under real strain, perhaps for the first time since
   it came to office. First, the Frente Amplio lost its parliamentary
   majority in the Chamber of Deputies, which created a completely new
   scenario for the government. Second, the fiscal deficit reached 4\% of
   GDP in December 2016: the largest deficit in more than two decades. This
   poses a challenge to both the government and its leftist agenda. Third,
   public approval of President vazquez has declined dramatically, leading
   to a situation in which more Uruguayans disapprove of their President
   than support him-something that has not happened since 2005. Finally,
   the accusations that led Vice-President Sendic to resign increased
   political tensions within the ruling coalition. This constellation of
   factors suggests that the extended honeymoon the Frente Amplio had
   enjoyed is now over.},

Abstract = {The paper aims to conduct a case study of the Fernando Lugo's
   impeachment process, which occurred in 2012 that caused his deposition
   as president of the Republic of Paraguay. Through the Gramscian
   analytical and conceptual contribution, we have listed 15 topics of
   analysis that allow us to understand the structural and cyclical
   phenomena that influenced the process studied, as well achie ve us to
   present and discuss the effects of impeachment process for the
   Paraguayan historical structure and its political regime, democracy. We
   view the process as a leadership crisis within the historical bloc,
   engendering cyclical effects and being solved with the rearrangement of
   forces, factors achieved with the Lugo's deposition through legal and
   institutional mechanisms. The main effect of the process was the
   institutional casualization that generates the regime dissatisfaction
   and can foment new political crisis.},

Abstract = {The article analyzes a key question: what role did the new generation of
   intellectuals play during the period of The Violence in Colombia? In
   order to achieve such a purpose, it takes into account the studies of
   Pierre Bourdieu and Jacques Dubois as theoretical framework, especially
   the concepts of field and institution. It concludes that the groups that
   made this generation had different conceptions and cultural and
   political interests, but they remained together due to their desire to
   modernize the culture and the national institutions. The poet Jorge
   Gaitin Duran was the mentor of this generation.},

Abstract = {October 1917 changed the world. The twentieth century became the epoch
   of socialist revolutions and, as the consequence of their victories and
   defeats (the paradox!), of the radical social reforms. The epoch of
   non-linear transformations of capitalism towards socialism and, broader,
   of the ``realm of necessity{''} towards the ``realm of freedom{''}
   started. And this is a challenge for all of us: for those who are
   creating socialist practices, and those who are thinking about socialist
   theory. This article is devoted to the last challenge and it deals with
   the most difficult problems of the theory of revolution in general and
   communist revolution in particular: the dialectic of social creativity
   and violence, destruction and creation, of political, economic, social
   changes on one hand; and the rebirth of culture-on another;
   interrelation of conformists and revolutionaries, and so on.},

Journal = {QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {12},
Number = {1},
Pages = {59-97},
Abstract = {The policy choices of governments are frequently durable. From the
   building of bridges to the creation of social programs, investments in
   public infrastructure typically last well beyond a single electoral
   cycle. In this paper we develop a dynamic model of repeated elections in
   which policy choices are durable. The behavior that emerges in
   equilibrium reveals a novel mechanism through which durability interacts
   with the shorter electoral cycle and distorts the incentives of
   politicians. We find that a government that is electorally accountable
   nevertheless underinvests in policy, that it deliberately wastes
   investment on projects that are never implemented, and that the type of
   policy it implements is itself Pareto inefficient. The first two
   distortions match evidence from infrastructure policy in western
   democracies, and the third identifies a distortion that has heretofore
   not been explored empirically. Notably, these effects emerge solely due
   to the interaction of policy durability and political accountability,
   and not from corruption, poor decision making, or voter myopia.},

   protection of Spain's foreclosure procedures. By insisting on the joint

   standard of judicial protection available to mortgage debtors across the
   EU. Secondly, the CJEU's rulings clarify that with regard to such
   matters, the principle of member States' procedural autonomy has become
   rather irrelevant.},

   INTERFACE WITH THE EUROPEAN UNION},
Journal = {POLITICKE VEDY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {20},
Number = {4},
Pages = {174-189},
Abstract = {Not much observed when all eyes are directed towards Kiev or the eastern
   regions of Ukraine, the westernmost Transcarpathian region is a direct
   border interface with the territory of the European Union. As such, it
   provides an alternative input to political sociology to grasp the
   current issues of the country. After a short historical and
   socioeconomic contextualisation, the present study investigates the
   current border uses for the population with neighbouring European
   countries and the main contemporary lines of work for decision makers
   looking for a regional integration. This overview is based on data
   collected on site from field observations and interviews with the
   actors. Transcarpathia appears to be deeply impacted by the crisis that
   Ukraine is facing, though geographically distant. There, it particularly
   exacerbates the contradictions of a border and marginal space, caught
   between the distant hope of a full European integration and the
   discouragement of the lack of support from Kiev. The current European
   neighbourhood policy and the bilateral efforts of neighbouring states
   are also put to the test by the crisis, raising the question of
   resilience and political will.},

Abstract = {The present essay aims to be a thought about the important role played
   by the Constitutional Court in the build-up of the Autonomy State. Its
   origins could be found, as far as it is known, in the not plenty
   definition of the territorial model in the Spanish Constitution, pushing
   the Court to play a role maybe a little bit to excessive. In the text we
   show some examples of that building, with the remarkable point of a
   coherent reasoning. At the end we set a bunch of proposals of
   constitutional reforms, trying to set some tools to prevent and solve
   the inevitable conflicts that take place.},

Abstract = {The prison isolates and hinders the creation of an environment in which
   family and social relationships develop positively. In the personal
   networks of inmates both processes of social support and conflict with
   their relatives and close ones are given. In this article are described
   the characteristics of the women prisoners' support networks in Spain
   and how interpersonal conflicts affect on the configuration of those
   networks.
   We analyze the results of a research that has had a sample of 599 female
   participants (538 by survey respondents and 61) in a national study that
   has covered 42 prisons. The data are quantitative (treated with the SPSS
   20 software version) and qualitative (analyzed with interpretation and
   content analysis techniques).
   The results lead us to point out that the prison intervention has in
   consideration the positive inmates interpersonal relationships rather
   than focusing all their attention those family and social ties that are
   shown as negative or risky. This bet we do on prison intervention fits
   perfectly with socio-educational approaches that comply with the guiding
   principles of peace education.},

Abstract = {The liberalization of gambling is a measure equally taken and
   implemented by both sides within the bipolar system that typified
   Italian politics over the years 1990-2000. For 25 years, the growing
   number of operators, players and betting opportunities has been blessed
   as a ``necessity{''}, a forced decision that does not respect the
   reference values represented by the political forces that have in turn
   been part of the ruling majorities. The assumption of this paper is that
   the financial and regulatory consolidation path of the ``lawful game{''}
   provides, both from the governmental and cultural viewpoint, a
   privileged indication to describe the depoliticization of the Second
   Italian Republic compared to the conflict that should have raged within
   it as a competitive democracy.
   From the government viewpoint, the elected institutions renounced the
   political direction of the field to support the neo-liberal axioms that
   consider the accuracy of public accounting, the encouragement of
   consumption and the transfer of public assets to private capitals as
   three indisputable methods to pursue economic growth. From a cultural
   viewpoint, the silent consensus of Italian voters for gambling seems to
   reflect a more general consensus for the ``chance{''} factor, the
   tolerance for uncertainty that deeply permeates Italy as the other
   neo-capitalist societies.},

Title = {Scholarship on South Africa's Foreign Policy Behaviour: Parsimony versus
   Eclecticism},
Journal = {POLITIKON},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {44},
Number = {3},
Pages = {370-386},
Abstract = {Some commentators note that much of the literature on South Africa's
   foreign policy behaviour is marked by clash of concepts, arguments and
   normative convictions. This clash has mainly been between two dominant
   intellectual traditions: realism and liberalism. Works based on each of
   the perspectives incline towards particular preferences, values and
   prescriptions- a single vision or a universalising organising principle
   guides the framing of policy problem, interpretation of empirical
   observations and prescriptions. The limitation of this mode of enquiry
   is that it fails to take account of the complexity of the social world
   and that there are many ways of looking at it. The article argues that
   neither of the two dominant perspectives comprehensively and
   persuasively' explains South Africa's foreign policy behaviour and
   practice. Beyond parsimony the paper advocates scholarship grounded in
   analytic eclecticism'. It is an approach that integrates ideas and
   variables associated with different theoretical perspectives. This
   approach is preferable because it ensures that the scholarly endeavour
   is sufficiently close to the experience of real world actors. It leads
   to deeper insights into policy behaviour and how to holistically deal
   with the problems associated with it.},

   in its political and administrative structure, at least during the
   Regency of Maria Cristina (1885-1902). In opposition to traditional
   ideas about Restoration as a period of stagnation, the liberals
   displayed a reformist vocation. They were enhanced by their encounter
   with the political models of the United Kingdom and France, but also the
   experience of other countries such as Italy, Germany and Belgium.
   Likewise, this openness was used as a strategy for achieving legitimacy,
   evincing the efforts of the party to forge the inclusion of the country
   in a modernity identified with Europe.},

Abstract = {Given the current situation of peace negotiations, the article analyzes
   the actions of post demobilization armed groups against the exercise of
   political opposition. In the first section, Dahl's theoretical approach
   is used to explain the conditions that allow free and legal opposition's
   organization. In the second, these groups are characterized; their
   actions against the sectors considered as a threat to the status quo are
   analyzed as well as state's actions addressed against them. Finally, the
   conclusions suggest that despite the violence against sectors perceived
   as a threat (victims, land claimants, demobilized guerrillas), the
   exercise of political opposition in Colombia will be possible. The
   analysis is primarily based on a press review about the actions of post
   demobilization armed groups.},

   Regional Order?},
Journal = {ASIAN POLITICS \& POLICY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {9},
Number = {1},
Pages = {31-49},

Abstract = {Drawing mostly on Chinese-language sources, this article examines
   Chinese assessments of the effectiveness of China's earlier charm
   offensive in increasing China's regional influence and reshaping the
   regional order according to its preferences. The main argument is that
   China achieved mixed success. China was successful in preventing others
   from adopting hostile anti-China balancing postures, and especially
   before 2005, successful in attaining support and momentum for its
   preferred vision of East Asian regional cooperation and regional trade
   liberalization. China was less successful, however, in shaping the
   regional security order, although experts recognized the incremental
   improvements in what would be a gradual process in minimizing the
   dominance of U.S. alliances. Around 2005, however, Chinese experts noted
   increased resistance to China's preferred vision for regionalism and
   regional economic cooperation. The article concludes by examining
   analytical themes that enabled China to successfully exert regional
   influence or represented challenges to its efforts to reshape the
   region.},

Year = {2017},

Abstract = {In recent years, studies of rural development have focused on the
   territorial dimension, with state institutions and mechanisms aimed to
   obtain and organize consensuses on the different policy levels
   (regional, national, provincial and local) promoting the idea that the
   territory shall be the area of interaction between public and private
   agents, as well as the reference point for the exercise of power. The
   current article seeks to analyze public policies under the premise that
   these constitute themselves as processes of hegemony construction.
   Building on contributions from critical geography and other disciplines
   in the social sciences, we address the emergence of family agriculture
   (FA) policies as a novel element of rural development in Argentina - and
   the region. Our insights are drawn from a case study conducted in the
   Benito Juarez partido (Buenos Aires province). The investigation is
   based on fieldwork and interviews with key informants. It will be
   concluded that the economic and/or political inclusion mechanisms put in
   place set out to produce new subjects consonant with the necessities of
   hegemonic actors.},

   of Violence},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF POLITICS IN LATIN AMERICA},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {9},
Number = {3},
Pages = {27-48},
Abstract = {The article examines the links between paramilitary groups and the
   Colombian state within a context of pervasive violence. Colombia
   represents a particularly interesting case as high-intensity violence is
   accompanied by the preservation of a relatively strong institutional
   framework. Most interpretations of this relationship consider it to be
   either a sign of state weakness or a centralized strategy to outsource
   violence. Taking a different stance, the paper argues that the existence
   of paramilitary groups compels us to analyze government through
   practices vis-a-vis the treatment of violence. A policy linking private
   security and counterinsurgency, crafted in the early 1990s and known as
   Convivir, provides an illustration of this approach.},

Abstract = {Generally speaking, political theory avoids considering the kind of
   damage suffered by he who lives excluded from any political community or
   perhaps sees such damage as a juridical and political phenomenon that is
   the loss of nationality. One must instead be aware that they who are
   compelled to live within the circumscribed space of a set of
   regulations, institutions and spaces that can be labelled under the
   umbrella term of camp are subject to a specific existential deprivation
   and not only to a juridical damage. To justify this argumentation it is
   worth going back to Hannah Arendt's works where the condition of people
   without citizenship is understood under ontological-existential terms
   thus offering a wiser perspective to understand one's moral obligations
   towards stateless people and refugees.},

Title = {THE RUSSIAN REVOLUTION AND MODERNIZATION TRAPS},
Journal = {POLIS-POLITICHESKIYE ISSLEDOVANIYA},
Year = {2017},
Number = {4},
Pages = {138-155},
Abstract = {The Russian Revolution dramatically changed the history of our country
   and of the whole world. The search for its causes generated many
   theories and views. On the one hand, we can hardly perceive it beyond
   the peculiar socio- historical development of the Russian society and
   specific historical situation. On the other hand, starting from the
   Modern Era, many countries were `taken ill' with revolutions. In the
   present article the author analyzes the Russian Revolution in connection
   with the world historical process, defines some common causes of
   revolutions and shows in what way these causes have manifested in our
   history, he also reveals the similarity of the Russian Revolution with
   other significant revolutions as well as distinguishes its
   peculiarities. This gives an opportunity to answer the questions whether
   the Russian Revolution was inevitable and whether the drastic social
   transformations that took place in the first period of the Soviet
   history were inevitable either. The focus of the present article lies on
   the correlation between revolution and modernization, on the
   interconnections, threats and traps that result from an accelerated
   development of a society and can lead to revolutions. Starting from the
   Modern era the revolutions are underpinned in most cases by considerable
   disproportions in the societal development resulting from an accelerated
   modernization. These disproportions are aggravated by a fast population
   growth and by an extremely sharp increase of the share of urban
   population in the structure of society. The article demonstrates how and
   why the revolutions occur during the periods after some (sometimes long)
   increase in the living standards of population and growing expectations,
   as well as why the revolutions are possible just in the societies
   successful in economic terms as it was with the pre-revolutionary
   Russia. The conclusion is made that the revolution at a certain stage of
   modernization is more probably a predicted pattern than a random event.
   The article reveals the mechanism that brings a society into a
   peculiar-type trap - the modernization one. While the Malthusian trap is
   believed to be connected with a lag of productive forces from population
   growth rates and the generally insufficient transformational dynamics,
   the modernization trap, on the contrary, is associated with extremely
   rapid changes which leave behind some most important societal relations
   and institutions. In Russia there originated a peculiar type of
   modernization trap - the Malthusian-Marxian one.},

Abstract = {The Russian Revolution was a global event. It served as a justification
   for anti-democratic counter-revolutions and marked the beginning of a
   new type of political regime : single party dictatorship. It started a
   period of organised violence unprecedented in the history of mankind,
   brought the disintegration of a major empire to its conclusion and led
   to the establishment of the Soviet Union, which had a decisive impact on
   international relations during the 20th century. An analysis of the
   causes, progress and consequences of the October Revolution using the
   methods of comparative historical sociology leads to important insights
   for a general theory of inhibited and accelerated social change.},

Abstract = {This essay challenges the influential view that Isaiah Berlin and Hannah
   Arendt played a central role in inaugurating an ` anti- utopian age'.
   While the two thinkers certainly did their share to discredit the
   radical utopian inclination to portray a political blueprint in the
   abstract, I show that neither was straightforwardly anti- utopian. On
   the contrary, both thinkers' writings display a different kind of
   utopian thinking, consisting in an imaginative and idealized
   reconstruction of existing polities. Schematically put, Berlin's utopia
   was England reconstructed as a quintessential liberal society, whereas
   Arendt's utopia was America reconstructed as a quintessential modern
   free republic. Those two polities differ from each other in important
   respects, but they share two essential features in common: they are
   claimed to be exempt from the rise of totalitarianism; and they
   allegedly give men and women the decent chance to live a fulfilling
   life. To illustrate Berlin's and Arendt's overlapping and yet differing
   visions, I consider their contrasting responses to the upheaval of 1968
   - a possible utopian moment in the late 20th century. While their
   responses could scarcely be more different, they were informed by their
   shared desire to imagine an ideal polity in what both regarded as the
   darkest century in human history.},

Journal = {QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {12},
Number = {1},
Pages = {37-57},
Abstract = {Issue frames are a central concept in studying public opinion, and are.
   thought to operate by foregrounding related considerations in citizens'
   minds. But scholarship has yet to consider the breadth of framing
   effects by testing whether frames influence attitudes beyond the
   specific issue they highlight. For example, does a discussion of
   terrorism affect opinions on proximate issues like crime or even more
   remote issues like poverty? By measuring the breadth of framing effects,
   we can assess the extent to which citizens' political considerations are
   cognitively organized by issues. We undertake a population-based survey
   experiment with roughly 3,300 respondents which includes frames related
   to terrorism, crime, health care, and government spending. The results
   demonstrate that framing effects are narrow, with limited but
   discernible spillover on proximate, structurally similar issues.
   Discrete issues not only organize elite politics but also exist in
   voters' minds, a finding with implications for studying ideology as well
   as framing.},

Abstract = {The early English-language promoters of Nostradamus (Orson Welles and
   Erika Cheetham) had strong Leftist-Marxist connections including ties to
   the Cambridge 5 spy ring. Nostradamus was the top search anomaly of Sept
   11, 2001. Interest was driven by a surge in emails and text messages via
   the internet. This behavior is discussed in relation to known cyber
   threats from 2001. Similar spikes in Nostradamus searches (Google
   Trends) emanated from Poland (April 2010), Ukraine (March 2014), and in
   Hungary (August 2015). Nostradamus mirrors proven Russian disinformation
   operations, such as those that today implicate 9/11 as being an ``inside
   job{''} by the US government, or that the CIA killed JFK, or that the
   CIA engineered the AIDS virus. Noting Nostradamus' use by both the
   Allies and the Axis powers as a psychological warfare tool in World War
   2, the case is made that it was the Russians carrying out an
   ``information attack{''} on 9/11 that is consistent with Russian cyber
   warfare and active measures strategy; and that they may have used
   similar techniques elsewhere since 2001.},

Volume = {44},

Pages = {425-445},
Abstract = {This article focuses on the factors that demonstrate the necessity and
   significance of security sector reform in Zimbabwe. This is important
   given the security forces' interference in elections and politics, the
   militarisation of civilian institutions and grave intra-party factional
   wars that emerged. It argues that the security sector was partisan,
   politicised, violent on civilians and divisive with the support of the
   Zimbabwe African National Union Patriotic Front amid the militarisation
   of the Zimbabwe Electoral Commission. Also, ahead of the 2002
   Presidential elections, and the 2008 harmonised elections the
   securocrats vowed not to accept any presidential aspirant who won
   elections without liberation war credentials. It is fundamental for all
   stakeholders to the Zimbabwean conflict to encourage the security forces
   to uphold the constitution of Zimbabwe in particular the guidelines
   articulated in the Defence Act and Police Act in order to achieve
   sustainable peace and development in the country.},

Abstract = {Since Russia's annexation of Crimea and the war in eastern Ukraine,
   relations between the West and Russia have been in deep crisis. The dual
   strategy of ``as much containment and deterrence as necessary, as much
   cooperation and dialogue as possible{''} offers an orientation for
   future policy towards Russia. NATO and the EU need security with and
   against Russia. The goal must be to again obligate Russia to comply with
   a rules-based security policy and conventional and nuclear disarmament.
   The West should be prepared to conduct a dialogue on a cooperative
   security policy and conventional and nuclear disarmament in order to
   generate trust and prevent an uncontrollable escalation dynamic. One key
   issue remains how security and stability should be organised in the
   region between the EU and Russia. Providing formal assurance to Moscow
   that there is no intention of absorbing Ukraine and the other states in
   the region into the EU or. NATO would send a false signal. A
   normalisation of the relationship with Russia will not be possible
   without a clear deescalation of the Ukraine-Russia conflict.},

Abstract = {This article examines the significance of Friedrich Nietzsche to Albert
   Camus' concepts of absurdity and revolt. It rests on three related
   claims. First, that Nietzsche's critique of metaphysics
   (foundationalism) is the point of departure for Camus' absurdist
   inquiries. Second, that Camus' philosophy of revolt is informed in
   crucial ways by Nietzsche's views on the sources of moral and
   intellectual authority in the modern world. Finally, that Camusian
   revolt is an attempt to deal with the political crisis of
   foundationalism in a way that preserves Nietzsche's anti-essentialism
   while also avoiding the excesses of absolutist politics. Ultimately, I
   suggest that the origins and implications of Camus' project cannot be
   grasped apart from an account of its engagement with Nietzsche.},

Abstract = {The political programmes drafted by the political parties at European

   and as such are marginalised. We argue that Euromanifestos nevertheless
   constitute a dynamic material, and a relevant indicator of the
   structuring of the European political space. Using computer-based
   discourse analysis, this article examines how the politicisation of the
   European political sphere is given to see in the 2014 manifestos
   published by the 13 registered Europarties ahead of the European
   elections. Results show that although sharing a discursive space, each
   Europarty mobilizes this space in a peculiar manner, leading to a
   plurality of European projects.},

Abstract = {It is conventional wisdom that the laws of physics that govern our
   everyday world are different from those that explain the smallest
   particles and forces. Alexander Wendt argues that, to the contrary,
   quantum theory in fact can apply to the larger-scale world, and to human
   behavior as well. An alluring possibility to be sure, but we may need
   multiple theories of different types to explain diverse human behavior
   and behavioral patterns. Theories, furthermore, can be self-confirming
   or self-denying. In quantum theory, classical physics, and social life,
   uncertainty looms large and political leaders in particular face
   multiple choices in dealing with it, including whether attempts to
   reduce uncertainty will change the world to their detriment. In these
   efforts, they often conflate estimates of likelihood with judgments of
   confidence and incorrectly assume that an estimate that an event is
   unlikely is flawed if the event actually occurs.},

Abstract = {The paper explores the conflict between users' right to privacy and data
   protection and the practices of online platforms such as Google and

   the two companies in the period 2011 to 2016, the authors provide an
   overview of the field and a critical look at the current systems of
   privacy and data protection in the US and Europe, including the new
   General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). The paper argues that whereas
   the two systems differ on a number of accounts neither of them
   critically engage with the online business model that lie beneath these
   platforms, including its incentive for maximising data collection.},

Title = {Participatory Budgeting and Community-Based Research: Principles,
   Practices, and Implications for Impact Validity},
Journal = {NEW POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {39},
Number = {1},
Pages = {143-155},
Abstract = {Research and evaluation is an integral part of the Participatory
   Budgeting (PB) process. Since PB in New York City (PBNYC) is designed to
   be a democratic and community-based initiative that is grounded in the
   values of equity and inclusion, it is important that the research and
   evaluation methods used to study the process and its participants adhere
   to the same principles. For the past five years, a team of
   community-based researchers, academics, and PB participants have
   designed research questions and instruments, implemented data
   collection, analyzed and shared data with PB participants and
   practitioners, and issued reports to the wider public. Like PB, the
   research design is rooted in the communities where PB is operating. The
   research is not intended to sit on a shelf but is actively used by
   participants and practitioners to help reflect on the process, improve
   deliberation in decision-making, and strengthen the process and outcomes
   of PB. This article will discuss Participatory Action Research
   principles used by the Community Development Project of the Urban
   Justice Center, explore the applicability of these principles to the
   Participatory Budgeting research context, and explain how these
   practices have helped to deepen and improve the process and outcomes of
   PBNYC.},

Pages = {198-217},
Abstract = {Mass incarceration is at a crossroads. Even though demands to dismantle
   mass incarceration are increasingly gaining traction, it will not
   necessarily lead to a reduction of the carceral state. There is an
   emerging trend that centers on surveillance, security, and police
   discretion. The ways in which policy-making is negotiated, social
   upheaval is managed, and policing is being adjusted affirm a shift that
   puts more of the onus on the controlling aspects associated with law
   enforcement and less on the enclosing characteristics of incarceration.
   The current decline in incarceration should thus be seen as more of a
   realignment than an end of the carceral state.},

Abstract = {Prominent strands of contemporary democratic theory, by figuring genuine
   democratic agency as fundamentally disruptive, present conventional
   social and political institutions merely as sites of calculation and
   normalization. This article challenges such a view by tracing its
   origins in Max Weber's theory of domination. Even as many democratic
   theorists repudiate the political consequences of Weber's thought, they
   fail to fully confront the sociotheoretic categories underpinning his
   vision, such that these categories continue to structure conceptions of
   democratic agency and horizons of practical possibility in democratic
   theory. Here, I argue that Weber's democratic skepticism arises not, as
   is commonly thought, from a philosophical repudiation of the concept of
   legitimacy, but rather from his analysis of the origins of value systems
   in extraordinary ruptures with everyday experience. To move beyond
   Weber, democratic theorists must challenge both his distinction between
   the ordinary and the extraordinary and his reduction of institutional
   politics to domination and technical control.},

Abstract = {Finland and the Russian Federation share significant overlaps in
   history. With the exception of a couple of conflicts, the relationship
   between the two is commonly described as friendly. With a common border
   of more than 1.300 kilometers, Finland has always been closely tied to
   its eastern neighbor. Despite the physical proximity, the Cold War era
   closure of the border increased the mental distance between the two
   sides, and fostered an image of the other colored largely by attitudinal
   stereotypes. For a long time, a good fence indeed made good neighbors.
   The resultant `us' versus `them' mentality etched in the minds of many
   has proven to be far more deeply rooted and harder to erase than the
   political border per se. In an attempt to trace the development of the
   portrayed image of Russia, this article analyzes the opinion columns
   featured in the main Finnish newspaper Helsingin Sanomat during
   1990-2010. The analysis suggests that little effort has been made to
   improve the popular geopolitical image of Russia. While understanding
   the potential of having Russia as a neighbor, many Finns continue to
   actively reconfirm the elements in the neighbor, which should be let go
   in order move beyond stereotypes. This tendency is only reinforced by
   the load of the language used in the opinion writings, which seems to
   inhibit people from critically evaluating the opinions and views that
   they hold. Myths about Russia are used for transferring ideological
   norms and dominant historical values of Finnish culture. Therefore,
   myths serve to make collective views and convictions natural and
   evident, even if they ungrounded. Stronger is the main myth, easier it
   is for both the author (the message's sender) and the reader (the
   message's recipient) to find a common interpretation. As a result, it
   creates a code which can be understood only by those who know it and
   possesses a respective social knowledge.},

Abstract = {This paper re-evaluates the notion of progress in light of the trauma
   represented by interwar European fascism. It critically examines the
   widespread assumption that interwar European fascism demonstrates the
   illusory, or even pernicious, nature of progress. Seeing fascists as
   enraged crusaders against the march of history, whose aim was to impede
   the further rise of what Nietzsche contemptuously referred to as ` the
   Last Humans,' affords a perspective from which progress, at least in its
   main current, no longer appears invalidated by fascism. The criterion of
   democratic mass empowerment, furthermore, can usefully distinguish
   between two mutually exclusive notions of progress: the first, of
   largely Hegelian provenance, was committed to mass empowerment; the
   second, while intractably opposing progress as a democratic enterprise,
   also appropriated it for radically anti-democratic purposes, transmuting
   its meaning so that the Last Humans are no longer conceived as its
   beneficiaries but, at most, as its tools.},

Journal = {DESAFIOS},

Abstract = {Truth commissions are widely considered to be a key tool of transitional
   justice mechanisms (TJMs), whose goal is to achieve truth, justice, and
   reconciliation after violent conflict or dictatorship. However, policy
   actors promoting these mechanisms have often not adequately engaged in a
   critical reflection of the policy measures they are suggesting. Instead,
   they usually argue from normative points of view rather than relying on
   empirical evidence. During the last decade, there has been a continued
   debate as to whether or not TJMs actually work and what impact they
   have. Drawing on research from three case studies (Kenya, Sierra Leone,
   and Timor-Leste), this paper analyzes the (non) implementation of
   recommendations produced in the final reports of truth commissions
   created after armed conflict. The work focuses on the impact of truth
   commissions on democracy, peace, and institutional reform. The analysis
   roughly follows the four-step approach set out by Skaar, Maica, and Eide
   (2015) to measure the impact of truth commissions and illustrates both
   the opportunities they provide and their limitations.},

Abstract = {This essay traces out a new organization of Louis Althusser's work that
   rests on his fundamental educational problematic: interpellation. There
   are three moments where Althusser discusses education in his writings:
   in the famous essay on schools as Ideological State Apparatuses, in his
   infamous essay on the university and the pedagogical function, and in a
   much more obscure reference to trade unions. In all three, Althusser is
   dealing with the problem of interpellation, yet none of these essays
   enable us to actually theorize what Althusser's own practice of the
   seminar offers as educational logic-a practice that resulted in the
   student-teacher collaboration Reading Capital. In short, whereas the
   Institutional State Apparatus interpellates individuals and the trade
   union offers a counterinterpellation, the seminar is a form of
   disinterpellation that must be thought of as the educational unconscious
   of Althusser's late writings on the encounter.},

Abstract = {This study analyzes how the concept of sovereignty was mobilized in
   Brazil between the years of 1822 and 1824. The theoretical starting
   point of article consists in the affirmation that it is necessary to
   ensure a sovereignty principle to think politics and political changes
   in the modernity. For this, initially, the essay approaches the
   metamorphosis that occurred in the notion of sovereignty in the early
   years of the 1820s. Then, it studies the discourses around the concept
   of national sovereignty in the context of Independence, of the
   Constituent Assembly of 1823 and of the Imposed Letter of 1824. Finally,
   it analyzes the uses of the concept in relation to the problem of the
   limitation of popular power. From this path, it is understood that it is
   possible to comprehend the operative value of the notion of sovereignty
   in the formation of the Brazilian State.},

Abstract = {The purpose of the present article is to establish what links there may
   be between leadership styles and war and peace policies in the
   Russia-Chechen conflict. To do so, we analyze the styles of two
   unrecognized executive leaders, Aslan Maskhadov and Doku Umarov, both of
   whom were involved in the same conflict with different peace policies.
   The structure of the paper is as follows. First, we overview the
   literature on leadership styles in armed conflict situations and
   construct a theoretical framework. Second, we review the historical and
   biographical context. Third, we examine the interview content-analysis
   methodology for the measuring of leadership style. Fourth, we classify
   Maskhadov and Umarov on the basis of leadership styles, and compare
   policies implemented by these leaders with those of other leaders in a
   context of internal armed conflict. Finally, we present conclusions and
   future prospects.},

Abstract = {The paper's purpose is to analyze the provisions of the first Soviet
   Constitution in terms of the relationship between the legislative and
   executive political institutions, and to examine whether and to what
   extent the principle of unity of powers had been prescribed. The
   analysis is based on the legal method, since the competences and the
   relationship of legislative and executive institutions had been
   explicitly prescribed by the Constitution. It also contains an analysis
   of the theoretical approach of the Marxist theoreticians to the system
   of government. The conclusion is that the Constitution of the Russian
   Socialist Federal Soviet Republic prescribed the principle of democratic
   unity of powers, and the system of assembly government, which had been
   based on the superiority of the representative body over the executive.
   However, it had not been a ``clear{''} system of assembly government,
   since the executive (Sovnarkom {[}the Soviet of People's Commissars])
   had some important competences. Although the leading theoreticians of
   the new regime had not envisaged this possibility, it occurred as the
   result of the extraordinary circumstances caused by the civil war, as
   well as of the fact that the Marxist theory on the new system of
   government had not been developed in all its aspects.},

Abstract = {In recent decades the discourse of human rights has increased its
   hegemony, becoming adopted as an approach and tactic methodology by
   multiple actors, local and global. Our target in this paper aims to
   analyze the loss of legitimacy that the discourse of human rights being
   acquired. One of the main reasons is the lack of relevance that the
   concept of duty and responsibility acquire in many rights-discourses.
   For this purpose, we will make a brief tour throughout we consider the
   main symptoms that have contributed to a fragile culture of rights, as
   the weakness of the concept of rights; the breaking of solidarity bonds;
   the multiplication of antagonistic and incompatible discourses of
   rights; the emergence of a new culture of violence. All are symptoms
   that help to forge a neglect of duties as the irreducible core of human
   rights. We will finish this essay talking about the importance of the
   duties in our present time to reconstruct a critical speech on human
   rights, as well as suggesting some strategies for recovering them.},

Abstract = {The aim of this inquiry is the reconstruction of a hermeneutic
   circularity among some of the purely psychological categories of Paul
   Ricoeur's elaboration and the key concepts of his moral, legal and
   political analysis. This is trying to highlight the theories and the
   intellectual comparisons of the theoretical aspects of Ricoeur, finding
   its results in a more explicitly legal-social context, in an excursus
   aimed at the hypothesis of a categorical rhizomatic foundation of Paul
   Ricoeur's political thought.},

Title = {``Europe disturbs the Organization chart{''}. Dealing with Europe in

Journal = {POLITIQUE EUROPEENNE},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {57},
Number = {3, SI},
Pages = {116-141},
Abstract = {This article shows that the institutionalisation of a European political
   space does not lead to the existence of dedicated committees or staff
   for dealing with European issues within French employers' organisations.
   Since 1956, the procedures for monitoring European issues have been
   regularly reviewed inside those organisations. This article stresses
   that dedicated European committees are neither an indicator of the
   Europeanization of national employers' groups, nor a privileged entry
   point to study their European activities. It rather sheds light on the
   competition between different ways of dealing with European topics.
   Within these organisations, the permanent staff dedicated to European
   issues are at loggerheads with the rest of the staff when it comes to
   defining how European issues should be taken care of. In order to
   legitimise their role in the organisation, the permanent staff act to
   singularise European issues as ones that require specific knowledge.
   Doing so, they imbue the organisation with a specific vision of Europe.},

Journal = {AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {52},
Number = {4},
Pages = {537-549},
Abstract = {The Howard Government's commitment to supporting the male breadwinner
   policy model was a major barrier to the efforts of female political
   leaders to influence the development of a national paid parental leave
   scheme. Associated with this model was the argument that paid parental
   leave discriminated' against non-working women and devalued their
   contribution to society as mothers. Despite a change of government in
   2007 this argument remained influential through the Productivity
   Commission's Inquiry into Paid Maternity, Paternity and Parental Leave
   (2009). Key to the eventual legislation of the scheme in 2010 was female
   leaders' strategy of aligning with, rather than disrupting, this
   narrative. As such, women in trade unions, political parties, women's
   groups and the bureaucracy framed paid parental leave as supporting
   women in their maternal roles as it allowed them the financial breathing
   room to stay at home for longer with their newborn.},

   Today, it must be understood as a cosmopolitan principle to respect the

   own decision-making processes even if they have no formal right to be
   represented. This cosmopolitan principle is already institutionalized in
   a number of international, supranational and transnational contexts. All
   of these contexts lack important pre-conditions for a full-blown
   application of the principle. The fact that the principle has
   nevertheless been institutionalized to some degree in all three contexts
   can be interpreted as evidence for its broad acceptance as a new global
   norm.},

Abstract = {Since the opening up of the archives following the collapse of the
   Soviet Union, there has been a new revival in research into the Russian
   Revolution. Historians have obtained new insights into the
   non-Bolshevist parties, the situation in the regions and on the
   periphery of the Empire and on the national governments who fought the
   Bolsheviks. By embedding the Revolution more strongly Into the European
   context as a whole, such as the First World War, the structural crisis
   of the continental empires and the revival of national movements in
   Europe, representations of and explanations for the Russian Revolution
   have gained greater substance, depth and comparability.},

Title = {Civil Society Activism under US Free Trade Agreements: The Effects of
   Actorness on Decent Work},
Journal = {POLITICS AND GOVERNANCE},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {5},
Number = {4},
Pages = {40-48},
Abstract = {US free trade agreements comprise unique provisions that enable civil
   society to present public complaints against labor rights violations
   occurring in the US or its trade partners. To date, a variety of
   complainants have used these mechanisms, including (inter) national
   trade unions, human rights organizations, and a priest. And yet, little
   is known about the submissions' nature of agency and the effects it has
   on the procedural continuations to address illicit labor practices. To
   fill this research lacuna, this article employs a multidisciplinary
   framework of `actorness' that measures the submitters' diversity
   (professionalism/non-professionalism, collectivism/individualism,
   transnationalism/nationalism) and their effectiveness
   (rejection/acceptance of submissions and further procedural follow-ups).
   Combining quantitative examination with in-depth analysis of two diverse
   cases of actorness, and drawing on expert interviews, public reports,
   and minutes of meetings, the study reveals that the majority of public
   submissions were of professional, collective, and transnational nature.
   However, contrary to what extant literature suggests, this is not a
   guarantee that they achieve more far-reaching procedural steps in the
   protection of workers. Non-professional, individual, and national
   actorness can compensate for the advantages of professionalism,
   collectivism, and transnationalism.},

Abstract = {This article on drone strikes in Pakistan offers a distinctive empirical
   case study for critical scholarship of counterterrorism. By asking how
   cosmopolitanism has developed through UK news discourse, it also
   provides a constructivist contribution to the literature on drones. I
   argue that UK news discourse is not cosmopolitan because it focuses on
   risk and places the Other beyond comprehension. US-UK networked
   counterterrorism operations have complicated accountability, and while a
   drive for certainty promoted more scrutiny of policy, news media
   outlets, academics and activists turned to statistical and visual genres
   of communication that have inhibited understanding of the Other.},

Abstract = {This article presents a new index for a comprehensive and systematic
   measurement of the level of intra-party democracy (IPD). The proposed
   index is designed on the basis of a comparison with state-level
   democracy and previous attempts to measure IPD. It examines five
   dimensions: participation, representation, competition, responsiveness
   and transparency. The way each dimension is measured is explained and
   justified on the basis of the procedure of its design and democratic
   theory. Its application and potential contribution to the analysis of
   democracy and party politics is demonstrated through its use to
   comparatively evaluate the level of internal democracy in political
   parties in Israel; and through examining several hypotheses concerning
   the relationship between party characteristics and their level of IPD
   and the relationship between the various dimensions of IPD.},

Abstract = {After the celebration of ten elections to the Parliament of Galicia, the
   last of them on 25 September 2016, it is possible to analyze the yields
   of the Galician autonomous electoral system. This work makes a
   comprehensive analysis of the effects of the Galician electoral rules,
   using a set of indicators that measure partisan fragmentation,
   disproportionality, bonus and penalties received by parties and
   inequality in the value of voting. It also examines the minimum changes
   that the electoral system has undergone since its genesis in the Statute
   of Autonomy of 1981, passing through the approval of the Galician
   electoral law in 1985, until the 1992 reform, as well as the recent
   attempts to reform the electoral system in 2012 and 2014. Finally, we
   will be able to formulate a proposal of electoral reform of its own
   that, based on minor modifications, can correct some of the
   dysfunctionalities of the current electoral system.},

Abstract = {Uncertainty about capabilities, intent, or resolve has long been linked
   to war. More recently, the bargaining model of war has established
   uncertainty, also referred to as asymmetric information, as one of the
   two major causes of costly conflict, the other being the dynamics of
   commitment in anarchy. A growing theoretical literature has made
   significant strides in fleshing out causal mechanisms and expanding our
   understanding of the role of information in conflict onset and how it
   relates to crisis bargaining and arms races. This article reviews these
   theoretical developments and describes current efforts to better
   understand the relationships between information, uncertainty, and war.},

Abstract = {This research has as general objective the systematic study of the way
   in which the road infrastructure and of public works in Venezuela was
   managed and maintained, with particularity in the analysis of the
   characteristics of the subsidiary work in the urban and rural emeritense
   field from 1828 to 1925 , A research that made it possible to assess the
   impact of this tax modality on the improvement, development and
   strengthening of public spaces in the urban and rural emeritense.
   Likewise, it should be noted that the subject under study has a scarce
   bibliography, so the research rests mainly on information obtained in
   primary sources, protected in the Historical Archive of the State of
   Merida, in the Municipal Archive of the State Government Palace ,
   Especially in the books containing the Acts of Sessions between 1854 and
   1925; And in the documentary fund of the File of the Mayor's Office of
   the Municipality of Libertador Merida. Likewise, we go to the
   documentary sources located in the National Library Febres Cordero.},

Abstract = {As the son of a father sentenced to camp imprisonment and banishment,
   Arseny Roginsky experienced early on how it felt to be a victim of
   despotism and state violence. The concealed death of his father
   sharpened his sensitivity towards lies and fear as a weapon of power.
   After a period of study under Yuri Lotman, he discovered his fascination
   for the search for truth in the past. He was one of the initiators of
   the independent Pamyat (remembrance) publication. He attracted the
   attention of the Soviet security authorities, and in 1981 he was
   sentenced to four years' imprisonment. The same historian who studied
   the fate of people incarcerated in the first camp, the Soloviki special
   camp, and who electrified the Gulag Archipelago, was now forced to enter
   into the world of the camps himself, with their own laws and their own
   language. The political turmoil that began with Perestroika made it
   possible to establish the Memorial society, whose objective it is to
   educate about the infringement of human rights in the past, and to fight
   against that same infringement in the present.},

Abstract = {The Regulation of lobbies has always found many difficulties for
   definition, application and eficiency. This regulation has been focusing
   historically on identifying the key actors undertaking lobbying
   activities and applying transparency to both their organization and
   their activities. In our opinion, this legislative model, which comes
   from the American legislation on lobbying of 1946, is inefficient and
   insufficient as it typically leaves out key actors that undertake
   lobbying activities. Our preferred option is to regulate this field by
   focusing on the activities and not on the actors, and to search for
   means that far from adding more difficulties to the lobbying activity,
   which converts it into something reserved only for the few with more
   resources, make it an easy activity for all.},

Abstract = {Since the Conseil National pour la Defense de la Democratie-Forces de
   Defense de la Democratie (CNDD-FDD's) accession to power following the
   2005 elections in Burundi, governance setbacks were of great concern and
   constantly criticized throughout the post-wartime. This study
   contributes to the understanding of how legacies of wartime shape
   post-war trajectory of a former rebel movement by analysing the
   relationship between main post-2005 features of CNDD-FDD and some key
   elements of its history. There is substantial evidence showing that the
   CNDD-FDD leadership, lacking political will for real changes, has
   continued during the post-wartime its armed movement practices from the
   maquis era, leading to the conclusion of a facade transformation of
   CNDD-FDD rebel movement-to-political party.},

   Communication Strategies in Campaign Posters, Newspaper Advertisement,

Journal = {JOURNAL OF POLITICAL MARKETING},

Abstract = {Politicians and people professionally involved in politics agree that
   negative campaigning is a frequently used campaign communication
   strategy by Austrian political parties. Yet, there is no empirical
   investigation of such claims. The present study examines party-
   controlled communication channels to identify the use of negative
   messaging strategies from a political actor's perspective. The data for
   this study come from a 6-week content analysis of campaign posters,
   newspaper advertisement and press releases of the 2008 Austrian National
   Elections. I examine the degree, source, target, and type of negativity.
   Results show that there are great differences in the degree and type of
   negativity between the three communication channels. Whereas in press
   releases all Austrian parties constantly engaged in going negative,
   campaign posters hardly contained any negative message. To a great
   extent negative campaign tactics are adjusted depending to whom the
   message is addressed to in the first place, the voter or the media.
   Concerning the source and target of negative appeals, results show that
   in particular, parties sitting in opposition employ negative
   campaigning. Yet, they are hardly ever the target of negative messages.},

Abstract = {The article analyses a neglected side of corruption - citizen-initiated
   bribe offers in Azerbaijan. The main rationale for taking a citizen
   focus on corruption is to identify whether citizen choices support
   state-led anti-corruption initiatives. Drawing on a survey of 1002
   respondents, the research shows that `tolerance of corruption' is high
   among the population in Azerbaijan. Logistic regression results show
   that bribe offers among citizens are associated with localization and
   formal value orientations. This means that the respondents pro-actively
   use bribes and readily bend laws to their own local interests. Thus,
   bribe offers constitute around half of the entire variation in
   corruption in Azerbaijan. Therefore, a successful fight against
   corruption cannot be confined to the eradication of only bureaucratic
   bribe demand, but needs to take into account corruption choices of the
   population too.},

Abstract = {Despite extensive research on electoral turnout in developed
   democracies, we know relatively little about the determinants of
   electoral participation in (electoral) autocracies. Yet, electoral
   mobilization is crucial to understanding electoral authoritarian regime
   dynamics and democratic regression. This article studies the
   `socioeconomic roots' of electoral authoritarianism by using original
   local-level data from a prominent contemporary electoral authoritarian
   regime, Russia. The article shows how the electoral mobilization of
   certain institutionally and socioeconomically state-dependent
   demographic sectors was a key part in Russia's transition from a
   competitive to hegemonic authoritarian regime between 2000 and 2004. An
   original local-level data set allows us to test the hypotheses using
   multilevel models, controlling for several socioeconomic and contextual
   variables at both regional and local levels. The results support the
   hypotheses of electoral mobilization in specific demographic areas and
   show interesting variations in turnout patterns between the subnational
   units.},

Abstract = {The article is devoted to the formation and crisis of the
   ``mainstream{''} - the system of nation-state governance based on the
   symbiosis of the right and left ideological approaches. Formation of
   this system has occurred in the developed countries during the 1990s -
   early 2000s. Important conditions were as follows: the collapse of the
   Soviet system, the acceleration of globalization and economic growth,
   the rise of the middle class and the dominance of economic determinism
   in the decision making. At present, this governance system is in crisis.
   The erosion of middle class threatens the stability of its democratic
   procedures. Traditional voters of the center-left and the center-right
   are no longer willing to support their parties. The challenges from
   alternative parties and alternative political movements are becoming
   stronger. The victory of Donald Trump in the presidential elections in
   the United States, ``Brexit{''} in the UK, the defeat of Renzi's
   center-left government in the constitutional referendum and electoral
   successes of the ``Five Stars{''} movement in Italy provoke further
   destruction of the ``mainstream{''} core. The growing number of
   alternative movements' supporters is increasingly affecting the
   traditional parties. The ``alternatives{''} are closely connected with
   well-known ``populism{''}, but they go beyond it in the direction of
   destruction of the existing consensus. ``Alternatives{''} appeal to the
   citizens directly, avoiding ``filters{''} of party structures. They seek
   the removal of the ``political correctness{''}. The alternative
   movements have currently found a form that allows them to seriously harm
   the mainstream. However, they do not have content that is able to
   replace mainstream management practices. Nevertheless, a simple return
   to a period of sustainable and competitive party-political systems that
   existed prior to mainstream formation is also impossible. The deepening
   political crisis will create new forms of alternative policies with
   varying degrees of their success. At the end of the article the authors
   make conclusion about the impact of alternative movements' rise on the
   contemporary political process.},

Volume = {67},
Number = {9-10},
Pages = {51+},
Abstract = {In Russia, almost all prosecutions lead to a conviction. Acquittals are
   in effect precluded. A comparison with Germany shows why this is the
   case. In the Federal Republic of Germany, the principle applies that in
   cases that are not clear cut, the accused enjoys the benefit of the
   doubt. In Russia, the reverse is true. Instead of halting proceedings if
   there is insufficient evidence and acquitting the accused, the
   indictment remains in force for all authorities throughout the legal
   process. In effect, it is therefore not the judges who make the final
   decision, but the investigators from the Ministry of Internal Affairs.
   Two-thirds of these investigators are women. If a procedure initiated by
   them ends with an acquittal, they are likely to be accused of failure to
   perform their duty.},

Abstract = {This article discusses some of the key contributions of the Bolshevik
   Revolution to the colonial nations such as India and puts them into
   historical context. It argues that the Bolshevik Revolution and its
   leaders, especially V.I. Lenin should be recognised as making a major
   contribution to the anti-colonial struggle and the fight to achieve
   equality in the community of world of nations. This article then points
   out how Lenin has provided assistance to the struggle to achieve freedom
   and end colonialism. He wrote in support of the people who were
   oppressed for centuries in the colonies and also invited them to Moscow
   and discussed with them their situation. Colonialism produced economic
   backwardness in India as British colonial rule led to huge change in the
   Indian economy to fit the interests of British ruling elites, i.e.
   merchants and industrialists. The study concludes that the Bolshevik
   Revolution dealt a significant blow to the imperialist countries.
   Despite the collapse of the Soviet Union, there is no doubt that the
   Bolshevik Revolution had changed the world history. It made
   decolonisation possible and contributed to the defeat of fascism.},

Abstract = {In 2003, the premiers of Canada's ten provinces and three territories
   established the Council of the Federation (CoF) to strengthen
   interprovincial cooperation and exercise leadership on national issues.
   However, the purpose of COF in practice has not been the subject of
   systematic study. Against the backdrop of its predecessor, the Annual
   Premiers' Conference, and the broader institutional and economic forces
   that contribute more generally to weak institutionalization of Canada's
   multilateral intergovernmental forums, this paper considers the
   functioning of CoF in practice by analysing the nature of the joint
   positions of premiers expressed in communiques it has issued to the end
   of Conservative government rule, 2015. This analysis reveals the
   spectrum of `vertical' and `horizontal' measures that CoF has
   undertaken, and the nature of integration of CoF with other multilateral
   intergovernmental forums. It concludes that CoF is not immune to the
   underlying forces contributing more generally to the weak
   institutionalization of multilateral intergovernmental councils.},

Abstract = {John D. Rockefeller, Jr. expended some \$2.85 million on restoration
   work at Versailles, Fontainebleau, and Reims Cathedral in the 1920s and
   1930s. Tempting as it is to see this expenditure as part of a broader
   philanthropic strategy after World War I, Rockefeller Junior was
   pursuing a largely personal interest in natural and cultural
   conservation; in these years he funded many other projects in the U.S.
   and around the world. Looking specifically at the French restorations,
   Gabriel Hanotaux characterized the work as ``the internationalism of
   beauty.{''} During the war, as president of the Rockefeller Foundation
   and chairman of the United War Work Campaign, Rockefeller had learned a
   great deal about how philanthropy was being transformed. He and others
   began to see discrete and distinctive roles for mass popular giving
   campaigns, professionalized foundations, and government. Through his
   restoration work, he began to draw on those lessons to shape a
   distinctive role for his personal giving.},

Abstract = {In this article, I make a policy argument defending family-based
   immigration preferences in U.S. immigration law given recent calls by
   some labor economists, political philosophers, and now, the Trump
   Administration to move from a family-based immigration system to a
   skills and education based selection process. I begin by tracing
   historical policy arguments for limiting family-based immigration. I
   then challenge the view that family-based immigration is a fiscal burden
   on the nation as a whole and acts against the interests of disadvantaged
   U.S.-born workers. Finally, I respond to objections to family-based
   immigration by disadvantaged citizens who believe that they are
   suffering from competition with immigrants not selected for their
   education or skills, including those sponsored by family members.},

   Codifying coordinated regulations for University research centers to
   ensure the unity of the researchers, lack of definite and fixed output
   for commercializing, study of the increasing mass of the number of
   registered patents, rise of the complexity of the patents
   (interdisciplinary patents) that lead to the limitations for the
   innovators in obtaining intellectual property rights, lack of the
   cooperation of the developing countries because of the obstacles of
   registering patents and being bereft of the benefits of nano because of

Abstract = {The present article examines the Human Rights Committee's pronouncements
   on the relationship between the International Covenant on Civil and
   Political Rights (ICCPR) and international humanitarian law (IHL),
   taking into account the developments in the jurisprudence of other human
   rights bodies. The analysis aims to clarify the theoretical
   underpinnings of the relationship between the ICCPR and IHL, paying
   special attention to the complementarity perspective and the
   interpretive principle of systemic integration. The article critically
   examines the Human Rights Committee's understanding of how the Covenant
   applies in armed conflict, specifically in relation to the protection of
   the rights to life and liberty and the regulation of the use of force
   and security detention; it considers both the shortcomings and the
   innovative aspects of the Committee's interpretations. The analysis
   concludes by exploring the normative and practical implications deriving
   from the concurrent application of IHL and the Covenant, particularly
   with regard to the Committee's ability to review state action in armed
   conflict, the duty to investigate violations, and the right to a remedy
   and reparation for victims.},

Abstract = {The question of the possibility to implement the upper limit of voting
   right is rather sensitive yet on the rise in democratic societies. The
   main goal of the research is to concentrate on moral and social
   consequences of eventual introduction of such limitation, and
   presentation of related pros and cons. Secondary, it aims to contribute
   to real and substantial professional discussion about this sensitive and
   specific topic. The article intends to provide a rational explanation of
   relevancy of our dilemma and its consequences for development of
   democracy and credibility of elections, as well as application of Social
   Darwinism theory and theory of public choice on the researched topic.
   Methodological framework in our work includes analysis of political
   scientists' and thinkers' works. The advocacy and criticism of the topic
   of our research is made by synthesis of their works. We are analyzing as
   well the legal documents, which create normative obstacles to our
   intention. Eventually, the authors reached coherent insights on this
   dilemma and conclude that even if risks are present, the upper limit of
   suffrage could lead to stability and credibility of elections.},

Journal = {NORDIC JOURNAL OF HUMAN RIGHTS},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {35},
Number = {4, SI},
Pages = {341-359},
Abstract = {This paper presents a critical view on the extent to which international
   standards (treaty and non-treaty obligations) prescribe particular
   features for electoral systems, for representation in parliament, and
   how they have been reflected in international election observation
   mission (IEOM) reports. Apart from regulating the equality of the vote
   and an acceptable deviation from equality, there are few specific
   requirements for systems of representation in the standards. The
   requirements of genuine and fair elections may be interpreted to exclude
   unreasonable systems, but the interpretation would often be
   controversial. In some non-treaty documents, it is even explicitly
   stated that anything goes as long as the few defined requirements are
   met. Against this background, IEOM reports have been very careful not to
   comment on systems of representation. In rare cases, however, comments
   have been issued, in post-conflict situations in particular. The paper
   points out inconsistencies in the interpretation of international
   standards by IEOMs and argues that detailed standards may help remove
   inconsistencies and reduce the claims of application of double
   standards. The paper also discusses inconsistencies following the
   restrictions some of the non-treaty documents make on the requirement of
   equality of votes to one (the lower) house of the legislature.},

Abstract = {Substantial part of the academic world as well as politics recognizes
   civil society organizations as important positive actors in political
   change, in democratization as well as in peacebuilding. But the
   empirical evidence from some conflict prone areas show that civil
   society organizations can have substantial conflict boosting potential.
   This article investigates the role of Taiwanese civil society
   organizations in shaping the relationship between Mainland China and
   Taiwan. It shows that Taiwanese CSOs hold a very complicated position
   which has in fact added to tensions in cross-strait relations. The
   conflict potential of Taiwanese CSOs in cross-strait relations grows not
   only from the difference in political regimes between China and Taiwan,
   but also from the special relationship of Taiwanese CSOs with political
   elites, the incompatibility of building peace in cross-strait relations
   and democratization in Taiwan, from the Chinese concentrated action
   against Taiwanese CSOs in international arena and from the deep division
   of the Taiwanese society about the political future of the island.},

   reconfiguration. The analytical category based on the Content Analysis

   Paulo), Marcelo Crivella (PRB-Rio de Janeiro), Rafael Greca
   (PMN-Curitiba) and Roberto Claudio (PDT-Fortaleza). The results point to
   these candidates' general choice to reinforce their own personal
   characteristics rather than discussing political proposals or ideas of

Title = {German MPs and interest groups in EU multilevel policy-making: the
   politics of information exchange},
Journal = {WEST EUROPEAN POLITICS},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {40},
Number = {5, SI},
Pages = {1004-1024},
Abstract = {Policy-makers regularly interact with interest groups to exchange
   information. This provides, it is often argued, the former with input
   needed to formulate effective policies and the latter with political
   influence. This article shares this broad perspective. In contrast to
   large parts of the literature, however, the paper argues for a political
   perspective on information exchanges between parliamentarians and
   interest groups. This perspective builds on party politicians'
   ideological positions to explain the scope of parliamentarians'
   information exchanges with different types of interest groups. In order
   to move away from the idea that information is a scarce resource for
   parliamentarians their interactions with interest groups are put in the
   context of their intra-party information exchanges. The empirical
   analysis of original survey data of members of the German Bundestag
   broadly confirms the article's main arguments.},

Abstract = {In 2005, Dutch cartoonist Kurt Faster Gurt published sketches of Prophet
   Muhammad (PBUH) in the Jyllands-Posten newspaper as well as in PDF form
   via its website. The images depicted the Prophet (PBUH) and his
   companions in what Islamic countries around the world deemed as
   derogatory at best and blasphemous at worst. This article looks at the
   decision by the Jordanian General Prosecutor to put on trial Kurt Faster
   Gurt and his cartoonists in 2008, which opened the flood gates to
   numerous challenges to domestic cyber laws having international
   jurisdiction. From Yahoo to YouTube, the Jordanian decision set a
   precedent for what has become a new world of law and politics, whereby
   Internet content producers, no matter where in the world they appear,
   could be held accountable to domestic cybercrime laws. To explain the
   Jordanian approach, other legal cases are studied in which it is proven
   that the damage caused by some material available in the Internet may
   justify the indictment of their authors by national Courts regardless
   the defendant's nationality or place of residence. Such cases urge
   States to provide for themselves an adequate legal corpus to be able to
   cope with these cases and to be able to implement the Court's decisions.},

Abstract = {The 1995 Beijing Platform for Action (BPfA) established a global norm to
   recognize the economic value of unpaid care work across the world. In
   1999, Venezuela became the first of three South American countries to
   enshrine a similar norm with its Constitution in its Article 88. I argue
   that despite the temporal proximity of the two events and the global
   significance of the BPfA, the global norm only served partially as a
   tipping point for Venezuela. Taking an analytical framework that
   underscores the role of norm-takers, this article demonstrates that
   other, national, regional and transnational interactions led by national
   actors in national and regional arenas were as important as Beijing 95
   for the development of Article 88.},

   Revolucionario (MCR), whose action was concentrated in the Region de La
   Araucania, Chile. An ethnographic approach with testimonies and in-depth
   interviews with mapuche and chileans who participated in the MCR were
   used as instruments of data collection. The relationships established
   between the left group and the mapuche responded to a reciprocal
   relationship guided by interests of both groups, as well as the
   configuration of multiple identities between those who participated in
   the direct actions promoted by the MCR.},

Abstract = {In today's government, executive officers interact continually with
   Congress on issues of legislation and administration. But does the
   Constitution's text support such interaction? This article argues that a
   basis may be found in the State of the Union and the Recommendation
   clauses of Article II. Combining an examination of the Constitution's
   text with Alexander Hamilton's at times ambiguous tenure as Treasury
   secretary, this article argues that such interaction fits within the
   structure of the two branches. Furthermore, this article distinguishes
   the two clauses by claiming that executive officers must respond to most
   requests for information but only recommend at the president's
   discretion.},

Abstract = {This article attempts to explain the decision of governments in Latin
   America and the Caribbean to grant expatriates voting rights in their
   country of origin. Focusing on 24 Latin American and Caribbean countries
   from 1980 to 2012, the study investigates the effects of remittance
   flows, globalization, leftist-party control of the executive branch, and
   several other controls on the likelihood that governments will grant
   voting rights for their citizens residing abroad. The statistical models
   are estimated with Cox proportional hazard regression. The results add
   to the literature on migration by demonstrating that remittance flows
   influence the likelihood that governments will adopt policies granting
   expatriate voting rights, although the influence is non-linear. Partisan
   control is also shown to be important, although the level of wealth,
   globalization, policy diffusion, and other controls were not found to be
   significant.},

Abstract = {This article contributes to the literature on parliamentary design in
   general and the pioneer literature on parliamentary bodies specialized
   in gender equality in particular. It does so by establishing a frame for
   the critical assessment of the impacts of such an institutional design.
   Moreover, by using interviews and data on the behavior of committee
   members, it demonstrates the advantages of applying a mixed method
   within a field that has mostly relied on participant interviews. A
   systematic analysis of the impact of the Danish Committee on Gender
   Equality shows that although this particular committee has not succeeded
   in adding the perspective of gender equality to legislation, it has
   increased parliamentary control with the government. Furthermore, it has
   enabled much better interaction between parliament and civil society
   organizations.},

Abstract = {This article examines the differential effects of social capital on
   policy equity in state outcomes. Specifically, it explores the
   relationship between social capital and incarceration rates in the
   American states paying particular attention to racial disparities in
   incarceration rates. Building on work by Hero, I present a theoretical
   explanation and empirical support for how social capital operates
   differently under different racial contexts. I argue that social capital
   enhances social empathy in homogeneous contexts and social controls in
   diverse contexts. Using state-level longitudinal data on the contiguous
   states, I find that social capital is positively associated with
   incarcerations, but only for African Americans. Furthermore, the effects
   of social capital appear to be conditional on racial context where this
   relationship is stronger as minority group size increases.},

Abstract = {The April 2016 clashes between the Azerbaijani and Armenian armies along
   the Nagorno-Karabakh Line of Contact caused the highest number of human
   losses since the 1994 ceasefire, and highlighted the fragility of the
   status quo and necessity for substantive, properly mediated talks. From
   Azerbaijan's perspective, there were various reasons behind the April
   war, including the deadlock in negotiations and lack of prospects for
   substantive talk. The intensifying and increasing frequency of
   skirmishes on the Line of Contact made it necessary for Baku to seek
   better military-tactical positioning.},

Abstract = {Parliamentary entry on the national level is a crucial achievement for
   any new party. But its repercussions are not necessarily beneficial.
   This article assesses the electoral consequences of parliamentary
   breakthrough by theorizing factors that shape (a) a new party
   organization's capacity to cope with pressures generated by
   parliamentary entry and (b) the relative intensity of the new functional
   pressures a new party is exposed to after breakthrough. To test our
   hypotheses derived from these two rationales, we apply multilevel
   analyses to a new data set covering 135 organizationally new parties
   that entered national parliament across 17 advanced democracies over
   nearly five decades (1968-2015). Our findings stress the importance of
   party organizational characteristics (party origin, time for party
   building and leadership continuity) for parties' capacity to sustain
   electoral support after breakthrough. In contrast, the intensity of
   functional pressures as generated by government participation
   immediately after breakthrough does not have significant effects on
   parties' performance at the follow-up election.},

Journal = {IZQUIERDAS},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {36},
Pages = {200-221},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Since the recovery of democracy in 1990, legal mobilization has become a
   key strategy for the Chilean union movement. Trade unions increasingly
   turn to the Labor Department or the courts for challenging the
   employers' power and putting pressure over the State to make changes on
   the labor order. Based on interviews with different labor actors, this
   article evaluates the effects of this phenomenon for workers. It argues
   that legal mobilization has allowed unions to gain certain rights and
   expand their margin of action in companies. However, this strategy has
   not produced substantial changes in the inherited labor order. The
   article identifies two causes of this: 1) the undesirable effects of the
   use of this strategy on the strength of the trade union organization; 2)
   changes in the orientation of the Labor Department and the courts.},

Abstract = {What determines countries' successful transition to democracy? This
   article explores the impact of granting civil rights in authoritarian
   regimes and especially the gendered aspect of this process. It argues
   that both men's and women's liberal rights are essential conditions for
   democratisation to take place: providing both women and men rights
   reduces an inequality that affects half of the population, thus
   increasing the costs of repression and enabling the formation of women's
   organising - historically important to spark protests in initial phases
   of democratisation. This argument is tested empirically using data that
   cover 173 countries over the years 1900-2012 and contain more nuanced
   measures than commonly used. Through novel sequence analysis methods,
   the results suggest that in order to gain electoral democracy a country
   first needs to furnish civil liberties to both women and men.},

Abstract = {Development projects like schools and latrines are popular with
   politicians and voters alike, yet many developing countries are littered
   with half-finished projects that were abandoned mid-construction. Using
   an original database of over 14,000 small development projects in Ghana,
   I estimate that one-third of projects that start are never completed,
   consuming nearly one-fifth of all local government investment. I develop
   a theory of project noncompletion as the outcome of a dynamically
   inconsistent collective choice process among political actors facing
   commitment problems in contexts of limited resources. I find evidence
   consistent with key predictions of this theory, but inconsistent with
   alternative explanations based on corruption or clientelism. I show that
   fiscal institutions can increase completion rates by mitigating the
   operational consequences of these collective choice failures. These
   findings have theoretical and methodological implications for
   distributive politics, the design of intergovernmental transfers and
   aid, and the development of state capacity.},

Volume = {52},

Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Around the turn of the century, political developments in Northern
   Ireland, Fiji and Papua New Guinea encouraged claims that preferential
   voting systems could steer polities in the direction of moderate'
   multi-ethnic government. Sixteen years later, we have a longer time
   period and larger volume of data to reassess these verdicts. This
   article investigates ballot transfer and party vote-seat share patterns
   in the seven deeply divided polities with some experience of
   preferential voting for legislative elections or direct presidential
   elections (Northern Ireland, Fiji, Papua New Guinea, Estonia, Sri Lanka,
   Bosnia-Herzegovina and Southern Rhodesia). We find little support for
   centripetalist claims that such systems encourage moderate' parties. We
   argue that where district magnitude is low, where voters are required to
   rank preferences and where ticket voting prevails, departures from
   vote-seat proportionality may favour moderate' parties, but such heavily
   engineered systems may simply advantage the larger parties or yield
   erratic outcomes.},

Abstract = {The communist AKEL party governed the Republic of Cyprus from February
   2008 to February 2013. During this period, AKEL had to deal with grave
   economic problems. This article uses the European Elections Study (2009)
   data and presents a statistical model that explains up to 70 per cent of
   the variance. We show that retrospective sociotropic evaluation of the
   economy by the Greek Cypriots has a significant effect on their
   intention to vote or not for the incumbent party. On the basis of this
   result, one may argue that the considerable amount of votes lost by AKEL
   in February 2013 presidential elections could be mainly because of the
   deteriorating economic situation since the party took office in February
   2008.},

Abstract = {Just as voters have ethnic identities, they also have economic
   interests. Government policies create winners and losers, favoring some
   economic groups or sectors and disfavoring others. And to the extent
   that economic interests divide populations into different blocs as
   ethnic identities do, politicians have options for building coalitions.
   Using the example of Zambia, I show that the recipes for successful
   coalition building have varied from election to election, and that
   shifting bases of partisan competition eventually brought about party
   turnover in power. With a demonstration of multidimensional party
   strategies, a clear contribution of the work lies in enhancing our
   ability to explain partisan change and alternation in power, despite a
   static ethnic map.},

Abstract = {This article develops a standard for evaluating how parliaments can
   contribute to the legitimacy of the European semester. It then uses that
   standard to identify where national parliaments may be able to oversee
   the semester through their relationships to their own governments and
   where that solution may, conversely, be insufficient. The article uses
   that analysis to raise four questions. Firstly, what powers over the
   semester should be exericed by some parliament somewhere? Secondly, how
   should any parliamentary participation in the semester be distributed
   across European, national and even sub-national parliaments? Thirdly,
   how far should parliaments co-operate in their responses to the
   semester? Fourthly, how uniform across parliaments should participation
   in the semester be?.},

Journal = {ELECTORAL STUDIES},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {49},
Pages = {118-127},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {This article examines electoral malapportionment by illuminating the
   relationship between malapportionment level and democracy. Although a
   seminal study rejects this relationship, we argue that a logical and
   empirically significant relationship exists, which is curvilinear and is
   based on a framework focusing on incumbent politicians' incentives and
   the constraints they face regarding malapportionment. Mal apportionment
   is lowest in established democracies and electoral authoritarian regimes
   with an overwhelmingly strong incumbent; it is relatively high in new
   democracies and authoritarian regimes with robust opposition forces. The
   seminal study's null finding is due to the mismatch between theoretical
   mechanisms and choice of democracy indices. Employing an original
   cross-national dataset, we conduct regression analyses; the results
   support our claims. Furthermore, on controlling the degree of democracy,
   the single-member district system's effects become insignificant.
   Australia, Belarus, the Gambia, Japan, Malaysia, Tunisia, and the United
   States illustrate the political logic underlying curvilinear relations
   at democracy's various levels. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {This article argues anarchy is undertheorized in International
   Relations, and that the undertheorization of the concept of anarchy in
   International Relations is rooted in Waltz's original discussion of the
   concept as equal to the invisibility of structure, where the lack of
   exogenous authority is not just a feature of the international political
   system but the salient feature. This article recognizes the
   international system as anarchical but looks to theorize its contours-to
   see the invisible structures that are overlaid within international
   anarchy, and then to consider what those structures mean for theorizing
   anarchy itself. It uses as an example the various (invisible) ways that
   gender orders global political relations to suggest that anarchy in the
   international arena is a place of multiple orders rather than of
   disorder. It therefore begins by theorizing anarchy with orders in
   global politics, rather than anarchy as necessarily substantively
   lacking orders. It then argues that gender orders global politics in
   various ways. It concludes with a framework for theorizing order within
   anarchy in global politics.},

Journal = {ELECTORAL STUDIES},

Volume = {49},

Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Mixed-member systems are usually defined as electoral systems that
   combine SMDP and CLPR, both of which are more likely to induce party
   reputation-seeking. Building on the literature of electoral
   institutions, this article provides an explanation of how mixed-member
   systems structure voter behavior and achieve a balance between
   candidate- and party-centric representation. Using Taiwan as a case of
   MMS, this article tests hypotheses against survey data and investigates
   the determinants of voting decisions for the two ballots. By employing a
   Bayesian bivariate probit model, this article shows that, first,
   partisan factors affect voter behavior in both nominal and list ballots.
   However, it is affective rather than rational considerations for
   political parties that play the major role. Second, personal reputation
   influences voters' choices of the nominal and list vote, but only
   negative elements matter for the list vote. Finally, there is a
   moderately positive correlation between the two ballots, which
   potentially results from affective, partisan considerations. (C) 2017

Abstract = {This article contains an integrated interdisciplinary approach to the
   study of legal security and its provision at an international level. The
   study is aimed at the development of conceptual approaches to the
   understanding of legal security in a general social sense and the ways
   of its provision at an international level. The evolution of approaches
   to the determination of an individual, society and a state legal
   security is considered, and attention is drawn to the need of legal
   component strengthening concerning the process of national and
   international security provision. The main determinants of international
   activity for legal security provision are established and systematized.},

Title = {Individual Differences in Group Loyalty Predict Partisan Strength},
Journal = {POLITICAL BEHAVIOR},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {39},
Number = {3},
Pages = {531-552},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {The strength of an individual's identification with their political
   party is a powerful predictor of their engagement with politics, voting
   behavior, and polarization. Partisanship is often characterized as
   primarily a social identity, rather than an expression of instrumental
   goals. Yet, it is unclear why some people develop strong partisan
   attachments while others do not. I argue that the moral foundation of
   Loyalty, which represents an individual difference in the tendency to
   hold strong group attachments, facilitates stronger partisan
   identification. Across two samples, including a national panel and a
   convenience sample, as well as multiple measures of the moral
   foundations, I demonstrate that the Loyalty foundation is a robust
   predictor of partisan strength. Moreover, I show that these effects
   cannot be explained by patriotism, ideological extremity, or directional
   effects on partisanship. Overall, the results provide further evidence
   for partisanship as a social identity, as well as insight into the
   sources of partisan strength.},

Abstract = {Managing conflicts efficiently has become a universal concern (Lipsky et
   al., 2003). Beyond the well-known fact that conflicts are consubstantial
   to life in society, today we must bear in mind that interpersonal
   relationships are antagonistic and at the same time complementary, that
   the world has become globalized, and that conflicts, in many cases, are
   much more complex than before. In short, we live in a constant paradigm
   shift and `` when the paradigms change, the world itself changes with
   them{''} (Khun, 1962). The cases of three large American companies
   (COCA-COLA, PECO Energy and ScheringPlough) are cited, among others, as
   representative examples of the 1990s that, leading very different
   sectors, but with a shared dissatisfaction with the traditional formulas
   for conflict resolution, generated new and successful internal
   organisational management models. The development of this new area of
   management in the large US organisations was, in its day, a new reality
   for the organisations, and led to the conduct of several applied studies
   led by research groups from different universities, models to be
   followed today, due to their methodology and because of the effective
   and conclusive results they have provided. This paper aims to summarise
   the main conclusions of these studies in order to provide the keys to
   the shift towards efficient management of conflicts in the business
   environment that happen, on many occasions, as we will see, by the
   proper use of mediation in a given company ` s conflict typology.},

Abstract = {The dominant perspective on federalism and American public opinion
   suggests that Americans simply do not consider federalism when making
   policy evaluations. Recently, however, several scholars have argued that
   even if Americans do not make legalistic or theoretical references to
   federalism, they often think intuitively about intergovernmental
   politics. This study presents the results of a three-part survey
   experiment designed to assess how readily individuals come to think
   about federalism when evaluating public policy. In general, individuals
   do not consider the intergovernmental implications of policy, even when
   asked to explicitly compare two levels of government. Overwhelmingly,
   individual preference for government activity obscures concerns for
   federalism in eight of nine substantive policy domains. Yet, this
   indeterminacy does not mean that public opinion is irrelevant for
   studies of American federalism. Rather, it is a highly malleable
   instrument that political elites can use to leverage public support for
   policies.},

Abstract = {Policy feedback theory argues that public policies shape mass political
   behavior by teaching citizens about their relationship to government. I
   reevaluate this argument by examining how criminal justice policy shapes
   the political orientations and participation of blacks and whites. I
   argue that, because these policies send different messages to blacks
   than to whites about the treatment they can expect from government,
   these groups have opposite reactions to criminal justice enforcement.
   Using data from a 2014 national survey and information on local criminal
   justice outcomes, I find that racially skewed criminal justice
   enforcement is associated with negative political orientations and lower
   rates of political participation for highly educated blacks. I also find
   that whites respond positively to similar criminal justice outcomes when
   they reside in areas with large black populations. The results show that
   unequal policy outcomes lead to political inequality.},

Abstract = {This essay studies the links between the ideas of sacred and community
   in the College de sociologie. In this ``institution{''}, established by
   G. Bataille, R. Caillois and M. Leiris, the criticism of modernity and
   secularization - which consists in the link between instrumental reason
   and mass society - is based on the concepts of sacred and myth. For the
   members of the ``College{''}, psychoanalytic account and sociology of
   primitive peoples both show that the social structure is based on a core
   of violence: they underline the negative element in the social process,
   to produce a political and cultural alternative to the modern society.
   Hence, anthropology, ethnology and surrealist avant-garde contribute to
   create a different language of critical theory, which is very
   interesting, although problematic.},

Abstract = {The international court of justice was established by Charter of the
   United Nations and is considered as one of its integral parts in which
   only experienced and knowledgeable judges and lawyers can be employed.
   In fact, it consists of several independent judicial institutions.
   Marshall Islands, a country which was cruelly imposed to nuclear tests,
   was brave enough to sue powerful countries with nuclear weapons. In
   1996, nuclear weapons case was considered by the international court of
   justice for the first time. All the court's members came to this
   conclusion that these countries should stop their nuclear activities and
   they are not permitted to use any nuclear weapon. As a result they
   ratified a bill. Then, Marshall Islands' petition was considered by the
   international court of justice in The Hague. This country also took
   legal action against U.S. A. and the federal judiciary of the United
   States accepted to take it into consideration. This paper aims at
   analyzing the petition of Marshall Islands against Britain in the
   international court of justice. According to the content of this
   petition, countries can't develop their nuclear weapons which threat men
   and the world. As a result, the destruction of present nuclear weapons
   is the only effective way to achieve this goal.},

Abstract = {In this paper we discuss how an innovative audio-visual project was
   adopted to foster active, rather than declarative learning, in critical
   International Relations (IR). First, we explore the aesthetic turn in
   IR, to contrast this with forms of representation that have dominated IR
   scholarship. Second, we describe how students were asked to record short
   audio or video projects to explore their own insights through aesthetic
   and non written formats. Third, we explain how these projects are
   understood to be deeply embedded in social science methodologies. We
   cite our inspiration from applying a personal sociological imagination,
   as a way to counterbalance a `marketised' slant in higher education, in
   a global economy where students are often encouraged to consume, rather
   than produce knowledge. Finally, we draw. conclusions in terms of deeper
   forms of student engagement leading to new ways of thinking and
   presenting new skills and new connections between theory and practice.},

Pages = {299-318},

Abstract = {This article contributes to our understanding of policy diffusion in two
   ways. First, by explicitly focusing on the competition mechanism of
   diffusion, I consider how policy externalities contribute to free-rider
   dynamics or competitive races across the American states. The second
   contribution is the focus on the interdependence of the early stages of
   agenda setting as well as policy enactments. Using a unique dataset on
   four different types of tobacco policies that are introduced and
   eventually enacted in the states from 1990 to 2010, I find evidence that
   states engage in free-riding dynamics and that strategic interaction
   exists in the early stages of agenda setting. There is also evidence
   that states respond to legitimate policy threats in neighboring states.
   Overall, the results stress the importance of scholars to explore the
   conditional nature of policy diffusion dynamics by focusing on
   variations in policy content and stages of the policymaking process
   other than policy enactment.},

Abstract = {Hybrid regimes like electoral authoritarianism blend elements of
   democratic and non-democratic political practices. Hybrid regimes can
   develop from populism or can themselves develop populism to explain and
   justify their democratic shortcomings. Where the latter occurs, populism
   is a tool of regime stabilisation rather than a form of populism in
   power'. Moving from using some populist themes to assist regime
   stabilisation to official populism requires the development of populist
   discourse to a point where it becomes definitional of what constitutes
   the relationship between state and society. The paper uses the example
   of Russia to discuss the uses of populism in a hybrid regime. Populist
   rhetoric has been used by the Putin regime since the mid-2000s, but was
   initially balanced by other discourses. This changed during the
   2011-2012 electoral cycle as a conservative-traditional populist
   discourse was deployed that redefined political agency and the
   relationship of the state to Russian society.},

Abstract = {How do emotions affect public opinion on the European Union? This
   article advances existing literature that focuses on cue-taking,
   utilitarianism and identity by arguing that emotional reactions are
   important to understanding citizen attitudes towards the European Union.
   This is because discrete emotions such as fear, anger and enthusiasm
   affect how individuals deal with threats and how they seek out, process
   and use information. We hypothesise that, compared to anxious citizens,
   those angry with the European Union are more likely to wish to leave the
   European Union, less receptive to cost-benefit considerations, and less
   nuanced in their opinions about integration. Our analyses, carried out
   using a survey conducted in the UK in April 2015, support our
   hypotheses. These results help us predict the effectiveness of political
   strategies, e.g. in referendum campaigns.},

Abstract = {Theories of toleration maintain that people sometimes have good reasons
   not to act on their convictions, however strong. Theories of latitude
   maintain that one should doubt the strength of one's convictions. While
   toleration has often been taken to be foundational for the liberal
   tradition, another view (made fully explicit by Brian Barry's Justice as
   Impartiality) is that we should look, rather, to the idea of latitude,
   as exemplified in late seventeenth-century Anglican writings. Taking
   these writings as its initial point of reference, the article maintains
   that toleration, rather than latitude, should be seen as foundational
   for the liberal tradition, which is better understood in terms of what
   one person owes to another than in terms of the relative validity of
   their beliefs.},

Abstract = {This study examines the effects of personality traits on voter turnout
   in South Korea. While it has been demonstrated that no direct
   relationships exist between personality traits and voter participation
   in South Korea, we argue that personality traits have indirect effects
   on turnout through such attitudinal factors as political interest,
   political efficacy, partisanship, and ideology. Using data from Korean
   General Social Survey (KGSS) 2012, we find that political interest and
   political efficacy play an important role in mediating the relationships
   between personality traits and voter turnout in South Korea. However,
   contrary to our expectations, there is either weak or no evidence on the
   mediating role of partisanship and ideology in the relationships between
   personality traits and voter turnout. To sum up, our findings provide
   some support to the indirect relationships between personality traits
   and voter turnout in South Korea and imply that the impacts of
   personality traits on voter participation vary by country or geographic
   region.},

Abstract = {In modern discourse, Liverpool is a by-word for anti-Tory sentiment, yet
   the city has not always been so inhospitable for the Conservatives. From
   the mid-18th century until the 1970s, the Conservatives dominated the
   city council and often held over half of Liverpool's parliamentary
   constituencies. Whilst popular opinion ascribes Conservative decline in
   Liverpool to Margaret Thatcher, Conservative Prime Minister from 1979 to
   1990, it began a decade before Thatcher gained power. This article
   argues that Conservative decline in Liverpool was due to the increasing
   inability of socialisation to create new Conservative voters, coupled
   with dissatisfaction with the Heath government and a rejection of
   unresponsive local party machines. The Liberal Party, through their use
   of pavement politics, were able to exploit these issues. Their 1973
   local election victory allowed them to displace the Conservatives as the
   main opposition to Labour in most of the city, thus beginning the
   strange death of Tory Liverpool.},

Abstract = {In 2010, the Supreme Court's decision on Citizens United v. FEC, fueled
   public outcry about the growth of the cost of the political campaign and
   the influx of outside money in the form of independent expenditures.
   President Barack Obama seemed to agree with this speculation calling
   independent expenditures, ``dark money{''} that ``pulls our politics
   into the gutter{''} {[}Obama, Barack. 2015. ``The Citizens United
   Decision was Wrong.{''} (Press Release). Retrieved from
   https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2015/01/21/statement-preside
   nt.]. Indeed, signs pointing to the increase in the cost of campaigns
   are correct, as 2014 saw the most expensive congressional elections in
   history. In this paper, we examine the effects of outside group spending
   on Senate races in 2010, 2012, and 2014. We find that outside group
   spending does play a significant, though small role in determining the
   vote share of a candidate. We also find that outside group spending in
   support of a candidate is generally more effective than outside group
   spending against a candidate, especially for the incumbent. Still,
   outside group expenditures pale in comparison to campaign expenditures
   for the challenger in terms of overall effect.},

Abstract = {Which states join international institutions? Existing theories of the
   multilateral trade regime, the GATT/WTO, emphasize gains from
   cooperation on substantive policies regulated by the institution. We
   argue that political ties rather than issue-area functional gains
   determine who joins, and we show how geopolitical alignment shapes the
   demand and supply sides of membership. Discretionary accession rules
   allow members to selectively recruit some countries in pursuit of
   foreign policy goals, and common interests attract applicants who are
   not yet free traders. We use a duration model to statistically analyze
   accession time to application and length of accession negotiations for
   the period 1948-2014. Our findings challenge the view that states first
   liberalize trade to join the GATT/WTO. Instead, democracy and foreign
   policy similarity encourage states to join. The importance of political
   ties for membership in the trade regime suggests that theories of
   international institutions must look beyond narrowly defined
   institutional scope.},

Abstract = {This paper describes the development process of voting behavior in
   Chile; particularly the relationship between the class voting theory and
   the theory of cultural post-materialist vote is investigated. This
   research deals with Chile as a case study, a developing country with a
   relatively stable democracy since 1990 and although it has been
   mentioned in various investigations, has not been given the depth and
   perspective necessary to understand the political scene in which their
   electoral processes are developed. We seek to test the relationship
   between socioeconomic status of voters, their post-materialist values
   and the results of the elections in which they participate.},

Abstract = {What institutional arrangements allow veto players to secure maximal
   welfare when all agree on both the need for and the direction of policy
   change? To answer this question, we conduct a mechanism design analysis.
   We focus on a system with two veto players, each with incomplete
   information about the other's policy preferences. We show that the
   unique welfare-maximizing mechanism is the mechanism that implements the
   preferred policy of the player whose ideal policy is closer to the
   status quo. We provide examples of institutional structures under which
   the unique equilibrium outcome of this two-player incomplete information
   game is the policy outcome implemented by this mechanism, and argue that
   our result can be used as a normative benchmark to assess the optimality
   of veto player institutions.},

Abstract = {This article intends to provide a brief intellectual look in analyzing
   the State from a Marxist perspective. Three main ideas are addressed:
   the idea of the State as social relationship; the idea of the State as a
   transition State; and the idea of the socialist transition as a
   democratic transition. Thus, by developing these discussion points, one
   of the most ambitious theories of Marxism will be projected: i.e. the
   historical construction of the community-formation on the
   socio-political weakening of the State-formation.},

Abstract = {One important and, to date, overlooked component of democratic
   accountability is the extent to which it might exacerbate existing
   societal inequalities if the outcomes for some groups of citizens are
   prioritized over others when voters evaluate governmental performance.
   We analyze a decade of California school board elections and find
   evidence that voters reward or punish incumbent board members based on
   the achievement of white students in their district, whereas outcomes
   for African American and Hispanic students receive comparatively little
   attention. We then examine public opinion data on the racial education
   achievement gap and report results from an original list experiment of
   California school board members that finds approximately 40\% of
   incumbents detect no electoral pressure to address poor academic
   outcomes among racial minority students. We conclude by discussing the
   implications of these findings for several scholarly literatures,
   including retrospective voting, racial inequality in political
   influence, intergovernmental policymaking, and education politics.},

Abstract = {The transformation of rebel groups into political parties has captured
   the attention of scholars of both conflict studies and of party
   transformation. In this paper we examine the question of rebel party
   image change by investigating the causes of name changes adopted by a
   rebel organization as it transforms into a political party after the end
   of a civil conflict. We develop an analytical framework based upon the
   extensive literature on party identity change in the West, and apply it
   to the name changes of rebel parties. Using an original data set of 54
   former rebel organizations, we find that factors internal to the
   organization (such as the degree of inclusivity and the origins of the
   rebel organization) explain name change more than factors related to the
   post conflict environment.},

Abstract = {Contrary to longstanding arguments that equate parties with durable,
   information-rich brand names, the relabeling of parties is not rare, and
   in many countries it is not even very unusual. This paper provides the
   first effort to document this neglected phenomenon. It finds that across
   European democracies roughly a third of all parties have relabeled
   themselves at least once since 1945, and a similar proportion of
   elections include at least one party running under a new name. It then
   presents analyses of why parties change names more frequently in some
   circumstances, finding support for three explanations derived from the
   existing literature: parties with longer-standing brands are less likely
   to shed them, but relabeling is more likely for parties that suffer
   electoral setbacks and for parties in weaker party systems. Finally, it
   presents evidence that the end of Soviet communism made left parties
   more likely to rename themselves.},

Abstract = {While there is a substantial literature highlighting the presence of
   social dynamics in legislatures, we know very little about the precise
   processes that generate these social dynamics. Yet, whether social
   dynamics are due to peer pressure, frequency of interaction, or genuine
   learning, for example, has important implications for questions of
   political representation and accountability. We demonstrate how a recent
   innovation can be used to study the diffusion of behavior within
   legislatures. In particular, we study diffusion within the US House of
   Representatives by looking at the dynamic process underlying discharge
   petitions. The discharge procedure shares many characteristics with
   other forms of legislative behavior, yet it has one important advantage
   when it comes to studying social dynamics: we can observe when members
   decide to sign petitions. Based on data from 1995 to 2014, we find that
   the social dynamics underlying the discharge procedure tend to involve
   the rational evaluation of information conveyed by the behavior of
   previous petition signatories.},

Abstract = {This paper addresses the electoral consequences of the German
   government's anti-nuclear power policy shift after the Fukushima
   accident. Building on a cost-benefit framework and insights from
   political psychology, the theoretical analysis anticipates that the
   policy shift could not earn governing parties additional votes but could
   avoid vote loss. Utilizing data from multiple surveys and employing
   simulation techniques, the evidence demonstrates that voters, in
   particular incumbents' supporters, became more skeptical of nuclear
   power after the Fukushima disaster. At the same time, governing parties'
   supporters were particularly eager to perceive a credible change in the
   government's nuclear power stance. As a consequence, governing parties
   did not garner additional votes but inhibited their supporters from
   voting for other parties and thus avoided vote loss. Generally speaking,
   the novel approach proposed in this paper is suitable for shedding light
   on electoral effects of parties' policy shifts that have thus far gone
   unnoticed.},

Abstract = {The main purpose of this discussion paper is to present a general view
   of the consequences of Plan Colombia for the Colombian conflict during
   the last 15 years. During that period, the governments of the United
   States and Colombia have worked together to fight the most significant
   challenge for security at the turn of the 21st century. The goals of
   Plan Colombia of reducing the cultivation, production, and distribution
   of illegal narcotics -being the cultivation of coca the main target-were
   not achieved. In addition, with Plan Colombia illegal mining grew and
   became an important income for Colombian narco-terrorist groups.
   However, with this strategy Colombia has achieved significant goals such
   as the strengthening of Colombian institutions and the consolidation of
   government presence in all regions of the national territory. Such a
   strategy has also contributed to restructuring the political and legal
   systems, the strengthening of the economy, the professionalization of
   the Armed Forces, and has made possible the beginning of processes that
   aimed at obtaining a negotiated peace agreement with the Revolutionary
   Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC), and the National Liberation Army (ELN).},

Abstract = {Do parties respond to voters' preferences on European integration in
   elections to the European Parliament (EP)? Following recent research
   that shows political party responsiveness to Eurosceptic attitudes
   during EP elections is conditioned by party characteristics, this
   article seeks to understand how party unity on European integration
   affects party responsiveness to Euroscepticism. It argues that when
   Eurosceptic attitudes among voters are high and the parties are divided
   in their position on European integration, parties will be more
   responsive to voters and take a more Eurosceptic position. To test the
   theoretical expectations, the study uses data from the Chapel Hill
   Expert Survey, the Euromanifestos Project, and European Election Study
   for 1989-2009 for over 120 parties across 20 European Union member
   states. The findings have important implications for understanding the
   nature of democratic representation in the European Union.},

Abstract = {People vary in their preferred times of day for activity. Notably, as
   individuals age, their daily energy and attention typically peaks
   earlier in the day. When voting is permitted may then affect voters' age
   distribution, even when holding constant the number of hours polls are
   open. Data from along the time-zone border in Kentucky, where
   poll-availability hours vary, supports this hypothesis: places where
   voting hours are later see higher turnout rates among younger voters and
   lower turnout rates among older voters. The one-hour delay in voting
   hours reduces older registrants' turnout, and boosts younger
   registrants', by roughly three percentage points.},

Abstract = {Southeast Asia is the world's most diverse and rapidly modernizing
   region, yet one where modernization theory is challenged (e.g. Bell et
   al., 1995) and where allegiance to authoritarian regimes appears
   trenchant (Chang et al., 2013; Dalton and Shin, 2014). Using the
   AsiaBarometer, I consider the influence of modernization and allegiance
   on potential democratization by analyzing an established indicator of
   assertive change: tolerance of homosexuality (Inglehart and Welzel,
   2005: Ch. 5, forth-coming). The findings reveal differences between
   Southeast Asians and the West and between citizens in the Sinic and
   Indic subregions. Exposure to foreign cultures produces a significant
   increase in tolerance among Sinicized citizens, but has no meaningful
   effect on those in Indic states. Patriotism and trust in civil society
   also boost tolerance among Sinicized citizens, but reduce the
   probability of tolerance among citizens in Indic states. The strong
   linkage between sexual tolerance and gender equality driven by social
   factors and secularism in the West does not manifest in Southeast Asia.
   While the findings suggest potential for change in the Sinicized region,
   they underscore the different effects that globalization and allegiance
   may have on citizens living under Southeast Asia's variety of regimes.},

Abstract = {From his early education to the end of his life Thomas Jefferson's
   materialism played an essential role in his understanding of
   Christianity and his hopes for its eventual reform. Jefferson regarded
   refuting the spiritualist, immaterialist corruptions of Christianity as
   necessary for guaranteeing that religious freedom and free inquiry,
   which Jefferson considered inseparable, existed in practice and not just
   in theory. Central to Jefferson's religious reformation was the question
   of the nature of human understanding and the issue of the material basis
   of thought, the study of which he at times referred to as metaphysics.
   Jefferson believed that free inquiry into the nature of human
   understanding would contribute to the reform of religion by separating
   the diamonds of primitive, or rational, Christianity from the dunghill
   of revealed religion, thus rendering religion a subordinate ally rather
   than an adversary of religious liberty and free inquiry.},

Volume = {7},

Pages = {7-23},

Abstract = {This study analyses the feasibility of China's One Belt, One Road (OBOR)
   initiative from an institutionalist perspective. The initiative is
   undertaken as a `geo-functional institutionalist' project, and this
   strengthens its feasibility. Firstly, the initiative aims to
   institutionalize a new international structure paralleling the existing
   Westerndominated one through which China could re-organize its position
   as an `agenda entrepreneur' in the world without any clash with the
   West. Secondly, the initiative follows a functionalist strategy. It
   offers a `win-win' functionalist framework without any hegemonic
   ambition; thus, the initiative attracts the attention of the rest of the
   world. China also follows a pure functionalist and bilateral/regional
   way to deal with the heterogeneity problem among the target countries.
   However, China's institutionalization attempt might be isomorphic with
   the existing Western-dominated system in terms of its hegemonic
   structure due to the cognitive limitations in finding alternatives, and
   this might ruin the feasibility of the initiative.},

   Congress and the president over how to shape policy, yet we know little
   about the issues on which veto politics take place or longitudinal
   changes to these dynamics. When a president threatens to veto a bill, he
   raises its visibility and scope and thus helps shape the federal
   government's issue agenda. This article examines the issue dynamics of
   veto threats from 1985 to 2014. When presidents threaten to veto
   legislation they do so on public priorities and where their threats may
   be more credible, while divided government leads presidents to try to
   protect their own issue priorities on spending bills.},

Abstract = {The travelling and appropriation of queer theory by francophone
   feminists in Quebec have been particularly long and arduous, prompting
   an inquiry into not only the reasons for this delay, but also into the
   elements that ultimately allowed for an integration of queer theory
   among francophone feminists. Combining tools from social movement
   literature on diffusion (brokerage, frames, repertoire of contention,
   etc.) and a political theory approach, this article divides the
   integration of queer theory among francophone feminists into two
   moments. In the first instance, activists and academic feminists have
   generally received queer theory with considerable criticism, which we
   have regrouped into 3 axes: 1) the deconstruction of women and lesbians
   as political subjects; 2) the investment in the symbolic aspects of
   politics, to the detriment of material relations and structures of
   power, and 3) the erasure of lesbian specificity and the absence of male
   privilege examination. In the second moment, the work of the Pink
   Panthers-a radical queer group-allows for frame bridging and the use of
   a recognisable repertoire of collective action to address two out of the
   three axes of criticism. This article suggests that the process of
   brokerage creates a crack in the wall of resistance that will quickly
   become a space for the insertion and integration, even if still
   conflictual, of queer theory into francophone feminism.},

Abstract = {Negativity towards mainstream politics is at an all-time high, with
   young people often targeted as the issue. However, are young people
   really to blame for political malaise? This article seeks to make sense
   of contemporary debate about political disenchantment in Australia using
   a cluster analysis to compare levels of complacency across generational
   cohorts. In this, we find no evidence to support the idea that
   Australians of any age cohort are complacent about their democracy.
   Although, there is some evidence of attitudinal differences between
   cohorts, criticisms of the practice of politics are also widely shared.
   Moreover, a majority of citizens appear to favour a mix of reforms
   combining mechanisms to open-up representative politics with
   opportunities for more direct intervention. To this end, we rebuke the
   narrative of a specific apathetic or disconnected Australian age cohort.},

Abstract = {Under what conditions do individuals withdraw support from dominant
   parties in nondemocratic regimes? Employing an original panel survey, we
   measure the same individuals' support for Russia's dominant party first
   at the peak of its dominance in 2008 and again shortly after it suffered
   a cascading defection of regime supporters in 2011-12. This allows us
   uniquely to explore the microfoundations of theories of regime defection
   cascades, generally supporting the argument that they involve complex
   ``informational{''} as well as ``reputational{''} processes.
   Accordingly, we find that early and eager movers in such a cascade tend
   to come from less socially vulnerable segments of the population, to
   have greater need to rely on other people for interpreting events, to
   believe the regime has lower levels of popular support, and to come from
   more heterogeneous communities. We find little role for mass media
   (including social media) or democratizing zeal in driving Russia's
   regime defection cascade.},

Abstract = {How do electoral authoritarian autocrats choose strategies for
   manipulating elections? Most scholars assume that autocrats strategize
   all electoral manipulation from above, with local regime agents charged
   with carrying out these top-down strategies. In contrast, a few assume
   that local regime agents strategize all electoral manipulation from the
   bottom up. More likely, reality lies in between. To make this point, I
   build an argument for how autocrats might configure the distribution of
   decisions over electoral manipulation among regime agents. I argue that
   autocrats delegate decisions about electoral manipulation to local
   regime agents in core regime districts - to ensure aggregate support -
   and to regime agents in recently marginal regime districts - to ensure
   territorial control. In contrast, autocrats determine strategies in
   long-time marginal districts and in those turned adverse to the regime.
   Statistical analysis of a unique political reform in one state in
   electoral authoritarian Mexico - where autocrats transferred the
   authority to restrict political rights and the secret ballot to some
   regime agents but not to all - supports the argument. It also reinforces
   the proposition that wholly centralized/decentralized decision-making
   about electoral manipulation only occurs under specific political
   conditions, raising questions about the empirical validity of these
   assumptions in current research.},

Abstract = {After the German Left, despite its split, had unequivocally welcomed the
   October Revolution, in January 1918 the attitude of the majority-SPD
   changed fundamentally, when the Bolsheviks prevented the constituent
   assembly from working. For Lenin, thus the SPD did no longer count as a
   possible partner. The Bolsheviks supported the founding of the KPD and
   lent massive financial support, however until mid-1920 the party
   remained small and without influence. The Russian interest focused on
   the Independent Social Democrats whose numbers grew rapidly in 1919,
   while at the same time the party became more radical. Joining the
   Communist International at first led to a factual, then also to an
   organisational split. Only by the left-wing majority on the USPD's party
   congress joining the KPD, the latter became a mass party. A few months
   later the Comintern led the VKPD to the ``March action{''} of 1921, the
   start of a rising meant to topple the Reich government by way of social
   unrest and armed violence. This reflected the pre-given and perceived
   image of the October Revolution.},

Abstract = {One hundred years after the October events in St. Petersburg, the number
   of interpretations counts by the thousands. Even if there are good
   reasons why this experiment of the century has lost almost all charisma,
   given the countless victims, nevertheless there are intelligent
   interpretations which are worth looking at because they are capable of
   providing better insights. Among them counts the comparison drawn ten
   years after the Russian Revolution by the almost forgotten Hungarian
   Social Democrat Siegmund Kunfi when he was in exile in Vienna. More
   systematically - and more intelligently - than others before him, he
   attempts to draw parallels between the course of the events in Russia,
   including the struggles between factions within the ruling Bolshevik
   Part, and the course of the great French Revolution of 1789. His - not
   frequently convincing - results are worthwhile still today, although
   there is reason for criticism.},

Abstract = {The study of secession generally stresses the causal influence of
   cultural identities, political preferences, or ecological factors.
   Whereas these different views are often considered to be mutually
   exclusive, this paper proposes a two-stage model in which they are
   complementary. We posit that cultural identities matter for explaining
   secessionism, but not because of primordial attachments. Rather,
   religious and linguistic groups matter because their members are imbued
   with cultural legacies that lead to distinct political preferences - in
   this case preferences over welfare statism. Further, ecological
   constraints such as geography and topography affect social interaction
   with like-minded individuals. On the basis of both these political
   preferences and ecological constraints, individuals then make rational
   choices about the desirability of secession. Instrumental considerations
   are therefore crucial in explaining the decision to secede, but not in a
   conventional pocketbook manner. To examine this theory, we analyze the
   2013 referendum on the secession of the Jura Bernois region from the
   Canton of Berne in Switzerland, using municipal level census and
   referendum data. The results lend support to the theory and suggest one
   way in which the politics of identity, based on factors like language
   and religion, can be fused with the politics of interest (preferences
   for more or less state intervention into the polity and economy) to
   better understand group behavior.},

Abstract = {Violence against women (VAW) represents a phenomenon that over the past
   decade has reached an unprecedented level in Italy. As a result this
   topic has been included amongst the key issues addressed by the
   Independent Evaluation Report on the occasion of the Italian OSCE
   Chairmanship 2018. Relying and building on the study conducted by this
   author in order to contribute to the Report, the present article
   provides an overview of the key findings of the research, discussing how
   and to what extent Italy's approach is in line with the OSCE commitments
   on VAW. This article aims at pointing out existing weaknesses and
   strengths of the Italian legal and policy framework as well as at
   identifying possible ways forward to bolster Italy's compliance with the
   OSCE commitments and the existing international and regional standards.},

Title = {Judicial Partisanship and the Slaughterhouse Cases: Investigating
   the Relationship Between Courts and Parties},
Journal = {STUDIES IN AMERICAN POLITICAL DEVELOPMENT},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {31},
Number = {1},
Pages = {24-46},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Scholars of judicial behavior have persuasively demonstrated that
   parties profoundly influence the elaboration of judicial doctrine, but
   have paid more limited attention to understanding how courts can
   transform the content of party agendas. In this article, I argue that
   judges can work to deliberately define the issue positions adopted by
   the political parties with which they are affiliated. I contend that
   judges can, like other political actors, use the tools of their office
   to further explicitly partisan goals. Although they may employ
   traditional modes of legal reasoning, judges may nevertheless craft
   their decisions in ways that prioritize certain party principles over
   others, interpret the law in ways that knit together the beliefs of
   divergent factions within their party coalition, articulate principles
   to guide the party's incorporation of new issues, and, in some
   instances, begin to outline a coherent ideological vision for the party.
   I develop this theory through a close examination of the Slaughterhouse
   Cases, regularly cited as a core building block of the American
   constitutional canon.},

Abstract = {Can emphasis on shared religion reduce out-group prejudice? To explore
   this question, we conducted a survey experiment on the effect of
   religious primes on Turkish citizens' attitudes and behavior toward
   Syrian refugees in Istanbul and Gaziantep. We used a factorial design to
   compare the independent and interactive effects of primes emphasizing
   refugees' Sunni or Muslim identity and a factual statement on the
   economic cost of the refugees. We find that religious primes increase
   respondents' level of donations to a charity supporting Syrian refugees
   and certain attitudinal measures of support for the refugees. We also
   uncovered a differential impact among the Sunni and Muslim primes and
   found that the statement of economic cost removed the pro-refugee effect
   of religious primes.},

Abstract = {Partisanship increasingly factors into the behavior of Americans in both
   political and nonpolitical situations, yet the bounds of partisan
   prejudice are largely unknown. In this paper, we systematically evaluate
   the limits of partisan prejudice using a series of five studies situated
   within a typology of prejudice. We find that partisan prejudice predicts
   suppression of hostile rhetoric toward one's own party, avoidance of
   members of the opposition, and a desire for preferential treatment for
   one's own party. While these behaviors may cause incidental or indirect
   harm to the opposition, we find that even the most affectively
   polarizedthose with the strongest disdain for the oppositionare no more
   likely to intentionally harm the opposition than those with minimal
   levels of affective polarization.},

Abstract = {This paper aims to study the absenteeism of Spanish Members of
   Parliament in the lower House during mid-nineteenth century as a means
   to consider political representation. In particular, the lack of
   attendance at Parliamentary sessions was so extended that it called into
   question the relationship between representatives and the represented
   from the perspective of accountability. The paper considers whether
   politicians were able to give satisfactory account of the parliamentary
   actions developed. The paper raises the possibility of the electorate's
   willingness to monitor parliament, which extended this engagement beyond
   liberal groups to include the citizenry more generally.},

Abstract = {There is a large literature arguing that countries with high employment
   protection legislation (EPL) have worse labour market performance. Yet,
   the overall impact of the crisis on France's labour market was
   comparatively limited. To solve this puzzle, this paper makes four
   points. First, it shows that France's labour market problems have not
   historically been about high EPL. Second, the crisis in France was not
   as acute as in the Euro area. Third, the costs of the crisis were
   concentrated on certain labour market groups. Finally, the government
   introduced several labour market policies in response to the crisis and
   labour market dualisation increased despite falling policy dualism.
   While deregulation seems - if anything - to have made matters worse, the
   government also introduced short-time work schemes, prolonged
   unemployment benefits and extended active labour market policies.
   Overall, this paper advances our understanding of labour market
   performance and policies in France during the crisis.},

Abstract = {In this issue, Dahlum and Knutsen (D\&K) claim to disprove the
   emancipatory theory of democracy proposed by Inglehart and Welzel
   (I\&W). 1 This theory posits that rising emphasis on universal freedoms,
   or what I\&W call `emancipative values', is a major force driving the
   emergence and survival of democracy.
   To support their claim, D\&K impute country scores to emancipative
   values for years in which real data are absent. 2 These imputations
   allow them to produce a time-series cross-sectional (TSCS) database,
   consisting of some 2,000 country-year observations. 3 Running panel
   regressions over these data, D\&K find that a population's emphasis on
   emancipative values in a given year has no effect on its level of
   democracy in the next year. D\&K believe that this result invalidates
   I\&W's theory, in which case the values of a population are irrelevant
   for whether it attains and sustains democracy.
   We appreciate this contribution because it provides a welcome
   opportunity to pinpoint some pitfalls of TSCS frameworks. To do so, we
   proceed in three steps. First, we describe the problem with TSCS data in
   conceptual terms; then we illustrate the problem with a simulation;
   finally we demonstrate what real data say about I\&W's theory. We
   conclude that the evidence supports the emancipatory theory of democracy
   as powerfully as it did in I\&W's original analyses.},

Abstract = {This paper introduces conscientious politics', discusses their features
   and shows their resonance in the case of Israel. I define conscientious
   politics as politics informed by moral deliberations about legitimacy,
   and locate them in the larger matrix of conscience. In the balance
   between passion and persuasion, conscientious politics provide time and
   invite venues for deliberation on the social contract, challenging
   rulers' convenience and society's conventions. While the individual's
   freedom of conscience draws mainly on positive liberty (from within),
   conscientious politics also requires emancipation from without. However,
   conscientious politics are not necessarily harmonious or liberal, nor
   does liberalism necessarily entail free conscience. Conscientious
   politics are often hidden in plain sight', and the normative task of
   bringing them to light depends on revealing the moral dilemmas that
   underpin actual politics. I unearth such dilemmas with regard to
   Israel's 2011 social justice movement, the subsequent prisoner exchange
   and Israel's relations with the Palestinians.},

Abstract = {It is reasonably and logically conceivable that a judge commits a grave
   judicial error during the undertaking of his or her judicial work,
   whether related to legal principles, in the performance of his or her
   judicial duties or in his exercising of jurisdiction. This error is
   related to his or her civic responsibility, if it has resulted in
   damages to a member of the opposing party. Despite the importance and
   seriousness of such mistakes, and its long establishment, Jordanian
   legislation has not provided for it, and has left it to the general
   rules. There is no doubt that there are reasons which lead to such
   errors occurring and, conversely, that there are ways to avoid this
   error.},

Abstract = {This article proposes a historiographical analysis of the
   franco-quebecois political science on Indigenous peoples. Political
   science participates in representing social realities of populations
   that, in the present case, have been historically marginalised. It is
   thus critical to understand the processes that underlie its production
   and diffusion. By exploring the political circumstances that impacted
   the development of research on Indigenous peoples, we conclude that
   franco-quebecois scholars have built a field of study that is distinct
   in terms of its volume, tone, and recurring themes. In particular, we
   suggest that the study of the place of Quebec within Canada shaped and
   eclipsed that of Indigenous peoples in the province. Finally, we situate
   the contributions and limits of franco-quebecois political science with
   respect to Indigenous peoples. In so doing, we uncover some of the most
   significant dynamics in the development of Canadian political science in
   this area of study and provide indications for future research in the
   field.
   Resume Cet article propose une analyse historiographique de la science
   politique franco-quebecoise qui porte sur les peuples autochtones. Dans
   la mesure oU la science politique participe a la representation des
   realites sociales de populations qui, dans la situation qui nous occupe,
   ont ete historiquement marginalisees, il importe de comprendre les
   processus qui sous-tendent sa production et sa diffusion. Au moyen d'une
   etude de l'impact de la construction de l'identite nationale
   franco-quebecoise sur le developpement de la recherche sur les peuples
   autochtones, nous concluons que les chercheurs franco-quebecois ont
   construit un champ d'etudes distinct d'autres productions scientifiques
   autochtonistes notamment canadienne-anglaise quant a son volume relatif,
   son ton et ses themes. En particulier, nous proposons que l'importance
   prise par la question nationale a ecarte celle de la relation entre les
   peuples autochtones et le Quebec. Enfin, notre retrospective situe les
   contributions et les limites du discours universitaire franco-quebecois.
   Ce faisant, nous relevons certaines des dynamiques les plus
   significatives dans le developpement de la science politique canadienne
   et nous en degageons des enseignements pour l'orientation de travaux
   futurs.},

Journal = {CHINA QUARTERLY OF INTERNATIONAL STRATEGIC STUDIES},

Volume = {3},

Pages = {39-55},

Abstract = {There are two prevailing arguments among international observers about
   China's role in the Middle East. One is that China has been a ``security
   free-rider; ``the other is that China is fundamentally a
   business-seeker. Yet neither of the two is well-grounded. If viewed
   comprehensively rather than in terms of military engagement alone,
   China's contribution to stability and security of the region is
   enormous, and its role in the Middle East can be described as a
   combination of a major economic partner, a low-profile mediator and a
   modest but important provider of security public goods. As China has
   proposed various new concepts and initiatives as guidelines of its
   foreign policy, its future policy toward the Middle East can be best
   understood through its increasing efforts to promote the ``Belt and
   Road{''} initiative, to develop a new-type major-power relationship, and
   to uphold justice and pursue shared interests with all related
   countries. With ever more Chinese engagement in the region, China's
   Middle East policy is expected to be delivered in a more comprehensive
   way. However, China is not likely to seek dominant presence in the
   region in the foreseeable future.},

Abstract = {Although still in its early phases, the Juncker Commission has already
   broken new ground. Not only is Jean-Claude Juncker the first Commission
   President to be selected by the Spitzenkandidaten process, an
   extra-constitutional system that has reconfigured the European Union's
   institutional balance, but he has transformed the structure and
   operation of the College with the aim of creating a more political, and
   therefore more effective, Commission, and made good - so far - on his
   promise `to do better on the bigger things and be small on the small
   things'. This article examines this three-fold transformation. It looks
   at the innovations and change associated with the Juncker Commission. It
   considers what motivated them and how they were achieved, sets them in
   historical perspective, and discusses their implications for the
   institutions and for the European Union more broadly.},

Abstract = {When political scandals erupt in the press, we usually blame misconduct
   by public officials, but these episodes are political events whose
   occurrence and severity also depend in part on the political and media
   context. Using data on U.S. governors, I show that several key factors
   affect the likelihood and intensity that alleged misconduct will be
   politicized by the opposition and publicized by the press. First, lower
   approval ratings, which decrease the cost of politicizing and
   publicizing an allegation, are generally associated with more frequent
   and intense media scandals. By contrast, competing news events can crowd
   potential scandals off the news agenda. However, no evidence is found
   that opposition control of state political institutions leads to more
   media scandal. These results suggest that the occurrence of media
   scandal depends more on circumstance than we typically assume.},

Abstract = {Disease makes performing civic obligations more difficult both for the
   afflicted and those around them. Elections held when infectious diseases
   are locally prevalent are therefore likely to see lower voter turnout
   than are those held in healthier times. This is especially notable given
   the strongly seasonal incidence of influenza, which coincides with
   election season in some countries. This article examines the
   relationship between regional turnout rates in Finland and the United
   States from 1995 to 2015 with measures of local influenza prevalence. In
   both countries, regression models suggest influenza outbreaks associate
   with lower voting rates. This may suggest another mechanism limiting the
   political representation of people and communities vulnerable to ill
   health.},

Abstract = {Despite its widespread use in studies of race and ethnic politics, there
   exists a long-standing debate about whether racial resentment primarily
   measures antiblack prejudice or ideological conservatism. In this paper,
   we attempt to resolve this debate by examining racial resentment's role
   in shaping white opinion on a racialized policy issue that involves no
   federal action and no government redistribution of resources: pay for
   play in college athletics. Using cross-sectional and experimental data
   from the 2014 Cooperative Congressional Election Study and Amazon's
   Mechanical Turk, we find evidence not only that racial resentment items
   tap racial predispositions but also that whites rely on these
   predispositions when forming and expressing their views on paying
   college athletes. More specifically, we demonstrate that racially
   resentful whites who were subtly primed to think about African Americans
   are more likely to express opposition to paying college athletes when
   compared with similarly resentful whites who were primed to think about
   whites. Because free-market conservatism, resistance to changes in the
   status quo, opposition to expanding federal power, and reluctance to
   endorse government redistributive policies cannot possibly explain these
   results, we conclude that racial resentment is a valid measure of
   antiblack prejudice.},

Abstract = {While disproportional resources and curbs on civil and political rights
   clearly matter to electoral authoritarian persistence, long-term
   acculturation to political norms and modes of governance on the ground
   in such regimes - of which Singapore and Malaysia are the most durable
   examples - complicate transformation. A combination of what amounts to
   classic machine politics with the structural ``assist{''} of sub-par
   elections renders electoral authoritarianism extraordinarily
   increasingly resilient over time, not just because it is hard or
   unlikely for voters to vote in new leaders, but also because the
   aspiring or elected opposition may end up reproducing rather than
   subverting key attributes of that regime. Clientelist political praxis
   may be highly responsive, offer direct accountability, and align with
   voters' rational self-interest, at least in the short term. However, its
   persistence impedes pursuit of new ideological or programmatic
   objectives, perpetuates piecemeal and inefficient allocation of
   resources, assumes that most voters should expect little from state
   policies, and discourages attention to proactive legislation, in favour
   of a more localized, reactive politics. A machine-oriented political
   regime, then, is not only exceptionally hard to shake, but suboptimal in
   the long term.},

Abstract = {One interesting fact to note about China's expanding partnership network
   is the inclusion of many security allies of the United States. China's
   partnership network (CPN) and the U.S. alliance system (UAS) are quite
   different in nature, with the former emphasizing economic cooperation
   and the latter focused on security deterrence. Due to such factors as
   the geographical locations of U.S. allies, strategic positions, and
   perceptions of external threats, China's partnerships with U.S. allies
   are generally more successful in Europe than in the Asia-Pacific. Based
   on an analysis of the dynamics of interaction between CPN and UAS, this
   article categorizes their past interaction into two basic models:
   coexistence (both easy and hard) and confrontation. With regard to the
   growing uncertainties in the global economy and global politics, the
   interaction between CPN and UAS may either create a platform for
   enhanced cooperation or an arena for escalating contention among related
   countries. To avoid the latter scenario, China must remain prudent in
   expanding its partnership network, and try to strengthen mutual security
   reassurance with the United States and its allies through more win-win
   cooperation in all areas.},

Title = {Designing stakeholder consultations: Reinforcing or alleviating bias in
   the European Union system of governance?},
Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL RESEARCH},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {56},
Number = {1},
Pages = {46-69},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Consultations with stakeholders are a policy instrument widely used by
   policy makers to design policies and prepare legislative proposals
   across national and supranational systems of government. The European
   Union has recently reviewed its stakeholder consultation regime and
   asked for stakeholders' policy input. This offers an opportunity to
   examine empirically stakeholders' own evaluation of the regime and to
   ask a fundamental question about its democratic credentials: Do
   stakeholders recognise the EU consultation regime as reinforcing bias in
   interest representation by benefiting policy insiders, or conversely as
   an instrument that alleviates bias in supranational policy making?
   Building on rational choice institutionalism, this article outlines the
   potential distributional outcomes of the regime and argues that they are
   likely to vary along the lines of a classic divide in policy making that
   opposes policy insiders to outsiders. Two competing narratives are
   discussed in relation to the expected direction of this variation by
   focusing on insiders' incentives to support or oppose the regime. The
   observable implications are tested empirically on an original dataset
   containing information about stakeholders' positions on the evaluation
   of the regime status quo, its proposed further institutionalisation and
   their recommendations for change. The findings describe a consultation
   regime that seems to have created conditions alleviating bias in
   stakeholders' participation in supranational policy making. This is
   evident in the lack of systematic, significant differences between
   insiders and outsiders in the evaluation of the consultation regime.
   Where differences do occur, they are consistent with the image of a
   consultation regime that has not reinforced bias in favour of policy
   insiders. These actors are found to be more critical of the regime
   status quo, its institutionalisation and more inclined to recommend
   policy improvements. This supports an optimistic view over the
   democratic credentials and legitimacy of the EU consultation regime and
   outlines an additional scenario under which policy actors that are
   traditionally associated with exerting more power and influence find
   themselves stripped of their privileged position in the context of
   European supranational governance.},

Abstract = {How does the economic cycle matter for political parties and party
   systems? This article presents a unified theory connecting economic
   cycles to party behavior and to party system fragmentation. We argue
   that a key but poorly studied determinant of party system performance is
   the difference in perceived competence among parties. The narrowing of
   differences in parties' valence stock, or the `valence gap', has the
   effect of increasing the weight voters assign to parties' ideological
   positions and, in turn, increases the number of parties in the system.
   Analyses of German public opinion from 1990 to 2007 and of
   cross-sectional analysis of party valence characteristics from nine
   countries provides evidence in support of our claims. Overall, study
   findings show how economic growth and decline work through differences
   in parties' valence to shape the behavior of party systems. (C) 2016

   two-round elections in Norway},
Journal = {ELECTORAL STUDIES},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {45},
Pages = {130-140},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {What effect do candidates with local ties have on voter turnout and
   party support? A considerable challenge within the existing literature
   on the personal vote, including that part which derives from local ties,
   is disentangling it from the party vote using observational data. We
   exploit the unique institutional context of Norway's historical
   two-round system, and data measured at the municipality level, to
   evaluate the mobilizational impact of voter attachment to parties versus
   (local) candidates. Under this system, entry into the second round was
   unrestricted, with the number and identity of candidates determined by
   elite coordination decisions. In municipalities where coordination at
   the district level between rounds resulted in the withdrawal of a
   candidate with local ties, we document a strong negative effect on both
   turnout and party support, which highlights the value of the personal
   vote for mobilization, and the potential trade-offs that confront
   parties and coalitions in nomination decisions. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {Does governing in coalitions affect how coalition parties' policy
   positions are perceived by voters? In this article, the authors seek to
   understand the relationship between parties' participation in coalition
   governments and their perception by voters. Policy positions are an
   important instrument through which parties compete for the support of
   voters. However, it is unclear to what extent voters can correctly
   perceive the positions of parties when they govern together with other
   coalition partners. It is argued here that because of the blurred lines
   of responsibility in multiparty cabinets, it is difficult for voters to
   correctly perceive the positions of coalition parties. What is more, it
   is expected that the internal functioning of coalition cabinets affects
   the extent to which coalition parties struggle to get their message out
   to voters. It is hypothesized in the article that intra-cabinet conflict
   is negatively related to misperception. To test their theoretical
   expectations, the authors combine data on the left-right policy
   positions of political parties from the Comparative Manifestos Project
   with data on how these positions are perceived by voters gathered from
   the Comparative Study of Electoral Systems from 1996 to 2011. The
   findings shed light on the relationship between party competition and
   coalition governments, and its implications for political
   representation.},

Title = {A Tale of Convergence? Discrimination based on Sexual Orientation in
   Regional Human Rights Bodies and the Human Rights Committee},
Journal = {NORDIC JOURNAL OF HUMAN RIGHTS},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {35},
Number = {3, SI},
Pages = {240-257},
Abstract = {The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) and the
   regional human rights conventions do not explicitly prohibit
   discrimination based on sexual orientation, or provide the right to
   marry and have a family for same-sex couples, thus leaving an open
   margin of interpretation to their judicial and quasi-judicial
   enforcement bodies. However, regional courts and the Human Rights
   Committee (HRC) jurisprudence seems to have followed a path of
   convergence rather than fragmentation. This article will analyse the
   case-law of the regional judicial bodies and of the HRC on the matter
   through the lens of the prohibition of discrimination, assessing how
   such convergence has been reached and evaluating its nature. The
   analysis will reveal that beneath a seeming trend of convergence in the
   case outcomes, there are signs of a strong point of divergence and many
   threats of future fragmentation. In particular, there is a deep contrast
   between the European and the Inter-American Court of Human Rights in
   terms of prohibited discrimination based on sexual orientation.
   Moreover, the convergence reached among regional human rights bodies and

Abstract = {With Initial Operating Capability (IOC) declared by the US Marine Corps
   and US Air Force, increasing production and delivery rates, and
   impressive performances in recent exercises, the F-35 programme and the
   fifth-generation capability that it represents look to have turned a
   corner. As the capability moves towards Full Operating Capability (FOC),
   the debate, so long focused on costs, delays and technical issues,
   should now begin to be framed in new terms. Andre Adamson and Matthew
   Snyder analyse some of the stakes involved as the capability
   increasingly acts as a driver for fifth-generation transformation, and
   to consider some of the implications for air forces that have committed
   to the programme and, perhaps more significantly, for those that have

Abstract = {Decades of research across several disciplines have produced substantial
   evidence that labor unions, on balance, reduce economic disparities. But
   unions are complicated, multifaceted organizations straddling markets
   and politics. Much of their equality-promoting influence occurs through
   their ability to reduce class-based inequity in politics and public
   policy. Declining unionization across much of the developed world is
   eroding workers' bargaining power. Reduced economic leverage puts
   pressure on union solidarity and weakens labor-based political
   movements. Important research design problems and significant
   heterogeneity across unions, regions, countries, and time imply a
   continued need for more work.},

Abstract = {We formalize and examine two overlapping models that show how rising
   inequality combined with ethnic and racial heterogeneity can explain why
   many advanced industrial countries have experienced a drop in support
   for redistribution as inequality has risen. One model, based on altruism
   and homophily, focuses on the effect of increasing social distance
   between the poor and the middle class, especially when minorities are
   increasingly overrepresented among the very poor. The other, based on
   self-interest, combines an insurance model of preferences for
   redistribution with increasingly segmented labor markets, in which
   immigration of workers without recognized skills leaves most native
   workers better off but intensifies competition for low-end jobs.
   Empirically, when we estimate parameters from the two models using data
   from multiple waves of ISSP surveys, we find that labor market
   segmentation, previously omitted in this literature, has more consistent
   effects than social distance.},

Title = {{[}en] Exploring New Control Techniques Aimed at the Knowledge Work: How
   to Improve Critical Management Studies' Understanding of Power},
Journal = {POLITICA Y SOCIEDAD},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {54},
Number = {1},
Pages = {87-109},
Abstract = {We have to give Critical Management Studies (CMS) credit for having made
   a difference in the research of organisations after introducing
   Foucault's concepts and the influences from constructivism. CMS have
   insisted on how modern organisations shape their members' identities by
   means of different ideologies and rituals in order to turn them into
   loyal and disciplined subjects. Anyway, in this article, I also aim to
   find out which other new control mechanisms are developed in firms that
   use tacit and creative knowledge intensively while producing their
   goods. Examples of these activities are the ICT sector or the animation
   industry, in which I interviewed up to 40 professionals from different
   firms to know their typical working practices. By doing this, I could
   unravel the kind of control mechanisms which these workers are subjected
   to. Most of them are high-skilled professionals. These employees have to
   be diligent and creative when working out informational inputs so that
   the goods produced can beat or, at least, meet the standards ruling the
   market. Therefore, we can suppose that specific control mechanisms will
   be established in these spaces, whose aim is to stimulate creative and
   intellectual performance through the extraction and spread of knowledge
   all over the firm. Based on these mechanisms, I will propose a
   distinctive model of power (of a biopolitical kind) emerging in these
   spaces. This model contrasts with the ``disciplinary type of power{''},
   which has been studied by CMS excessively. As well as the qualitative
   interviews, I also analysed other research materials.},

Title = {{[}en] Truth Debated. The Predominance of the Legal Paradigm in the
   Examination of Human Rights Abuses in Argentina},
Journal = {POLITICA Y SOCIEDAD},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {54},
Number = {1},
Pages = {229-248},
Abstract = {In these pages I will examine three representations, developed in
   diverse political contexts and under different epistemological
   frameworks, of the value of criminal justice for addressing human rights
   abuses in Argentina. The first is the legal strategy of the Raul
   Alfonsin government, which sought to establish an exemplary sentence
   founded on a utilitarian perspective of punishment and based on the
   truth brought to light by the Never Again report produced by the
   National Commission on the Disappearance of Persons (CONADEP). The
   second involves the critical reflections regarding this strategy that
   were formulated by one of its architects, Jaime Malamud Goti, in the
   context of impunity following the pardons granted to the military juntas
   by President Carlos Menem, which at the time appeared to preclude any
   possibility of dealing with such abuses in the judicial sphere. The
   third, furthered by academics and relatives of the disappeared in the
   last five years, arose from the impact that the experience of the South
   African Truth and Reconciliation Commission also had in Argentina.
   Through the discussion of these representations I will show that while
   the role of trials in addressing human rights violations is being
   revisited, at least by a portion of those who advanced them, that
   resignification is framed in the legal paradigm and reinforces the
   predominance of that paradigm as a way of processing the violent past in
   Argentina.},

Abstract = {Focusing on migrant rights in Austria, this article illustrates how
   local actors use courts and litigation as avenues to claim rights for
   non-citizens. Adding to studies that have stressed the role of the
   international court in this process, I analyze such changes as a result
   of the interplay between international human rights frameworks and the
   capacities of local actors to mobilize resources, knowledge and
   expertise. This article presents two case studies in Austria, in which
   the entitlement to unemployment assistance (Notstandshilfe), and the
   right to stand as a candidate for works councils (Betriebsrat) and for
   the Chamber of Labour (Arbeiterkammer) were expanded to non-citizens.},

Journal = {GLOBAL CHANGE PEACE \& SECURITY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {29},

Pages = {129-143},
Abstract = {Existing studies of Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN)
   states' engagement with migrant worker rights focus on the experience of
   such workers from gender, labour and security perspectives. As such,
   these studies are yet to consider the broader impact of migrant worker
   rights on the process and nature of cooperation between ASEAN members.
   This article addresses this gap by framing migrant worker rights within
   the broader human rights socialization ongoing within Southeast Asia,
   driven by both members of ASEAN and external stakeholders. It argues
   that, contrary to many existing accounts of norms as creating shared
   commitments, migrant worker rights have led to considerable
   contestation, often driven by diverging national approaches to the
   issue. This article examines the impact of migrant worker rights norms
   on Thailand, the largest labour-recipient state in ASEAN. It asserts
   that Thailand's diverging experience is caused by the lack of norm
   precision, resulting in the applicatory contestation of such norms.},

   the European Court of Justice to adjust the center/periphery conflict in

Title = {``Academics for Peace{''} in Turkey: a case of criminalising dissent and
   critical thought via counterterrorism policy},
Journal = {CRITICAL STUDIES ON TERRORISM},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {10},
Number = {2, SI},
Pages = {274-296},
Abstract = {On 11 January 2016, 1128 academics in Turkey and abroad signed a
   petition calling on Turkish authorities to cease state violence in
   mainly Kurdish populated areas of the country, which had been under
   curfew and an extended state of emergency. The petition received an
   immediate reaction from President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who accused the
   signatories of treason and terrorist propaganda. He subsequently
   demanded that public prosecuters launch an investigation.
   Criminalisation of the petition has been exacerbated by disciplinary
   action by universities against many of the signatories. Many have
   suffered insults, arrest, detention or suspension as a result of the
   ensuing smear campaign. This massive crackdown on academic freedom has
   been masked by discourses of counterterrorism, which have also been
   deployed to criminalise dissent more generally in Turkey as a part of a
   process of rapid ``democratic retrenchment{''} since 2013. This article
   is an attempt to put the criminalisation of academics within the larger
   framework of human rights violations, increasing curtailments of
   academic freedom and rising authoritarianism in Turkey. It argues that
   the prosecution of the signatories of the petition is an extension of an
   established tradition of targeting academic freedom in times of
   political crisis in Turkey but is also a product of growing
   authoritarianism under the ruling party and President Erdogan. It shows
   that counterterrorism laws can be extended far beyond eliminating
   security threats by instrumentalising them to suppress dissent in a
   declining democracy.},

Abstract = {This contribution applies the ``strength of weakness{''} argument to
   coalition negotiations in the German states. We investigate whether
   parties with internally disputed platforms are more successful in
   transferring their policy preferences into coalition agreements. In
   addition, we examine whether sub-national party branches that (have to)
   form a coalition rejected by the national party leadership are facing
   the pressure of performing particularly well in the coalition
   negotiations in order to justify the outcome of the coalition formation
   process against the national-level party. These expectations are tested
   on the basis of statements on the policy positions and coalition
   preferences made by party representatives before elections in Germany
   from 2006 to 2015 in combination with characteristics and results of the
   coalition negotiations on the German state level. The findings provide
   evidence that programmatically heterogeneous parties are able to achieve
   better policy compromises in coalition negotiations. However, there is
   no support for the hypothesis that parties at the state level forming a
   coalition which is unpopular with the national-level party can better
   enforce their policy positions in the negotiation process.},

Journal = {LABORATOIRE ITALIEN-POLITIQUE ET SOCIETE},
Year = {2017},
Number = {20},
Abstract = {While the Italian musician may have been an object of study for
   nineteenth-century medical sciences, the same cannot be said of the
   singer castrato: although the latter is the most characteristic and
   original element in the history of Italian opera, the castrato remains
   unknown to scientific studies of the time, despite his exceptional
   biological nature. The rare texts which deal with castrati consider
   castration as an exotic subject. They study the different
   anthropological forms of eunuchism present in the East, but neglect
   orchiectomy which aims at artistic purposes. Though widely disseminated
   in Italy, orchiectomy is presented in these texts as an aberration which
   should not be investigated further. There were, however, many castrati
   who could have been examined in their lifetime or even after their
   death. This article thus brings together the little information
   accessible in non-medical sources in an attempt to define the acoustic
   nature of castrati's voice, taking into consideration the vocal change
   undergone during their adolescence.},

   Mexican Politicians},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF POLITICS IN LATIN AMERICA},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {9},
Number = {1},
Pages = {59-90},
Abstract = {Between 2005 and 2015, organized criminal groups murdered 209
   politicians in Mexico. This paper explains why. It argues that the two
   interwoven trends of political and criminal pluralization in Mexico
   fostered the conditions for a new type of criminal violence against
   politicians. Mexican politicians are now targeted for accepting illicit
   money as well as for standing up to criminals. Moreover, this violence
   is evidence of an alarming and persistent pattern in Mexico of
   politicians enlisting criminal organizations to eliminate their
   political competition. Using a zero-inflated negative binomial model,
   this paper shows there is a strong statistical relationship between the
   increase in assassinations and the increases in political pluralization
   and criminal fragmentation. The article concludes that the failure to
   protect local public officials creates greater opportunities for the
   emergence of subnational authoritarian enclaves and threatens democratic
   consolidation.},

Volume = {40},

Pages = {1218-1240},
Abstract = {This article presents a three-dimensional conceptualisation of conflict
   of interest (COI) regulation directed towards assuring the impartial and
   unbiased decision-making of parliamentarians. It distinguishes and
   separately measures (based on a new dataset) COI strictness, sanctions
   and transparency and shows that they indeed constitute empirically
   separate dimensions of parliamentary ethics regimes adopted in European
   democracies. In order to illustrate the usefulness of these indices, the
   article then examines the relationship between the three indices and
   trust in national parliaments across 25 democracies. Unlike the
   Sanctions and Transparency indices, the COI Strictness Index (composed
   of strictness of rules and enforcement) has a significant and robust
   negative association with trust, which highlights the importance of
   disentangling different elements of COI regimes. While future research
   has to explore the causal relationships between COI regulation and
   trust, capturing the complexity of COI regimes in an unbiased fashion
   and thereby making them comparable across European democracies is an
   essential step towards doing so.},

Abstract = {Policy congruence is one standard for the measurement of a good
   democracy. It is one of the normative conceptions of democracy that
   elected politicians act in accordance with the preferences of the
   electorate. Although an undisputed tenet of democracy, its measurement
   is fraught with limited interpretations of acting for, or mirroring
   citizens' preferences. This study investigates the congruence of policy
   stances of members of parliament with citizens in Poland. With the
   passage of time MPs and citizens will converge with their preferences on
   socio-cultural issues while on identity topics divergence is more likely
   to be the norm. I draw from democratization theories that claimed that,
   in time, the quality of democracy would improve. I test this hypothesis
   diachronically using surveys of citizens and members of the Sejm, the
   Polish lower chamber of representatives, starting in 1997 to the
   election of 2011.},

Abstract = {This paper explores ways in which civil conflict can be simulated using
   numerical methods. A general two-party model of conflict is developed by
   extending an approach proposed by {[}Christia, F., (2012), Alliance
   Formation in Civil Wars, Cambridge University Press, New York], which is
   based on a metric of the `relative power' that exists between the state
   and a rebel group. Various definitions of relative power are considered
   and one of these is chosen to illustrate different types of two-sided
   armed conflict, namely direct-fire, guerrilla and asymmetric warfare.
   The additional suggestion of Christia that random or stochastic events
   can lead to unexpected conflict outcomes is also further extended in
   this paper. The inclusion in the model of terms describing concurrent
   rebel recruitment of civilians and state deployment of troops are then
   described. Examples are presented for various hypothetical cases. It is
   demonstrated that numerical simulation techniques have great potential
   for modelling civil war. The Christia approach is shown to provide an
   excellent basis from which numerical models of civil conflict can be
   built and from which the progress of a conflict can usefully be
   visualised graphically.},

Abstract = {This article analyses the democratic involution in Hungary, which was
   followed by the country embracing a pro-Russian policy in 2010. These
   processes came to be viewed as a rare case of authoritarian diffusion
   taking place towards an EU member state. Based on the discussion of
   interest versus ideational appeal as factors of authoritarian diffusion,
   the article develops a relational and dynamic framework to analyse the
   question of authoritarian diffusion. The framework underlines the
   importance not only of sender state attributes, but also those of
   receiver states. The analysis finds no empirical evidence for
   authoritarian diffusion; Hungary's slide into illiberalism was not
   inspired or supported by Vladimir Putin. Instead, mutual interests are
   sufficient to understand Russo-Hungarian cooperation.},

Abstract = {This article examines the affective content of Greek media
   representations of the debt crisis, from 2009 to 2012. We analyze the
   content of opinion pieces from journalists, experts and public
   intellectuals published in Greek newspapers, and identify their
   affective tone towards political actors and institutions. We focus on
   anger, fear and hope, and identify blame attribution frames, which
   underpin the public's trust and confidence in domestic and European
   Union institutions. This article contributes to the systematic
   understanding of the impact of the debt crisis as a traumatic event on
   public opinion, and considers its implications for attitudes towards
   European integration.},

Abstract = {One of the most challenging issues concerning the doctrine of the
   Responsibility to Protect (R2P) is `who should intervene' in case of
   gross violations of human rights. After the intervention in Kosovo in
   1999, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) has been
   increasingly considered a legitimate actor to fulfil the duty to
   intervene for humanitarian reasons. In 2011, the first military
   intervention inspired by the R2P in Libya reinforced the appreciation of
   NATO as a viable enforcer of the doctrine. The paper problematizes the
   idea that NATO could be a straightforward solution to the problem of who
   should intervene. NATO's constitutive nature comprises aspects that are
   at odds with R2P as a normative scheme. In this regard, the paper delves
   into three aspects: (a) the controversial issue of `delegated authority'
   from the UN to NATO; (b) the tension between the universalistic
   character of the R2P and the particularistic nature of NATO and (c) the
   military nature of the alliance and its consequent focus on
   security/military considerations that rarely, or just occasionally,
   match with humanitarian concerns. Finally, the paper analyses the
   intervention in Libya assessing the incongruities between NATO's
   military operations and the normative framework of R2P.},

Volume = {24},
Number = {5, SI},
Pages = {819-838},
Abstract = {Despite being traditionally seen as the largest threat to
   democratization, coups have recently been argued to provide a window of
   opportunity for a democratic transition. Central to post-coup
   democratization is the belief that the international community can exert
   sufficient leverage to coerce coup-born governments to allow a
   transition to civilian rule. We contribute to this young body of work by
   theorizing that less coercive aspects of transnational economics can
   prompt coup-born governments to voluntarily transition to civilian rule.
   In short, we argue that coups in states that are more closely tied to
   the international economy through trade dependence, and are more
   vulnerable to loss of investor confidence due to reliance on high
   contract intensiveness, will see coup-born governments attempt to
   legitimize a new government and to restore confidence in the rule of law
   by swiftly stepping down. A cross-national assessment of over 200 coups
   from 1950 to 2010 provides strong support for the argument, as trade
   dependence and contract intensive money are far stronger determinants of
   post-coup democratization than other factors commonly associated with
   democratization.},

Journal = {TOCQUEVILLE REVIEW},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {38},
Number = {1},
Pages = {81-111},
Abstract = {One of the strangest phenomena in today's China is that a thinker as
   liberal as Tocqueville has become well-known due to the recommendation
   of a top leader of China's authoritarian regime. No matter how one
   interprets this phenomenon, Tocqueville's theoretical and historical
   reflections on democracy and revolution provide a framework to
   understand how democratic China has been and might be. The
   democratization of Chinese society as reflected in the diffusion of
   equality as a value and ongoing individualization is facilitating both
   centralization and empowerment of the state. The limited and
   dysfunctional grassroots democracy, the weakness of civil society, and
   the rise of illiberal political Confucianism present serious obstacles
   to political democratization in China. However, with the possible
   failure of statism, political democracy would be an alternative. The
   fragile but increasing demand for freedom in civil society might
   contribute to the advancement of a long, unsteady and difficult
   democratization in China.},

Journal = {CITIZENSHIP STUDIES},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {21},
Number = {4, SI},
Pages = {483-494},
Abstract = {The article discusses the path of an important reform of the Greek
   Citizenship Code, starting from the initial introduction of the
   Citizenship Law in 2010, the public debate and reactions that followed
   leading to its partial annulation as unconstitutional in 2012, and
   finally, the developments until its restoration with a new law in 2016.
   This initiative introducing radical reforms for the Greek context took
   place in the midst of the public debt crisis, and thus has not been
   discussed accordingly. Until then, the issue of Greek nationality
   represented a non-issue in the political agenda of the country, since
   the issue of citizenship was considered `nationally sensitive'. The
   paper examines how such a reform is pushed forward during extremely
   difficult conditions, an unprecedented economic and political crisis,
   coupled by the largest refugee wave in the recent history of the
   country, having still an uncertain future/outcome.},

Abstract = {We evaluate hypotheses about human capital and structural theory-based
   predictors of variation in academic salaries. We use standard
   statistical models to explore differences in salary among full-time
   political science faculty, while also utilizing selection models to
   control for factors that place individuals on different trajectories
   stemming from their graduate school experience. We report on several
   findings, one of which is the positive effect on salary associated with
   graduation from a highly ranked PhD program; a second being the negative
   effect on salary of a high undergraduate teaching load. Other findings
   are that negotiation positively affects salary for men, but not for
   women, and that journal publications increase salaries amongst women,
   but not men. At the associate professor level, we find a significant
   gender gap in salary, even with controls for human capital, structural
   factors, and productivity. We also find a significant effect of race on
   the salaries of male faculty.},

Journal = {DEMOCRATIZATION},

Volume = {24},
Number = {7, SI},
Pages = {1271-1288},
Abstract = {This article analyses the mechanisms of influence, learning, and
   emulation used by Hugo Chavez to diffuse Bolivarianism across Latin
   America and the world. Different from autocratic types of diffusion that
   are instrumental and motivated by self-preservation, Chavez promoted
   what he depicted as a superior model of democracy and a populist
   strategy of political transformation using constitution making, heavy
   state intervention in the economy, and anti-imperialism. Even though
   Chavez promoted his script for regime change across Latin America and
   the Caribbean, his model was emulated only when opportunities opened up
   in nations such as Bolivia and Ecuador that experienced crises of
   political parties and the institutional framework of democracy.
   Bolivarianism was not emulated in nations where political parties and
   democratic institutions remained functioning, and where the left and
   civil society valued democracy, pluralism, and liberal rights due to
   brutal autocratic experiences. Despite its democratizing promises
   Bolivarianism did not lead to the radicalization of democracy but to its
   erosion and its displacement towards authoritarianism. The fear of
   Bolivarianism also led to a coup against president Zelaya in Honduras.
   Bolivarian strategies of populist rupture crossed the Atlantic and were
   adapted by PODEMOS that became the third largest political party in
   Spain.},

Volume = {20},
Number = {1, SI},
Pages = {75-87},
Abstract = {Within the umbrella of equal recognition, several principles of
   linguistic justice can be distinguished. A first, the per-capita
   principle, mandates prorating language recognition based on a per-capita
   distribution. A second, the equal-services principle, prescribes
   upholding the official languages as the languages in which the state
   speaks and in which public services are provided, irrespective of
   changing numbers of speakers. Alan Patten defends the prorated
   per-capita principle. I argue for the equal-services principle, which
   practically will often amount to a form of linguistic maximin: the more
   vulnerable the language, the more numerous the resources.},

Abstract = {From the fierce criticism to which our ``Guidelines for a new Russia
   policy{''} have been subjected, it is clear that opinions differ when it
   comes to Russia. Yet the security policy conflict between Russia and the
   West remains so dangerous that we are being forced to find ways of
   de-escalating it. As was the case during the period of detente, the
   first step is to acknowledge the regulatory differences with Russia
   instead of denying their existence. This entails strengthening
   constitutive standards of international law rather than putting them up
   for negotiation. Instead of exporting democracy, we should trust in the
   impact of a positive model; instead of organising security against one
   another in the conflict zone between Russia and the EU, we should
   regulate it through mutual agreement and cultivate economic and
   humanitarian relations.},
