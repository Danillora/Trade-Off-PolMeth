Title = {What Do We Value Most in Schools? A Study of Preference Rankings of
   School Attributes},

Abstract = {ObjectivesA key question in education policy as well as individuals'
   school choice involves the characteristics of schools we value most. It
   is thereby important to understand any heterogeneity in parents',
   teachers', and school principals' preference rankings driven by their
   education level, gender, and age.
   MethodIn this article, we propose a survey-based approach to examine
   preference rankings of diverse school attributes, which accounts for
   tradeoffs required in real-world choice situations.
   ResultsOur results indicate that stakeholders on average rank the
   ethical aspects of schools (such as pupil and staff happiness and
   equality of opportunities) above their efficiency aspects (such as
   academic achievement or school size). Yet, respondents' role in the
   school as well as their education level, gender, and age influence
   observed preference rankings.
   ConclusionsTo avoid biased inferences, survey designs on school
   preferences should account for the fact that real-world choices in favor
   of one particular characteristic often imply giving up at least some
   others. Doing so, we show that parents, teachers, and school principals
   appear to disagree with the predominant consideration awarded to
   academic achievement in current education policies.},

Abstract = {The media's role in shaping the priorities of politicians, known as
   political agenda setting, is usually examined at the institutional
   level. However, individual politicians' goals and attitudes are also
   expected to shape their level of responsiveness to the media. This study
   is the first to explore how individual politicians' goals and
   motivations moderate their real-life level of responsiveness to the
   media. We examine this by using a unique sample of 197 incumbent
   politicians in three countries (Belgium, Canada, and Israel) and an
   automated content analysis of parliamentary speeches (N = 45,574) and
   news articles (N = 412,112). We find that politicians who view
   themselves as a conduit of the public (delegates) are more responsive to
   the media than those acting on their own judgment (trustees).
   Politicians involved in many issues (generalists) are also more
   responsive than specialists. Finally, no association is found between
   politicians' negativity bias and their media responsiveness.},

Abstract = {Previously reported effects of institutional quality and political risks
   on foreign direct investment (FDI) are mixed and, therefore, difficult
   to interpret. We present empirical evidence suggesting a relatively
   clear, statistically robust, and intuitive characterization.
   Institutional factors that affect the likelihood of an abrupt and total
   loss of foreigners' capital (i.e., return of capital) dominate factors
   that affect rates of return conditional on a strictly positive terminal
   investment value (i.e., return on capital). The evidence is consistent
   with the hypothesis that expropriation risk is most important among the
   available measures of different dimensions of institutional quality. A
   one standard-deviation reduction in expropriation risk is associated
   with a 72\% increase in FDI, which is substantially larger than the
   effects of any other dimensions of institutional quality as
   simultaneously estimated in our empirical models of expected FDI
   inflows. We show that this evidence is consistent with the predictions
   of a standard theory of FDI under imperfect contract enforcement and
   multiple dimensions of political risk.},

Abstract = {Primary and runoff elections in Texas provide an ideal test of the
   ballot order hypothesis, because ballot order is randomized within each
   county and the state offers many counties and contests to analyze. Doing
   so for all statewide offices contested in the 2014 Democratic and
   Republican primaries and runoffs yields precise estimates of the ballot
   order effect across 24 different contests, including several not studied
   previously. Except for a few high-profile, high-information races, the
   ballot order effect is large, especially in down-ballot races for
   judicial positions. There, the empirical results indicate that going
   from last to first on the ballot raises a candidate's vote share by
   nearly ten percentage points. The magnitude of this effect is not
   sensitive to demographic and economic factors.},

Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL ECONOMY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {49},
Pages = {164-181},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Do aid donors reward the adoption of multiparty elections? Are
   multiparty elections rewarded in both democracies and electoral
   authoritarian regimes? How do the rewards for institutional reforms
   compare to the rewards for substantive improvements in governance and
   political rights? These questions are of particular interest given both
   the spread of democracy and the emergence of autocracies with multiparty
   elections for the executive and legislature as the modal form of
   authoritarianism. To answer these questions, we examine temporal
   dynamics in aid flows before and after transitions to multiparty
   elections and the strategic allocation of aid rewards to specific
   sectors depending upon electoral competition and substantive
   improvements in governance and political rights. We find that, in the
   post-Cold War era, bilateral and multilateral donors reward the adoption
   of multiparty elections in both democracies and electoral authoritarian
   regimes while also rewarding substantive improvements in governance and
   political rights. Sector specific analyses reveal that multiparty
   elections are rewarded with greater democracy aid and economic aid in
   both democratic and electoral authoritarian regimes. Nevertheless, the
   quality of elections matters: the adoption of democratic elections
   receives greater aid gains than the adoption of authoritarian elections.},

Title = {Diaspora policies in comparison: An application of the Emigrant Policies
   Index (EMIX) for the Latin American and Caribbean region},
Journal = {POLITICAL GEOGRAPHY},

Abstract = {In this paper we present the Emigrant Policies Index (EMIX), an index
   that summarizes the emigrant policies developed by 22 Latin American and
   Caribbean (LAC) states. In recent decades sending states have
   increasingly adopted policies to keep economic, political or social
   links with their emigrants. These ``emigrant policies{''} vary in scope
   and nature between different countries and include measures as diverse
   as dual citizenship policies, programs to stimulate remittances, the
   right to vote in the home country from abroad, and the creation of
   government agencies to administer emigrant issues. The EMIX proposes a
   useful tool to condense and compare a wide spectrum of policies across
   countries. Its development involved the collection of official data, as
   well as a critical review of secondary literature and input from experts
   as complementary sources. Through a rigorous framework for constructing
   the index, we show how emigrant policies can be aggregated to measure
   the overall degree and volume of emigrant policies in LAC states. The
   results of the EMIX portray a region that has indeed made serious
   efforts to assist their diaspora in the states of reception and to
   encourage their involvement in the political, economic and social fabric
   in the states of origin. The results, however, also reveal great
   variation in the emigrant policies and the administrative setting
   adopted by LAC states. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {The following pages describe the evolution of a series of associations
   devoted to the promotion of culture in San Sebastian during the Franco
   regime. I have tried to reconstruct the evolution of the associative
   network that was maintained in the city during the decades of
   dictatorship, focusing on the kind of culture they promoted and the
   image of Spain that their cultural activity reflected. One of the
   questions these pages try to answer is the role played by regional
   identities in this context. The hypothesis put forward here is that
   through the study of cultural practices we can shed light on the
   processes of acquisition of identities - national or regional-, which
   developed in the associative networks of Carlism, Regional Associations
   and the Guipuscoan Cultural Circle. The outcome of this research shows
   to what extent these were three different associative models, which
   promoted diverse identifications and images of the nation, although the
   regional ingredient was present in all of them.},

Abstract = {Objectives. To examine how firearms-related incidents are defined as
   social problems versus personal tragedies. This is achieved by examining
   a case of gun violence where the actors immediately involved are
   apparently blameless: child-involved accidental firearms deaths and
   injuries. Specifically, we examine changing narratives of these
   incidents from the mid-19th century to the present. Methods. A database
   of 314 New York Times articles on child-involved accidental shootings
   from the mid-1800s to the present day was compiled and analyzed using
   Atlas. ti. Results. Our content analysis shows that despite declining
   prevalence and coverage over time, these incidents were increasingly
   framed as social problems through narratives of criminalization and
   responsibilization. These discursive frameworks differ in how they
   allocate blame and advance appropriate social responses to
   child-involved shootings. First, ``criminalization{''} involves a police
   response to both the child shooter and, especially after the 1911
   promulgation of New York's Sullivan Act requiring a license for
   concealable firearms, to adult custodians. Second,
   ``responsibilization{''} allocates responsibility for the proper
   management of guns to adults at home (since the 1970s) as well as to
   society at large (since the 1980s) within a discourse that frames
   child-involved accidental shootings as indicative of broader social
   disorder. Conclusions. Narratives of child-involved shootings reflect a
   broader social transformation of accidents into public problems that
   occurred in the 20th century. As such, the results provide insight into
   both the contemporary gun debate and the moral valuation of children.},

Abstract = {The empowered consumer (or privacy pragmatist), an autonomous individual
   who makes informed decisions about the disclosure of their personal
   information, has dominated discussions on digital privacy. Despite
   increasing evidence that control is a problematic framework through
   which to operationalize privacy, the power of this figure persists in
   academic, regulatory, and commercial discourses in the United States.
   This article examines how Alan Westin's privacy pragmatist figure has
   been used to frame privacy within a typology of personal preference. It
   begins by reviewing existing critiques of the pragmatist model and the
   version of privacy it supports. While critiques have tended to focus on
   the methodological and theoretical strengths and weaknesses of Westin's
   model, two recent studies suggesting that people may be resigned to
   online privacy violations reveal an additional rationale for broadening
   policy discussions about privacy beyond the model offered by Westin.},

Abstract = {Objectives. The attitudes of gun owners and nongun owners appear more
   polarized in the last two decades. We posit that divisions between gun
   owners and nongun owners reflect emerging political identities,
   especially among gun owners. Methods. Using data from the General Social
   Survey (1972-2012) we examine if and when this gun ownership divergence
   began to shape the political behavior of the two groups by analyzing
   voting patterns in presidential elections. Results. We first observe
   that relative to conventional predictors of vote choice, gun ownership
   is important, reliable, and robust across election cycles. Since the
   1970s, possessing a firearm increases the likelihood of voting for
   Republican candidates. Second, we find that the impact of gun ownership
   on the likelihood of voting for a Republican candidate increased across
   elections, reaching a level in 2012 nearly 50 percent higher than in
   1972. The voting choices of gun owners and nonowners are therefore
   distinct and increasingly so over the past several decades. Conclusions.
   Given the significant proportion of the electorate who owns guns, the
   prominence of guns in social and political culture, and the weight of
   gun lobbies in political affairs, the growing divide between gun owners
   and nonowners will likely continue and significantly impact electoral
   politics. Gun owners are developing a powerful political identity that
   rivals other groups' characteristics in its ability to predict voting
   behavior.},

Abstract = {One of the main lines of reasoning in the contemporary debate on media
   effects is the notion that selective exposure to congruent information
   can lead to political polarization. Most studies are correlational,
   potentially plagued with self-report biases, and cannot demonstrate time
   order. Even less is known about the mechanisms behind such an effect. We
   conducted an online quasi-experiment with a sample matching the
   characteristics of the Dutch population closely (N = 501). We
   investigate how selective exposure can lead to polarized attitudes and
   which role frames, facts, and public opinion cues play. While we find
   that facts learned can help explaining attitude change and that
   selectivity can influence the perception of public opinion, we cannot
   confirm that people generally polarize.},

Abstract = {This paper studies firms' obfuscation choices in a duopoly setting where
   two firms differ in their marginal costs of production. We show that the
   high-cost firm chooses maximum obfuscation while the low-cost firm
   chooses minimal (maximal) obfuscation if the cost advantage is large
   (small). We argue that in this setting there is a new role for price
   regulation as it leads to more transparent pricing. Moreover, a price
   cap benefits social welfare as it shifts production to the more
   efficient low-cost firm.},

Abstract = {This article theorizes and empirically investigates the link between
   ethnic divisions and terrorist attacks on a local scale. We argue that
   terrorists in ethnic contexts can use two separate provocation
   strategies: one targeting the government and one targeting opposing
   ethnic groups in order to stir up ethnic conflict. Following the second
   strategy, terrorists should target especially highly polarized
   localities, which are more prone to an escalation of ethnic conflict.
   Empirically, we suggest an innovative approach to estimate ethnic
   division indices at sub-national level, using 55 x 55 km grid cells as
   the unit of observation. Our empirical analysis uses negative binomial
   regression models including a spatially lagged dependent variable to
   account for spatial autocorrelation. The analysis reveals that, from
   2002 to 2014, areas with high levels of ethnic polarization encountered
   more terrorist attacks. The results are robust for different model
   specifications and ethnic polarization remains the most robust ethnic
   predictor. We conclude that the pattern of terrorist attacks is
   consistent with our argument that terrorism can be used as a strategy
   for local ethnic provocation. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {Scholars often view the sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries as a
   period of general urban decline, when territorial rulers imposed their
   political agendas on smaller state actors such as city-states in ever
   more authoritative ways. Such a view is especially prevalent in studies
   based in the Holy Roman Empire. It forms part of a larger approach to
   studying the course of state formation that focuses too much on the
   building of internal bureaucratic institutions and not enough on the
   importance of interactions between state actors. Studies that examine
   the relationship between warfare and state formation in particular
   downplay the importance of city-states, arguing that the costs of war
   served as a prime vehicle for princely states to marginalize city-states
   during the Reformation era. This article re-evaluates this paradigm of
   urban decline through the comparative study of corporate alliances,
   formal cooperative associations between princely states and city-states.
   Specifically, it examines the fallout surrounding two conflicts between
   princes and city-states within the Schmalkaldic League and the
   Protestant Union. Controversies over the use of alliance military forces
   within these leagues reveal that rather than decline in the decades
   leading up to the Thirty Years War, urban influence within leagues
   increased over time because of the dynamics of war. This conclusion
   challenges the narratives of territoriality and urban decline that
   dominate much of the political history covering the sixteenth and early
   seventeenth centuries. Ultimately, it presents a new way to understand
   the relationship between city-states, princely states, warfare, and the
   course of state formation in the Reformation-era Holy Roman Empire.},

Abstract = {Objective. In the wake of a massive shift in public opinion on same-sex
   marriage, scholars have examined the factors that predict support of
   marriage equality. This research, largely from cross-sectional or trend
   data, leaves questionable evidence for causality. In this research note,
   we use newly available panel data to predict attitudes toward marriage
   equality. Methods. We use three three-wave panels of survey data from
   the General Social Survey (2006-2014) to estimate the effects of both
   time-variant and nonvariant characteristics on attitudes toward marriage
   equality. Results. Using time-variant factors, we support prior
   research, finding evidence for the causal effect of political views and
   time period on attitudes. Unlike earlier research, we find no
   significant effect of church attendance or marital or parental status.
   Among invariant characteristics, we largely support prior research on
   the effect of demographic characteristics on attitudes. Conclusion. This
   analysis underscores the importance of using longitudinal data to
   support causal inferences and augment cross-sectional research on
   political attitudes.},

Abstract = {This paper analyzes the effects of policy uncertainty on the stability
   of a monetary union. Focusing on peripheral countries, we study how
   uncertainty over the consequences of a possible exit affects regime
   switches. Applying game theory and a cost-benefit analysis, we model a
   regime switch as the endogenous result of a two-stage policy game. We
   find that the effects of uncertainty are not trivial. Unilateral exits
   are less probable, but contagion is more likely to be observed. Our
   results are driven by two opposite forces: a traditional conservative
   effect induced by policy uncertainty in a single policymaker framework,
   which calls for more stability, and a strategic effect, arising from the
   strategic interaction, which may undermine the monetary union's
   foundation and strengthen incentives for contagion. (c) 2016 Elsevier

Abstract = {Equality is part of American revolutionary and constitutional ideals.
   Inequalities have enormous impacts on the functioning of democracy. The
   goal is clear: all men are created equal and, in a democracy, everyone
   should count for one. But the country has struggled for two centuries to
   determine what that means in practice and how to accomplish it. Equal
   voting rights have been easier to define than the ideal of equality has
   been for the campaign process. But equal inputs to the political process
   do not comprise a sufficient condition of a political process which
   values all equally, any more than the plebiscites we frequently condemn
   here and abroad. Egalitarian philosophy and empirical observations don't
   automatically line up. By contrast, equalization, as movement toward
   equality, offers more fluid and promising approaches, such as compliance
   with Rawls' difference principle and similar movements toward equality,
   which are more helpful for dealing with campaigns. Adequate descriptions
   of equality must reflect findings that too much inequality is disastrous
   for democracy.},

Title = {Secrecy and absence in the residue of covert drone strikes},
Journal = {POLITICAL GEOGRAPHY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {57},
Pages = {13-23},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {By focusing on the materials and practices that prosecute drone warfare,
   critical scholarship has emphasised the internal state rationalisation
   of this violence, while positioning secrecy and absence as barriers to
   research. This neglects the public existence of covert U.S. drone
   strikes through the rumours and debris they leave behind, and the
   consequences for legitimisation. This article argues that by signifying
   the possible use of covertness, the public residue of unseen strikes
   materialises spaces of suspected secrecy. This secrecy frames seemingly
   arbitrary traces of violence as significant in having not been secreted
   by the state, and similarly highlights the absence in these spaces of
   clear markers of particular people and objects, including casualties.
   Drawing on colonial historiography, the article conceptualises this
   dynamic as producing implicit significations or intimations,
   unverifiable ideas from absences, which can undermine rationalisations
   of drone violence. The article examines the political consequences of
   these allusions through an historical affiliation with lynching
   practice. In both cases, traces of unseen violence represent the
   practice as distanced and confounding, prompting a focus on the struggle
   to comprehend. Intimations from spaces of residue position strikes as
   too ephemeral and materially insubstantial to understand. Unlike the
   operating procedures of drone warfare, then, these traces do not
   dehumanise targets. Rather, they narrow witnesses' ethical orientation
   towards these events and casualties, by prompting concern with
   intangibility rather than the infliction of violence itself. A political
   response to covert strikes must go beyond `filling in' absences and
   address how absence gains meaning in implicit, inconspicuous ways. (C)

Title = {Tweeting India's Nirbhaya protest: a study of emotional dynamics in an
   online social movement},
Journal = {SOCIAL MOVEMENT STUDIES},

Abstract = {Previous research has recognized the role of emotions in protests and
   social movements in the offline world. Despite the current scenario of
   ubiquitous social media and `Twitter revolutions,' our knowledge about
   the connections between emotions and online protests still remains
   limited. In this study, we examine whether online protest actions follow
   the same emotional groundwork for supporting and nurturing a social
   movement as in the offline world, and how these emotions vary across
   various stages of the social movement. Through a computer-assisted
   emotion analysis of 65,613 Twitter posts (tweets), posted during the
   Nirbhaya social movement (movement against the Delhi gang-rape incident)
   in India, we identified a strong resemblance between online emotional
   patterns and offline protest emotions as discussed in literature. Formal
   statistical testing of a range of emotions (negativity, positivity,
   anger, sadness, anxiety, certainty, individualism, collectivism, and
   achievement) demonstrates that they significantly differed across stages
   of the social movement; as such, they influenced the course of the
   online protest, resonating parallels with offline events. The findings
   highlight the importance of anger and anxiety in stirring the collective
   conscience, and identify that positive emotion was pervasive during the
   protest event. Implications of these findings are discussed.},

Journal = {SOCIAL MOVEMENT STUDIES},

Volume = {16},
Number = {2},
Pages = {169-181},
Abstract = {In this article, we explore and develop the utility for social movement
   studies of Michel Foucault's conceptualization of heterotopia. Informed
   by Foucault's theorizing, we propose a heuristic typology of social
   movement heterotopias. Five heterotopia ;types' are considered:
   `contained', `mobile', `cloud', encounter' and rhizomic'. Each has
   particular attributes, but all challenge normal, routine politics. They
   do so by being, from the perspective of state and capital, either in the
   `wrong' place, moving in the wrong' way, or involving the `wrong'
   connections, affinities or organization. These are constructed-types,
   proposed for the purpose of description, comparison and prediction.
   These social movement heterotopias are different types of space that
   facilitate practices of resistance and transgression. We situate
   Foucault's writing on heterotopia at a pivotal moment in his
   intellectual career, when he became increasingly concerned with how
   particular mechanisms for modulating the creative force of
   resistance/power are invented, the types of bodies they craft and the
   politics they make possible. We propose an interpretation of heterotopia
   that relates it to his later work on power, resistance and freedom, and
   the interplay of his ideas with those of Gilles Deleuze.},

Abstract = {The theory of opposition has been famously crystallized in a square. One
   of the most common generalizations of the square is a cube of
   opposition. We show here that there is no cube such that each of its
   faces is a square of opposition. We discuss the question of
   generalization and present two other generalizations of the theory of
   opposition to the third dimension: one based on Blanche's hexagon of
   opposition, the other on the square of contrariety.},

Abstract = {The Women Section of the Falange's periodicals in the forties, Medina
   and Y, contributed to the construction and dissemination of ideals for
   womanhood accepted in the early period of Franco Dictatorship. Contrary
   to the thesis that the domesticity model, by virtue of which women were
   exclusively conceived as spouses and mothers, was reinforced and it
   emerged as the only referent for Spanish women in the postwar, the
   analysis of these periodicals confirms that the construction of gender
   models was a process permeated by tensions and contradictions. These
   were the legacy of social and cultural changes that had taken place in
   previous decades, as well as the experience of the Spanish Civil War
   that, by means of the active participation of thousands of women in the
   war effort, the dominant gender models in the Francoist side became
   redefined. Besides, altered these female publications reflected the
   fascist women's efforts to negotiate their place in Franco Dictatorship,
   as well as their desire to make visible their contribution to the `New
   Spain'. To sum up, the article explores the construction of femininity
   in the Spanish postwar as a process defined by the instability instead
   of the imposition of a rigid and immutable model.},

Journal = {SOCIAL MOVEMENT STUDIES},

Volume = {16},

Pages = {623-628},
Abstract = {Several recent episodes of massive student protests in countries in
   Europe, Latin America, and Africa, raise the question of whether we are
   witnessing to a new surge of student protests. This profile offers an
   interpretation of the socio-economic and political processes that have
   caused contentious reactions among students, paying special attention to
   changes in the major characteristics of the higher education sector.
   Inlast decades, governments of all colors have enacted laws promoting
   the outsourcing of personnel, the managerialization of governing bodies,
   and the introduction of tuition fees as well as cuts to public funding.
   These changes are inspired by a new paradigm, which promotes the
   `discipline of the market place, the power of the consumer and the
   engine of the competition.' In this context, various forms of resistance
   and opposition can be observed. Here, we focus on three dimensions: (1)
   financing and autonomy of universities; (2) governance and
   managerialization; (3) precarization of labor conditions. The profile
   shows how recent protests in Chile and England are related to changes in
   the afore-mentioned dimensions. We conclude that the reappearance of
   students as political actors is related to the emergence of a range of
   distributional conflicts stemming from the implementation of the
   neoliberal agenda in the field of higher education.},

Title = {The Reaction Function of the European Central Bank},
Journal = {POLITICKA EKONOMIE},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {65},
Number = {4},
Pages = {424-439},
Abstract = {The forecast-based reaction function of the European Central Bank (ECB)
   is estimated in this paper and the change in the monetary policy regime
   is discussed in the context of the current economic crisis.
   ECB/Eurosystem staff projections database is utilized in order to
   estimate the rule. The advantage of using this database is demonstrated
   by comparing the results of econometric estimation utilizing these data
   on projections with the results obtained by popular method of using
   future values as proxies for expectations. This popular method is shown
   to be inadequate in this paper not only by econometric verification of
   alternative forms of the estimated reaction function. Its inadequacy is
   demonstrated also by analyzing statistical properties of the time series
   and by showing that standard econometric assumptions do not hold when
   using future values as proxies for expectations. It is further shown
   that current values are more suitable proxies for expectations than
   values actually observed in the future. This fact provides an answer to
   the question analyzed recently by Arlt, Mandel (2012), (2014) who
   investigated how is it possible that simple backwardlooking rules
   perform extremely well when describing forward-looking behavior of
   central banks.},

Title = {The indignant citizen: anti-austerity movements in southern Europe and
   the anti-oligarchic reclaiming of citizenship},
Journal = {SOCIAL MOVEMENT STUDIES},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {16},
Number = {1, SI},
Pages = {36-50},
Abstract = {This article discusses the change in political vision of anti-austerity
   movements in southern Europe in comparison with previous protest
   movements. It focuses on the emergence of a discourse of citizenship at
   the core of the new protest wave, as seen in frequent references to
   citizens', citizenry' and citizenship' in movement manifestos, and the
   resolutions and declarations of popular assemblies. I investigate the
   meaning and motivations of this citizenism' and how it reflects the
   change in economic conditions and popular perceptions in the aftermath
   of the 2008 economic crisis. The analysis draws from movement documents,
   and in-depth interviews with 40 protest organisers and participants from
   the Indignados movement in Spain and the Aganaktismenoi movement in
   Greece. I argue that within these movements, the idea of citizenship has
   acted both as a source of popular identity interpellating a diverse set
   of demographics, and as a central demand, organising calls for greater
   popular participation in decision-making, freedom of expression and
   against corruption. Anti-austerity movements put forward an
   anti-oligarchic view of citizenship, which is different from the
   liberal, civic-republican and social democratic approaches, in its
   understanding of citizenship as the power of the dispersed citizenry'
   against the concentrated power of economic and political elites. This
   grassroots re-appropriation of citizenship highlights how anti-austerity
   movements in southern Europe have departed from the anti-statism of
   autonomous movements and have developed a more positive view of the
   state as a basis of social cohesion and a possible means of people
   power'.},

   Analysis},
Journal = {POLITICKA EKONOMIE},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {65},
Number = {2},
Pages = {179-197},
Abstract = {The aim of our paper is to identify factors that influence the
   territorial selection and allocation of development aid of the Czech
   Republic. We applied random-effects probit and tobit models in our
   regression analysis which revealed that flows of Czech aid to individual
   developing countries are determined by variety of factors. Czech
   interests and mutual relations were mostly identified as statistically
   significant determinants, namely export: volumes, closer historical
   relations and geographical proximity. The presence of Czech embassy in a
   country was not confirmed as a significant factor. The reflection of
   recipients' needs in Czech aid selection and allocation is rather
   ambiguous. While Czech aid flows depend positively on total population
   and negatively on per capita income of recipient countries, they are
   positively influenced by the recipients' level of social development.
   Similarly, the Czech Republic tends to give (more) aid to more
   democratic and freer countries with lower institutional quality.},

Abstract = {Hard power, the unorthodox foreign policy mechanism, has emerged
   recently as a complex agency that uses military power to regulate
   diplomatic relations between military and civilian actors. Although
   national governments use hard power rather frequently to influence
   foreign public opinions, the field's scholarship tends to downplay the
   role of military instruments in the development of public diplomacy.
   Almost all armed forces contribute to various public diplomacy efforts
   by applying basic tools, including humanitarian-relief operations and
   construction works, and international military education and training
   programs. This article analyzes these tools in the context of soft power
   and public diplomacy and demonstrates the impact of military power on
   public diplomacy. It also reconstructs the effective time frames of
   public diplomacy works of the military by introducing a novel pattern to
   understanding these works.},

Abstract = {Social change endeavors are increasingly shaped by corporate interests
   and, in some instances, large corporations take over ideas and practices
   initiated by social change advocates. We label this process
   `corporatization' and argue that, while it is clearly a variant of
   co-optation, it has specific qualities that warrant a separate
   analytical framework. Using existing research to examine the cases of
   breast cancer activism, organic food, and recycling in the United States
   - all extreme examples of corporatization - we conceptualize
   corporatization as a subset of co-optation in which: (1) corporations
   come to dominate fields initiated by activists; (2) corporatized
   versions become widespread; and (3) alternative, `response,' movements
   emerge to oppose corporatized versions. We posit that, in each case,
   `corporate takeover devices' allowed corporate entities to `join the
   game' and eventually come to dominate fields initiated by social
   movements.},

Abstract = {The article introduces the reception of Isaac Deutscher's work in
   Eastern Europe in a historical context and shows how deeply this
   reception was connected to the various transformations of the system,
   which had been established after the victory of the Russian October
   Revolution. The author gives a Marxist analysis of the historical
   development of state socialism and the various changes in
   Eastern-European Marxist thought which accompanied this history. He
   belongs to that school of thought which defines this system as state
   socialism, and he gives a theoretical analysis of its main
   characteristics, adding that 1989 failed to fulfil the expectations and
   hopes of many Western and Eastern-European Marxists.},

Abstract = {We contribute to the rare evidence of driving motives of establishing
   new onshore and offshore companies by analysing the situation in the
   Slovak Republic in 2014. We analyse financial and ownership data for the
   Slovak enterprises already included in onshore and offshore business,
   providing data by corporate service providers on the driving motives and
   their combination for the Slovak customers in 2014 and the available
   external data assessing the quality of the Slovak business environment.
   We present the empirical evidence that the motive of tax benefits is
   ranked as the most important, followed by the anonymity of the UBO,
   flexible arrangement of ownership relations, asset protection, asset
   management and trusteeship and special cases. In the second part of our
   research we provide empirical. evidence on significant areas of the
   business environment affecting the number of newly established onshore
   and offshore companies by the Slovak enterprises between 2005 and 2014.
   The indicators assessing the quality of the Slovak business environment
   are divided into two groups paying taxes plus doing business and the
   quality of the legal system in Slovakia. Our research shows that from
   the first group is insignificant only the indicator of time to comply
   with taxes. On the other side, the perception of corruption and the
   functionality of the state institutions are evaluated as significant
   from the second group.},

Abstract = {This article discusses ``Military Operations in Urban Terrain{''}
   (MOUT), arguing that MOUT is a doctrine that systematically blurs
   distinctions observed in traditional warfare, such as those between
   public and private space as well as those between military forces and
   civilians. Moreover, through a series of administrative mechanisms, MOUT
   seeks to legitimate psychological warfare techniques and to broaden
   social control over various populations. The article also reviews some
   of the arguments that rationalize the new political and academic
   interest in urban warfare. It investigates topics such as global
   urbanization, the increase in low-intensity conflicts, and the paradigm
   shift in military sociology (from Clausewitz to ``new warfare{''}). The
   article suggests that MOUT seeks to justify a conflation between two
   forms of violence, potestas and violentia, namely military repression
   and administrative/biopolitical social control over populations. I argue
   that the doctrine cannot be analyzed simply through appeals to state
   sovereignty or the implications of biopolitics, as has become customary.
   The article concludes with an examination of the conflation between
   potestas and violentia in ``Operation Enduring Freedom{''} in
   Afghanistan after September 11 and in a series of Israeli operations in
   Palestine following the outbreak of the Second Intifada in the year
   2000.},

Abstract = {In the sixties, an age of profound social change, political tensions and
   religious crisis, the evolution of gender identities in the YCW (Young
   Christian Workers) was influenced by intersectionality with other
   categories such as class, religion and youth. In this relevant Catholic
   Action organization, femininity and masculinity were constructed in
   relation to each other, first from complementarity discourse and then
   from the demand for equality between women and men. Work experience,
   Christian commitment and juvenile rebellion led to significant changes
   in the gender identities of YCW militants. These identities were also
   influenced by a change in religious discourse which originally sought a
   Catholic reconquest of Spanish society but moved towards dialogue with
   other political cultures and participation in the social and political
   movements which were undermining the francoist dictatorship.},

Abstract = {This study examines public opinion about the U.S. military across five
   dimensions of analysis using a Texas statewide survey that includes a
   rare oversample of Latino and African American respondents (four hundred
   each). It finds that while support for the military remains high,
   attitudes vary across a cluster of important military-related issues and
   within the factors that influence them. Evidence from multivariate
   regression analysis demonstrates that not only do demographic and
   political factors help shape these opinions, they may mediate the role
   race/ethnicity plays in influencing attitudes. This study adds greater
   nuance to the understanding of public opinion and the military,
   demonstrating that support for the military is neither all-encompassing
   nor monolithic. Scholars interested in military recruitment efforts and
   civilmilitary relations should take note of the gaps and divisions
   discovered in the ``crucial case{''} of Texas.},

Abstract = {Recognising how the concept of sovereignty has been affected by an
   indigenous and human rights agenda, this article explores the potential
   outcomes of the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous
   Peoples (UNDRIP) in terms of its challenge to Westphalian notions of
   sovereignty in Canada's North. It argues that the UNDRIP, adopted by the
   United Nations in 2007, is now playing a significant role in giving
   Canada's Indigenous Peoples a voice in international affairs and for
   reframing the relationship between state and non-state actors in ways
   which privilege collective rights rather than territorial imperatives.},

Abstract = {The Maritime Silk Road Initiative (MSRI) is a part of China's experiment
   in scaling up economic corridors across vast swathes of diverse economic
   geographies. China's involvement in a large number of ongoing transport
   corridor projects has encouraged it to embark on the most ambitious of
   them all till date. The heterogeneity among the economic capacities and
   integrations of various regions constituting the MSRI, particularly in
   efficiency of infrastructure and ability to trade, is noticeable. This
   article underscores these variations as important determinants of
   competitiveness of the constituent regions and countries. India's
   perceptions of the MSRI are significantly shaped by its lack of quality
   maritime infrastructure capacities that make it relatively uncompetitive
   vis-a-vis China, Europe and most of Southeast Asia; and the impression
   of the MSRI's China-centrality emanating from lack of mention of
   non-China regional forums in the Chinese government's vision statement;
   and absence of proactive measures from the Chinese leadership in
   establishing the MSRI's multi-country character. The article argues that
   it is important for India to appreciate the geopolitical character of
   this unprecedented infrastructure initiative, which, while emphasizing
   Chinese interests, might not be inimical to India's economic ambitions,
   provided India is able to address its domestic infrastructure
   imperatives.},

Abstract = {This paper builds homogenous series of the rate of surplus value (RSV)
   for the Chinese economy over the extended period 1956-2014 with a
   Marxian approach. It finds that the high profitability that stimulated
   capital accumulation in the decade before the 2008 crisis had relied on
   the continuous growth in the RSV. Given that the global crisis and
   changes in the domestic economy undermine all the conditions maintaining
   the accumulation model (an expanding external market, a relatively large
   reserve army of labor, and a low debt-income ratio), the RSV has failed
   to increase and profitability declined since 2008. Thus, this paper
   interprets the so-called new normal of the Chinese economy as a stage of
   declining profitability that results mainly from the stagnant RSV and
   the rising value composition of capital.},

Year = {2017},
Pages = {197-214},
Abstract = {This paper presents a unified account of bitstrings-i.e. sequences of
   bits (0/1) that serve as compact semantic representations-for the
   analysis of Aristotelian relations and provides an overview of their
   effectiveness in three key areas of the Logical Geometry research
   programme. As for logical effectiveness, bitstrings allow a precise and
   positive characterisation of the notion of logical independence or
   unconnectedness, as well as a straightforward computation-in terms of
   bitstring length and level-of the number and type of Aristotelian
   relations that a particular formula may enter into. As for diagrammatic
   effectiveness, bitstrings play a crucial role in studying the
   subdiagrams of the Aristotelian rhombic dodecahedron, and different
   types of Aristotelian hexagons turn out to require bitstrings of
   different lengths. The linguistic and cognitive effectiveness of
   bitstring analysis relates to the scalar structure underlying the
   bitstrings, and to the difference between linear and non-linear
   bitstrings.},

Abstract = {From 2001 to mid-2008 the price of oil rose from around \$25 a barrel to
   around \$150. This escalation of oil prices reflected both new demand in
   a world where the Chinese and Indian economies were enjoying high levels
   of growth and the apparent stagnation of conventional oil production
   from 2005. The ensuing difficulties of high-cost oil were exacerbated by
   the weakness of the dollar in a world in which the US in the first half
   of the decade had turned to China as a structural creditor and by
   increased volatility in oil markets as those markets became increasingly
   subject to speculative capital flows. The consequence of these pressures
   was a cumulative set of macro-economic and geo-political difficulties
   for western states. These macro-economic difficulties were central to
   the recessions that began in western economies in 2007-08 even whilst
   central banks focused as much attention on the inflationary pressure the
   oil price rise created. Meanwhile the geo-political difficulties left
   the US increasingly unable to exercise influence in the Middle East
   where the majority of the world's conventional oil supply remained. In
   this sense the 2008 economic crisis was much more than a crisis
   generated by western financial sectors. It was also a crisis arising
   from the resource basis of western economies.},

Title = {The Unexpected Effects of Criminal Violence along the Mexico-Texas
   Border},
Journal = {GEOPOLITICS},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {22},
Number = {4},
Pages = {934-957},
Abstract = {The violence and insecurity that Mexico suffered during former President
   Calderon's war on the Mexican drug cartels have come at a grave economic
   cost to many cities. The criminal violence had an impact on
   interdependent borderlands, which are geographic areas that have a
   symbiotic link between cities and communities of adjoining territories.
   Mexican business people and consumers that live in cities along the
   shared border with the United States have the ability to shift their
   economic transactions away from their insecure environments and to US
   border communities. In addition, US residents that would normally travel
   south for economic transactions would decide to avoid violent areas and
   therefore conduct business on the northern side. This research
   demonstrates that increased violence in Mexico produced a positive
   economic effect on the US side of the Mexico-Texas interdependent
   borderlands. Specifically, our time series analysis (2002-2014) shows
   that increased homicides, kidnappings and extortions in adjacent Mexican
   cities are strongly associated with higher gross total sales in the
   Texas communities while controlling for economic and demographic
   factors. We also found that the increases in the three crime categories
   were not associated with the arts, entertainment and recreation sector,
   nor the accommodation and food services sector performance. However,
   there was a positive relationship with the retail sales sector.},

Abstract = {In recent years, a kind of democratic failure appeared in the previously
   successfully democratized region of post-communist Europe. Problems of
   democratic deficit, and the deterioration of democracy have been
   increasingly observed in countries that had earlier been considered
   `success stories' of democratization. One such case is Macedonia, a
   country that managed to separate peacefully from Yugoslavia amidst
   bloody civil wars in the neighborhood and managed to democratize and
   sustain democracy. Although Macedonia exhibited problems of
   ethno-national contestations during the period of transition, its
   democratic development continued in spite of the brief inter-ethnic
   conflict in 2001. If this success story had continued as predicted, it
   could be cited as a positive example of how democracy can be
   consolidated despite ethno-national contestations. However, from 2008
   Macedonia began regressing democratically, gradually slipping into
   competitive authoritarianism. This article examines the process of
   autocratization in Macedonia through an analysis of how an exogenous
   shock enabled internal formative events in that the ruling regime headed
   by Prime Minister Nikola Gruevski commenced a process of
   primordialization of nationalism. This in turn produced a severe
   intra-Macedonian cleavage, along with further strains in Macedonia's
   inter-ethnic relations, giving an opportunity to the ruling party with
   its chief Nikola Gruevski to capture state institutions and consolidate
   a competitive authoritarian regime.},

Pages = {277-291},
Abstract = {Digital information consumption has a positive effect on external
   political efficacy in that the Internet provides factual support for the
   belief that governments are responsive to the demands of citizens. The
   existence of the digital forum creates the perception of greater
   openness and transparency. This effect is likely conditional on
   institutional context. Specifically, we expected the relationship
   between digital information consumption and efficacy to be stronger in
   more democratic countries. We use survey data from 18 Latin American
   countries to demonstrate that consumption is a strong predictor of
   external efficacy, and that this effect is modestly stronger in more
   democratic countries.},

Abstract = {On March 18, 2014, a group of student protestors raided and occupied the
   Legislative Yuan and later the Executive Yuan in Taiwan. The student-led
   movement lasted for about 3 weeks after Taiwan's President made
   significant concessions to change his non-transparent practices when
   signing the Cross-Strait Service Trade Agreement (CSSTA) with People's
   Republic of China. Mostly labelled as a movement of civil disobedience
   against government's dealings with China, the 318 Sunflower Student
   Movement is viewed as an important step toward the deepening of Taiwan's
   democratization process. Its repercussions were felt in Hong-Kong and
   Macao where similar civil disobedience movements had emerged. On the
   basis of the resource mobilization theory (RMT), the authors used a
   combination of case study and thematic analysis methods to examine the
   role of social media in political mobilization in Taiwan. This chapter
   identified two major recurrent themes as follows: challenging mainstream
   media and mobilizing multi-movement resources.},

Title = {Dissenting youth: how student and youth struggles helped shape
   anti-austerity mobilisations in Southern Europe},
Journal = {SOCIAL MOVEMENT STUDIES},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {16},
Number = {1, SI},
Pages = {64-81},
Abstract = {Social movements do not appear spontaneously. They are rooted in
   cultures and contexts and their evolution depends both on macro
   structural factors and on the action and organisation of pre-existing
   actors. In particular, the anti-austerity protest events that
   characterised southern European countries in the last few years cannot
   be understood through a focus on them as isolated incidents. They need,
   instead, to be analysed as part of a cycle of protest. Furthermore, some
   of their components are rooted in the activity and elaboration of
   pre-existing actors. We contribute to this issue by analysing the role
   of the student movement in the lead up to the anti-austerity
   mobilisations in Italy and Spain. This analysis allows us to show that a
   relevant component of the discourse of anti-austerity mobilisation comes
   from a long-standing trajectory of critique of neoliberalism, and that
   specific actors in specific fields of action reshaped and
   recontextualised this heritage in the context of the economic crisis,
   paving the way, at least from the discursive point of view, for the
   emergence of anti-austerity mobilisations. Our analysis, based on
   qualitative interviews of Italian and Spanish activists, point outs how
   student activists acted as initiators of anti-austerity mobilisations
   and as brokers in the adaptation of the anti-neoliberal discourse in the
   new context, with the goal of addressing a wider audience. We stress
   that pre-existing political trajectories play a significant role in the
   development of social movements, we highlight the importance of
   discursive continuities of cycle of protest and we argue that this role
   needs to be taken into account, together with structural factors and
   political processes, in understanding protest. Furthermore, we aim to
   contribute to the study of social movement continuities and
   cross-temporal diffusion, pointing out the active role of movements in
   this process in a dialectic relationship with the structural context.},

Title = {Why noncompetitive states are so important for understanding the
   outcomes of competitive elections: the Electoral College 1868-2016},
Journal = {PUBLIC CHOICE},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {173},
Number = {3-4},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Brams and Kilgour (Public Choice 170:99-113, 2017) begin their recent
   essay on the Electoral College (EC) by pointing out the obvious, but
   nonetheless regularly neglected fact that noncompetitive states may have
   a decisive impact on EC outcomes and shape the electoral strategies of
   the candidates in the competitive states, especially if there is
   asymmetry in the partisan balances in the non-competitive states. Their
   contribution is to offer combinatorics insights into the implications of
   such asymmetries in the form of three new indicators: Winningness,
   Vulnerability, and Fragility. They then explore the magnitude and
   effects of these three measures for the presidential elections of 2000,
   2004, 2008 and 2012. The major contribution of this note is to extend
   their analyses of these measures to an additional 34 elections: every
   election in the modern two-party post-Civil War era from 1868 to 2016.
   We find the Winningness measure to predict very well over the entire set
   of 38 presidential elections. Inspired by their work, we also offer a
   new and simpler metric for partisan asymmetries in noncompetitive states
   and show how it can predict the expected closeness of EC outcomes as
   well or better than the more complex combinatorics measures they
   propose.},

Abstract = {My focus in this paper is the use of the doctrine of double effect (DDE)
   in the context of Just War Theory. Different versions of DDE have
   different degrees of plausibility. Two distinctions are crucial. First,
   I distinguish between epistemically idealized and non-idealized
   scenarios. Second, I distinguish between versions of DDE that make a
   ceteris paribus comparison between intentional and non-intentional
   outcomes, from versions that either make a comparison that is not
   ceteris paribus or are non-comparative. After undertaking these
   classificatory tasks, I defend the following claims: First, in an
   idealized world, ceteris paribus versions of DDE are plausible. Second,
   we cannot transfer such plausibility to stronger (non-ceteris paribus)
   versions of DDE. Finally, in a non-idealized world, DDE is plausible.
   The argument for this last claim combines the reasons for defending
   ceteris paribus versions of DDE in idealized circumstances with an
   argument about how to proceed when we face hard choices under
   uncertainty.},

Title = {Zero-sum politics in contested spaces: The unintended consequences of
   legislative peacebuilding in Northern Ireland},
Journal = {POLITICAL GEOGRAPHY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {61},
Pages = {193-202},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Studies of ethno-nationalist conflict have repeatedly underlined the
   significance of policy interventions that seek to de-territorialise
   contested space after armed conflict and create more plural societies.
   Creating `shared' space in divided societies is often critically
   important and inextricably linked to peacebuilding. However much of this
   scholarship has tended to focus on the relative success or failure of
   such policies. This paper conversely explores the `unintended
   consequences' (Merton, 1936) of legislating around fragile public space
   in Northern Ireland and considers its potential to undermine, rather
   than reinforce efforts to transition to peace. Drawing on a body of work
   around unintended consequences, territorial socialisation and
   peacebuilding, we argue that such legislation in ethno-nationalist
   societies emerging from conflict is a double-edged sword which can be
   utilised both explicitly and implicitly to reactivate tribal spatial
   politics and exacerbate divisions in deeply divided societies. (C) 2017

Abstract = {The United Nations Security Council (UNSC) is critical to global peace
   and security, yet more than 20 years of negotiations over its reform
   have proved fruitless. We use recent advances in the theory of a priori
   voting power to present a formal quantitative appraisal of the
   implications for democratic equity and efficiency of the ``structural
   reforms{''} contained within 11 current reform proposals, as well as the
   separate effect of expansion of the UNSC membership. Only one reform
   proposal-a weakening of the veto power for Permanent Members by
   requiring two negative votes for a veto to be effective-robustly
   dominates the status quo against our measures of equity and efficiency.
   Several proposed structural reforms may actually worsen the issues they
   ostensibly claim to resolve.},

Abstract = {In the context of the example of a factory whose smoke emissions affect
   a near-by laundry, Coase (J Law Econ 3:1-44, 1960) argued for taxing the
   laundry as well as the factory, while Baumol (Am Econ Rev 62:307-322,
   1972) argued for taxing only the factory. Consistent application of
   marginal cost pricing shows that the efficient tax on laundries is
   positive when the number of laundries is finite and that the tax
   approaches zero in the limit as the number of laundries approaches
   infinity. The efficient tax on factories is bounded away from zero,
   regardless of the number of factories. Our framework is an application
   of the Vickrey-Clarke-Groves family of truth-telling mechanisms that
   require each agent to bear the full social cost of changing the outcome
   that would have prevailed had she not participated in the decision.
   Until now, the literature has not fully resolved the discrepancies
   between Coase's and Baumol's arguments, and even contemporary textbooks
   on environmental economics and public economics do not offer correct and
   complete analyses.},

Abstract = {Why do women's economic decision-making and political empowerment vary
   so widely? What are the main potential determinants of such variations?
   Over a cross-section of Italian provincial data, we analyze the
   association between two specific facets of women's empowerment, the
   percentage of women holding office in local political bodies and the
   percentage of women in high-ranking jobs, and the religious and cultural
   conditions which facilitate or hinder women's inclusion. Our hypothesis
   is that culture, in particular those values embodied by religious
   culture, plays a central role in shaping norms and beliefs about the
   role and involvement of women in society. Moreover we suggest that these
   cultural norms are inherited from the past and therefore have a high
   degree of inertia. Both OLS and IV results indicate that our measures of
   women's empowerment are strongly associated with religious culture, as
   proxied by religious marriages. These results are robust and consistent
   across specifications.},

Abstract = {Changes to Earth systems threaten human and non-human sustainability
   because these changes undermine critical life support systems such as
   estuarine and coastal ecosystems (ECEs), which are in systematic
   ecological decline. This article investigates the root social causes of
   coastal decline through the case of serial collapses of the Atlantic
   oyster (C. virginica), starting in New York in 1810. The research
   triangulates two methods, inductive historical political economy, and a
   reading of archival newspapers from 1607 to 1900 interpreted through a
   framework informed by Marxian attention to the flow of capital and the
   stages of capitalist development. The historical research indicates that
   the community-oriented classical republicanism of Jefferson, lost to the
   rise of a liberal republicanism in the period after the Revolutionary
   War and the early 19th century. This shift initiated the first stages of
   American capitalism, called ``original accumulation,{''} that caused the
   first collapse of the native oyster beds. As capitalism matured into the
   ``production{''} phase, industrial harvesting and development in the ECE
   destroyed the cultivated beds. In the archives, oysters are consistently
   framed as a commodity, not a part of a living seashore with needs.
   Recurring discourses of an ``inexhaustible{''} industry, competition
   between states, and even ``oyster wars{''} highlight the importance of
   the oyster as a commodity. In stories about depletion, the narratives
   are limited to the source of oysters seed to New York, or
   micro-depletions that complain of a lost favored brand and the search
   for its replacement. The origins of Atlantic ECE decline are found in
   the development of Atlantic capitalism. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All

Title = {The contentious sovereignties of the camp: Political contention among
   state and non-state actors in Italian Roma camps},

Abstract = {The global proliferation of camps manifests an alarming phenomenon of
   burgeoning marginalization, and shows that the concept of `camp' is
   today increasingly crucial to grapple with current changes in the
   world's geographies of exclusion and inclusion. Specifically, this
   article focuses on `institutional camps', i.e. created by government
   agencies in alleged emergency situations and aims to conceptualize
   sovereignty over this type of camp. After critically reviewing the
   ongoing scholarly debate on camp sovereignty, I situate my approach
   within the work of scholars who see political authority over the camp as
   comprising a multiplicity of both state and non-state actors. The
   article contributes to this perspective by drawing on the theory of
   `contentious politics' advanced by McAdam, Tarrow, and Tilly (2001).
   Through this analytical framework, I suggest construing camp
   sovereignties as contentious, i.e. inherently constituted by conflicting
   and ever-evolving power relations that change according to framing
   strategies, political opportunities, resources and repertoires of
   action. In order to show the benefits of such approach, the paper
   focuses on the empirical case of the Italian Roma camps in Rome, through
   which I show that camp sovereignty is not only fragmented into a
   multiplicity of actors but is also the result of conflict, compromise,
   negotiation, and co-optation among actors whose frames, opportunities,
   resources, and repertoires constantly change over time. (C) 2017 The

Abstract = {This article presents a model wherein law enforcers propose sentences to
   maximize their likelihood of reelection, and shows that elections
   typically generate over-incarceration, i.e., longer than optimal
   sentences. It then studies the effects of disenfranchisement laws, which
   prohibit convicted felons from voting. The removal of ex-convicts from
   the pool of eligible voters reduces the pressure politicians may
   otherwise face to protect the interests of this group, and thereby
   causes the political process to push the sentences for criminal offenses
   upwards. Therefore, disenfranchisement further widens the gap between
   the optimal sentence and the equilibrium sentence, and thereby
   exacerbates the problem of over-incarceration. Moreover, this result is
   valid even when voter turnout is negatively correlated with people's
   criminal tendencies, i.e., when criminals vote less frequently than
   non-criminals.},

Abstract = {Employment has been a key issue in the public debate on the energy
   transition in France. In this paper, we develop a methodology based on
   input-output analysis to compare the employment content of each economic
   sector to the national average. The differences are broken down into
   five components: the import rates of final goods, the import rates of
   intermediate goods, taxes and subsidies, salary levels and the share of
   labor in value added. We then estimate the employment content and the
   greenhouse gases (GHG) content of all French economic sectors in 2010,
   in order to study intersectoral substitutions stemming from an energy
   transition.
   We find that employment content variations are explained, in order of
   importance, by salary levels, the share of labor in value added, the
   import rates of final goods, the import rates of intermediate goods, and
   finally taxes and subsidies. In addition, our results show that the EU
   ETS covers sectors with high GHG content and low employment content, but
   not sectors with high GHG content and high employment content. Concerns
   about employment impacts might be part of the explanation for this.
   Finally, we identify intersectoral substitutions that would encourage
   sectors with lower GHG content and higher employment content.},

Abstract = {For proponents of the view that anthropogenic climate change will become
   a `threat multiplier' for instability in the decades ahead, the Syrian
   civil war has become a recurring reference point, providing apparently
   compelling evidence that such conflict effects are already with us.
   According to this view, human-induced climatic change was a contributory
   factor in the extreme drought experienced within Syria prior to its
   civil war; this drought in turn led to large-scale migration; and this
   migration in turn exacerbated the socio-economic stresses that
   underpinned Syria's descent into war. This article provides a systematic
   interrogation of these claims, and finds little merit to them. Amongst
   other things it shows that there is no clear and reliable evidence that
   anthropogenic climate change was a factor in Syria's pre civil war
   drought; that this drought did not cause anywhere near the scale of
   migration that is often alleged; and that there exists no solid evidence
   that drought migration pressures in Syria contributed to civil war
   onset. The Syria case, the article finds, does not support `threat
   multiplier' views of the impacts of climate change; to the contrary, we
   conclude, policymakers, commentators and scholars alike should exercise
   far greater caution when drawing such linkages or when securitising
   climate change. (C) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd. This is

Title = {``Vote with your feet{''}: Neoliberalism, the democratic nation-state,
   and utopian enclave libertarianism},
Journal = {POLITICAL GEOGRAPHY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {59},
Pages = {82-91},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {This paper examines a series of emerging utopian discourses that call
   for the creation of autonomous libertarian enclaves on land ceded by or
   claimed against existing states. These discourses have emerged in the
   aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis and can be seen as a response to
   the crisis on the part of freemarket advocates who critique previous
   waves of neoliberal reform for failing to radically transform the
   existing structures of the state. Enclave libertarianism seeks to
   overcome neoliberal capitalism's contradictory relationship to the
   liberal democratic state by rethinking the state as a ``private
   government service provider{''} and rethinking citizens as mobile
   consumers of government services. Citizens are thus called to ``vote
   with their feet{''} by opting-in to the jurisdiction that best fits
   their needs and beliefs. The paper argues that these utopian imaginaries
   are key to understanding specific new manifestations of post-crisis
   neoliberalism, and calls for more research into the diversity of
   discourses and imaginaries that circulate through networks of neoliberal
   actors beyond specific policy initiatives. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {We present a model of executive-legislative bargaining over appointments
   to independent central banks in the face of an uncertain economy with
   strategic economic actors. The model highlights the contrast between two
   idealized views of Federal Reserve appointments. In one view,
   politicians prefer to appoint conservatively biased central bankers to
   overcome credible commitment problems that arise in monetary policy. In
   the other, politicians prefer to appoint allies, and appointments are
   well described by the spatial model used to describe appointments to
   other agencies. Both ideals are limiting cases of our model, which
   depend on the level of economic uncertainty. When economic uncertainty
   is extremely low, politicians prefer very conservative appointments.
   When economic uncertainty increases, politicians' prefer central bank
   appointees closer to their own ideal points. In the typical case, the
   results are somewhere in between: equilibrium appointments move in the
   direction of politician's preferences but with a moderate conservative
   bias.},

Abstract = {How partisans select and perceive political news during election
   campaigns is an important question in political communication research.
   This article interrelates two prominent concepts: the selective exposure
   and the hostile media paradigms. I argue that some media outlets are
   more likely than others to be selected based on political preferences
   and that the partisan leanings of these outlets are perceived as
   friendly by their audiences. Other outlets are selected regardless of
   political alignment. Here I expect to find hostile media perceptions. An
   analysis of representative survey data from the 2009 and 2013 German
   national election studies reveals support for the proposed pattern.
   However, the overall magnitudes of selective exposure and bias
   perceptions are limited in the campaigns under investigation.},

Abstract = {Objectives. Missing from the literature is an assessment of how forensic
   evidence, particularly DNA evidence, is portrayed across several
   fictional crime dramas, rather than just one drama, namely, CSI. The
   purpose of this article is to explore how DNA evidence is presented in
   four fictional crime dramas, the context in which it is discussed, and
   the impact DNA has on case clearance in these fictional dramas. Methods.
   We drew a systematic sample by taking every fourth episode within each
   of four crime shows: CSI (Las Vegas), Law \& Order: SVU, Criminal Minds,
   and Without a Trace. Transcripts were created for the 117 included
   episodes. We used both qualitative and quantitative content analyses to
   analyze the discourse of DNA within these crime drama episodes. Results.
   Our results indicate that police and forensic dramas both contain
   frequent references to DNA, while FBI dramas rarely discuss DNA, at
   least in any meaningful context. Additionally, DNA is not used to solve
   a majority of fictional victimizations in these dramas. Conclusions.
   These results also provide context for future research on the CSI
   effect, particularly in terms of measuring crime show viewership
   variables.},

Abstract = {The education of children as future elites after the Restoration was a
   persistent concern for French emigres after the Revolution of 1789.
   Focusing on discourse on emigre education and emigre schools in Britain
   and the Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation, this article examines
   how, in the 1790s, the emigres' rejection of the Republic and their
   quest for monarchical restoration resonated in pedagogical activities.
   Under difficult living conditions and unclear prospects of political
   exile, education became a consolidating strategy of combating the
   Revolution with pedagogical means. The social composition, educational
   programmes, and public representations of emigre schools reveal their
   pivotal role in emigre community life, involving priests, women,
   writers, politicians, local supporters - and children. Comparison
   between Britain and the Holy Roman Empire allows for differentiating
   strategies of integration into the host societies and of immunization
   against revolutionary influences. Education contributed to strengthening
   the emigres' identity and mobilizing their hosts for the ideological,
   military, and humanitarian struggle against the Revolution. The
   students' later careers call for reconsidering experiences of exile
   education among the elites of Napoleonic and Restoration France.},

Abstract = {I analyze the choice politicians face when seeking votes from groups
   that lobby for sales tax rate decreases or tax exemptions, given the
   constraint that politicians want to raise a certain amount of revenue.
   Using data on sales taxes, I develop a model predicting a positive
   relationship between the number of exemptions and the sales tax rate.
   The estimation results provide support for this prediction. Each
   additional exemption is associated with an increase of between 0.10 and
   0.25 percentage points in the tax rate.},

Abstract = {This article analyzes how partisanship and political information
   influence perceptions of government corruption at national and regional
   levels and whether information attenuates the impact of partisanship.
   The data are drawn from surveys of recent elections held in Canada,
   France, Germany, Spain, and Switzerland. Almost everywhere, partisans of
   the incumbent parties and the most-informed citizens perceive less
   corruption than their nonpartisan and less-informed counterparts.
   However, there is no evidence of an interaction effect between
   information and partisanship. We note one interesting exception: In
   Quebec, the better informed perceive more corruption, especially those
   who are also partisans of opposition parties. We discuss how this
   pattern may be related to the emergence of a corruption scandal before

Abstract = {This article analyzes the extent to which the format and the ``Do not
   know{''} (DK) protocol of political knowledge questions influence the
   size of the gender gap. By using a set of experiments that manipulated
   the DK protocol and the format (open vs. closed ended) of political
   knowledge questions in a face-to-face representative survey of the
   Spanish population, we show that the format of the questions (open vs.
   closed ended) is not relevant in explaining the gender gap. DK
   protocols, however, influence outspoken levels of political knowledge
   differently for men and women. DK-discouraging protocols tend to
   encourage the emergence of hidden knowledge among women, whereas they
   mostly boost guessing among men. This finding suggests that the meaning
   and the use of the DK option appear to be gender biased.},

Title = {Juvenile Delinquency and Self-Sentiments: Exploring a Labeling Theory
   Proposition},
Journal = {SOCIAL SCIENCE QUARTERLY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {98},
Number = {1},
Pages = {73-88},

Abstract = {Objective. According to labeling theory, an official deviance label
   promotes the development of deviant self-meanings. Despite the
   centrality of this hypothesis to the theory, most tests of the
   hypothesis on juveniles are decades old, fail to control for deviant
   behavior, and focus only on self-evaluation, neglecting two of the three
   dimensions of self-meaning: self-potency and self-activity. Therefore,
   our objective is to explore this hypothesis in a way that addresses
   these weaknesses. Method. We test the hypothesis by examining the
   relationship between a delinquency adjudication and all three dimensions
   of self-meaning while controlling for recent deviant behavior. Our data
   come from two samples of college students and one sample of youths in an
   after-care program for youths who have been adjudicated delinquent.
   Results. In line with expectations, a delinquency adjudication is linked
   with lower self-evaluation and higher self-potency. But, contrary to
   expectations, it is associated with higher feelings of activity.
   Conclusion. The findings are consistent with the labeling theory
   proposition that an official deviance label promotes the development of
   deviant self-meanings. We discuss the theoretical and policy
   implications of these findings and outline avenues for future research.},

Title = {Competition Among National Football Leagues. Does It Exist? Should We

Abstract = {It is often supposed that the stakeholders of a national football league
   draw more satisfaction from their sport if the league is balanced, that
   is, if a large number of clubs have a reasonable chance of winning. This
   is the so-called Competitive balance hypothesis. This hypothesis can be
   challenged, however, in the context of international competition like
   the European champions league. It could be that the utility of national
   leagues' stakeholders would be higher if the probability of victory for
   their nation's club at the international level were higher. If this were
   the case, a league's governing body intending to maximize the quality of
   the national league by making use of redistributive schemes would face a
   trade-off between national competitive balance and international
   performance of the national representative club. We propose a simple
   microeconomic framework to model this trade-off. If a non-cooperative
   game exists among the national league governing bodies, whether it is a
   Nash or a Stackelberg one, this game would result in inefficient
   redistributive policies. We find soft' empirical evidence of such a
   competition among the big 5 football leagues in Europe. This result
   supports the idea of the creation of an international regulatory body.
   We derive the conditions under which the international regulatory body
   should ensure that the leagues' governing bodies implement
   redistributive schemes guaranteeing the respect of the national
   competitive balance. We also emphasize the risk of experiencing a drop
   in the quality of leagues if one of them becomes too big relatively to
   the others, what we call the tragedy of the wealthy.},

Abstract = {What were the sources of solidarity that bound anti-government
   protesters in Tahrir Square? This article complicates Judith Butler's
   claim that this solidarity originated in shared vulnerability to police
   violence and the practices of mutual care that were necessary to sustain
   bodies in the square. I draw on existing scholarship that suggests that
   passive knowledge of this shared vulnerability was already present among
   Egyptians, especially those working in the informal economy and living
   more of their lives - eating, chatting, praying, selling, etc. - on the
   streets of Egypt's cities and thereby drawn into increasing contact with
   state police forces. Given that aggressive policing and intimidation had
   generated a sense of passive solidarity among Egyptians, I ask how this
   solidarity was transformed into animated opposition to the regime. My
   answer is that the Islamic congregational prayers as well as the Sunday
   Masses held during the revolution were spectacles of interfaith
   cooperation that inspired courage and trust across sectarian and
   religious/secular communities. These prayers were rational rituals that
   generated trust among diverse Egyptians that Mubarak had sown suspicion
   among and played against one another to stay in power. These were
   embodied rituals that lent moral support to more the mundane aspects of
   occupying Tahrir Square, which was symbolically and strategically
   important in bringing down the regime.},

   together with Heidegger's technically economic articulation of standing

   weak in search of alternatives{''} as Gianni Vattimo and Santiago Zabala

   as corollary to the existential stress of the dislocated mind, this

Title = {Changing spaces of political encounter and the rise of anti-politics:
   Evidence from Mass Observation's General Election diaries},
Journal = {POLITICAL GEOGRAPHY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {56},
Pages = {13-23},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Negativity towards the institutions of formal politics is currently a
   concern across much of the democratic world. It is generally agreed that
   such negativity increased among British citizens during the second half
   of the twentieth century. In this paper, we analyse a novel dataset not
   previously used to study this topic: Mass Observation's General Election
   diaries. Since diarists wrote mostly about politicians, political
   campaigns, and associated media coverage, we ask specifically what the
   diaries can tell us about increased negativity towards politicians and
   its relationship to developments in political communication. We take a
   postholing approach to sampling of the diaries, enabling
   comparative-static analysis between the middle and end of the twentieth
   century. We view the diaries in a geographical framework derived from
   contextual theories of social action. This gives us a focus on spaces of
   political encounter, modes of political interaction, performances by
   politicians, and judgements by citizens. We argue that prominent spaces
   of political encounter changed over the period from long radio speeches
   and rowdy political meetings to televised debates and associated expert
   commentary. We demonstrate hovv these latter settings for political
   interaction afforded less opportunity for politicians to perform virtues
   to citizens, and for citizens to calibrate judgements of politicians.

Abstract = {The history of Kenya is loaded with continuous moments when music played
   a key role in expressing various issues in the country. Music is one of
   the most important modes through which ordinary Kenyans express their
   wishes, identity, frustrations and aspirations. For a long time, freedom
   of speech in Kenya, especially on issues touching political injustice
   had been curtailed. However, musicians in Kenya offered an alternative
   means of challenging the political status quo in the country by use of
   musical lyrics which address injustices directly or metaphorically. What
   is the place of music in Kenya's political landscape? Has political
   music in Kenya made a difference in governance and in educating the
   masses on their political and social rights? Have political songs helped
   change the political and social climate in Kenya? These issues are
   examined in this chapter.},

Abstract = {The emergence of the political sphere as an autonomous domain of human
   activity is considered to be one of the great achievements of
   Renaissance philosophy. The complementary autonomy of the economic
   sphere, however, was also shaping up in the world of philosophical
   ideas. In this article, I examine how the late medieval notion of moral
   economy was transformed in the hands of two illustrious representatives
   of Tudor and Elizabethan political thinking, Thomas More (1478-1535) and
   Thomas Smith (1513-1577). More specifically, I will show how, at a time
   of intense economic and social unrest, Smith's A Discourse of the
   Commonweal of This Realm of England (1549) and De Republica Anglorum: A
   Discourse on the Commonwealth of England (written between 1562 and 1565)
   recast Morean utopian themes in a distinctively anti-utopian light.},

Abstract = {This article analyses the anchoring of inflation expectations of
   professional forecasters and consumers in the euro area. We study
   anchoring, defined as the central bank's ability to manage expectations,
   by paying special attention to the impact of the ECB inflation target
   and ECB inflation projections on inflation expectations. Our analysis
   indicates that in the post-crisis period longer-term inflation
   expectations have become somewhat more sensitive to shorter-term ones
   and to actual HICP inflation. We also find that the ECB inflation
   projections have recently become more important for short- and
   medium-term expectations of professional forecasters and at the same
   time the role of the ECB inflation target for those expectations has
   diminished. Overall, our analysis suggests that in recent years
   inflation expectations in the euro area have shown some signs of
   de-anchoring.},

Abstract = {This chapter engages Vattimo and Zabala's Hermeneutic Communism from the
   standpoint of how it relates to a venerable tradition of `manifestos'. A
   typology of manifestos is offered and then the question is raised, to
   what extent we can fit Hermeneutic Communism within this tradition. The
   chapter also engages a questionable assumption of Hermeneutic Communism,
   namely the metaphysics of the end, which is announced as the end of
   metaphysics. This last point is elaborated vis-a-vis a reading of Rorty,
   which challenged the usefulness of philosophical manifestos for
   practical politics.},

Abstract = {In this chapter, I examine stories that foster care youth tell to
   legislatures, courts, policymakers, and the public to influence policy
   decisions. The stories told by these children are analogized to victim
   truth testimony, analyzed as a therapeutic, procedural, and
   developmental process, and examined as a catalyst for systemic
   accountability and change. Youth stories take different forms and appear
   in different media: testimony in legislatures, courts, research surveys
   or studies; opinion editorials and interviews in newspapers or blog
   posts; digital stories on YouTube; and artistic expression. Lawyers
   often serve as conduits for youth storytelling, translating their
   clients' stories to the public. Organized advocacy by youth also informs
   and animates policy development. One recent example fosters youth
   organizing to promote ``normalcy{''} in child welfare practices in
   Florida, and in related federal legislation.},

Abstract = {In this study, we examine modern reading of the Square of Opposition by
   means of intensional logic. Explicit use of possible world semantics
   helps us to sharply discriminate between the standard and modal
   ('alethic') readings of categorical statements. We get thus two basic
   versions of the Square. The Modal Square has not been introduced in the
   contemporary debate yet and so it is in the centre of interest. Some
   properties ascribed by medieval logicians to the Square require a shift
   from its Standard to Modal version. Not inevitably, because for each of
   the two squares there exists its mate which can be easily confused with
   it. The discrimination between the initial and modified versions of the
   Standard and Modal Square enable us to separate findings about
   properties of the Square into four groups, which makes their proper
   comparison possible. The disambiguation so achieved leads to the
   solution of various puzzles often mentioned in recent literature.},

Abstract = {Based on the Constructivist theoretical approach for analyzing
   international relations by identifying the forces which influence states
   behavior, this article compares major junctions in Spain's international
   status and the way systemic changes influenced the course of
   Spanish-Israeli relations. The article looks at Madrid's entry into the
   international trade regime represented by the General Agreement on
   Tariffs and Trade (GATT) in 1963, Spain's joining the Council of Europe
   in 1977, Madrid's inclusion in NATO in 1982, and its entry into the
   European Economic Community (EEC) in 1986. We argue that this last
   milestone left Madrid with little option but to establish relations with
   Israel. This proved that systemic pressure, derived from Spain's new
   status in the EEC, was crucial for the establishment of bilateral
   diplomatic ties.},

Abstract = {Health Policy in Cross-border Cooperation Practices: The Role of
   Euroregions and Their Local Government Members. Territory, Politics,
   Governance. The support for local cross-border cooperation in Europe has
   been built on the premises of new cross-border institutions
   (Euroregions) as primarily responding to policy problems that cannot be
   dealt with effectively within the national contexts, expressed as
   filling the gaps'. One area with significant gains to be made by
   cooperating across borders is health policy. This article discusses the
   extent to which health policy has (not) become an activity in
   cross-border practices, and what the potential is for Euroregions to
   facilitate this. The article first relies on previous research in
   combination with a mapping exercise of 53 current structures to
   demonstrate that despite well-advertised best practices', the overall
   level of health cooperation is relatively low. It then looks into the
   motivations for cooperation and policy priorities of participating local
   governments. The empirical data consist of interviews with mayors of
   local governments in six Euroregions, located at three national borders
   (Sweden-Norway, Hungary-Slovakia and Austria-Germany). The analysis
   points to attitudes related to frustration, a sense of institutional
   inappropriateness and cognitive distances playing a role in the low
   salience of health policy. The article therefore argues that cooperation
   in the health area will derive from policy activity from other actors
   than Euroregions.},

Abstract = {The fourth chapter considers the emergence of Armenia, Georgia, and
   Azerbaijan as independent states after the collapse of the Soviet Union.
   The idea, inherited from Marx, that nationalism would wither away and be
   replaced by class struggle proved mistaken. Would-be leaders played up
   the nationalist causes. But the frontiers the Soviet Union had created
   were even more arbitrary than they had to be, and the region was plunged
   in conflict, to the advantage of the neighbouring great power, the
   Russian Federation. No regional unity was possible.},

Abstract = {We test the theory of expressive voting in relation to political
   ideology in a laboratory experiment. After deriving our hypotheses from
   a decision theoretic model, we examine voting decisions in an experiment
   in which we use the size of the electorate as the treatment variable.
   Using a Heckman selection model that includes both the electoral
   participation decision and voting choice decision, we find mixed results
   for the expressive voting hypothesis. In line with expressive voting,
   our findings suggest that non-ideological voters are more likely to
   abstain from voting than ideological voters especially when the
   electorate grows large. Concerning the voting choice decision between an
   equal but inefficient, and an unequal but efficient income distribution
   the evidence for expressive voting is mixed. We do find that voters with
   socialist (left wing) preferences behave expressively, but we do not
   find this effect for voters with capitalist (right wing) preferences.},

Abstract = {ObjectivesThe pioneers of intergroup contact research suggested that the
   positive impact of face-to-face interaction might fail among intolerant
   participants. To challenge this view, the present study extends previous
   research by examining religiosity as a boundary condition of intergroup
   contact among ethnic minority members.
   MethodsThe results were generated in a regression analysis of a Danish
   national probability sample from 2006 (N = 3,958).
   ResultsAnalyses show that: (a) the ability of intergroup contact to
   reduce prejudice is strongest among the most religious and (b) that
   contact reduces prejudice at all levels of religiosity.
   ConclusionsThese findings support the general claim that intergroup
   contact is sufficiently powerful to produce positive outcomes, even
   among the most intolerant. Additionally, the findings suggest that
   intergroup contact is not necessarily seriously infected by selection
   biases, as the most intolerant do not systematically avoid contact. The
   concluding section discusses the theoretical implications of the
   findings.},

Abstract = {In this contribution, we have gathered data on the French Parliament and
   the representatives in order to enhance our understanding of their
   different missions (law-making, representation and
   oversight,activities). The analysis of data on the number, the
   characteristics and the activity of the representatives on the one hand
   and the analysis of the budgets' assemblies on the other hand display
   different features. First the representatives benefit from a generous
   pension system but their base salary has declined in real terms while
   other elements `(such as expenditure allowances to cover expenses which
   arise in the course of their parliamentary activities) of their
   compensation package have increased on the contrary. Second, the French
   national assembly shows a great stability in terms of a weak
   representativeness and a long-lasting multiple-office holding practice.
   Finally the parliamentary activity has increased. These evolutions shed
   light on selection issues as well as incentive to work issues which
   matter for the functioning of representative democracies.},

Abstract = {This article examines how staff working on two major Internet
   platformsGoogle and Facebookmake sense of human rights such as freedom
   of expression and privacy. Based on interviews and online material, the
   article examines how the two rights are spoken of, how threats are
   perceived, and how the companies define their role in terms of
   protecting those rights. The article finds that both companies frame
   themselves as strongly committed to (and actively promoting) human
   rights. The framing, however, focuses primarily on potential human
   rights violations by governments, and pays less attention to areas where
   the companies' own business practices may have a negative impact on
   their users' rights and freedoms. While the platforms are spoken of
   using civic-minded metaphors connected to people's ability to exercise
   rights and thus to participate in public life, the companies actually
   retain the freedom to set and enforce their own rules of engagement.},

Abstract = {The centenary approaches of the establishment of the first chair in
   International Relations (IR) at Aberystwyth in 1919. In this paper, I
   argue that while revisionist historians are correct to claim that IR did
   not emerge in a Big Bang, 1917-19 was nevertheless an important moment
   in the history of IR particularly in the US which should be appreciated
   a century later. 1917 saw the creation of The Inquiry, a secret
   organization composed of academics set up by President Woodrow Wilson
   tasked with preparing the American delegation to the Paris peace
   negotiations. Continuing in the revisionists' spirit, through the lens
   of the Inquiry, I suggest that early IR should be viewed as a social
   formation at the intersection of government, civil society, and
   academia, not as an academic specialty only. Rather than disbanding
   after Paris, crucially, the Inquiry was incorporated into the fledgling
   Council on Foreign Relations. Such a perspective prompts comparisons
   between 1917 and today. Empirically, how influential are the think tanks
   and research institutes that try to shape US foreign policy?
   Normatively, we might ask whether the limited yet elitist network
   represented by the Inquiry was better or worse than the expansive world
   of policy-making of today? Drawing on diverse sources, including
   original research at the Inquiry's archive, I revisit the Inquiry and
   pose these questions to contemporary IR scholars.},

Abstract = {This article discusses the adequacy of Rawls' theory of justice as a
   tool for racial justice. It is argued that critics like Charles W Mills
   fail to appreciate both the insights and limits of the Rawlsian
   framework. The article has two main parts spread out over several
   different sections. The first is concerned with whether the Rawlsian
   framework suffices to prevent racial injustice. It is argued that there
   are reasons to doubt whether it does. The second part is concerned with
   whether a Rawlsian framework has the resources to rectify past racial
   injustice. It is argued that it has more resources to do this than Mills
   allows. This second part of the article centers on two Rawlsian ideas:
   ideal theory and the fair equality of opportunity (FEO) principle. It is
   argued that ideal theory is essential for the kind of rectificatory work
   that Mills wants nonideal theory to do, and that where there is a
   socioeconomic legacy of past injustice, it is hard to see how FEO could
   be implemented if it did no rectificatory work, a result which means
   that there is less need to turn to nonideal theory at all.},

Abstract = {The general elections of Spanish republican period confirm a novelty,
   the consolidation of Basque nationalism in rural areas. Among the
   reasons for this success is the appearance of the peasant association
   called Euzko Nekazari Bazkuna (ENB, Basque Peasants Federation) in 1933
   in Guipuzcoa. This article's aim is to analyze the relationship between
   ENB, the PNV and Solidaridad de Trabajadores Vascos, also extending the
   field of study to the province of Vizcaya, where in 1935 Euzko Nekazari
   Alkartasuna (Solidarity of Basque Peasants) was formed. It also seeks to
   emphasize the fact that this associative proposal only succeed when
   peasants decided to group by themselves.},

Abstract = {The introduction of a new real estate taxes in Italy in 2011 provides a
   natural experiment, which is useful to test for political budget cycles.
   The new real estate tax allowed discretion to local governments. This
   generates a random variation in the distance of municipalities from the
   following elections when they choose the level of the tax rate. We do
   find substantial evidence of political budget cycles, with
   municipalities choosing lower tax rates when close to elections. We
   observe this budget cycle for smaller municipalities where the tax was
   more likely to be the single most important issue for the local
   government. Cities close to elections with large deficits did not set
   lower rates and so did municipalities with a lower average value of
   properties. Finally, the political budget cycle is stronger in the
   South.},

Abstract = {This article traces the development of Italian eugenics and scientific
   racism from their origins in nineteenth-century positivist anthropology
   to the 1938 Manifesto of Racial Scientists. I follow the biographical
   trajectory of the Sicilian racial thinker Alfredo Niceforo (1876-1960),
   the last member of Cesare Lombroso's positivist school, a founding
   father of Italian eugenics and a prominent statistician throughout the
   fascist regime. I argue that the peculiarity of the Italian path to
   eugenics was its internal orientalism', caused by the poverty and
   perceived backwardness of the Italian South. Blending Niceforo's
   biography with his ideas, I chart the social and intellectual history of
   Italian scientific racism from the transformation of Lombroso's school
   to the fascist Aryanization' of Italians.},

Abstract = {In a large range of political and economic situations, the formation of
   coordinated groups is driven by two opposite forces: increasing returns
   to size on the one hand, the heterogeneity of preferences, which hampers
   coordination, on the other. An important question is whether competitive
   pressures, such as described by free mobility and free entry, lead to an
   efficient and stable organization of the society into possibly several
   self-sufficient groups. This paper discusses theoretical approaches to

Abstract = {Although the crisis surrounding the execution of Protestants by Catholic
   authorities in the Polish town of Thorn in 1724 is relatively well known
   among historians of early modern Europe - as indeed is the
   susceptibility of the eighteenth-century Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth
   to external interference and intervention - there has been no detailed,
   multi-angle analysis of the European reactions to this instance of
   alleged religious persecution. By analysing the diplomatic and publicity
   responses of various European powers, as well as the comments in the
   contemporary print media, a number of insights will be gained. By
   focusing on the arguments and language used, the article seeks to
   discern the normative attitudes of contemporary statesmen towards
   sovereignty, standards of good governance, enlightened' state practices,
   international treaty law, and the grounds and scope for the external
   protection of foreign subjects' rights. More broadly, this will enable a
   deeper understanding of the normative underpinning of the
   post-Westphalian states system by highlighting the previously
   underestimated role and capacity of intervention in states' internal
   affairs, stemming, at least in part, from a proto-humanitarian' impulse.
   By keeping a close watch on the broader context of European
   international relations, the relative importance of political and
   geo-strategic interests in such undertakings, and how these interacted
   with more ideological factors, will also be explored, as will the
   interrelationships between the public sphere and foreign policy.},

Abstract = {A state of the art regarding the issue in which some interpretative
   proposals will be presented. The role that the army has developed as a
   nation building agency has been largely referred to the experts of this
   area of knowledge. However, there is still a lack of research focused on
   this issue, especially on the 20th century. As far as our country,
   Spain, is concerned, this field of investigation has been limited to
   some researches which focused on the 19th century and on Miguel Primo de
   Rivera's dictatorship. This paper deals with the main features of the
   Spanish compulsory army service during the period of Franco's
   dictatorship, and tries attempts to analyse the role that this
   phenomenon played in the process of Spanish nation building, and in the
   creation of Spanish national identity: the definitive universality of
   the service, the combination between theoretical and practical training,
   Spanish history learned by recruits and the literacy lessons. Yet, not
   only is this the main purpose of the essay, since it also aims to depict
   the lack of specification in the theoretical teaching, the
   discrimination that the recruits suffered based on their geographical
   origin, and the influence of other conscripts with different national
   identities. Finally, we question some aspects of the conscription's
   nation-building capacity.},

Journal = {SOCIAL SCIENCE QUARTERLY},

Volume = {98},
Number = {2, SI},
Pages = {690-727},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Objective. Because of the increased attention Democrats and Republicans
   are paying to the Latino vote, both parties may find it necessary to
   change their platforms and rhetoric to appeal to Latino policy
   preferences. This research examines the impact of Americanization on
   Latino policy preferences. Methods. Using data from the 2006 Latino
   National Survey, we create a continuous scale that measures the extent
   to which Latinos have Americanized, that is, become incorporated into
   the U.S. mainstream. We use multivariate analyses to examine the effect
   of Americanization on a wide range of salient policy preferences.
   Results. Our research shows that across a wide array of issues, Latinos
   vary considerably among themselves in terms of their level of
   Americanization, even after accounting for a rich set of control
   variables commonly found to predict policy preferences. Our results also
   indicate that, regardless of levels of Americanization, Latinos approach
   unanimity in their support of an expanded socioeconomic safety net
   supported by the government. Conclusions. Our results indicate that
   Latino policy preferences are well to the left of the national
   mainstream and indeed include policies that are anathema to the
   Republican Party. The political implications of these preferences are
   that despite increased outreach, Republicans will find it difficult to
   woo Latino voters, and it will be challenging for Democrats to maintain
   or increase their Latino support.},

Abstract = {We analyse the evolution of the price of paintings in London auctions
   with a unique data set of over 200,000 sales in the period 1780-1840. We
   build a price index for the representative painting through hedonic
   regressions controlling for the characteristics of auctions and
   paintings and for the artists' fixed effects. The emergence of an
   efficient secondary art market was an important opportunity for
   portfolio diversification. Estimating a CAPM model for art investment
   suggests that British paintings could deliver a higher return compared
   to imported paintings and an attractive source of diversification
   relative to the contemporary stock market. This contributed to increase
   the demand for British art and, possibly, to promote the innovations of
   its Golden Age. While the representative painting of the British school
   was initially undervalued, new British painters reached foreign prices
   by the beginning of 1800s.},

   of the first women to officially serve in combat in the U.S. military.
   This article focuses on the role of gender in these women's experiences
   in the context of the masculine culture of the military. We explore how
   they used performance of masculinity and metaphors of family to fit into
   their combat units. We also deliberate on how sexual harassment was used
   against these women in ways that communicated that they were not fully
   accepted. Finally, we consider the tension between empowerment and
   disempowerment in these women's narratives of their military service.},

Abstract = {This study examines whether gender moderates the relationships between
   deployment and both organizational identification and pro-organizational
   behaviors. The broader context motivating this study is the U.S.
   military's 2016 rescission of the ground combat exclusion, accomplishing
   full gender integration in the armed forces. Structural equation
   modeling is used to test for gender moderation effects. Results reveal
   deployment frequency, but not current deployment, has small effects on
   several pro-organizational behaviors. Results also show that gender does
   not moderate the effects of deployment frequency on soldiers'
   perceptions of the organization or economic or social satisfaction.
   Gender does moderate the effects of deployment frequency on soldiers'
   identification with the army. Additionally, while gender was not found
   to moderate the relationship between combat deployments and overall
   pro-organizational behaviors among soldiers, it does moderate the effect
   of deployments on one pro-organizational item: sacrificing behavior.
   Implications are discussed with an eye toward full gender inclusion in
   the U.S. military.},

Abstract = {This article focuses on the potential of online participation to enable
   the cooperative development of norms by affected stakeholders,
   investigating whether such processes can produce norms of both high
   quality and legitimacy. To answer this question, we designed,
   implemented, and evaluated an online norm setting process that goes
   beyond the scope of those usually described in the literature. Taking as
   a case study a process to redraft the examination regulations for
   doctoral degrees at a science faculty of a German university, we show
   that such instances of online deliberation can integrate the diversity
   of opinions of all affected stakeholders. The result was a norm that
   implemented previously controversial external recommendations for
   doctoral dissertation procedures and that was met with high satisfaction
   from both those who participated as well as those who remained passive.
   While we believe that the university context in which this process was
   conducted is particularly promising for such efforts because of its
   organization, its members, and the issue that was at stake, we argue
   that similar conducive conditions exist, for example, for political
   parties. As such, the findings can be instructive for understanding the
   potential and limits of successful online participation in other

Abstract = {Trade has the potential to influence a wide range of political and
   social outcomes. Using the post-Soviet context, we examine how language
   policies-vital components for how minorities are treated with
   far-reaching economic consequences-are influenced by trade. We argue
   that while ethnic politics and colonial legacies are both important in
   shaping language laws, it is important to recognize that the Russian
   language remains a significant commercial lingua franca in the region.
   When economic exchanges between Russia and other post-Soviet republics
   are frequent, governments are more likely to adopt pro-Russian language
   laws as a practicality and to maintain favor with the Russian government
   and Russian-speaking businesses. Using an original dataset covering all
   Russian language-related laws in the former Soviet states from 1992 to
   2009, we find a significant and positive relationship between trade and
   pro-Russian language laws. These results are robust even when we (1)
   instrument for Russian import levels and (2) consider the Baltic effect,
   spillovers from cultural affinity, and the uniqueness of fuel exports.},

Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {This paper examines the role of globalization on public spending on
   education in Europe. With the implementation of the Bologna process, the
   changes taking place in the educational structure in Europe have
   highlighted the importance of public education expenditures. Taking into
   account the effects of trade, income, and sociodemographic factors, we
   study the impact of globalization on public education expenditure at
   preprimary, primary, secondary, and tertiary institutions using a panel
   data model for 25 EU countries for the 1998-2010 period. Our findings
   with different indices of globalization depict a positive effect on
   education financing. The use of legal and institutional variables, the
   inclusion of the crisis and euro dummies, and further control variables
   do not alter our main findings. The Bologna dummy variable is not found
   to have a significant effect on public education financing, indicating
   that the integration goals under this process have not translated into
   increasing levels of public expenditure for education.},

Abstract = {The so-called Rotterdam Act enables municipal governments in the
   Netherlands to bar poor households with no or limited residential
   history in the metropolitan area from moving into certain neighborhoods.
   Although evidently at odds with principles of equality enshrined in law,
   the Act has emerged as a standard part of the policy tool kit. This
   article seeks to explain how the Rotterdam Act came to pass. Asking this
   question sets us on the path of reconstructing how specific urban areas
   suffering from extraordinary problems were identified and how using
   exceptional measures to exclude specific groups were instituted. In a
   word, we are interested in the construction of exceptionality. We show
   that the construction of exceptional territories is based on the
   interplay of discretionary power and statistical calculation. We discuss
   the wider relevance of our analysis to the emerging field of critical
   data studies and for understanding the links between sovereignty,
   territory and statistics in constitutional democracies. (C) 2016

Abstract = {This chapter examines what we can learn from human rights documents and
   human duties declarations regarding the nature of the duties correlative
   to the human right to an adequate standard of living, and the duties to
   the community. Regarding the former duties, I find that such documents
   do not at all sufficiently clarify the nature of individual duties
   concerning global subsistence needs. These are, therefore, further
   clarified in Chap. 5.
   Regarding the duties to the community, by contrast, the study of the
   relevant human rights documents - particularly the travaux preparatoires
   of the Universal Declaration - will prove far more fruitful. We will
   find that duties to the community were considered an essential part of
   the Universal Declaration from the very beginning. The drafters'
   intention with Article 29 was to illustrate how individual rights
   function in a larger moral context, a context that next to rights also
   includes duties, public order and general welfare. Furthermore, it will
   become clear that the Universal Declaration rejects, by way of Article
   29, the view of the lone rights-bearer for whom the claims of the
   community are but so many burdens, and instead affirms the
   interdependence between the individual and the political community in
   which she finds herself.},

   generating pre-emptive and backlash mobilization, the movement is a
   spontaneous transformation of the staged Occupy Central campaign. Based

   rallied autonomous individuals from diverse backgrounds to occupy the
   physical spaces, thereby sustaining a self-mobilized, horizontal and
   resilient movement. Spontaneity, however, did not come out of nowhere.
   As an integral part of Hong Kong's bottom-up activism and ecology, this
   spontaneous episode encapsulates antecedent events diffusing stalwart
   actors, decentralized organization and transgressive repertories. This
   paper situates spontaneity in temporal, spatial and emotional contexts
   to understand the uncompromising claims and participatory practices of
   the spectacular occupation.},

Title = {The Shifting Geopolitics of Water in the Anthropocene},
Journal = {GEOPOLITICS},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {22},
Number = {2},
Pages = {332-359},
Abstract = {This forum responds to recent calls to hypothesize a geopolitics of the
   Anthropocene by examining how our notions of geopolitics of water may
   shift in the context of this new and, at times, divisive framework. The
   Anthropocene describes the geological epoch in which humans are the
   dominant actor in the global environmental system and has been a concept
   that is not without controversy. Taking the Anthropocene as an
   epistemological divergence where nature can no longer be viewed as
   separate from humanity, this forum asks how moving away from
   understanding hydraulic systems as essentially stable to understanding
   them as unstable and profoundly influenced by humans changes our
   understanding ofthe geopolitics of water. Collectively the contributions
   to this forum illustrate that formulating a water geopolitics of the
   Anthropocene requires 1) moving beyond a focus on fluvial flows to
   consider other forms of water; 2) broadening our understanding of the
   actors involved in water geopolitics; 3) examining new geopolitical
   tactics, particularly those grounded in law; 4) engaging critically with
   new and emerging forms of visualization and representation in the
   geopolitics of water, and; 5) examining how the notion of the
   Anthropocene has been used towards geopolitical ends and worked to elide
   different positionalities.},

Abstract = {This study finds out the use of Facebook by non-governmental
   organizations (NGOs) in Turkey to engage the social and political events
   of the country. NGOs are civil society organizations aiming at promoting
   participation of citizens in social and political issues. They are a
   part of democratic system and they have important role to struggle with
   corruptions and improve the legitimacy of political-legal organization
   in political system. NGOs work using social networks and promoting civic
   culture. Therefore, the use of new communication and interaction
   channels is necessary for NGOs to develop social networks and civic
   participation. Social media can be a new channel to promote social and
   political life. This study focuses on Facebook activities of 40 NGOs
   selected from eight different activity fields: politics, environment,
   woman rights, economy, emergency, education, human rights, and
   democracy. It uses content analysis method to understand the NGOs'
   activities in Facebook, in terms of social and political issues realized
   in the year of 2012.},

Abstract = {This paper identifies and critically examines the British Interplanetary
   Society's geopolitics of outer space from 1933 to 1965, presenting a
   critical astropolitics of outer space in contributing to the critique of
   neo-classical astropolitics. The paper identifies three distinct periods
   in the changing geopolitical outlook of the BIS, the first being the
   idealist internationalism of the early years of the Society, the second
   concerning narratives surrounding the formation of the International
   Astronautical Federation, and the third articulating Commonwealth
   collaborations in promoting British-led spaceflight research. The paper
   concludes by suggesting that the early idealism of internationalism in
   spaceflight research became diminished and contingent by the mid-1960s
   in the context of the changing geopolitical realities of the post-war
   period, and argues for increased academic engagement with geopolitical
   cultures of outer space.},

Title = {European anti-austerity and pro-democracy protests in the wake of the
   global financial crisis},
Journal = {SOCIAL MOVEMENT STUDIES},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {16},
Number = {1, SI},
Pages = {1-20},
Abstract = {European anti-austerity and pro-democracy movements form part of a
   global wave of protests following the global financial crisis. Despite
   continuity of actors and a double critique of global capitalism and
   democratic deficits from the previous Global Justice Movement, the
   centrality of the nation as target and focus of mobilization is a
   significant difference in this wave. The economic impact of the crisis
   and austerity policies is insufficient to explain variation in
   mobilization across countries hardest hit. In order to transform
   economic/material grievances into collective resistance, grievances need
   to be channelled against specific targets, and interpretive frameworks
   of meaning tied to a collective identity need to be mobilized. In
   Europe, anti-austerity protests were initiated by two sets of actors,
   Institutional Left and autonomous actors. Autonomous actors linked
   anti-austerity claims to interpretive system of meanings framed around
   the crisis of legitimacy of representative democracy; targeted primarily
   national political and economic oligarchies; and mobilized newcomers
   through an inclusive collective identity constructed around the ordinary
   citizen' as political subject. Democratic regeneration emerges as a
   significant demand, but is uneven in its resonance. It finds its
   clearest and most emblematic expression in the movements of the
   squares'. To the extent that the twin' crises (financial/democratic) are
   framed synergistically, they can be seen as counter-hegemonic, as they
   seek to rupture the consensus of the post-political'. The presence or
   absence of a strong pro-democracy narrative that connects actors across
   sectorial and organizational differences could help explain variation
   between cases. Transnational diffusion processes have been crucial but
   have not (yet)led to a transnational movement. Given the significant
   role of the Troika in the bail-outs, debt renegotiations and austerity
   policies of those countries hardest hit, the low visibility of Europe'
   in the mobilizations is surprising.},

Abstract = {This study examines the diversion of funds in M\& A deals, using over
   7,500 deals from core European countries for the period from 1997 to
   2013, sourced from the Zephyr database. Theoretical predictions suggest
   that in M\& A deals acquiring companies may use the target's assets as
   collateral to raise funds which is then diverted within the internal
   capital markets. Our results do not indicate an increase in leverage
   burdens of target firms. While we do not find evidence that assets are
   used as collateral to raise financing, our results point to indirect
   clues that funds are diverted away from the target company after the
   acquisition.},

Title = {Knowledge and practice mobilities in the process of policy-making: The
   case of UK national well-being statistics},
Journal = {POLITICAL GEOGRAPHY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {56},
Pages = {24-33},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {This paper examines the creation of the UK's `Measuring National
   Well-being' statistical programme, drawing on accounts given of the
   creation of the programme in official sources and primary interviews.
   Focusing on the microspaces of public consultations and advisory panels,
   it argues that the construction of this statistical object was
   simultaneously the construction of a knowledge-object for academics, and
   of a policy-object for policy-makers. As such, the statistic drew on and
   fed into domestic and international networks of statistical, academic
   and policy usage. The programme was shaped by the needs of these
   multiple networks, creating an object that they could hold in common but
   which did not necessarily fully satisfy any of them. Understanding the
   creation of objects in this way extends understandings around policy
   transfers and mobilities by showing how policy-objects arise through the
   transfer and mobility of things which are not policy. Simultaneously,
   what arises from policy mobility is not simply policy. Instead, what
   arises is multiple objects, which are the product of the intersection of
   travelling policy, knowledge and practice and they feed back into
   existing networks of knowledge, policy and practice. In doing so, the
   paper shows the inter-relations of knowledge and practice with policy,
   revealing them to be situated in place, contingent and compromised. It
   also contributes to the understanding of how official statistics, as a
   key technology of the state, are created. (C) 2016 The Author. Published

Abstract = {Through a content analysis on Chinese online dissidents' social media
   discourses, this study examines the impact of Internet censorship on
   Chinese dissidents' political discourse in two social media platforms:
   Weibo and Twitter. Data was collected during a time period when China's
   Internet censorship was tightened. Results revealed that Chinese online
   dissidents are more likely to post critical opinions and direct
   criticism towards the Chinese government on Twitter. In addition,
   dissidents on Twitter are more likely to engage in discussing with
   others, while Weibo dissidents tend to adopt linguistic skills more
   often to bypass censorship. No difference was found in terms of
   dissidents' civility and rationality across the two platforms.
   Implications and future research are discussed in detail.},

Abstract = {This chapter considers how the crisis of the 1970s was resolved. The
   Thatcherite reforms of the 1980s built upon the rhetoric of the 1970s,
   which-as the previous chapter demonstrates-blamed the trade unions for
   the wider economic problems. Kirkland outlines the changing relationship
   between labour and capital in the 1980s, focusing upon the ``Right to
   Buy{''} housing scheme, the privatisation programme and the Big Bang
   deregulation of 1986. Finally, this chapter demonstrates how such
   legislation had the effect of shifting the economic balance of power
   away from organised labour (and by extension trade unions) towards
   capital and the owners of capital.},

Booktitle = {MUSIC AS A PLATFORM FOR POLITICAL COMMUNICATION},
Series = {Advances in Media Entertainment and the Arts (AMEA) Book Series},
Year = {2017},
Pages = {238-256},
Abstract = {The popularity and consumption of dancehall music in Zimbabwe has grown
   exponentially over the past few years. However, despite its popularity,
   Zimdancehall has attracted controversy for promoting violence and vulgar
   behavior among other ills. This chapter casts aside society's moral
   judgements in order to investigate Zimdancehall music's role as an
   alternative public sphere. Using Fraser's alternative public sphere and
   Bakhtin's carnivalesque as its conceptual framework, and Norman
   Fairclough's approach to Critical Discourse Analysis as its methodology,
   the study analysed the discourses that underpin Zimdancehall music. The
   chapter argues that Zimdancehall music has become a counter public that
   provides marginalised youths with a platform to resist the dominant
   state-sponsored patriotic discourse. The music genre has opened a
   liberating alternative communicative space, outside of state control and
   ZANU-PF's patriotic discourse, where marginalised youths can
   symbolically invert their reality, protest as well as articulate their
   needs and aspirations freely.},

Abstract = {Recent literature has failed to reach a consensus on how best to model
   the defense - growth relationship. Although several attempts have been
   made to solve the problem by the theoretical comparison of models,
   empirical attempts at comparison have been largely restricted to the
   United States. Given the recent criticism of the Feder-Ram model, this
   article uses Iranian data to compare the performance of the Feder-Ram

   the augmented Solow model to explain economic growth can better account
   for the effects of an increase in defense expenditures.},

Volume = {22},
Number = {3},
Pages = {549-570},
Abstract = {Since the 2000s, Turkish policymakers and private sector interests have
   combined representations of Turkey as both Western and Eastern with a
   branding approach to identity in foreign policy, trade and investment
   promotion, and cultural sector activities. This article analyses how the
   commodification of its liminal identity as a dual identity allowed
   Turkey to invoke different aspects of its identity in the West and the
   East in ways that catered to both audiences and enabled the pursuit of
   different political and economic objectives. However, the article also
   notes how this branding strategy was limited by the national identity
   debates and dominant geopolitical discourses that continued to situate
   the West and East as mutually exclusive and binary opposite identity
   markers. Overall, the case of Turkey underscores the complex
   relationship between branding, identity, and discourse, which has thus
   far received scant attention in the literature.},

   Court Cases},
Journal = {POLITICAL COMMUNICATION},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {34},
Number = {4},
Pages = {571-589},
Abstract = {Media coverage of Supreme Court decisions is not well-understood, with
   studies typically focusing on features of decisions such as issue area
   and opinion authorship, and ignoring the political and legal importance
   of those decisions. Because the Court is both secretive and esoteric,
   and because it does not engage in traditional public relations
   activities, media must proxy importance by looking to available cues,
   such as interest group participation. Importantly, some indicators of
   importance are available before a decision is rendered; thus I examine
   both pre- and post-decision media coverage of cases. I show that
   expected legal and political impact drive media coverage of Court
   decisions, and that the decision-level features that prior studies have
   focused on are much less important in determining coverage than has been
   previously thought.},

Abstract = {The following article traces the tactical co-development as a process
   within mutual brokerage' between Anglo-American abolitionists. In the
   case of the Anglo-American abolitionist network of the early nineteenth
   century, the co-production of so-called world conventions' brought
   together an international network of abolitionist actors tied to one
   another through previous fora for discussion and debate. Mutual
   brokerage is perhaps most clearly seen within the example of female
   abolitionists during the nineteenth-century abolition campaigns. Women
   brought to the Anglo-American abolitionism the co-development of tactics
   through writings, planning, meetings, speeches, and petition writing.
   The article argues for a dialogical account regarding the spread of
   ideas and a reexamination of the role of brokerage within tactical
   diffusion. The writings and in-person debate about the ethical and moral
   concerns of the movement were channels through which ideas flowed.
   Instead of a one-directional flow with brokers as translators bringing
   new tactics from one locale to another, the channels were characterized
   by the absence of earlier originators' and later adopters' - traditional
   categories assigned to actors within the diffusion process. Rather, the
   article posits that the channels of transmission shaped the spread of
   ideas and subverted the traditional categories of transmitters' and
   receivers' found in more monological accounts of diffusion.},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Online discussions are the essence of many social platforms on the
   Internet. These platforms are receiving increasing interest because of
   their potential to become deliberative spaces. Many studies have
   proposed approaches to measure online deliberation and to evaluate which
   are the best design principles for deliberative online platforms.
   However, little research has focused on how deliberation in online
   platforms is affected by the arrival of events like the emergence of new
   topics or the modification of platform features. In this article we
   present a methodology to detect events that affect online deliberation
   in online discussions. Our results on Meneame, the most popular Spanish
   social news site, show that a change in how discussions are shown to the
   user, from a linear to a hierarchical conversation view, significantly
   enhanced deliberation. In particular we observe that this type of
   interface induced argumentative structures of online discussion.},

Abstract = {The success of a democratic election greatly depends on poll workers.
   However, our knowledge of citizen engagement in the organization of
   elections is still limited. This article studies the contextual factors
   that shape citizens' decisions to volunteer as poll workers. To
   accomplish this task, we take advantage of an original feature of the
   Mexican election system: the participation of randomly selected citizens
   in organizing and overseeing the operation of polling stations. We argue
   that the sociopolitical context in which elections take place greatly
   affects work at the polls. In particular, electoral competition and
   rising violence affect the organization of elections and citizen
   participation in this process. We find that competitive elections
   facilitate poll worker recruitment, especially in the early stages of
   the democratization process. However, at the same time, criminal
   violence depresses citizen participation in the organization of
   elections. This article contributes to the developing literature on
   electoral administration and the burgeoning literature on the political
   consequences of criminal activity.},

Abstract = {ObjectiveAnalyze NASA's efforts to sell both its mission and its
   successes from its origins in 1958 to the present.
   MethodsUse public opinion polling and qualitative sources to establish
   change over time.
   ResultsStudy suggests that NASA's public support was less important than
   most have previously asserted, and that the overall activities of NASA
   have been advanced by a small base of supporters, challenged by a small
   group of opponents, and sustained by a larger number of people who
   accept a status quo in space exploration.
   ConclusionA general public lack of support for expending many dollars on
   spaceflight has been a fundamental reality of NASA since its beginning.
   It is not changing, and probably not changeable, in the predictive
   future. Accordingly, NASA's quest for human spaceflight's popular appeal
   remains an elusive goal.},

Abstract = {Why do people watch televised election debates? This article considers
   the role of three factors highlighted in recent research on political
   news exposure: selective approach toward attitude-congruent information;
   selective avoidance of attitude-incongruent information; and information
   utility. I test the distinct effects of these three factors on viewing
   decisions by taking advantage of Austria's unique organization of
   televised debates as pairwise match-ups between the main party leaders.
   I find that selective approach dominates selective avoidance and that
   information utility increases exposure propensity. Beyond explaining
   debate viewership, these findings have general implications for
   understanding exposure to political information, particularly during
   campaigns.},

Title = {Living with others: fostering radical cosmopolitanism through
   citizenship politics in Berlin},
Journal = {ETHICS \& GLOBAL POLITICS},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {10},
Pages = {98-116},
Month = {NOV 1},
Abstract = {A growing refugee and migration crisis has imploded on European shores,
   immobilizing E.U. countries and fuelling a rise in far-right parties.
   Against this backdrop, this paper investigates the question of how to
   foster pluralism and a cosmopolitan desire for living with others who
   are newcomers. It does so by investigating community-based, citizen-led
   initiatives that open communities to newcomers, such as refugees and
   migrants, and foster cultural pluralism in ways that transform
   understandings of who is a citizen and belongs to the community. This
   study focuses on initiatives which seek to build solidarity and social
   relations with newcomers, but in ways that challenge citizen/non-citizen
   binaries based on one of our field research sites: Berlin, Germany. The
   paper brings insights from critical citizenship studies, exploring how
   citizenship is constituted through everyday practices, into dialogue
   with radical cosmopolitanism, particularly through Derrida's works on
   `unconditional hospitality'. This radical cosmopolitan literature
   theorizes possibilities for building relational ontologies between guest
   and host, citizen and newcomer, in ways that are not based on exclusion,
   but engagement with difference and which challenge antagonistic forms of
   self-other and citizen-non-citizen dichotomies. Illustrative examples
   based on community-led initiatives in Berlin demonstrate how this spirit
   of radical communitarianism is put into practice through everyday lived
   experience and demonstrate that it is possible to develop a cosmopolitan
   spirit through exchange and transformation of both the self and other by
   engaging with rather than seeking to eliminate difference in the aims of
   constituting a universal around which cosmopolitanism can be built.},

Abstract = {Recent evidence suggests that historical boundary precedents play a
   central role in the outbreak, character, and long-term consequences of
   territorial disputes. The institutional theory of borders holds promise
   in explaining why leaders find old borders to be attractive as new
   borders. However, the mechanisms that link historical precedents to
   territorial claims and their consequences are not fully specified in the
   extant literature. I argue that there are three key arguments that can
   explain why boundary precedents are associated with subsequent disputes:
   ease of justification, perpetual conflict over territories of particular
   value, and persistent coordination around old borders. I argue that the
   coordination mechanism is essential to understanding the connections
   between historical boundary precedents and territorial disputes.},

Abstract = {ObjectivesBuilding on work by Kam, Wilking, and Zechmeister, we argue
   that academic researchers ought to make greater use of campus employees
   for survey experiments. For applications where a representative sample
   is unattainable and student samples provide too little variation on key
   characteristics, staff members provide an inexpensive alternative that
   offers greater statistical leverage and the ability to detect
   conditional treatment effects
   MethodsUsing an e-mail survey experiment conducted on employees at a
   large public university, we explore how two modest incentives for
   participation affect the quantity and quality of responses.
   ResultsWhile overall differences among conditions are modest, a cash
   lottery generates somewhat higher response rates with little effect on
   sociodemographic skew or level of satisficing. The condition offering a
   charitable contribution fared worse on both counts.
   ConclusionUniversity employees provide a convenient, heterogeneous, and
   inexpensive population for experimental studies.},

Abstract = {This empirical study discusses both the incentive and redistributive
   effects of nonlinear tariffs on the drinking water of developed
   countries. Using an original panel database based on a natural
   experience with drinking water in France, we econometrically explore the
   impact of tariffs changes on consumption (linear versus nonlinear). We
   demonstrate that this measure reduces global consumption. However, small
   consumers (<75 m(3)) benefit from the new tariff program and increase
   their consumption, whereas the consumption of the others (>75 m(3))
   decreases. Public policy implications of such tariffs on drinking water
   may lead to a discussion on the design of these tariffs and the quality
   of the information given on water consumption.},

Title = {Defining the community of interest as thematic and cognitive regions},
Journal = {POLITICAL GEOGRAPHY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {61},
Pages = {31-45},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {When deciding where to draw the boundaries for electoral districts,
   officials often strive to ensure that communities of interest are not
   split up but kept wholly within those boundaries. But what constitutes a
   community of interest is vague, with legal and academic sources
   describing either a thematic region with shared demographic and land-use
   traits, or a cognitive region that is meaningful to people and commonly
   agreed upon. This study, conducted in the city of Santa Barbara,
   California, seeks to identify communities of interest at the sub-city
   level as both thematic regions by clustering Census tracts and land
   parcels according to classes of relevant variables and cognitive regions
   by surveying residents about the size and locational extent of their
   community and finding areas of agreement. We then assess the degree to
   which the two types of regions overlap as a way to evaluate how well the
   two meanings correspond. We also examine the amount of overlap between
   the two sets of regions and the city council electoral districts that
   were recently created in Santa Barbara. Our study finds that the two
   types of regions correspond relatively well to each other in this test
   city, but that the electoral districts correspond more to the thematic
   regions, understandable given that the district creation made no attempt
   to survey residents about their beliefs. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {ObjectiveThis study examines the reasons why a majority of Democrats
   support restrictive voter identification (ID) laws, in spite of such
   laws clashing with stereotypical Democratic Party interests.
   MethodsRacial, ethnic, and class demographic data from the 2006 to 2008
   American Community Survey of the U.S. Census are merged with the 2008
   Cooperative Congressional Election Study. Multilevel models with mixed
   effects are used to predict support for photo ID laws.
   ResultsPhoto ID support is polarized across political sophistication
   among Democrats in congressional districts with a higher proportion of
   foreign-born residents as well as with higher foreign-born population
   growth. In contrast, the increasing presence of foreign-born residents
   further solidifies support among Republicans, regardless of
   sophistication. Further analysis reveals that contextual effects of the
   foreign-born population specifically affect white partisans and also
   polarize attitudes across social class.
   ConclusionsThe results suggest that support for restrictive voter ID
   laws is highest among Republicans and disengaged Democrats, particularly
   in racially and ethnically diverse areas.},

Abstract = {In campaigns, candidates often avoid taking positions on issues,
   concealing the policy preferences that would guide them if elected. This
   paper describes a novel explanation for ambiguity in political
   campaigns. It develops a model of candidate competition in which
   policy-motivated candidates can choose whether or not to announce their
   policy preferences to voters. It applies Eyster and Rabin's
   (Econometrica 73(5):1623-1672, 2005) concept of cursed equilibrium,
   which allows for varying degrees of understanding of the connection
   between type (policy preference) and strategy (whether to announce). If
   voters updated according to Bayes' rule, they would understand that
   candidates who do not announce positions are strategically concealing an
   unpopular policy preference. In equilibrium, only the most extreme
   candidates, those located furthest from the median voter's position,
   would choose to take no position. However, if voters do not sufficiently
   appreciate the informational content of a non-announcement, unraveling
   will not occur and both extremists and more moderate candidates will not
   announce positions.},

Abstract = {Decades of polling data and recent research have demonstrated the
   magnitude of anti-atheist prejudice in the United States and its
   relationship to perceptions of atheists as immoral and untrustworthy.
   Across three studies, I examine the malleability of bias against
   atheists in the context of election politics. Informational
   manipulations of an atheist candidate's stated values (Study 1) and
   popularity (Study 2) improve participants' perceptions of the morality
   and trustworthiness of and likelihood of voting for that atheist
   candidate, but religiously affiliated participants still prefer a
   similarly situated Christian candidate. Study 3 shows that participants
   are more likely to vote for an atheist when the opposing candidate was
   described as a theocrat. Implications of this research for ameliorating
   the under-representation of non-religious individuals in government are
   discussed.},

Abstract = {Objective. A comprehensive study on the development of political trust
   is absent. Studies on the socialization effect of the media generally
   neglect the influence of the media system. This study aims to fill this
   gap. Methods. Using a within-country comparison of two media systems, I
   estimate the influence of different socialization agents on the
   development of political trust through hierarchical models of repeated
   measurements on a representative panel of Belgian adolescents (BPPS
   2006-2011, n = 3,025). Results. News consumption and a public service
   broadcasting preference foster political trust within diverse media
   systems. The socioeconomic status and level of political discussion in
   the family, an open classroom climate, and classroom instruction about
   politics also promote political trust. Conclusions. Television, the
   family, and the school are all equally important agents in the
   development of political trust. It is critical to take the nature of the
   media system into account when studying how the media affect political
   trust.},

   units on candidacy},

Abstract = {Following current debates on the study of the quality of local
   government, this article focuses on the effects of settlement unit size
   and organizational type on candidacy in local elections within the Czech
   Republic. Municipal size and institutional design are traditionally seen
   as important factors influencing political participation at the local
   level. However, citizens in differently defined settlement units
   included in a municipality are disadvantaged differently by these
   factors and thus, de-motivated to participate in politics. The unit of
   analysis within the article is a settlement unit within a municipality.
   The article uses Poisson regression to estimate the effect of the
   absolute and relative size of the settlement unit and different
   organizational types of settlement unit on the relative number of
   candidates in the unit. The analysis is based on data from 6,124 Czech
   municipalities over three sets of elections. The results of the analysis
   show that increasing absolute size and decreasing relative size of
   settlement unit have negative effects on the number of candidates in
   units. Also the institutionally disadvantaged units (defined by the
   location of the municipal office within the settlement unit) produce
   smaller number of candidates. The results show the importance of
   structural factors on the traditionally neglected type of political
   participation (candidacy) within this field. This allows the formulation
   of recommendations for local government reforms, not only in the Czech
   Republic, but also for amalgamated municipal systems. (C) 2017 Elsevier

Title = {Italian Electoral Law: A Story of an Impossible Transition?},
Journal = {ELECTION LAW JOURNAL},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {16},
Number = {2},
Pages = {272-279},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {This study identifies three drivers of the break in the majoritarian
   path to which electoral reforms seemed to be leading the Italian
   political system since 1993. The first is the unconventional political
   landscape, with the rise of the Five Star Movement and significant
   fragmentation of parties. The second is the original sin of the
   Italicum, designed under the assumption that the Senate reform would be
   successful. The third driver is the groundbreaking intervention of the
   judiciary, called repeatedly into question in order to assess the
   constitutionality of the Electoral Law in a context characterized by the
   progressive decline of Italian politics. The article will focus on
   drivers two and three and will proceed as follows. The first section
   will draw a general picture of the changes that have occurred in Italian
   electoral law after 1993, underlying the common aim shared by all recent
   electoral law interventions: to foster the affirmation and consolidation
   of a bipolar pattern. The second section will focus on the landmark
   decision of the Italian Constitutional Court (ICC), Decision No. 1/2014,
   which struck down Law No. 270 of December 21, 2005 (Electoral law for
   the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate of the Republic). This decision
   paved the way for judicial intervention in a sphere typically left to
   the mediation of different political interests and gave the legislature
   the way forward which led to the Italicum. The third section will deal
   with the Italicum, addressing its genesis, its primary features, and the
   declaration of unconstitutionality by ICC Decision No. 35/2017. Finally,
   the fourth section will address the currently open issues and the need
   for a legislative intervention which could determine whether the Italian
   political system will follow the majoritarian trend in the name of
   government stability, or if it will be hostage to both the political
   conflicts and the institutional flaws of super-perfect bicameralism.},

Title = {The diffusion of international norms of banknote iconography: A case
   study of the New Taiwan Dollar},
Journal = {POLITICAL GEOGRAPHY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {57},
Pages = {49-59},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {There has been a dramatic rise in progressive values imagery on the
   banknotes of industrialized states over the past few decades. We see
   this trend as an instance of international norm diffusion and point to
   two causal mechanisms that have facilitated it: mimesis and
   professionalism. We hypothesize that national politicians are more
   subject to the mimetic mechanism, whereas central bank bureaucrats are
   more subject to the professionalism mechanism. We then probe the value
   of our theoretical contentions with a case study of the banknotes of the
   Republic of China, i.e. Taiwan. Using qualitative and quantitative
   content analysis, we show the convergence of the New Taiwan Dollar with
   advanced country norms of progressive banknote iconography around the
   year 2000. Then, using historical process -tracing analysis, we show
   that this convergence was engineered by national politicians who wanted
   banknote reform for mimetic and domestic political reasons, and central
   bank bureaucrats who wanted banknote reform for professional reasons. In
   short, the changes to these important symbols of national identity were
   reflections of different state actors' thirst for international
   belonging. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Credit Supply Constraint of Solvent Open Economy within Implementation
   of Basel III Capital Requirements},
Journal = {POLITICKA EKONOMIE},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {65},
Number = {2},
Pages = {141-160},
Abstract = {The article deals with constraint of credit supply consistent with
   external solvency of economy and solvency of banking sector under
   negative international investment position, foreign ownership of banking
   sector and growing bank's capital and stable funding requirements. The
   target is to define main parameters of sustainable supply of funding of
   external capital providers and to test the relationships among
   determinants of external solvency, foreign sources of funding the
   economy and banking sector and credit aggregates in the Czech Republic
   using unrestricted ARDL ECM model. The results show growing inflow of
   debt funding motivated by export led growth, the Czech FDI investments
   and lack of euro liquidity due to CNB foreign exchange interventions.
   The debt provided by foreign parent companies could overcome a
   constraint of home banking sector's credit supply. Growing export causes
   investments to production capacity financed by equity of foreign
   holders. The cost of negative NFA is driven by profitability of
   exporters which is positively correlated with GDP growth. The bank's
   capital incl. reinvested profits do not reflect a credit cycle due to
   excess of capital in the Czech banking sector.},

Pages = {887-910},
Abstract = {Through the use of survey data from the West Bank, this paper explores
   the effects of the Apartheid/Separation Wall in the occupied territory
   of the West Bank on Palestinian society. How has the Wall separated a
   population from their loved ones, their orchards and crops, homes, and
   overall livelihood? How have these relationships transformed? Place and
   space have special meanings in Palestinian experience and consciousness,
   and yet Palestinians remain vulnerable to punishment through control of
   access to spaces and places.The inability to reach one's home or land
   has serious ramifications on the psyche of individuals and communities.
   Not only do physical barriers hinder social interactions, but they also
   impact society in numerous ways. The effects on Palestinian society are
   largely invisible and have long-term and far-reaching consequences.
   These consequences run deeper than the physical barriers that have
   created them.Social continuity has repeatedly been disrupted due to the
   geopolitical transformation of land control and roads network, which
   favours one group (Israeli Jews) over another (Palestinian
   ArabsChristian and Muslim). The policies of separation, through the
   wall, checkpoints, and the permit regime, have actually separated
   Palestinians from other Palestinians, and not Palestinians from
   Israelis.},

Abstract = {This chapter investigates how music acts performed at China Central
   Television's (CCTV) annual variety show, Chunwan, are used as an
   ideological package for political communications in China. The authors
   argue that the Communist Party of China uses songs as the medium for the
   grand narrative of a shared identity. Chunwan, this televised event,
   helps construct an imagined community of mainlanders of different social
   backgrounds, Chinese from Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan, and overseas
   Chinese. Music, disseminated via China's national TV broadcaster, serves
   as an ideological state apparatus that consolidates the legitimacy of
   the Party.},

Abstract = {The Concert for Bangladesh occurred on August 1, 1971, forever changing
   the dynamic between popular music, politics, and humanitarian aid. The
   concert was organized by former Beatle George Harrison, reflecting New
   Left political leanings. He was inspired to put on the concert by
   Bengali Ravi Shankar, who sought aid for victims of war and severe
   weather in East Pakistan, soon to become Bangladesh. The concert raised
   consciousness among the counterculture movement and mixed with world
   politics as the War of Liberation raged in the south Asia country on the
   Indian subcontinent.},

Volume = {3},

Abstract = {The Communist era and its legacy became an important part of Czech
   (political) culture and identity after 1989. This phenomenon is
   especially powerful in relation to the meaning making of the communist
   era after 1989 and the way Czechs are getting over it. Labels such as
   communist, Bolshevik, normalization, nationalization of property and
   many others related to the communist era became powerful vehicles for
   stigmatization and creating a public enemy in almost any sphere, be it
   political, show business, or public. What makes it especially powerful
   is that the cultural and historical legacies (understood as deliberately
   propagated representations of selected fragments of the group's past),
   when expressed explicitly, offer models of or for behaviour and
   thinking. In other words, public memory is often one of the constitutive
   factors of contentious and politically motivated mobilizations
   undertaken by different actors like political parties, social movements
   or individual agents when seeking public support or legitimacy, or just
   aiming to achieve their goals. In post-communist countries these actors
   often strive to mobilize participants, supporters or even opponents
   using legacies of the Communist past. In this text we seek to uncover
   how various situations, events or people are constructed as public
   enemies by using the communist legacy. In particular, we ask the
   following questions: How is anti-communist framing constructed and how
   does anti-communist framing resonate with popular images and
   understanding of Communism, the Communist era in the Czech Republic and
   related matters? We analyse anti-communist framing (i.e. directly or
   indirectly identify the situation, adversaries, institutions or
   activities with the Communist regime) and via constructing metaphors
   provide readers with deep understanding of how particular Communist
   legacies in specific contexts create public enemies who lose sympathy
   and support from the public.},

Abstract = {The present study examines the influence of military identity on
   military performance, and the potential of military identity to predict
   military performance beyond military ethos, organizational commitment,
   and hardiness in Norwegian petty officer students. Dependent variables
   were (1) overall performance, (2) petty officer potential, and (3)
   leader performance. Hierarchical regression analyses showed that (1)
   overall performance was predicted by organizational commitment,
   hardiness, and military identity (professionalism); (2) petty officer
   potential was predicted by organizational commitment and hardiness; and
   (3) leader performance was predicted by hardiness. Military identity
   (professionalism) was thus found to explain overall military performance
   among Norwegian petty officer students. Additionally, results confirmed
   the predictive value of hardiness on military performance. This is the
   first study to examine the unique influence of military identity on
   military performance in the Norwegian armed forces.},

Abstract = {EU enlargement policy is organized through a series of practices that
   regulate its relations with enlargement countries, including Albania, a
   candidate for EU membership. The aim of this contribution is modest in
   that it does not seek to engage in a discussion about the actual impact
   of EU conditionality. Instead, it takes the well-known limitations of
   external interference as given, and seeks to demonstrate the importance
   of an often-neglected institution in the process: subcommittees. These
   bodies bring together EU and Albanian officials and comprise a major
   part of the EU's engagement with enlargement countries. Imposing
   conditionality through sub-committee meetings, including in the field of
   human rights, is a practice that occupies most of the time of the
   European Union services working at the offices that maintain relations
   with Albania. However, this instrument has received scant attention in
   the literature.},

Abstract = {In this chapter, the author aims to empirically examine the effect of
   social media use and e-government adoption on citizens' perceived
   corruption. It is hypothesized that the use of social media by citizens
   is positively related to their perceptions of corruption, while the use
   of government websites is negatively related to perceived corruption.
   The author draws on a recent national telephone survey of citizens in 36
   major cities in China to empirically test the above hypotheses. The
   multilevel model estimates suggest that social media use is
   insignificantly related to corruption perceptions, but government
   website use is negatively associated with perceived corruptions. The
   findings of this study help understand the anti-corruption effects of
   social media and e-government, and also generate helpful implications
   for other countries and regions in utilizing digital applications for
   anti-corruption purposes.},

Pages = {301-315},
Abstract = {Municipalities in the Slovakia as part of public sector have to finance
   their needs in accord of legally set municipal budgeting principles. The
   general basic rule mentions that current needs have to be financed from
   current budget. Capital or investment expenditure can be financed by
   returnable resources. Using returnable finance resources induces the
   indebtedness. Although the state level of government is not responsible
   for the indebtedness incurred on municipal level, usually limits the
   municipal indebtedness by law and monitors the total municipal debt and
   debt service. The paper deals with municipal indebtedness in the SR,
   where total municipal debt is involved to econometric investigation in
   aim to identify its determinants. Estimated GMM dynamic panel model
   includes time effects and reveals significant positive influence of
   capital revenues, debt service and lagged debt. Significant is negative
   impact of unemployment rate and financial autonomy. Time effects are
   significant in period of 2003-2004 (extensive indebtedness of certain
   cities), 2008-2010 (effects of public sector reform and previous
   economic expansion) 2011(delayed impact of financial crisis) and
   2012-2014 (economic recovery).},

   EUR/CZK Exchange Rate},
Journal = {POLITICKA EKONOMIE},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {65},
Number = {6},
Pages = {649-668},
Abstract = {The traditional view of international economics is that exchange rate is
   a leading factor which can strongly affect a country's foreign trade.
   However, the production fragmentation widespread around the world due to
   the recent globalization may weaken the role of exchange rate on
   international trade. As the Czech economy is a very open one, a
   quantitative knowledge of the impact of exchange rate on export is a
   valuable information for all actors in the economy. In our contribution,
   we examine effect of the exchange rate of the Czech crown on domestic
   export in three macroeconomic models in both short and long run. The
   first one is a Keynesian model representing the demand for export in the
   form of marginal propensities. The second one is a VAR model in
   elasticities of the reduced form. The last one is a structural model
   resulting from the findings from the previous one. To estimate their
   parameters, we use quarterly data from 2000 Q1 to 2016 Q1. In all three
   cases we identify statistically significant impact of exchange rate on
   export in short-run models.},

Abstract = {This paper examines policies of Abenomics and explains their
   ineffectiveness through historical comparisons. In conclusion, Abenomics
   raises serious concerns about Japanese economy. It offsets the effects
   of its aggressive monetary expansion by increasing consumption taxes. It
   has tilted the distribution of income in favor of financial speculation,
   but the returns have not benefitted the nonfinancial economy. It has
   enriched investors, corporate profits, and exporters but not Japan's
   workers, households, and general economy. It ignores the structural
   problems. Specifically, its deregulation of labor markets reduced
   household income by raising the number of nonregular workers. Higher
   wages in general and providing more workers with stable, well-paid
   employment are among necessary reforms. It will be difficult to achieve
   a sustainable economic recovery in Japan without proceeding with these
   types of policy changes.},

Journal = {SOCIAL MOVEMENT STUDIES},

Volume = {16},
Number = {5},
Pages = {610-622},
Abstract = {What happens when a prime minister frames a momentous protest as a
   foreign conspiracy? The Turkish government's reaction to the Gezi Park
   protests, a reaction centred on a conspiracy theory about an `interest
   rate lobby,' provides a unique case to explore the impacts of conspiracy
   theories about big-scale protests. Relying on quantitative and
   qualitative content analysis of online users' responses to the
   government's conspiracy theories, I discuss the socio-political
   significance of this conspiratorial rhetoric. The findings demonstrate
   that (1) the previous political views of online users predict their
   responses to conspiracy theories, and (2) the users' comments were
   centred on their perceptions of the government. These show that people
   tend to interpret the conspiracy theories in line with their political
   values and interests, and, accordingly, that the government's
   conspiratorial frames concerning the protests seem to have contributed
   to the political fragmentation by enhancing the division between the
   Justice and Progress Party (AKP) supporters and opponents.},

Journal = {HISTORIA Y POLITICA},

Number = {37},

Month = {JAN-JUN},
Abstract = {Of all the journals published by the Seccion Femenina the monthly
   Teresa, Revista para Todas las Mujeres, was the most read and the one
   published for the longest period. It functioned as the official
   mouthpiece of falangist women between the years 1954-1977, a period in
   the life of the Franco dictatorship marked by profound political,
   economic and social changes. The articles, interviews and images
   published in Teresa constitute a conscious effort to fashion the
   identity of young, urban middle class women. This effort was part of a
   large project aimed at creating an audience capable of identifying with
   the messages and images of falangist womanhood. The article analyses the
   relationship between gender and class in the Seccion Femenina's
   discourse and practices as a conservative women's organization during
   the final years of the dictatorship and the transition to democracy. Our
   hypothesis is that during the second half of the 1960s gender issues
   were prioritized differently within the political agenda of right - wing
   women's organizations. This was achieved partly through the manipulation
   of the concept of class and of class differences. The article analyses
   these changes by focusing on the ways in which the writers in Teresa
   described and defined the role of women within two spaces: the space of
   the home and of family life and the space of work and of professional
   life.},

Abstract = {In recent years, the public sphere, which represents a realm in civil
   society where people can debate and discuss a range of issues and common
   concerns important to them, has become a key area for research in the
   humanities and social sciences. Arguably, however, Marxist theory has
   yet to advance a theoretical account of the most abstract and simple
   ideological properties of the capitalist public sphere as these appear
   under universal commodity relationships. The paper therefore tentatively
   seeks to develop such an account. Specifically, the paper theoretically
   derives a peculiar public sphere under capitalism, which is mediated
   between at least two commodity owners who also possess distinctive
   personalities driven by desires to own commodities. The paper then
   explains in more detail how the social form of this public sphere
   develops through other elements of commodity relations and their
   contradictions.},

Abstract = {If moments of historical rupture create spaces for social change, what
   emerges to fill those gaps? This article approaches this question by
   exploring the creation of the ``domestic{''} in 17th century Europe and
   Asia following the decline of the Spanish Habsburgs in the West and the
   Ming Dynasty in the East. Two events will serve as lenses through which
   that process will be explored. The first case centers on arguments for
   the legitimacy of the 1603 Dutch seizure of a Portuguese carrack in what
   would serve as the basis for Hugo Grotius's defense of the free seas.
   The second debate focuses on the appropriate mourning ritual following
   the 1659 death of King Hyojong, the 17th ruler in Korea's Choson
   dynasty. I argue that, in the process of responding to the crises they
   faced in their environments, social elites in both cases defined and
   articulated a conception of themselves as sovereign societies, creating
   a political space and corporate identity distinct from the extant
   institutional apparatus of the state and cultural framework of the
   nation.},

Abstract = {ObjectiveThis article examines the distinct processes of accommodation
   to immigrants in two similar small towns in Iowa. Ethnic conflict and
   contact theories predict that the processes would be similar in these
   towns, but their experiences demonstrate otherwise.
   MethodsThe study traces the histories of these towns and uses surveys,
   focus groups, and interviews to detail the process of accommodation in
   these communities.
   ResultsIn both towns, white/Anglo residents came to accommodate their
   new neighbors and accept immigrants as full members of their
   communities, but the processes were unique in each place. In one
   community, earlier exposure to a small group of Laotian refugees gave
   residents and officials valuable experience with diversity. Further,
   this town was pushed toward acceptance when an outside group spread
   falsehoods.
   ConclusionsThis study demonstrates that adjusting to ethnic diversity is
   a long-term process that is unique to a community's experience with
   diversity.},

Abstract = {ObjectiveTo assess whether charter-competition-induced changes in
   traditional school district policiesin this case outreach programscan
   slow subsequent charter growth.
   MethodsUsing Arizona data in a regression analysis, the impact of
   district outreach intensity on charter growth from 1997 to 2000when
   these marketing activities were probably modified in response to prior
   (1994-1997) charter entryis determined. This impact is then compared to
   the effect of outreach intensity on initial charter growth for
   1994-1997, when competition-induced changes in outreach activities were
   less likely to have been implemented.
   ResultsHigh district outreach intensity did not influence charter
   expansion during 1994-1997, but did slow this growth during 1997-2000.
   ConclusionTraditional school districts are capable of slowing charter
   growth via competition-induced changes in outreach activities, but the
   effect occurs with a lag. The analysis suggests that charter entry also
   generates responses from private schools that slow charter growth.},

Abstract = {In the early 2000s, the Canary Islands emerged as the main gateway for
   unwanted sea migrants from Senegal into Spain. In this paper, I draw
   from a year of multi-sited ethnographic work to discuss the relationship
   between state actions to secure the border against these migrants, on
   the one hand; and smugglers and migrants' efforts to subvert those
   actions, on the other. My argument is that the relationship between the
   two is mutually constitutive: anti-immigration policy is a reaction to
   the actions of unwanted migrants, and unwanted migrants adapt to state
   efforts to seal the border against unwanted migration by finding and
   exploiting spaces of opportunity in the border. In the context of sea
   migration from Senegal to the Canary Islands, 2005 marks a major shift
   in this relationship. That year the European Union adopted a new
   framework for migration control (the Global Approach to Migration and
   Mobility), Frontex became operational, and Spain and Senegal deepened
   their cooperation to stop unwanted Europe-bound sea migration. This
   forced unwanted migrants to find creative ways to enter EU territory. I
   argue that combining the institutional and migrant perspectives allows
   us to explore the decentering of the state in the contemporary
   anti-immigration border regime, the emerging spatialities of the
   contemporary border, and understand the migrant's journey. This
   perspective also illuminates the messiness, violence, and multiplicity
   of interests involved in the bordering of Europe. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {We use preference data from the 2015 parliament election in the Austrian
   federal state of Styria to analyze different voting rules. An exit poll
   right after the election collected data on ordinal and cardinal
   preferences from approximately 1000 actual voters. Our analysis is
   threefold. First, we determine the hypothetical social outcomes under
   different voting rules; second, we investigate the stability of the
   outcomes under those rules. Finally, we provide a categorization of
   different types of parties and analyze the impact of certain voting
   rules (Plurality Rule, Plurality Run Off, Hare System, Condorcet Method,
   Approval Voting, Borda Rule, Evaluative Voting, and Majority Judgment)
   on the performances of parties in those scenarios.},

Abstract = {This article analyzes announcement effects of the new statutory minimum
   wage on employment expectations and uncertainties in Germany. Using a
   difference-in-differences approach applied to the IAB Establishment
   Panel, employers affected by the minimum wage show an increased
   employment uncertainty and a 0.9\% points drop in their expected
   employment growth. Using the same identification strategy with data from
   2015, the treatment effect on actual employment growth of affected
   employers matches the employers' expectation. Hence, an analysis of
   employer expectations seems to be promising to detect employment effects
   of policy changes before they come into force.},

Abstract = {The construction of a large dam is often a contested and controversial
   matter. Delicate aspects related to the dam construction business such
   as the resettlement of peoples, environmental impact and financial
   costs, can trigger popular discontent and hinder the realisation of a
   particular project. By advancing the notion of the hydropolis, a
   reinterpretation of Hannah Arendt (1958) definition of the polis, this
   paper will explore how ruling elites can manipulate the public opinion
   to politically construct a large dam as a foreign policy matter. This,
   it will be argued, serves to conceal the negative consequences of a dam
   so that issues related to its social and environmental impact are
   removed from the national political debate. Specifically, the case of
   the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD) in Ethiopia will be used to
   illustrate how a large dam can become a geopolitical object grounded on
   the friend/enemy distinction, in the context of the longstanding
   geopolitical tensions in the Nile River Basin. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {Objective. Studies show that public service broadcasters narrow
   knowledge gaps between politically interested and disinterested because
   such contexts encourage incidental learning. This reasoning, however,
   fails to explain why gendered knowledge differences persist in
   environments that equalize learning. Using stereotype threat theory, I
   argue that news content emits symbolic gender cues that encourage or
   discourage women to become politically informed. Methods. Employing
   European Election Study 2009 voter data (N = 27,000), and multilingual
   news content analyses from 27 E.U. member states, I test whether more
   egalitarian representation of women as newsmakers correlates with
   narrower gaps between men and women. Results. Aggregate and multilevel
   models show that greater representation of women as newsmakers
   correlates with smaller gaps in news exposure and political knowledge.
   Analyses also consider competing explanations such as women's electoral
   representation, education, labor force participation, and knowledge item
   guessing rates. Conclusion. Findings support the theoretical
   expectations regarding symbolic cues and knowledge gaps.},

Title = {The refugee camp as a space of multiple ambiguities and subjectivities},
Journal = {POLITICAL GEOGRAPHY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {60},
Pages = {110-120},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Analyses of refugee camps have criticised Agamben's conceptualisation of
   exception, understood as the juridical production of `bare life' by the
   sovereign. They have emphasised the multiplicity of actors and
   exclusionary dynamics involved in the production of exception, as well
   as the politicisation of space. This scholarship has however stayed
   framed around an `exclusionary paradigm'. This article proposes a
   complementary way to move beyond Agamben's analysis of the camp by
   reconsidering the idea of a `zone of indistinction' between exclusion
   and inclusion. It refers to Palestinian refugee camps in Jordan, where
   many dwellers have a dual status of `refugee-citizen'. It analyses how
   the subject and citizenship are ambiguously constructed as
   simultaneously excluded and included and not solely included through an
   exclusion. To explore these complex spatial dynamics of exclusion and
   inclusion, the analysis addresses the exercise of three forms of power
   sovereignty, discipline and government by focusing on the materiality of
   the camp and the practices of authorities managing space. These powers
   are ambiguously contributing to the inclusion of the camp and its
   dwellers in the territory of the Jordanian state, as well as in the
   neoliberal city of Amman, while maintaining the character of the camp as
   an excluded humanitarian and temporary space. Through this process, camp
   dwellers are recast not only as assisted subjects and beneficiaries, but
   also as autonomous and productive subjects, as well as entrepreneurs and
   consumers. This article therefore argues that the camp needs to be
   re-considered as a space of multiple ambiguities and subjectivities
   aimed at creating a differentiation in the city. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {This paper studies the interaction between capital income taxation and a
   means-tested age pension. Our results document that the existence of a
   social insurance program financed from general revenue puts an upward
   pressure on the optimal tax rate. We also show that there is a negative
   relation between taper (benefit-reduction) and optimal capital income
   tax rates. The potential welfare gain from optimizing capital taxation
   in the presence of a universal retirement transfer system is relatively
   higher. However, when the transfer is substantially means tested, the
   gain is lower, because the means test effectively operates as a tax on
   retirement capital.},

Abstract = {It is well established that discussion networks have meaningful
   consequences for a variety of sociopolitical attitudes and behavior. In
   this project, we explore how social structure shapes reactions to
   disaster; in particular, the 2010 BP oil spill. We address the questions
   of how networks are relied upon following community-wide disaster, and
   to what extent these networks mirror social structures in other domains.
   To examine these questions, we analyze data that experimentally vary the
   commonly employed discussion ``name-generator{''} questions to see if
   oil spill discussants are fundamentally different from important matters
   discussants. Relative to ``important matters{''} discussants, we find
   strong support for a specialist model in response to disaster; oil spill
   discussants tend to be less intimate, more knowledgeable, more active,
   and more talkative about the oil spill. Ultimately, this suggests a
   contextual basis for the formation of and reliance on discussion
   networks.},

Abstract = {This paper investigates the organizational structure of the Hells Angels
   Motorcycle Club, one of the largest and best known North American
   motorcycle gangs. Within the first few decades since their
   establishment, the Angels developed a hierarchical organizational form,
   which allowed them to overcome internal conflict and exploit the gains
   from their involvement in criminal activities. This organizational form,
   I argue, played a central role in the rapid success of the Angels in the
   North American (and international) criminal landscape.},

Abstract = {Objective. Are increases in citizen demand for guns a boon to advocates
   of firearms deregulation? We examine this question via state firearms
   legislation approved between 2009 and 2013, a period marked both by
   state activism regarding firearms and large surges in the demand for
   guns in response to Barack Obama's two presidential elections. Methods.
   We conduct a multivariate analysis of an original data set of state
   firearms laws approved between 2009 and 2013. We measure directional
   shifts in the tenor of firearms legislation across 49 states,
   controlling for both demographic and political variables. Result. During
   this period, deregulation of firearms was associated with more
   ideologically conservative state legislatures as well as the interaction
   between Obama-induced surges in gun sales and increased National Rifle
   Association state campaign spending. Conclusion. The findings suggest
   that increased citizen demand for firearms provides a legislative
   climate that is advantageous for groups advocating the deregulation of
   firearms.},

Abstract = {Rents and political motives are present in many aspects of public
   policy. This article considers the role of rents, rent seeking, and the
   political choice of environmental policy. Rents are introduced into the
   political choice of price and quantity regulation under conditions of
   uncertainty. The model shows how political-economy aspects affect the
   choice between price and quantity regulation. The contesting of rents
   associated with different policies affects the regulatory structure and
   influences the political choice of an environmental policy target. The
   primary conclusion is that the political choice of environmental policy
   depends on the interaction between the efficiency of rent transfer and
   the size of rent-seeking groups within the economy.},

Abstract = {The political agenda-setting literature has extensively demonstrated
   that issues receiving more media attention rank higher on the political
   agenda as well. Scholars now try to get grip on the mechanisms
   underlying these findings. This paper focuses on the media's
   informational function as a driver of political agenda-setting
   processes. It studies the extent to which politicians, when reacting to
   media information, really learn about the information from the mediaas
   opposed to instances where the media function as an amplifier rather
   than as the true source of policy-relevant information. The matter is
   investigated by means of a survey with Members of Parliament (MPs) in
   Belgium, Canada, and Israel (N = 376). We confronted the MPs with news
   stories that had recently been in the media, asking them whether they
   undertook political action on the news story and whether they knew about
   the news story before it appeared in the media. We show that politicians
   mostly knew about the information before it appeared in the media-but
   that there is variation between politicians and types of action in this
   respect.},

Abstract = {Objectives. This article aims to investigate how local leaders'
   promotion is governed by the central state's concerns of maintaining
   political legitimacy in China. Methods. We offer a theoretical framework
   regarding how to understand the statistical association between economic
   performance and local leaders' promotion in China. The empirical work is
   based on Probit models that were applied on a panel of data covering
   local leaders of 335 cities between 1999 and 2009. Results. Our research
   confirms that a better record of relative local economic growth
   significantly boosts the promotion probability of the city-level party
   secretary. However, the importance of economic work will significantly
   decrease if the cadres have strong open signals of their competence.
   Conclusions. The findings in this article suggest that there exists a
   performance-based screening scheme for selecting political elites in
   China. Portraying the positive image of political elites by the
   ``tags{''} of their capacity in fostering economic development helps to
   boost both regime legitimacy and political authoritativeness in the
   Chinese-style authoritative political regime.},

Abstract = {This article examines the Gorton government's tentative, but significant
   role in reshaping Australia's approach to overseas investment, focusing
   on the role of the Prime Minister himself. Prime Minister Gorton and his
   Cabinet ultimately accepted the need to pursue a more overt form of
   economic nationalism for political gain. This provided a basis for
   subsequent governments to offer more direct, national government
   intervention in foreign investment decision-making to the Australian
   polity. Historical accounts and more recent assessments are drawn on to
   make this case and point to the legacy of Gorton and his government in
   the political management of foreign investment in Australia. The
   approach to foreign investment that emerged during Gorton's government
   demonstrated to subsequent governments the worth of developing a
   calibrated response that appeared to address populist concerns while
   still enabling substantive and increasing investment inflows.},

Abstract = {Objectives. The effects of religiosity and sociodemographic
   characteristics on support for same-sex marriage (SSM) are estimated.
   Methods. An ordered probability model with ordinal endogenous treatment
   is estimated. Treatment effects of religiosity and marginal effects of
   other covariates are calculated. Results. Religiosity reduces the
   likelihood of SSM support. This impact can be attenuated by educational
   achievement, Democratic Party affiliation, higher incomes, and greater
   contact with gays and lesbians. The importance of religion has no
   differential impact on the marginal effects of other covariates.
   Conclusions. We expect the litigation of cases in which gay married
   couples allege victimization from some form of discrimination, which, in
   turn, will be defended on the grounds of religious freedom. Religious
   freedom supporters will come from the intrinsically religious,
   evangelicals, strong Republicans, and African Americans; same-sex
   couples will draw support from those who are more educated, strongly
   Democratic, and at the higher end of the income distribution.},

Abstract = {This article traces John Rawls's debt to Frank Knight's critique of the
   ` just deserts' rationale for laissez-faire in order to defend justice
   as fairness against some prominent contemporary criticisms, but also to
   argue that desert can find a place within a Rawlsian theory of justice
   when desert is grounded in reciprocity. The first lesson Rawls took from
   Knight was that inheritance of talent and wealth are on a moral par.
   Knight highlighted the inconsistency of objecting to the inheritance of
   wealth while taking for granted the legitimacy of unequal reward based
   on differential productive capacity. Rawls agreed that there was an
   inconsistency, but claimed that it should be resolved by rejecting both
   kinds of inequality, except to the extent they benefitted the worst off.
   The second lesson Rawls learned from Knight was that the size of one's
   marginal product depends on supply and demand, which depend on
   institutional decisions that cannot themselves be made on the basis of
   the principle of rewarding marginal productivity. The article claims
   that this argument about background justice overstates its conclusion,
   because the dependence of contribution on institutional setup is not
   total. Proposals for an unconditional basic income may therefore have a
   strike against them, as far as a reciprocity-based conception of desert
   is concerned. If we follow Knight's analysis of the competitive system,
   however, so too does the alternative of leaving determination of income
   up to the market.},

Abstract = {During the first phase of Poland's transformation (1989-1997) the
   advantage of the Constitutional Tribunal's activism was that the
   Constitution was not an obstacle to democratic reforms, even if its
   structure dated back to the times of real socialism. Thus, socially
   desirable reforms could be implemented relatively quickly, without
   working on the revision of the Constitution. After the adoption of the
   new Polish Constitution in light of the judicial practice of the
   Constitutional Tribunal, we can observe a number of worrying cases of
   excessive control. The Constitutional Tribunal specifically interprets
   the constitution and in its case law introduces its own system of values
   as control criteria. Currently, the Constitutional Tribunal ``pushes{''}
   the literal interpretation to the margins, precisely in those situations
   that enable the Tribunal to give explicit content to a phrase of
   considerable importance for the matter in question. The Constitutional
   Tribunal plays in some cases the role not so much of ``negative
   legislator{''}, but rather of a positive `` substitute legislator{''}.
   The Constitutional Tribunal also exceeds its index of power as conferred
   by the Constitution. The activism of the Constitutional Tribunal in the
   area of the control of public power leads inevitably to the ``
   politicization{''} of its jurisprudence. However, the Polish
   Constitutional Court in its case law has repeatedly emphasized that
   aspect of the principle of judicial restraint that approaches the review
   of statutes with a presumption of conformity of the examined norms with
   the Constitution.},

Abstract = {The present study adds to the framing literature by providing a test of
   Mauro Porto's News Diversity standard for professional journalism:
   providing multiple, equally persuasive frames in every news story. What
   are the effects of multiple versus single media frames on a foreign
   policy issue, and how do they interact with people's foreign policy
   values? Previous studies have looked at how single frames influence
   opinions, how frames interact with values, and a few studies have
   investigated the effects of two competing frames at varying levels of
   persuasiveness. None, however, have used four, equally strong frames on
   a foreign policy issue and measured their effects among those with
   differing foreign policy values. We found that exposure to only single
   frames tended to move participants away from their stated values and in
   the direction of the frame, while exposure to multiple, competing frames
   kept participants' opinions closer to their stated valueswithout merely
   reinforcing previously held opinions.},

   Branding Dynamics in Post-Apartheid South Africa},

Abstract = {How does nation branding reflect state-society relations and more
   pertinently, what does it reveal about the way political power is
   legitimated by a given state and why? This question seldom receives
   attention in the rapidly expanding scholarship on nation branding. This
   article examines and interprets national branding processes in
   post-apartheid South Africa within the context of larger efforts by
   political elites to legitimate the new state and society and to address
   some of the complex legacies of the apartheid past. These efforts
   targeted domestic and international audiences in distinctive ways,
   intertwined foreign and nation-building policies, and sought to
   communicate key ideas about South Africa as state and nation and about
   the state's role in the wider world order. The article considers how
   different groups of state-linked actors participated in exercises of
   legitimation and the discursive mechanisms that were relied on. Three
   such mechanisms are highlighted: (i) the construction of a distinct
   African-style modernity (here termed Afro-modernity); (ii) claims of
   South African exceptionalism articulated in boosterist branding
   campaigns; and (iii) expressed, variously through foreign policy
   signals, diplomatic posturing and hallmark events, the projection of a
   national role conception as leader on the African continent and of the
   Global South. These compound political processes had ambivalent and
   incomplete outcomes, however. This article considers why and what the
   implications are for the South African state and its society.},

Title = {Extending the local: activist types and forms of social media use in the
   case of an anti-mining struggle},
Journal = {SOCIAL MOVEMENT STUDIES},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {16},
Number = {3},
Pages = {309-322},
Abstract = {As political activists increasingly use social media in local protests,
   scholars must redirect attention from large-scale campaigns to
   scrutinize the ways in which geographically confined actors use social
   media to engage in protests. This paper analyses how a 2013 anti-mining
   campaign in Kallak, Sweden, combined on-site resistance with social
   media strategies via Facebook pages. The study examines which activist
   roles and forms of social media use that emerged and aims to explore
   what larger practical and theoretical implications one can derive from
   this specific case of place-based struggles. Results show that three
   typologically distinct activist roles emerged during the protests: local
   activists, digital movement intellectuals and digital distributors.
   These different types of actors were involved in four different forms of
   social media use: mobilization, construction of the physical space,
   extension of the local and augmentation of local and translocal bonds.
   Based on our findings, we argue that the coming together of these
   different activist roles and the different uses of social media added a
   translocal dimension to the peripheral and physically remote political
   conflict in Kallak. Media users were able to extend a locally and
   physically situated protest by linking it to a global contentious issue
   such as the mining boom and its consequences for indigenous populations.},

Abstract = {1516 saw the publication of three important works. First of all, it is
   the year of Thomas More's Utopia. But it is also the year in which
   Erasmus published his major political work The Education of the
   Christian Prince. The third work even appeared with the same publisher
   as More's Utopia, viz. Nicolaas Everaerts's Topica or legal
   commonplaces. All three works are remarkable in their own way. Erasmus
   represents a tradition that goes back to Petrarch and that saw the
   well-being of society as totally dependent on the virtuousness of its
   prince. For Thomas More this was far too risky and therefore he sketched
   a radical alternative that was based on a reorganisation of society as a
   whole. However appealing his imaginary island was, it is remarkable that
   within the domain of political theory it did not attract too much
   attention. Most authors focused on another work, that was conceived in
   the very same period, viz. Machiavelli's Prince. The present article
   will shed light on these developments by focusing on the work of two
   further early-modern intellectuals active in the Netherlands. Both
   Justus Lipsius and Leonardus Lessius, whose work bears a strong
   resemblance to that of Everaerts, looked for the ideal society. And this
   was not a society after the model of More, but a society modelled after
   a well-defined form of Machiavellism.},

Abstract = {As news flows in the social media environment, communication processes
   are facilitated by connecting processes between different categories of
   people. Thus, multimedia stories in social media journalism link not
   only pieces of information, but also people. Social media platforms are
   not only to communicate with audiences, but also to make connections
   between different stakeholders in the online production of news. This
   chapter investigates if this process of the selection of news for social
   media platforms is based on algorithmic criteria, or is only based on a
   human judgment? Methodologically, this chapter will analyse data from
   the Facebook pages of Romanian news sites in order to generate data
   which will be developed for a comparative analysis with online media in
   Poland. The questions raised by this study concern how media companies
   promote information on social media sites today.},

Pages = {693-718},
Abstract = {This article links two major areas of work on the geographies of oil:
   socially produced scarcity and the new realities' of oil, with wider
   geographical inquiries, mainly global energy governance. It explores how
   in the current context characterised by oversupply, power stands out as
   a key factor in the geopolitics of prices, the interactions amongst
   energy institutions, the role of supply and demand, and the preferences
   of the actors involved. Geopolitical approaches find a niche in the gaps
   left by the increasing complexities of global energy governance. In this
   regard, energy geopolitics may be thought of as governance by other
   means', an alternative to failed external energy governance solutions.
   The article then focuses on the consequences of the drop in oil prices
   on producer countries and how it will impact the major issues that
   dominate the literature on energy security. It concludes by stating that
   there is a need to rethink the geopolitics of energy security in order
   to incorporate the global governance institutions' failure to facilitate
   cooperation as another cause of the re-securitisation of energy
   policies.},

Abstract = {This article documents the link between conflicts and income inequality,
   and shows the benefits of disaggregating inequality indexes by groups.
   More precisely, it tests the link between three inequality measures and
   religious conflicts of low intensity in Indian villages. The three
   inequality measures are the overall (or vertical) inequality, and its
   decomposition for religious groups, into a between-group component
   (horizontal) and a within-group component. The results show that the two
   components of aggregated inequality have opposite links with conflicts.
   Indeed, on the one hand, within-group inequality appears to increase the
   incidence of conflicts between religious groups. On the other hand, when
   between-group inequality plays a significant part, it decreases the
   incidence of conflicts. Income distribution is thus a correlate of
   conflict incidence, even for low intensity conflicts. Moreover, the
   documented empirical relation is consistent with the most recent
   theories, which underline the importance of the mobilization constraint
   for conflict incidence. On the contrary, results are inconsistent with
   an interpretation of conflicts as triggered by greed or grievance.},

Abstract = {The goal of this chapter is to draw attention to the interrelation of
   multiple mediatized relationships, including face-to-face interaction,
   in local citizen engagement around biodiversity/environmental
   information. The authors argue that it is possible to fruitfully
   theorize the relationship between public involvement and the media
   without focusing specifically on the type of media. Their argument is
   supported by three examples of participatory projects, all connected
   with environmental issues, and in which social media-based and
   face-to-face interactions are closely interrelated. This contribution
   highlights the local uses of social media and the Web, and shows how
   engagement plays out in the interaction of multiple channels for
   exchange and the use of resources in a variety of media formats. In
   particular, new media significantly alter the visibility of both local
   actions and of the resulting data.},

Abstract = {Much has been written in recent years about the growing impact of social
   media on social movements. While authors have extolled the virtues of
   Facebook and Twitter as organisational and informational tools for a
   range of movements from the Arab Spring to Occupy, evidence remains
   patchy as to under what conditions social media is most effective at
   engaging and mobilising the wider public. Drawing on the work of Tarrow,
   this article considers the impact of cycle effects on the effectiveness
   of social media as a mobilising and organising tool for the 2010/11 U.K.
   student protests. Although preceding the broader `movement of the
   squares' contention cycle, the protests made similar use of social media
   for generating mass participation. Yet, its mobilising power was
   dependent on a number of temporal factors, including amplification
   through mainstream media and the urgency of its initial campaign goal.
   Moreover, towards the end of the cycle, activists were found to be using
   social media - via `secret' Facebook groups - in ways that reinforced
   emerging group hierarchies, arguably contradicting their initial
   commitment to open-access networks and participatory democracy.},

Abstract = {Joe Sacco is best known for works that blend journalism with the format
   and structure of comic books. Sacco's prior work has considered themes
   of political conflict, legacies of violence, and marginalization across
   a range of geographic contexts, including Bosnia, the Middle East, and
   the United States. This interview, conducted by the authors with Joe
   Sacco on 16 November 2015, explores these and other themes in an attempt
   to situate the positionality and choices of the creator of geopolitical
   narratives in the broader literature on critical geopolitics. We
   consider the themes of subject, representation, audience response, and
   stylistic influences, among others, in our conversation.},

Abstract = {Contextualized within the popularity of new media, youth engagement is a
   very important concept in the practice of public involvement. Guided by
   the current literature on youth engagement and media studies, this
   chapter examines the key engagement-related notions involving youth and
   media usage. Being informed by a variety of case studies on youth
   engagement through the use of media within various contexts globally,
   the chapter discusses the opportunities and challenges of engaging youth
   through media usage. The specific notions covered in this chapter
   include: 1) the role of ``hybrid{''} media in youth engagement; 2)
   ``intersectionality{''} illustrating the diversity of youth populations
   and their media usage; 3) meaning-making through media usage among
   youth; and 4) building global social relationships and social and
   cultural capital through youth's media usage. Importantly, the use of
   new media can be seen as a means of reclaiming and reshaping the ways in
   which youth are engaged, as key meaning-making processes, to address
   personal, social, and cultural issues.},

Abstract = {The territory of colonialism. Territory, Politics, Governance. Stuart
   Elden writes of territory as a specific form of sovereignty, and has
   provided its genealogy through a study of European texts. These texts
   drew upon a Roman legacy and engaged the practical issue of the
   relations between papal and monarchical powers. This paper argues that
   colonialism was at least as important a context for the elaboration of
   territory as a strategy of sovereignty. Furthermore, and as the example
   of Ireland shows, this colonial practice was not only a matter external
   to Europe.},

Abstract = {In this study, we look at all (N = 15) military memoirs published
   between 2001 and 2010 in Britain about military participation in the
   Afghanistan conflict to establish the factors that determine whether or
   not a military memoir becomes a better seller (adjusted sales > 15,000
   copies). We look at three aspects of the book-content (i.e., type of
   plot), cover (e.g., whether rank or the award of medals is mentioned),
   and author features (e.g., rank, sex, coauthorship by another
   established writer, foreword by a well-known person)-and analyze data on
   these aspects, compared to sales figures, using SPSS. We find only two
   factors that correlate with higher sales: rank and the award of a
   medal.(1)},
