Title = {The US foreign policy establishment and grand strategy: how American

Abstract = {In this article, I demonstrate that there are compelling reasons why the
   USA should reconsider its current grand strategy-variously described as
   primacy or deep engagement-and, instead, adopt a less activist strategy
   such as offshore balancing, or restraint. The most salient reason for
   the USA to make a change of direction is that its current strategy has
   set the USA on a collision course with China. Nevertheless, the American
   foreign policy establishment is resistant to strategic adjustment. In
   this article, I offer a two-pronged explanation for this resistance.
   First, the American foreign policy establishment imposes a broadly
   uniform world view on those who comprise it. In this sense, the foreign
   policy establishment's very existence is a barrier to strategic
   adjustment. Second, the foreign policy establishment's preferences
   invariably prevail because it exercises discourse dominance, which
   allows it to frame issues, and to set the bounds of discussion by
   signaling to a wider audience what policy positions are legitimate, and,
   perhaps even more important, which are not. In this article, I begin by
   discussing how the American foreign policy establishment's members are
   recruited, and focus on its links to America's corporate and financial
   elite. Then, I lay out the key elements of the foreign policy
   establishment's world views. I show how the foreign policy establishment
   uses discourse dominance to ensure that US grand strategy reflects its
   core beliefs about America's international political role. Finally, I
   demonstrate that with respect to China, the foreign policy
   establishment's world view, and the discursive practices it employs,
   make it unlikely that the USA will be able peacefully to accommodate
   China's rise.},

Abstract = {The United States is launching another defence innovation initiative to
   offset the growing military-technological might of countries such as
   China, Russia and Iran. However, by utilising emerging technologies from
   the commercial sector to achieve greater military power the US may
   further open up the technology gap within NATO. This raises serious
   questions for NATO's European allies. This article probes the nature of
   the US's latest innovation strategy and sets it within the strategic
   context facing Europe today. Whether European governments, firms and
   militaries will join the US in its new defence innovation drive will
   hinge on politico-military and industrial considerations.},

Abstract = {Public diplomacy connotes a range of international programmes tasked
   with cultivating influence for nation-states. It is typically justified
   within the arguments that comprise the concept of `soft power'. Soft
   power, however, is a vague concept, arguably, which has been difficult
   to implicate as pivotal to foreign policy outcomes. Yet, despite its
   apparent shortcomings, the concept informs a variety of nation-state and
   international actors in their strategic formulations. States acting on
   soft power tenets via a diversity of policies suggest further attention
   is warranted to examine how soft power is adapted to the practice of
   public diplomacy among different nation-states. This article draws on
   Stefano Guzzini's `performative conceptual analysis' to explore how a
   comparative analysis of public diplomacy can account for differing
   articulations of soft power, and the kinds of tools that leverage
   communicative and cultural resources toward expected gains. The goal is
   to render soft power as grounded in localised, practical understandings
   of strategic necessity through public diplomacy tools of statecraft.
   Soft power is presented as an assemblage of practical reasoning that
   informs linkages between strategic arguments about communication power
   and the practice of public diplomacy.},

Abstract = {What explains the failure of legislatures with strong constitutionally
   endowed powers to exert themselves over the executive in practice? We
   examine the role of legislator professionalization in strengthening the
   legislature's ability to constrain executive action, conceptualizing
   legislator professionalization as prior legislative experience and prior
   professional work experience. We argue that more professionalized
   legislators, through the skill and knowledge they bring to the
   policymaking process from prior experience, will be better equipped to
   challenge executive authority. In a sample of four Latin American
   countries from 1990 through 2010, we find that legislatures are more
   likely to curb executive decree issuance when individual legislators are
   strongly professionalized, controlling for constitutional powers and
   several other partisan and political factors. Our findings suggest that
   legislatures composed of more professionalized legislators can constrain
   executive action, especially in the context of a unified political
   opposition in the legislature.},

Abstract = {Critical security advocates commonly portray strategic studies as
   crippled by its narrow focus on Cold War-era military issues, as
   state-centric and as Western-centric. I argue that this conception of
   the scope of strategy is flawed and I offer a comprehensive rebuttal by
   working out the logic of the theories advanced by Carl von Clausewitz
   and Thomas Schelling. The proponents of critical security overlook the
   striking expansion of strategy during the Cold War, its longstanding
   inclusion of competing political actors not just states, as well as its
   capacity to put Western and non-Western actors in a common analytic
   frame. By breaking out of the conceptual jails in which strategy has
   been incarcerated, I seek to reconnect International Relations to
   strategic thought from which it has become increasingly estranged.},

Abstract = {Many theories attempt to explain why some countries democratize and
   others do not. Existing accounts, however, focus almost exclusively on
   structural factors and ignore individual leaders. In this article, we
   argue that leaders educated at Western universities are more likely to
   democratize than other leaders because Western education socializes
   leaders to prefer democracy and creates transnational linkages that
   alter the strategic calculus of democratization. Utilizing an original
   data set on the specific colleges and universities world leaders
   attended, we show that Western-educated leaders significantly and
   substantively improve a country's democratization prospects.},

Abstract = {Much time and enormous amount of academic effort has gone into defining
   small states and their position in world politics. This endeavor, sadly,
   has produced very little agreement. It is therefore time to reposition
   the discussion. I do so by arguing that the analysis of small states
   should move from a concentration on `smallness' to looking in more
   detail at the relationships in which these states are engaged. IR
   scholars should therefore stop defining and re-defining the concept of
   `small state,' quite literally setting it aside as an analytical
   category. This article advocates a whole-hearted embrace of a relational
   approach, replacing the analytical category of `small state' with a new
   perspective and terminology.},

Abstract = {Does international recognition of statehood affect support for
   territorial compromise among groups engaged in struggles for
   self-determination? We show that, contrary to skepticism about the
   impact of the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA), international
   recognition of statehood by the UNGA shapes mass attitudes toward
   territorial compromise. The impact of international recognition,
   however, is two-pronged. International recognition simultaneously
   increases support for partition as a strategy of conflict resolution and
   decreases support for compromise on the territorial terms of partition.
   We also suggest a logic to explain these impacts of international
   recognition based on the intuition that international recognition should
   improve the bargaining position of the newly recognized group. We
   demonstrate that international recognition has an impact on mass
   attitudes of groups in conflict using a combination of a panel survey
   and survey experiment assessing the impact of the 2012 UNGA recognition
   of Palestine. This study is the first to show that international
   recognition can shape mass attitudes toward conflict.},

Abstract = {Using the Norwegian Nobel Committee's justification for awarding the
   2012 Nobel Peace Prize to the European Union (EU) as a foil, this
   article examines the EU through the prism of being a peace project. It
   contends that European integration reflects a Wilsonian liberalism
   approach to building peace, which emphasizes free trade and democracy,
   but with a distinctly European twist; an additional emphasis on
   functional integration and institutionalization, as well as a regional
   focus. It also identifies three themes that run through the
   contributions to the special section. First, there has been a strong
   dialectic between the internal and external dimensions of security in
   the European integration project from the outset. In some ways, these
   have been reinforcing, but in others, they have been contradictory.
   Second, the European peace project has passed though successive, if
   often overlapping, chronological phases. These phases have been defined
   by different security challenges that called for different policy
   approaches. Russian aggression and jihadi terrorism characterize the
   most recent phase. The third theme is that, despite the changes in terms
   of threats and policies, there has been a remarkable consistency in two
   reinforcing respects: the persistent tension among the member states
   about closer integration with respect to the external security, and the
   tendency of the EU to emphasize institution building and to neglect
   strategy. The article concludes with a dialogic introduction to the
   individual contributions.},

Title = {Powerful Individuals in a Globalized World},
Journal = {GLOBAL POLICY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {8},
Number = {1},
Pages = {5-13},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Mark Zuckerberg, founder and CEO of Facebook, made media headlines at
   the end of last year when he announced his intention to donate most of
   his Facebook shares to charity. This article deals with the significance
   and potential of individuals, such as Zuckerberg, in a globalized world,
   to determine global policy agendas. Philanthropists who head global
   foundations are the most apparent. While philanthropists' involvement in
   international relations is based on their capital, celebrities
   increasingly use their fame to do political advocacy, and social
   entrepreneurs are sometimes able to initiate change based on new ideas.
   Contributing to the existing literature, the article compares the
   characteristics of these three categories and discusses their relevance
   against the background of the increasing delegation of authority to
   private actors in global governance. When dealing with non-state actors
   in global governance, scholars have simply assumed these actors to be
   collective entities. In consequence, we have missed the fact that power
   has not only shifted away from state actors but also increasingly
   concentrates on very few individuals who possess respective resources of
   power. The individualization of global policy processes therefore causes
   new problems of democratic accountability and legitimacy.},

Abstract = {Theories of authoritarianism assert that autocratic governments follow
   repressive and redistributive policies which impede mass mobilization,
   mitigate economic grievances and prevent regime instability. However,
   policy formulation and implementation remain opaque and under-theorized
   elements of authoritarian politics. I argue that the mix of repressive
   and redistributive policies chosen by a regime is a function of
   intra-elite conflict between hard-liners and soft-liners. The power of
   the two factions and their influence on policy evolve as members of the
   elite learn to judge the comparative advantages of the regime in
   repression and redistribution. Hard-liners will be ascendant in regimes
   with a comparative advantage in repression, while soft-liners will be
   ascendant in regimes with a comparative advantage in redistribution. I
   illustrate these arguments with an account of the East German regime's
   response to the 17 June uprising in 1953, including analysis of an
   original data set on secret police informants and food supplies after
   the unrest.},

Abstract = {Research has consistently demonstrated that political liberalism is
   predicted by the personality trait Openness to Experience and
   conservatism by trait Conscientiousness. Less well studied, however, is
   how trait personality influences political orientation. The present
   study investigated whether differences in media preference might mediate
   the links between personality and political orientation. Participants
   completed measures of Big Five personality, media preferences, and
   political orientation. Results revealed that increased preferences for
   Dark/Alternative and Aesthetic/Musical media genres, as well as
   decreased preferences for Communal/Popular media genres, mediated the
   association between Openness to Experience and liberalism. In contrast,
   greater preferences for Communal/Popular and Thrilling/Action genres, as
   well as lower preferences for Dark/Alternative and Aesthetic/Musical
   genres mediated the link between Conscientiousness and conservatism.},

Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL POLITICS},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {26},
Number = {1},
Pages = {1-26},
Abstract = {A survey-embedded experiment implemented around the time of the 2014
   annual Conference of the Parties (COP) to the United Nations Framework
   Convention on Climate Change (N approximate to 1200) examined whether
   such summits are able to increase citizens' awareness of climate
   problems. This study finds that exposure to positive or negative cues
   about the COP increases climate change awareness, particularly among
   participants who start out with a low level of awareness. Neither
   positive nor negative cues about the COP significantly affect people's
   policy preferences. Our finding resonates with Bernard Cohen's
   observation that the mass media may not often be successful in telling
   people what to think, but they are successful in telling readers what to
   think about.},

Volume = {22},

Pages = {81-99},
Abstract = {There is a rich debate surrounding the causes of women's heterogeneous
   work-life orientations and strategies. This article focuses on the
   debate between postmodern individualistic approaches and gender
   approaches that emphasise the pervasiveness of socio-structural factors.
   After offering a profile of Spanish women in the twenty-first century,
   we present the results of qualitative research based on 30
   semi-structured interviews with working mothers from different social
   backgrounds. We discuss Hakim's `preference theory' by exposing how
   social class shapes Spanish working mothers' work-life attitudes and
   behaviour and how these further change over the life cycle or as a
   result of changing contexts.},

   Revision},

Abstract = {The 2016 constitutional referendum could have marked a new phase in
   Italian politics, producing a clear shift towards a majoritarian (and de
   facto presidential) democracy. But a substantial majority of voters
   rejected the reforms promoted by Matteo Renzi, leading to his
   resignation as Prime Minister. Once again, an attempt to redesign the
   Italian institutional framework failed due to party conflicts. This
   time, the referendum turned into a vote on Renzi himself. This article
   examines the background to the institutional reforms and the changing
   dynamics of the referendum campaign. Discussing the final outcome, it
   argues that this could produce a sort of U-turn in the long Italian
   transition.},

Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL POLITICS},

Volume = {26},

Pages = {480-501},
Abstract = {The development of renewable energy is one manifestation of current
   transformations in the organisation of European energy production and
   markets. To illuminate the changes triggered by renewable energy policy,
   the evolution of solar photovoltaic policy in France is analysed with a
   focus on its central instrument, feed-in tariffs (FITs). FITs for
   photovoltaics raised difficulties in many countries, but their effects
   were particularly dramatic in France. Market sociology and science and
   technology studies are employed to describe FITs as agencements
   organising the markets and politics of electricity production. FITs are
   considered as inherently unpredictable insofar as they encourage
   innovation and the emergence of new actors. The ways in which three
   successive agencements of FITs for photovoltaics framed the politics and
   economy of photovoltaics in France, and how they addressed unanticipated
   effects, are discussed. This is suggestive of transformations and
   tensions in the construction of French energy policy.},

Abstract = {This article examines the shifts in Philippine foreign policy under the
   Duterte Administration, and how these changes impact 21st century
   Philippine-US alliance. Unlike the Aquino Administration that challenged
   China's expansionism in the South China Sea, the Duterte Administration
   keeps silent on this maritime dispute in exchange for Chinese trade
   concessions, aid, and investments. President Duterte fosters closer
   economic and diplomatic relations with China and distances the
   Philippines from the US Specifically, he seeks China's assistance for
   the building of drug-rehabilitation centers for Filipino drug
   dependents, soft loans for the construction of railways in Mindanao, and
   even the acquisition of Chinese-made weapons for the Armed Forces of the
   Philippines (AFP). In consideration of this largess, President Duterte
   has degraded the country's strategic security ties with the US by
   terminating the joint Philippine-US naval patrols in the South China
   Sea, and limiting the scope and number of US military interactions with
   the AFP. These moves, which are a dramatic departure from the
   Philippines' long-standing policy of maintaining close security ties
   with the US, have strained the Philippine-US alliance. This article
   addresses this central question: How do the foreign policy changes under
   the Duterte Administration adversely impact the Philippine-US alliance?
   It also raises the following questions: (1) What are the foreign policy
   goals of the Duterte Administration? (2) How does the Duterte
   Administration pursue these goals? (3) In what ways does the pursuit of
   these goals affect Philippine-US alliance? (4) What is the future of
   Philippine-US alliance in the light of the Duterte Administration's
   shifting foreign policy goals?},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF EUROPEAN PUBLIC POLICY},

Volume = {24},

Pages = {580-597},
Abstract = {The article discusses the two forms of intergovernmentalism
   institutionalized in the European Union (EU), one adopted in internal
   market policies and the other in the new policies close to traditional
   state powers. On the basis of a comparative federalism approach, it
   investigates the different forms of influence that constituent state
   governments exercise on the decision-making process of two types of
   federation. Contrary to federal unions, such as the USA and Switzerland,
   in the EU the constituent states are represented by their governments.
   Constituent states are instead represented by their governments in
   federal states such as Germany (and informally in Canada), but in none
   of them they play the decision-making role as they do in the EU's new
   policies regime. The article thus highlights the legitimacy vacuum in
   which the intergovernmental institutions operate in the latter policy
   regime, although this is not the case in the internal market policies
   regime.},

   conducted by the author in 2003 in ten Asian societies, Uzbekistan,
   India, Sri Lanka, Myanmar, Thailand, Vietnam, Malaysia, China, Korea and
   Japan, the author analyzes the key dimensions of social capital,
   permeating the ten societies, (1) general trust in interpersonal
   relations, (2) trust in merit-based utility; and (3) trust in social
   system and comes up with the five groups of societies on the basis of
   three major dimensions of social capital and comes up with the five
   groups of societies (1) China and Vietnam, (2) Sri Lanka and Uzbekistan,
   (3) Malaysia, Myanmar and India, (4) Japan and Korea, and (5) Thailand.

Abstract = {The rural society in China has undergone dramatic changes in the past
   four decades since the implementation of the policy of reform and
   opening-up. These changes are reflected in width, depth, and disparity.
   Width refers to the fact that they cover a wide range of aspects, such
   as politics, economy, society, culture, and mentality; depth refers to
   the fact that a suite of factors, including the market economy,
   industrialization, urbanization, population flow, and the Internet,
   alter the way that villagers make a living and the physical
   configuration of rural areas in a fundamental manner; disparity refers
   to the fact that changes in width and depth display a degree of
   differences in speed and pattern in different areas, as well as the
   structural difference in the process of resource reallocation (many
   villages may well vanish on the horizon). At this grand countryside
   stage, many actors play various roles. Village leaders are brought into
   the limelight due to their indispensable status, thus, becoming the
   subject of this research. We seek to explore the roles and behavior of
   village leaders from the perspective of modernization of rural
   governance within the framework of the state-society relationship.
   Precisely speaking, we focus our research on those village leaders who
   grasp opportunities for development or take the lead during the course
   of dramatic changes. This article is comprised of three parts. Part 1
   presents a brief discussion about the concept of village leaders and
   outlines a schema delineating their roles and behavior on the grounds of
   literature review. Unlike existing studies, we focus on the
   institutional space aimed at normalizing their roles and behavior rather
   than their specific roles and behavior. It is of vital importance that
   the behavior of village leaders should be normalized and effective
   institutions should be formulated in the modernization of rural
   governance. Thus, Part 2 is primarily concerned about the institutional
   construction of the roles and behavior of village leaders. Part 3 serves
   as a recapitulation and carries out further discussions.},

Abstract = {This article examines the implementation of Greenland's self-government
   (commonly referred to as self-rule) through an analysis of the Greenland
   government in the first four years of the Greenland Self-Government Act
   (SGA). Greenland and its government are numerically dominated by the
   Inuit, one of the indigenous peoples of the Arctic. The article begins
   with an overview of Greenland as a country and its political
   development, from a Danish colony to the 2009 Greenland SGA. After
   explaining Greenland's governance structure and the role of Inuit
   governance in Greenland's parliamentary system, it analyses the
   implementation process of the self-government agreement. It is argued
   that the SGA with its main focus on modern nation-building within the
   framework of Western institutionalism constitutes a unique means of
   implementing indigenous self-government. It revisits the norm of the
   right of indigenous peoples to self-determination understood primarily
   as a collective human right and sets a precedent within the framework of
   indigenous rights in international law.},

Number = {1},
Pages = {1-22},
Abstract = {This article explores the emergence of Hizballah, the Party of God, and
   the development of its ideas of resistance at a local and regional
   level. It begins by considering the emergence of Hizballah and the
   Lebanese context through the lens of Giorgio Agamben's work on bare
   life. It suggests that these conditions existed in Lebanonamidst the
   Shi'a communityand asks how people came together to reject the condition
   of being thus'. Conventional approaches suggest that this occurred
   through Hizballah's ideas of resistance, yet this has largely been
   under-conceptualized. To do this, it looks at the role of the Karbala
   Narrative in helping the group draw support from Shi'a Muslims in
   Lebanon, while also locating itself at the vanguard of resistance in the
   Middle East. With the emergence of Da'ish in the summer of 2014, this
   position was challenged. By reflecting on speeches from prominent
   Hizballah figures, the severity of the threat can be seen, justifying
   the Party of God's involvement in Syria. It concludes by arguing that
   the need to maintain its geopolitical influence has required military
   action in Syria, which has ultimately led to the creation of bare life.},

Abstract = {This essay sets out five distinct periods of economic, demographic, and
   spatial change that transformed the physical landscape and its effect on
   the region's hinterland on a local, national and international level -
   that would form the ``urbanscape{''} of the early twenty first century.
   Lake Tana is at the Blue Nile's first major outflow and is the heartbeat
   of the watershed, registering its seasonal pulse. Lake Tana and its
   surrounding ecologies is the font of the Blue Nile's waters, sitting at
   1800 meters above sea level from where it frames much of the watershed.
   The Blue Nile watershed's agriculture and its relationship with human
   settlement had evolved over many generations of smallholder agriculture
   and its regional role in trade. The Blue Nile basin, its geology and its
   geographies simultaneously shaped the cultures of several distinctive
   peoples. The ethnographic landscape included Christian highland farmers
   and aristocrats, Cushitic-speaking Agaw farmers, Muslim traders (who
   spoke Amharic), and Omotic-speaking Shinasha. These cultures traded
   places and bodies of knowledge on the local ecologies over time,
   resulting in a cereal-based agro-economy that supported livestock and
   small farms that managed them.},

Abstract = {The current chaotic post-Chavez political and economic scenario affords
   a little certainty: Chavez is still very present in the everyday life of
   contemporary Venezuelans. Chavez as a martyr, as the second Bolivar, as
   a saint, as a spirit, is becoming part of the religious and social life
   of a great number of people. Despite being dead, he continues to shape
   Venezuelan revolutionary selves. An examination of Chavez's legacy
   through the lens of divine kinship provides important clues to
   understanding how charisma is embodied in people and things and
   circulates through networks of kinship (and fictive kinship) from gods,
   spirits, and ancestors to democratically appointed leaders and their
   ordinary followers.},

Abstract = {Does the state of the economy condition public concern for the
   environment? Scholars have long argued that environmental preferences
   decline during economic downturns as individuals prioritize short-term
   economic needs over longer-term environmental concerns. Yet, this
   assumption has rarely been subjected to rigorous empirical scrutiny at
   the individual level. The presumed link between economic and
   environmental preferences is revisited, using the first individual-level
   opinion panel (n=1043) of US climate attitudes, incorporating both
   self-reported and objective economic data. In contrast with prior
   studies that emphasize the role of economic downturns in driving
   environmental preference shifts, using a stronger identification
   strategy, there is little evidence that changes in either individual
   economic fortunes or local economic conditions are associated with
   decreased belief that climate change is happening or reduced
   prioritization of climate policy action. Instead, the evidence suggests
   that climate belief declines are associated with shifting political
   cues. These findings have important implications for understanding the
   dynamics of political conflict over environmental policy globally.},

Title = {Reconsidering minimum deterrence in South Asia: Indian responses to
   Pakistan's tactical nuclear weapons},
Journal = {CONTEMPORARY SECURITY POLICY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {38},
Number = {1},
Pages = {78-101},
Abstract = {India's nuclear doctrine and posture has traditionally been shaped by
   minimum deterrence logic. This logic includes assumptions that
   possession of only a small retaliatory nuclear force generates
   sufficient deterrent effect against adversaries, and accordingly that
   development of limited nuclear warfighting concepts and platforms are
   unnecessary for national security. The recent emergence of Pakistan's
   Nasr tactical nuclear missile platform has generated pressures on Indian
   minimum deterrence. This article analyzes Indian official and strategic
   elite responses to the Nasr challenge, including policy recommendations
   and attendant implications. It argues that India should continue to
   adhere to minimum deterrence, which serves as the most appropriate
   concept for Indian nuclear policy and best supports broader foreign and
   security policy objectives. However, the form through which Indian
   minimum deterrence is delivered must be rethought in light of this new
   stage of regional nuclear competition.},

Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL POLITICS},

Volume = {26},

Pages = {193-211},
Abstract = {Scholars of environmental politics demand serious reform of
   international governance and institutions to protect planet Earth. There
   is therefore an urgent need to discuss what causes change and gridlock
   in environmental politics. Serious reform is inextricably tied up with
   questions of power. The diversity with which studies on environmental
   politics understand power is exposed through three ideal type concepts:
   power with (learning and cooperation), power to (resistance and
   empowerment) and power over (coercion and manipulation). So far,
   scholars have mainly used analysis of coercive power (over) to explain
   gridlock in environmental politics; also needed is explicit
   acknowledgement of coaction and individual agency that can enable
   transition to more sustainable societies.},

Title = {Beliefs or ideology: the imperative of social inclusion in Brazilian
   politics},
Journal = {COMMONWEALTH \& COMPARATIVE POLITICS},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {55},
Number = {3},
Pages = {377-401},
Abstract = {This paper underscores how a dominant belief in social inclusion not
   only has shaped Brazil's post-1988 institutions, but has also dominated
   policy preferences of Brazilian politicians regardless of their
   ideological orientation. Based on a unique survey with Brazilian
   legislators, we have been able to understand how elite preferences are
   connected to this belief of social inclusion. We also address how the
   belief of social inclusion itself changed over time, from what can be
   called as irresponsible inclusion to a more fiscally sound social
   inclusion. By combining the elite's survey with roll call voting
   records, we compare the degree of consistency between what lawmakers say
   and how they behave. The results demonstrate that although social
   inclusion is the spoken imperative, the division between government and
   opposition distinguishes itself as the main cleavage in Brazilian
   politics. The Brazilian case is noteworthy, since its economically
   unequal and politically hyper-fragmented context can serve as an example
   of a strong executive, generally aligned to society beliefs, seizing the
   opportunity to coordinate Congress towards delivering redistributive
   policies.},

Title = {The venture into higher education: exploring politics of education in a
   Philippine local government college},
Journal = {PHILIPPINE POLITICAL SCIENCE JOURNAL},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {38},
Number = {2},
Pages = {123-145},
Abstract = {This study aims to examine the experience of the local government of
   Sibonga, a municipality in the province of Cebu, Philippines in
   establishing the Sibonga Community College, a local public higher
   educational institution. Situating within the context of a Philippine
   local government and taking into account the political dynamics and
   existing structures of local power and authority, this study uses the
   systems approach of David Easton as framework of analysis as adapted by
   education scholars. Primarily, this study focuses on the processes and
   practices undertaken in the venture into higher education system by the
   local government. Methodologically, the study looks into the perceptions
   of local government officials, local line agency heads, teachers and
   administrators, students and graduates; and uses key informant
   interviews and focus group discussion. The findings suggest that the
   creation of the educational venture was susceptible to local political
   dynamics, a strong mayoral engagement and nuances of informal
   arrangements with a national agency on higher education. The local
   government, as the political system at the local level, remains a
   powerful site of delivering public goods and service. In addition, the
   venture was argued to be a form of policy innovation and good governance
   centered on the response to the higher education gap at the local level.
   As such, there needs to be improvements in local government units'
   venture as provider of higher education at the local level, to match
   access goals with quality assurance, for an enhanced, rationalized and
   sustainable pursuit of higher education system in the country.},

Abstract = {The impact of decentralization on efficiency in the production of public
   goods and services has been described by the current scientific
   discourse in some detail. In this article, we focus on an analysis of
   the impact of the factor of decentralization as well as other selected
   factors on efficiency in public procurement. We view the term efficiency
   to be the ratio between the tendered and the estimated price, but also
   as procedural correctness and legality, as it is reflected in the
   administration of complaints, investigations, and findings regarding
   violations of the law by the supervising authority. We then describe the
   phases of bidding and post bidding. For empirical research, we used
   linear regression and logistic regression. These methods are applied to
   data regarding public procurement for the years 2010-2014. The results
   show that, among the contracting authorities at the different levels of
   decentralization, there were statistically significant differences which
   we can explain through the different levels of accountability, economies
   of scale, as well as the qualifications of the workers of the
   contracting authority.},

Journal = {CAMBRIDGE REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS},

Pages = {325-349},
Abstract = {As Britain prepares to leave the European Union after the popular vote
   of June 2016, the government is embarking on the revision of foreign
   policy. Boris Johnson, or just Boris', has been entrusted with forging
   the new Global Britain' for the post-Brexit era and reinventing British
   economy around new relationships. Boris has a track record of
   misrepresenting and offending foreign peoples, leaders and countries.
   This article assesses the prospects for Africa in Johnson's vision for
   Global Britain' as presented in his foreign policy speeches. The paper
   unpacks Johnson's discursive construction of Africa' and inserts it into
   a broader historical and political context of British relations with
   Africa. It argues that, by constructing Africa as a problem' and
   offering liberal values as a condition for development, Johnson is
   continuing British imperial and post-colonial discourses of developing'

Volume = {22},

Abstract = {This study explores whether and how participation in civil society
   organisations (CSOs) has transformed citizenship attitudes in different
   cities in Turkey, and how civic participation and citizenship attitudes
   are affected by local politico-cultural dynamics. The analysis is based
   on interviews conducted with representatives of 36 CSOs in five Turkish
   cities: Konya, Edirne, Diyarbakir, Trabzon, and Izmir. Our comparative
   analysis of the five cities reveals that civic life is more active in
   cities marked by high levels of religiosity (Konya) and politicised by
   conflict (Diyarbakir). On the other hand, politicisation of civic life
   through party dominance and clientelism, as in Edirne and Trabzon,
   undermines trust and discourages participation.},

Journal = {EAST EUROPEAN POLITICS},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {33},
Number = {3, SI},
Pages = {406-425},
Abstract = {``The political{''} represents a moment in which actors recognise
   autonomy and equality as constitutive values in the agonistic search for
   appropriate open-ended political outcomes. The tutelary, pedagogical and
   disciplinary practices of the depoliticised European Union (EU)
   undermine the foundations of equality in diplomatic and political
   engagement between continental actors. The relationship becomes
   axiological, where issues are deemed to have been resolved through some
   sort of anterior pre-political arrangement. This is a type of
   ahistorical political monism that ultimately claims to speak for all of
   Europe. The return of ``the political{''} allows a more generous and
   pluralistic politics to emerge based on genuine dialogical foundations
   in which self and other engage as equals and are mutually transformed by
   that engagement.},

Abstract = {Two narratives dominate the literature about the state of freedom of
   expression in postliberal Venezuela, and they have few points in common,
   since they depend on different conceptualizations of the notion of
   freedom of expression. While the traditional liberal narrative focuses
   on the negative freedom that prohibits state interference, the
   postliberal narrative is based on positive freedom that encompasses the
   collective right of self-realization, particularly for the previously
   marginalized. During the government of Hugo Chavez, the discourse of
   freedom of expression was renewed, placing it in the context of power
   relations, accentuating positive freedom, and emphasizing the role of
   the public and community media. The establishment of the international
   public channel TeleSUR has revived the 1970s debate about the right to
   communication and contributed to the creation of a new Latin
   American-ness.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF EUROPEAN PUBLIC POLICY},

Volume = {24},

Pages = {1172-1190},
Abstract = {Regarding the analysis of European economic policy choices since 2010,
   the literature has largely taken the path of intergovernmentalism,
   concluding that the member states were the key leaders of the economic
   and fiscal negotiations and relegating the Commission to the loser
   status. This article aims to open the black box of European economic
   policy-making through process tracing and embed a discussion on policy
   entrepreneurship by the Commission within an analysis of policy change
   in economic governance. It argues that the coupling of a high problem
   load with a high level of systemic ambiguity opens a window of
   opportunity for bottom-up entrepreneurship of the Directorate General
   for Economic and Financial Affairs which is snuffed out by the political
   College and the member states when the problem load and the systemic
   ambiguity are low.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF PEACE RESEARCH},

Abstract = {The existing conflict literature tends to treat interdependence between
   rebel groups as a binary category: either groups are allied or unallied,
   fragmented or unified, interdependent or independent. Yet much of our
   qualitative knowledge suggests that interdependence is better understood
   as a matter of degree where certain groups exert a disproportionate
   influence over their counterparts. The challenge is how to identify the
   degree of interdependence in practice. As a solution, I conceptualize
   interdependence as a property of a system of interactions between rebel
   groups and government forces within and across borders. My approach is
   to model the entire system of interactions in order to test hypotheses
   related to the directionality of influence and the potential for
   military coordination between groups. I demonstrate the utility of this
   approach by examining the relationship between Pakistan and the two
   major factions which make up the Taliban organization - the Afghan and
   Pakistani Taliban. I analyze the triangular system with a vector
   autoregressive model and monthly time series data on violent actions
   initiated by each group from January 2008 to February 2013. The
   substantive findings support much of the received wisdom concerning
   Pakistan's disparate relationship to both groups, which is characterized
   by antagonism with the Pakistani Taliban and collusion with the Afghan
   Taliban. The results also suggest that the claims of interdependence
   between the two Taliban groups have been overstated.},

Abstract = {The inclusion of the principle of Responsibility to Protect (R2P) and
   its crystallization in paragraphs 138 and 139 of the 2005 World Summit
   Outcome Document would not have been possible without the support of a
   large group of Latin American countries. This paper analyzes the factors
   that explain the sympathy that the principle aroused among some
   countries in the region, as well as the reasons that other countries
   have put forward to justify their rejection of the R2P. It highlights,
   firstly, the weight of the human rights regime in Latin America, as well
   as the enabling environment of the democratizing wave in the region.
   However, one of the keys to understanding support for a principle that
   seeks to prevent the perpetration of heinous crimes, even at the risk of
   intervention, lies in the region's own experience of crimes against
   humanity.},

Abstract = {The total number of US nuclear weapons in Europe has decreased by 97 per
   cent since its peak in the 1970s. Despite a series of political
   initiatives to have the remaining warheads withdrawn, approximately 180
   US B-61 nuclear weapons remain on European soil: in Belgium, Germany,
   the Netherlands, Italy, and Turkey. Yet, the Cold War has been over for
   over two decades and those tactical, short-range nuclear weapons do not
   seem to serve a military purpose. NATO's nuclear capacity would not be
   altered by their withdrawal from European territory. So, the question
   is: why are those nuclear weapons still there?
   This article identifies a set of actors that, by actively perpetuating a
   discourse casting NATO as a `nuclear alliance' founded on `burden
   sharing' and `transatlantic solidarity', ensure the continuation of the
   stationing of US nuclear weapons in Europe.},

Abstract = {Under what conditions do political leaders enact coup-proofing'
   strategies? There is a broad consensus in the literature that political
   leaders who face a higher risk of a coup will employ coup-proofing
   strategies that reduce the military's capabilities to organize a coup. A
   closer look at the theory and empirical analyses of earlier studies,
   however, suggests that the presumed relationship between coup risk and
   coup-proofing should be re-examined. Drawing on insights from formal
   studies of authoritarian power-sharing, this article proposes that
   political leaders become less likely to initiate coup-proofing efforts
   as the coup risk increases. The reason is that leaders' coup-proofing
   actions in themselves could prompt the military to launch a coup and
   thus political leaders will hesitate to offend officers when they face a
   high risk of a coup. The statistical models in this article estimate a
   latent coup risk by aggregating multiple indicators that capture the
   military's willingness and ability to organize a coup. The empirical
   results strongly support the proposition that coup-proofing efforts
   taken by leaders decrease as coup risk increases.},

   evidence-based policy-making for the development of Internet of Things

Journal = {POLICY STUDIES},

Abstract = {This paper provides theoretical bases and a framework to describe the
   incremental process of macro-level innovation policy-making for emerging
   industry in China and the role of government-business (G-B) interactions
   in generating policy-making evidence. By analyzing the decision-making
   processes of three macro-level innovation policies for the Internet of
   Things as a mode of industry development, the paper finds that the
   macro-level innovation policy-making resulted from a gradual sub-issue
   solving in each of several sub-processes. The specific micro-level
   policy tools are formed and implemented through G-B interactions to
   generate evidence, and these processes are gradual and incremental,
   helping policy-makers to overcome the high levels of uncertainties in
   emerging industry development. Five interactive approaches in this
   research are identified: inspections, investigations, soft lobbying,
   conferences, and cooperation. The patterns of interactions vary with the
   nature of the innovation policies. Our findings contribute to the
   evidence-based policy-making perspective, by clarifying the innovation
   policy-making sub-process and the evidence-generating mechanism of G-B
   interactions in dealing with emerging industry development
   uncertainties.},

   exploring transnational policy dynamic},
Journal = {POLICY AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {36},
Number = {1},
Pages = {109-126},
Abstract = {The study focuses on multi-level and multi-actor characteristics of
   European governance, concentrating on six European stakeholder
   organizations in the area of higher education (HE) and research. It
   analyses how policy positions change over time and how such changes can
   be accounted for, juxtaposing (1) environmental influence linked to
   structuration of the European HE policy arena as an organizational field
   and (2) internal organizational dynamic. Policy positions are seen to
   comprise three elements - policy issues, policy preferences and
   normative basis. Theoretically, the study is grounded in policy
   analysis, interest groups and neo-institutionalism. The empirical
   material consists of policy documents, subjected to both quantitative
   and qualitative content analysis. The study identifies changes in policy
   positions of stakeholder organizations, resulting in both differences
   and similarities, though the latter do not emerge over time in a way
   that suggests straightforward convergence. Thus, further research into
   specificities of policy-making processes within these organizations is
   necessary.},

   of local governments, played an important role driving this trend. After
   years of steady growth, ICLEI became a target of political opposition
   and its membership dropped significantly from 2010 to 2012. This begs
   the question of whether cities' termination of their ICLEI affiliation
   diminishes their implementation of sustainability actions. Two surveys
   administered in 2010 and 2014 provide data on cities' implementation of
   an array of sustainability actions. Using a difference-in-differences
   (DiD) method, the impact of ICLEI termination on local governments'
   administrative and policy commitments to sustainability is assessed. The
   results suggest that ending ICLEI membership does not significantly
   impact local sustainability actions, and also indicate that the
   durability of policy actions may be only loosely linked to the policies
   that justify them.},

Abstract = {When the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP)
   negotiations were underway, its politics were distinctively
   transnational. Numerous alliances between European and American industry
   associations advocated an ambitious agreement to mitigate the effects of
   conflicting rules. Some civic interest groups also closely cooperated to
   shape the agreement, while a broad, loose transatlantic coalition of
   civic interest groups opposed it. The extent of transnationalism in TTIP
   was greater than what had come before in the transatlantic relationship
   and what is evident in contemporaneous analogous trade negotiations.
   This article argues that while the salience of a trade negotiation
   affects whether societal actors mobilize, it is not sufficient to prompt
   transnational cooperation. Rather transnational cooperation stems
   primarily from what the actors are seeking to achieve and whether they
   have a motive and opportunity to work together. By clarifying the
   conditions under which transnational cooperation is more likely, this
   article informs the emerging literature on the new politics of trade. By
   making the case that the motives to mobilize and cooperate require
   distinct analysis, it contributes to the literature on transnationalism.},

Abstract = {This article puts the second-order theory for regional elections to the
   test. Not by analysing voting behaviour but with the use of campaign
   data. The assumption that regional campaigns are overshadowed by
   national issues was verified by analysing the campaign tweets of Flemish
   politicians who ran for the regional or national parliament in the
   simultaneous elections of 2014. No proof was found for a hierarchy of
   electoral levels but politicians clearly mix up both levels in their
   tweets when elections coincide. The extent to which candidates mix up
   governmental levels can be explained by the incumbency past of the
   candidates, their regionalist ideology, and the political experience of
   the candidates.},

Abstract = {This paper discusses how individuals can use humor, sarcasm and mockery
   to question the governmental policies in China regarding issues such as
   tradition, democracy, values of education in general and of critical
   thinking specifically. Drawing on research on individualization of the
   Chinese society (discussed later), the paper interprets the use of humor
   by an individual Chinese while teaching English in a test-preparation
   school in China to illustrate how the authorities and their policies in
   diverse areas of Chinese life can be challenged. Focusing on the images
   that the teacher constructed in his jokes on the basis of personal
   experience, the analysis identified how he projected an attitude of a
   critical, rational, reflexive and self-reliant nonconformist person
   towards the political establishment by mocking it for its promotion of
   traditional and nationalistic discourses, as well as its problematic
   practices. Since such individuals arguably constitute the backbone of
   the civil society for a better China, there is a need to acknowledge in
   research their efforts to contest the discursive and ideological
   constraints when pursuing the path to remain ``individuals{''} in a
   post-totalitarian society. (C) 2017 The Regents of the University of

Abstract = {How to increase diversity in the police is an unanswered question that
   has received significant political and media attention. One area of
   intervention is the recruitment process itself. This study reports the
   results of a randomized controlled trial (RCT) in a police force that
   was experiencing a disproportionate drop in minority applicants during
   one particular test. Drawing on insights from the literatures on
   stereotype threat, belonging uncertainty and values affirmation
   exercises, we redesigned the wording on the email inviting applicants to
   participate in the test. The results show a 50 per cent increase in the
   probability of passing the test for minority applicants in the treatment
   group, with no effect on white applicants. Therefore, the intervention
   closed the racial gap in the pass rate without lowering the recruitment
   standard or changing the assessment questions.},

Abstract = {The article attempts to identify common explanatory factors and internal
   causal mechanisms behind the poor democratic performance of
   post-communist semi-presidential regimes. It attributes poor democratic
   performance to constitutionally powerful presidents supported by
   single-party-majority cabinets. Under this situation, omnipotent
   presidents enact media-related law unhindered, tightly regulate the
   media, prevent the opposition from disseminating election information,
   and thus increase the ruling party's probability of winning elections.
   Through quantitative analysis and comparative case studies of Azerbaijan
   and Kazakhstan, this paper verifies the convergent pathway from powerful
   presidents' media control to poor democratic performance. In conclusion,
   powerful post communist presidents endanger democracy via media control.

Abstract = {This article argues that it is pertinent to situate academic metrics
   (journal, institutions and individual scholars' rankings and ratings)
   within the broader logic of neoliberal government, in order to better
   identify and understand the impact of these metrics on political
   scientists' perceptions, behaviours and identities. The results of a
   pilot survey conducted among political scientists in the United Kingdom
   and Belgium are used in order to further expose this impact. More
   precisely, we claim that although metrics are widely seen as a core
   element of a broader and undesirable political agenda, their repeated
   use leads to their endorsement, shapes and standardizes individual
   strategies, and shifts the codes of academic identity to the point of
   eroding academics' sense of purpose and permeating their judgements
   about colleagues.},

Abstract = {Legal instruments at the European level clearly define that States have
   an obligation to establish corporate liability for trafficking in human
   beings (THB). The monitoring of the implementation of the Council of
   Europe Convention on Action against Trafficking in Human Beings shows
   that, in general, the respective legislation for corporate criminal
   liability already largely exists in the States' Parties. However,
   application of the legislation seems to lag behind, since relevant cases
   were identified in only a few States. By analysing these legal
   mechanisms with a focus on Austria, studying case law in Belgium and
   Cyprus, and conducting interviews with stakeholders, the authors
   identify obstacles for the application of corporate criminal liability
   in the context of THB. Based on case law, the paper analyses the
   potential of corporate criminal liability for exploited persons to have
   access to compensation and describes challenges in this field. Cases on
   corporate criminal liability for THB seem to focus on sanctioning the
   companies and ensuring compensation might be seen as a rather secondary
   priority.},

Volume = {27},
Number = {4},
Pages = {661-675},

Abstract = {Extant literature regarding citizens' responses to government public
   communications focuses on the roles of transparency and provision of
   information. Conversely, the effect of strategically designed symbols,
   which are integral to most public communications, received limited
   attention. Building on social psychology and marketing research, we
   theorize that familiar promotional symbols enhance citizens' positive
   attitudes toward government through ``evaluative conditioning,{''} yet
   this effect is conditioned by citizens' experiences of actual government
   performance. We test these expectations via a survey experiment, which
   examines participants' responses to a familiar promotional symbol of an
   Israeli state-owned electricity monopoly, given near-random variation in
   their experiences of prolonged power outages. We find that exposure to
   the well-known symbol enhances participants' favorable attitudes toward
   the organization, and that this effect extends to those who recently
   experienced poor electricity services. The effect is significant in
   relation to participants' trust in the organization, but not regarding
   their satisfaction and performance evaluation. These findings indicate
   that familiar promotional symbols can shape citizens' attitudes, and
   compensate for the effect of poor performance, with regard to
   sufficiently ambiguous organizational aspects. We discuss the
   implications of these findings for current research on the effectiveness
   of transparency and performance information.},

Abstract = {This article presents the first assessment of how the five-factor model
   of personality and political ideology are associated across the world.
   Personality traits become more and more important in the study of
   political behavior. And the relationship with ideology virtually
   parallels the history of this line of research. Yet, many existing
   studies are limited to single, highly developed countries and mostly
   draw on nonrandom or nonrepresentative samples. Our study, in contrasts,
   makes use of the most recent wave of the World Value Survey and analyzes
   the relationship comparatively in 21 countries from all continents.
   Results corroborate the most prominent findings about personality and
   ideology. However, effects of personality traits cannot be generalized
   easily across the world as effects vary considerably from country to
   country. Therefore, we additionally analyze specific preferences
   concerning social and economic policies on the one side. On the other,
   we theorize as well as model the moderating role of the country context
   by introducing cross-level interaction effects.},

Abstract = {Superdiversity implies increasing diversity within diversity, including
   the rise of flexible migration strategies: complex migration
   trajectories implying serial cross-border mobility between two or more
   countries. The article explores transmigration in the two main
   superdiverse Belgian cities of Brussels and Antwerp, based upon in-depth
   interviews with Brazilian, Ghanaian and Moroccan transmigrants. The
   article analyses the social problems related to transmigration, how
   these problems transcend borders and challenge urban social work and
   social policies at different levels. It explores why transmigration
   requires forms of multilevel governance to deal with people living
   beyond borders in the EU.},

Abstract = {This paper analyses how urban governance incorporated migration-driven
   superdiversity combining cultural and economic development policies. We
   use the case of Mouraria, a Lisbon neighbourhood, as a site where city
   strategies accommodate old and new diversities to render a cosmopolitan
   sense associated to a `diversity advantage' approach. We identify three
   strategies shaping urban governance: de-ethnicisation of superdiversity
   and urban growth policies, diversity aestheticisation and the rationale
   of encounter, and place marketing and city branding. We find that urban
   governance in a superdiverse neighbourhood relies on policies of
   economic development and market creation that incorporate cultural
   diversity from a de-ethnicised perspective.},

Abstract = {This text approaches the issue of strengthening the democratic
   legitimacy of international institutions from a comparative legal
   perspective. It argues that Articles 9 to 12 of the Treaty on European
   Union can help to conceptualize and develop the elements of such
   democratic legitimation. The core statement of this contribution is: A
   democratization of governance beyond the state, in particular in the
   sense of a better political inclusion of citizens in the exercise of
   public authority by international institutions, can well be
   theoretically conceived and practically realized.},

Abstract = {How do people come to participate in violent display? By violent
   display', I mean a collective effort to stage violence for people to
   see, notice, or take in. Violent displays occur in diverse contexts and
   involve a range of actors: state and non-state, men and women, adults
   and children. The puzzle is why they occur at all given the risks and
   costs. Socialization helps to resolve this puzzle by showing how actors
   who have consciously adopted or internalized group norms might take
   part, despite the risks. Socialization is more limited in explaining how
   and why actors who are not bound by group norms also manage to put
   violence on display. To account for these other pathways, I propose a
   theory of casting'. Casting is the process by which actors take on roles
   and roles take on actors. Roles enable actors to do things they would
   not normally do. They give the display its form, content, and meaning.
   Paying attention to this process reveals how violent displays come into
   being and how the most eager actors as well as unwitting and unwilling
   participants come to take part in these grisly shows. To explore
   variation in the casting process, I investigate violent displays that
   occurred in two different contexts: the Bosnian war and Jim Crow
   Maryland. Data come from interviews, trial testimonies, and primary
   sources.},

Abstract = {Private business is among the many things that comprise the ``new
   normal{''} in Xi Jinping's China. Given the Communist Party's socialist
   transformation of the private sector in the 1950s and its concerted
   suppression of ``tails of capitalism{''} over the next 20 years, it was
   surprising that it began to legitimize private business in 1978. It did
   this to address a number of pressing social and economic problems. After
   a slow start, micro enterprises began to increase in numbers and scale,
   and the party passed several amendments to the state constitution and
   revised its ideological stance to make private business a normal and
   legitimate component of the economic field, and to recruit private
   entrepreneurs into the party. Nonetheless, the ``new{''} normal
   continues to evolve and China's new capitalists walk a vague line
   between acceptance and vulnerability.},

Abstract = {Drawing on institutional theory, this article articulates qualitative
   insights from a program of research on Canadian health technology-based
   ventures to examine the rules that characterize economic policy, capital
   investment, and regulatory approval as well as the way these
   institutions enable and constrain the development of ventures at an
   early stage. Our findings clarify how economic policy integrates these
   ventures into the entrepreneurial domain, how capital investment
   configures them for economic value extraction, and how regulatory
   approval fully releases their market value. These findings help to
   revisit current policy modernization initiatives by calling attention to
   the convergence among the three institutions. Rather than operating
   solely as a source of constraints, these institutions provide a highly
   integrated market-oriented space for health technology-based
   entrepreneurial activities to unfold.},

Abstract = {Why do some postconflict states return to violence, while others remain
   at peace? Analysts increasingly credit postconflict justice institutions
   such as truth commissions, amnesties, reparations, and trials with
   contributing to the prevention of conflict recurrence following civil
   wars. But scholars remain divided about the overall effectiveness of
   these varied institutions. In this article, we directly engage this
   debate. We seek to overcome theoretical and data limitations that make
   it difficult to address the relationship between justice institutions
   and the likelihood that conflict will recur. We find that only
   postconflict justice processes that lessen conflict-induced grievances,
   and thus address individual motivations to rebel, are successful at
   keeping the peace. In a series of statistical tests using new data on
   postconflict justice from 1946 to 2006, we find strong support for the
   role of motivation-addressing processes in reducing conflict recurrence.},

   using the data from the survey Caucasus Barometer (CB) conducted by the
   Caucasus Research Resource Center (CRRC) in 2012-2013. Two hypotheses
   cultural and institutional were tested. The study partially confirms the
   previous findings that national culture, as well as individual
   socialization (macro and micro-cultural theories) are the main
   determinants of trust in Azerbaijan. Meanwhile, government performance
   and individual evaluation (macro-and micro institutional theories) did
   not affect much on the trust level in the country. (C) 2017 The Regents

Abstract = {This article explores the reception of human rights norms on child labor
   in Bolivia and Argentina, countries where governments and civil
   societies express support for human rights. However, national responses
   after ratification of International Labor Organization's conventions
   diverge significantly. In Bolivia, domestic interpretations of human
   rights have prevailed over attachment to ILO conventions ({''}deviant
   compliance{''}), while in Argentina national policies exceed ILO
   recommendations ({''}over-compliance{''}). We use the evidence presented
   here to call for a more nuanced understanding of what compliance with
   human rights principles is understood to mean and to stress the
   importance of domestic interpretations of international norms.},

Abstract = {For those who spoke on behalf of Leave voters, the result on 23 June
   2016 meant the people of the United Kingdom were taking back control' or
   getting their own country back'. However, two parts of the United
   Kingdom did not vote Leave: Scotland and Northern Ireland. Here, the
   significant counterpoint to taking back control is waking up in a
   different country', and this sentiment has unique political gravity. Its
   unique gravity involves two distinct but intimately related matters. The
   first concerns the politics of identity. The vote was mainly, if not
   entirely, along nationalist/unionist lines, confirming an old division:
   unionists were staking a British' identity by voting Leave, and
   nationalists an Irish one by voting Remain. The second concerns borders.
   The Good Friday/Belfast Agreement of 1998 meant taking the border out of
   Irish politics. Brexit means running the border between the European
   Union (EU) and the United Kingdom across the island as a sovereign
   frontier'. Although this second matter is discussed mainly in terms of
   the implications for free movement of people and goods, we argue that it
   is freighted with meanings of identity. Brexit involves a border in the
   mind', those shifts in self-understanding, individually and
   collectively, attendant upon the referendum. This article examines this
   border in the mind' according to its effects on identity, politics and
   the constitution, and their implications for political stability in
   Northern Ireland.},

Abstract = {The present situation of UNESCO is unique in both, financial and legal
   terms. The United States with an assessment rate of 22 per cent to be
   contributed to the regular budget stopped paying its membership dues as
   of 2011 when the General Conference of UNESCO admitted Palestine as a
   Member State. But the United States decided to remain full member of the
   Organization. Israel followed the same way. The impact of an increasing
   debt mountain' over the years is obvious which led to a serious
   reduction in staff and activities. No one dares to question the issue of
   membership. Other member states started paying their annual dues either
   late or not at all. Ad hoc attempts of organizational change dominate
   the running of UNESCO without overcoming the existing fragmentation.},

Title = {Resourcing International Organisations: So What?},
Journal = {GLOBAL POLICY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {8},
Number = {5, SI},
Pages = {113-123},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {The changes observed in resourcing international organisations over the
   last decades may have dramatic consequences for their ability to fulfil
   their mandates. This paper investigates into how far reaching the
   expected changes really are, and whether the new types and sources of
   financial and human resources can really be considered as causal for
   these developments. It appears that resourcing may not be the initial
   cause, but contributes to the centrifugal dynamics currently observed in
   the multilateral system. Administrative cost related to the new and
   complex funding structures are considerable, and ensuring transparency
   over resource flows represents a major challenge. Official
   decision-making bodies lose power to sub-groups of members or external
   actors that fund parts of the organisations' activities through separate
   channels. Given the large volume of non-core funding and the lack of
   transparency, they cannot easily adjust their own priorities. It can
   thus not be expected that the funding of certain activities through
   external channels will simply be compensated by a corresponding
   reduction of core funding in this area. Whether this negatively affects
   the ability of the organisations to fulfil their mandates - and hence,
   eventually their legitimacy - depends on the motivations of those actors
   empowered in this process.
   Policy Implications
   The loss of trust in traditional international organisations on the one
   hand, and the tendency to provide them with resources through
   increasingly diverse channels outside their main budget on the other
   hand, is a mutually reinforcing process.
   The use of these alternative channels leads to a substantial reduction
   of the power of formal decision-making bodies in these organisations,
   and to a redefinition of priorities that they cannot simply compensate
   by corresponding adjustments in their own budget.
   At the same time, specific sub-groups of members and some external
   funders such as private companies or philanthropic organisations gain
   influence. Depending on the type of actors and their motivation to truly
   promote the global goals of the organisation, this may be either an
   efficient way to move things forward, or lead to a problematic diversion
   of the organisations' key activities and negatively affect the
   organisations' legitimacy.
   It is not yet clear, which actors will dominate in the future. This
   calls for a close monitoring of the ongoing dynamics, and for the
   definition of clear rules for the organisations' partnership with
   external actors. Potential conflicts of interest should be examined in
   advance.},

Abstract = {The criticism of the reconstruction that followed the cataclysm in Chile
   in 2010 has centered on contingent factors including the performance of
   politicians. An examination of the way structural factors conditioned
   the governmental response to the 8.8 earthquake shows that the
   constitution created by the military regime shaped the reconstruction
   through provisions that limited vertical and horizontal accountability
   in intrastate and state-society relations. The subsidiary state,
   executive-legislative power relations, the binomial electoral system,
   and the appointment rather than election of regional authorities favored
   a recovery effort that has been underinstitutionalized, privatized,
   characterized by scant participation of victims, and marred by
   irregularities. An analysis of governmental reports, media outlets,
   polls, and semistructured interviews conducted with legislators, social
   leaders, and scholars sheds light on the relation between the
   constitution and the recovery.},

Abstract = {For two decades after the fall of the Berlin Wall, globalization
   functioned as a unifying force in the West. In the absence of a common
   security threat, the United States and Europe found common ground in a
   neoliberal agenda calling for the freer movements of capital, goods,
   services, and peoples across national boundaries. Today, support for
   that neoliberal agenda has been rapidly weakening across the West.
   Drawing on a variety of quantitative measures, we show that Western
   support for globalization has declined, both at the level of national
   policy and at the level of party politics. We argue that this erosion of
   domestic support for globalization is closely linked to the rise of
   populist parties in Europe and the USA. We consider the implications of
   this shift in the West's domestic politics for the future of
   transatlantic cooperation and leadership.},

Abstract = {The proliferation of regional economic organizations (REOs) is a
   prominent feature of the contemporary international environment. Many of
   these organizations aspire to promote regional peace and stability. Some
   strive to promote these goals only through economic cooperation, while
   others have expanded their mandate to include mechanisms that address
   security concerns more directly. A glance at the security components of
   such organizations indicates that their purpose and design are very
   diverse. This article sheds light on the sources of this poorly
   understood phenomenon. Specifically, it argues that organizations that
   enjoy greater delegated authority are in a better position to expand
   their mandate into the security realm and to have more far-reaching
   agreements in this issue area. It then develops a metric that gauges the
   degree of security cooperation within REOs and presents a new dataset of
   numerous organizations on this institutional aspect. Employing this
   dataset in a rigorous statistical analysis and controlling for a host of
   alternative explanations, it demonstrates that, indeed, REOs with
   greater delegated authority develop deeper security cooperation.},

Abstract = {This article describes a technology that seeks to improve the
   effectiveness of public policies in order to achieve their goals.
   Improve the efficiency of governance, increase social trust and the
   latter enhance cooperation and collective action that governance
   demands. Nudge acts by reconfiguring the decision architecture; this
   tool calls into question the model of rational agent, revaluing the
   automatic system of action, emotions and shared mental schemas. The
   proposed outline is as follows: first, it describes the innovative
   environment and the human behavior model on which the nudges develop.
   Second, the tool is develops and political efforts in Anglo-Saxon
   countries to institutionalize their design are presented. Third, the
   paper contrasts the enthusiasm. for this technology with its limits and
   systematizes its criticisms. Finally, the opportunity of this proposal
   is analyzed in the framework of the complexities that face Latin
   America.},

Abstract = {Increasing ethnic diversity and whether or not it impacts on social
   trust are highly debated topics. Numerous studies report a negative
   relationship between diversity and trust, particularly in the United
   States. A growing body of follow-up studies has examined the extent to
   which these findings can be transferred to Europe, but the results
   remain inconclusive. Moving beyond the discussion of the mere existence
   or absence of diversity effects on trust, this study is concerned with
   the moderation of this relationship. It addresses the neglected role of
   subnational integration policies influencing the impact of diversity on
   trust. Empirical tests not only indicate that integration policies
   moderate the relationship but also suggest that the influence of
   policies varies substantively according to the specific policy aspect
   under consideration.},

Abstract = {Since it took effect, the EU-Turkey refugee agreement has been the
   subject of intense debate. While critics argue that it was politically
   short-sighted, others point out that quick action was necessary to avert
   both a humanitarian crisis in Greece and the collapse of the Schengen
   system due to the unwillingness of EU member states to share
   responsibility. Since the agreement took effect, the most serious
   problems lay in the implementation process, which has revealed a
   troubling tendency among EU leaders to disregard the fundamental human
   rights abuses in Turkey. In the southeast, for example, the Turkish
   government is waging a full-blown war against its Kurdish population,
   while a failed coup d'etat in July 2016 put the country under a state of
   emergency that has led to even greater repression and growing reports of
   violations of asylum law. Ultimately, this agreement may fail, but it
   will remain necessary for the EU to cooperate with Turkey in order to
   control migration and work towards developing a comprehensive migration
   policy. Drawing on lessons from the agreement, this paper shall consider
   ways forward for future EU migration agreements with third countries.},

Abstract = {According to the Canadian constitution and related jurisprudence, the
   federal government has full authority to enter into treaties and also
   has jurisdiction over international trade. Nonetheless, provinces are
   playing an increasingly significant role in trade negotiations for two
   reasons: negotiations are increasingly impacting provincial
   jurisdictions and the federal government cannot impose its treaties on
   provinces. In this article we compare provincial participation in three
   major negotiations: CUSFTA with the United States, CETA between Canada
   and the European Union, and the Trans-Pacific Partnership.},

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL STUDIES QUARTERLY},

Volume = {61},

Abstract = {A state that enlists foreign fighters as extensions of its own military
   power confronts an acute principal-agent problem. While the state
   (principal) might benefit by delegating security responsibilities to
   foreigners (agents), it risks seeing its aims partially implemented,
   unfulfilled, or even subverted. For more than a century, the United
   States has attempted to mitigate this problem as it has raised, trained,
   and armed proxies to fight its small wars. But we find considerable
   variation in its approach across time and space. Why? Rationalist
   treatments of the agency problem face difficulty in accounting for this
   variation, as they focus on goal incongruity between the principal and
   agent. This downplays, if not ignores, the historical and social process
   that leads to different manifestations of goal incongruity. Thus, I
   propose a constructivist reworking of agency theory. I stress how the
   principal draws upon, and deploys, social knowledge to identify and
   manage the particular hazards that it believes its agent poses. Mining
   primary sources, I show that changing characterizations of local
   proxies-as either biologically or culturally flawed-led to different
   interpretations of the agency problem. In turn, this led American
   officials to adopt different approaches to mitigating it-ranging from
   outright paternalism to less direct tutelage.},

Abstract = {This article discusses Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) and in
   particular global IPR expansion. That globally protected intellectual
   property (IP) is more valuable than ever must be set against the fact
   that today's global network capitalism, in which IP is so valuable, also
   enables information to circulate beyond IP control. Similarly, global IP
   expansion and its resistance go hand in hand, as global IP expansionist
   policy contains but also encourages infringement. We document this
   conflict, the paradoxical space affording it, the boundary disputes that
   manifest it, and the global IP expansionist policy ratchet' designed,
   but which fails, to contain it. We then evaluate global IPRs and the
   case for extensions, as manifested in treaties such as ACTA, TPP and
   TTIP. This evaluation is undertaken though specific examinations of
   copyright, patent and trademark laws. Claims for the overall social
   benefit of global IP harmonisation and expansion policies are rejected.},

Abstract = {In electoral politics throughout the developing world, ``cheap talk{''}
   on food is the norm. When political parties are outside of the governing
   majority, they tend to express a strong commitment to providing food for
   the poor. When in power, their commitment to fulfilling the right to
   food wanes. This tendency prevails regardless of party orientation.
   India is a case in point. This article draws on original datasets and
   interview data to demonstrate the role that interest group and regional
   party dynamics play in perpetuating cheap talk on food in India, and the
   implications for fulfillment of the right to food there and beyond.},

Volume = {45},

Abstract = {The growing evidence of policy change patterns characterized as
   punctuated equilibrium has increasingly directed the attention of policy
   scholars to the question of what factors cause them. The present study
   attempts to address this emerging question by developing a
   comprehensive, multifactorial model and testing it with state budget
   data. Specifically, based on theories of information processing and
   agenda setting, it develops a conceptual framework that models
   punctuated policy change as a function of two main factors:
   institutional friction (consisting of institutional constraints,
   legislative streamlining mechanisms, information-processing capacity,
   and bureaucratization) and policy windows (consisting of revenue
   volatility, change in party control, and budget cycle). In doing so, the
   study pays special attention to cyclical revenue fluctuations whose
   effect has never been subject to empirical test. Regression analyses
   reveal that policy window factors including revenue volatility, changes
   in party control of the governorship and the House, and a budget cycle
   play an important role in creating policy punctuations.},

Abstract = {Social scientists have long debated the impact of interest group
   coalitions on public policies. While views on coalition impacts range
   from dominance to impotence, an emerging perspective suggests that
   coalitions have impacts under certain conditions. In this paper, we join
   and expand that perspective by arguing that coalitions have a
   conditional impact on public policies through ballot measures.
   Specifically, we argue that coalitions will have greater impact on
   ballot measure outcomes in non-presidential election years, when the
   stakes involved are high, and when the goals of the measure are diverse.
   We test these hypotheses with analyses of a dataset of over 2,400 ballot
   measures on spending for open space at the state and local level between
   1988 and 2014. We find strong support for our hypotheses. The findings
   have implications for scholarly debates on interest groups and

Abstract = {To better understand how the Advocacy Coalition Framework (ACF) is
   applied, this article catalogues and analyzes 161 applications of the
   ACF from 2007 to 2014. Building on a previous review of 80 applications
   of the ACF (1987-2006) conducted by Weible, Sabatier, and McQueen in
   2009, this review examines both the breadth and depth of the framework.
   In terms of breadth, there are over 130 unique first authors from 25
   countries, in almost 100 journals applying the framework, including a
   majority outside of the United States. In terms of depth, a plurality of
   applications analyzes environment and energy, subsystems at the national
   level, and utilizes qualitative methods of data collection and analyses.
   This review also explores how the three theoretical foci of the
   frameworkadvocacy coalitions, policy change, and policy-oriented
   learningare applied. Our findings suggest that the ACF balances common
   approaches for applying the framework with the specificity of particular
   contexts.},

Abstract = {While recent studies suggest the party loyalties of Members of
   Parliament (MPs) influence voting behaviour on free votes independently
   of personal preferences, it remains to be seen to what extent party
   loyalties influence MPs' voting behaviour more generally. To this end,
   this article examines the impact of the partisan context of the vote on
   the effects of party loyalties. Using data from 20 divisions decided
   largely as free votes and controlling for personal preferences using a
   survey measuring MPs' attitudes, the analysis shows that the effect of
   party loyalty on voting behaviour is strongest under the most partisan
   conditions: when the outcome is anticipated to be close and most
   consequential to the success/failure of a bill. These findings suggest
   party loyalty effects may emerge on other highly partisan divisions with
   partisan consequences and not appear on less partisan divisions.},

Title = {Elites and American structural power in the global economy},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL POLITICS},

Volume = {54},
Number = {3, SI},
Pages = {276-291},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {This article elaborates the nature of American structural power in order
   to link it to the elite networks identified elsewhere. Most of this
   special issue looks at elites in relation to instrumental and agenda
   setting power. But instrumental power-control over the machinery-is
   effective only to the degree that the machinery is effective, and the
   machinery is all about structural power. American global economic power
   rests on two structural foundations: the ability to unilaterally create
   credit in the global economy, and control over a disproportionate share
   of global production flows and the resulting stream of profits. Elites'
   ability to exploit the opportunities created by structural power makes
   them the prime beneficiaries of that power. Moreover, the selection
   mechanisms that sort individuals into elite networks, via cohort and
   socialization effects, assure that these individuals generally act in
   the interests of the organizations and institutions that they represent,

Title = {Different by Design? Analyzing How Governments Justify GMO
   Liberalization through the Lens of Strategic Communication},
Journal = {REVIEW OF POLICY RESEARCH},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {34},
Number = {3},
Pages = {331-356},

Abstract = {GMO liberalization can be seen as politically risky for policy actors;
   it confronts them with policy-specific strategic challenges and
   incentives regarding their policy communication. This perspective has
   received much more attention in association with two other kinds of
   policies, welfare state retrenchment and foreign policy. The aim of this
   paper is thus to situate GMO liberalization within a larger framework
   and to examine how governments deal with this kind of policy through
   their communication. The analysis looks at the liberalization of GMOs in
   Norway and the UK to examine how their communication depends on policy
   characteristics as well as country-specific conditions. The findings
   suggest that the communication of GMO liberalization differs markedly
   from the communication of welfare state retrenchment and foreign
   military interventions and that the typical features of GMO policies as
   well as the sociocultural context of the two countries mattered for how
   the governments have communicated GMO liberalization.},

Volume = {27},

Abstract = {Formal models of the appointments process typically cast the decision of
   the appointing executive as one where an open position is assumed and an
   appointee is chosen in order to maximize the utility of the executive
   (and perhaps that of the legislature if confirmation is required).
   However, several-often patronage-focused-processes within the
   appointments process focus instead on finding acceptable positions for
   ``necessary-to-place{''} individuals. Here, I develop a model where the
   goal is to find the best position for such an individual. In contrast to
   many existing models of the appointments process, I find that when the
   personnel process is focused on finding the best position for a given
   person as opposed to finding the best person for a given position,
   ``turkey farms{''}-agencies that have high numbers of
   minimally-competent (but necessary-to-place) individuals among their
   ranks-can result in equilibrium. Moreover, once agency capacity is
   sufficiently low, incompetent individual appointees no longer have
   detrimental effects on the utilities of the appointing principals, which
   further incentivizes the usage of certain agencies as ``turkey
   farms.{''}},

Title = {Uncharted Territoriality in Coproduction: The Motivations for 311
   Reporting},

Abstract = {A central question for programs that involve constituents in the
   coproduction of government services is: what motivates constituents to
   participate? This study compares two perspectives on this question: the
   traditional public-as-citizen model treats participation as a function
   of a general civic disposition that extends to many forms of civic and
   political participation (e.g. volunteering and voting); and we introduce
   the public-as-partner model, which argues that a given program might
   rely on any of the diverse array of human motivations, depending on the
   specific nature of participation required. We compare these using 311
   systems, which provide a hotline and online tools for requesting
   nonemergency government services (e.g. graffiti removal), evaluating
   whether using 311 to contribute to neighborhood maintenance primarily
   reflects a civic disposition or is additionally motivated by a capacity
   for territoriality (i.e. identifying with and claiming responsibility
   for spaces), per the public-as-partner model. The study links three
   forms of information at the individual level for a sample of 311 users
   from Boston, Massachusetts (n = 722): objective reporting activity,
   derived from the 311 archive; a user survey including self-reports of
   civic activities and territorial motives; and voter registration
   records. Controlling for demographics and the contextual effects of home
   neighborhood, higher territorial motives predicted a greater likelihood
   of a person reporting any issues of public concern and reporting more
   issues over a broader geographical range in one's home neighborhood
   (where >80\% of reports are made). Civic activities and voting predicted
   a greater likelihood of reporting in nonhome neighborhoods (e.g. work).
   This dichotomy highlights the distinction between the two models in
   conceptualizing the motivations for participation in coproduction. The
   article explores how to extend this logic to the assessment of
   participation, outreach, and disparities in access across programs.},

Abstract = {Since 2002, 26 U.S. states have passed laws that enhance restrictions on
   voters who intend to register and vote. Most have been sponsored by
   Republican legislators and passed by states with large Republican
   majorities. Proponents of such identification requirements argue that
   they are necessary to ensure the integrity of the electoral system by
   reducing voter fraud. Many Democrats have cried foul, arguing these laws
   are motivated by crass partisanship at best, and racial bias at worst,
   because they disproportionately disenfranchise minorities. Surprisingly,
   empirical evidence for significant demobilization, either in the
   aggregate or among Democrats specifically, has thus far failed to
   materialize. We suspect strong emotional reactions to the public debate
   about these laws may mobilize Democrats, counterbalancing the
   disenfranchising effect. We find support for this conjecture in a
   nationally representative survey and an experiment where news frames
   about voter identification (ID) laws are carefully manipulated.},

Abstract = {Business interest groups are crucial actors for tax policy-making, but
   it is still unclear under which conditions they are more successful than
   politicians in shaping taxation. This article argues that centralised
   coordination and high levels of policy integration make business
   interest groups more influential in the tax policy-making process. If
   there is no ideological convergence between agenda setters and business,
   highly centralised and well-integrated business interest groups are more
   successful in blocking or softening revenue-raising tax reforms or
   simply transferring tax burdens to consumers or non-organised citizens.
   To evaluate this theoretical framework, I have compiled an original
   dataset on business groups and associations for 18 countries in Latin
   America between 1990 and 2010. This theory uncovers a strong link
   between the patterns of business coordination and the feasibility of
   implementing distributive tax policies. This article also contributes to
   the study of business politics beyond the limited sample of developed
   countries.},

Abstract = {Given the growing complexity of health care, current global demographic
   and epidemiologic trends, adverse economic conditions in many parts of
   the world, and limited national budgets, it is increasingly difficult
   for policy makers and regulators to ensure continued access to
   affordable and high-quality health care. Decision-makers must implement
   policies that support efficient, equitable, and sustainable health
   systems. To that end, this special issue aims to foster dialogue on the
   current state of health-care financing and some of the challenges that
   lie ahead for health systems. The objectives of this special issue are
   threefold: (1) to analyse trends in health-care financing in a range of
   countries with varying degrees of economic development and political
   organization; (2) to review the viability of different financing models
   based on international experiences; and (3) to examine how efficiency in
   health care systems can be achieved without sacrificing quality. The
   issue consists of three sections and includes contributions from
   academic experts, health-care practitioners, and members of the broader
   stakeholder community.},

Abstract = {In this article, we investigate whether differences in social trust and
   impartial public administration have an impact on public confidence in
   EU crisis management institutions. Our assessment is based on a
   cross-country comparison using aggregate country-level data of the
   member states in the European Union. Earlier studies on the EU as a
   crisis manager have not carefully studied to what extent differences in
   social trust and administrative culture may or may not matter. Our
   analysis shows that in countries where citizens are treated impartially
   by their own national public administration institutions, people are
   less likely to support EU-coordinated civil protection efforts. In
   contrast, in places where citizens perceive their government's treatment
   of them as partial and unfair, citizens will tend to support
   EU-coordinated civil protection.},

Abstract = {Nighttime illumination can serve as a proxy for economic variables in
   particular in developing countries, where data are often not available
   or of poor quality. Existing research has demonstrated this for coarse
   levels of analytical resolution, such as countries, administrative units
   or large grid cells. In this article, we conduct the first fine-grained
   analysis of night lights and wealth in developing countries. The use of
   large-scale, geo-referenced data from the Demographic and Health Surveys
   allows us to cover 39 less developed, mostly non-democratic countries
   with a total sample of more than 34,000 observations at the level of
   villages or neighborhoods. We show that light emissions are highly
   accurate predictors of economic wealth estimates even with simple
   statistical models, both when predicting new locations in a known
   country and when generating predictions for previously unobserved
   countries.},

Abstract = {Transitional justice encompasses a variety of measures devised to
   overcome legacies of gross human rights violations and other historical
   injustices. The spread of international criminal tribunals, truth
   commissions, inclusive alternatives to purges, and apologies represents
   one of the most fascinating intellectual developments in legal and
   social studies. What do we know about the social efficacy of
   transitional justice measures? This article reviews 25 studies that
   provided quantitative evidence about the effects of transitional justice
   gathered at the individual-level analysis and situates them in the
   context of other studies on major transitional justice interventions:
   truth commissions, international criminal tribunals, lustration
   (vetting), reparation, and apologies. The article concludes that (1)
   transitional justice matters in dealing with the past; (2) justice is
   understood as a social-political category rather than a legal category;
   (3) past experiences affect attitudes to transitional justice as well as
   its outcomes; (4) different victims have needs for different
   transitional justice measures; (5) the outcomes of transitional justice
   depend on its context and implementation; (6) truth-sharing may produce
   both positive and negative effects; and (7) reconciliatory measures may
   produce positive social effects.},

Abstract = {Climate change is a collective action problem that has often been
   analyzed as a Prisoner's Dilemma. States have an incentive to free ride
   on the efforts of others. Yet around the globe national and sub-national
   governments are introducing regulatory measures to reduce emissions that
   can be fairly characterized as unilateral actions. The US and China, the
   world's two largest emitters, are at the forefront. Indeed the evidence
   of states beginning to depart from business-as-usual behavior raises the
   possibility that the characterizations of climate change as a Prisoner's
   Dilemma may apply less strongly to the problem and that something else
   may be starting to happen. Accordingly, this article considers: (i) to
   what extent nations are taking unilateral action to address climate
   change; and (ii) in the context of climate change, which is considered
   one of the greatest global collective action problems the world has
   faced, what are the possible economic explanations for nations to act in
   a unilateral fashion and what are the normative reasons for doing so. We
   justify regulatory unilateralism on economic, geopolitical and moral
   grounds, and argue that regulatory unilateralism may offer the best hope
   of triggering a race to cut emissions. A race rather than prolonged
   negotiations is what is required at this moment in climate history.},

Abstract = {The four Visegrad states (V4) of Central Europe play an important role
   in facilitating closer relationship between the European Union (EU) and
   its eastern neighbours. In particular, they seek to achieve this through
   increased cross-border mobility as a means of supporting institutional
   reforms, sharing know-how, and promoting cross-border economic
   development. Such approach is of particular interest in highlighting the
   V4's different response to preventing uncontrolled migration from the
   southern neighbourhood, in contrast to managing legal migration across
   the Union's eastern border. Previous studies of the Visegrad states'
   role in the eastern neighbourhood often point to the historical
   discourse, or simply assume unspecified existing ``interests.{''}
   However, an assessment lacks into the extent to which the V4's
   increasing role in the neighbourhood is based on a historical discourse
   seeking to revive past connections, or an interest (security)-based
   approach shrouded in normative agenda.
   The article argues that while the V4 states might pursue visa
   liberalisation with the eastern neighbours for diverse reasons (ends),
   the four states employ a shared normative agenda (means), which includes
   (1) a shift from the ``exclusive{''} impact of Fortress Europe towards
   ``politics of inclusion{''} and (2) recognition of the transformational
   impact of cross-border mobility in areas as diverse as minority rights,
   promotion of democratic governance, and economic cooperation.},

Abstract = {Until 2014, security responses to the Boko Haram insurgency were largely
   domestic and military. However, the increasing expansion of Boko Haram
   attacks in the Lake Chad Basin (LCB), compounded by the consequent
   humanitarian crisis, compelled a joint security action. This came in the
   form of the rejuvenated Multinational Joint Task Force (MNJTF),
   comprising forces from the LCB member states (Nigeria, Cameroon, Niger,
   and Chad) and Benin. My goal in this paper is to interrogate the
   cross-border dynamics and ramifications of the Boko Haram insurgency,
   and the nature of security responses to it. The analysis extends to the
   politics of cross-border security cooperation against Boko Haram in the
   LCB, as well as the impact of the MNJTF on Boko Haram's evolving
   tactics. Along the way, the paper identifies key challenges to the
   effective operationalisation of the MNJTF.},

Abstract = {This article aims to contribute to the analysis of Brazilian grand
   strategy and the place of UN peace operations (POs) in the context of
   this strategy. It deals with the political economy of POs and grapples
   with the trends of POs in the recent past, especially the increasingly
   robust mandates of peace operations and their implications. Brazilian
   participation in peace operations is discussed, focusing on its main
   characteristics and the consequences of an absence of consensus on the
   role of POs for the country's grand strategy. Finally, suggestions are
   proposed that might create synergies between participation in POs and
   Brazil's grand strategy.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF EUROPEAN PUBLIC POLICY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {24},
Number = {7},
Pages = {1006-1026},
Abstract = {When important public issues are debated, many options for government
   action should be subjected to serious reflection. Constrained
   discussions over policy options may hamper democratic legitimacy and
   accountability, and produce decisions that ignore relevant reasons and
   facts. Hence, constrained deliberation has important consequences for
   knowledge construction and utilization. We advance theory on epistemic
   policy learning' by showing mechanisms that promote expert consensus in
   external arenas, and that these can hamper deliberation on public
   policy. Government-appointed experts, in combination with mass media,
   can freeze' deliberation by presenting one unified front. Comparison of
   national print media coverage in Sweden and Denmark during the 2009 H1N1
   influenza pandemic offers support. The similar polities enacted
   different policies: Sweden sought to vaccinate its full population while
   neighbouring Denmark targeted small groups. Yet experts dominated both
   public discourses and echoed each other's support of national policy. In
   turn, public policy debates were scant in both contexts.},

   community and homeland: a phenomenal task not undertaken lightly, but
   shouldered by a nations' government, its public and private sectors, and
   its people. They must all be willing to respond to the rapidly changing
   conditions that ricochet around the world at breakneck speed.{''}(1)
   -H.H. Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum
   ``We are building a new reality for our people, a new future for our
   children, and a new model of development.{''}
   -H.H. Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum
   H.H. Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum (Sheikh Mohammed), the Prime
   Minister and Vice President of UAE and Ruler of Dubai, was on the way to
   the Expo 2020 site. He had a habit of getting up early in the morning
   and doing surprise inspections of government organizations and critical
   projects. Often he drove alone, as this was more convenient. This habit
   of his allowed him to keep a pulse on the city and the country and
   ensure its future development. (2,3,30)
   Dubai had won the World Expo 2020 bid in November 2013. The theme for
   the Expo was ``Connecting Minds, Creating the Future.{''}(4) This was a
   milestone in the history of the World Expo as it was the first time that
   the event was to be staged in the Middle East, North Africa, and South
   Asia region.
   While most Expos traditionally draw regional customers, like in Milan,
   and domestic customers, like in China, it was hoped that Dubai's
   standing as an ancient meeting place and as a modern crossroad for
   nations and societies, would be able to attract international visitors
   from all over the world. Expo 2020 Dubai was expected to host 180
   countries and to bring over 25 million people to the region, adding more
   than US\$ 23 billion to the UAE's gross domestic product (GDP). 5 Of
   these visitors, 70\% were expected to be from outside UAE - a first in
   the history of the Expo.
   The Expo 2020 logo design was based on an artifact found at the
   archeological site called Saroug Al Hadeed, dating over 4000 years. It
   is a ring of gold with concentric circles. This site was identified from
   air when Sheikh Mohammed had been flying across the desert in 2002. He
   said of the logo (see Exhibit 2.1):
   ``{[}This logo] represents our message to the world that our
   civilisation has deep roots. We were and will always be a pot that
   gathers civilisations and a centre for innovation ... The people who
   lived in this land had a deep creative spirit and today the people of
   this country are building the nation's future for centuries to
   come.{''}(6)
   Dubai, under Sheikh Mohammed's leadership, has become a global city,
   embracing the best of its Arab heritage. UAE had successfully
   diversified away from oil. The non-hydrocarbon share of the economy was
   over 69\% in 2016 and the expectation was that oil revenues will be 5\%
   of GDP by 2021.(7) The focus for the future was to increase
   competitiveness in foreign markets especially looking at trade,
   entrepreneurship and on seven high-value-adding innovation sectors like
   renewable energy, transport, education, health, technology, water, and
   space. 8 UAE wanted to use cultural diplomacy to promote stronger
   relationships with other countries. From a human capacity point of view,
   enrich the lives of the citizens through social, health and cultural
   initiatives and balance the regional tensions through humanitarian
   endeavors. On September 28, 2016, Sheikh Mohammed launched the UAE
   Strategy of the Future under the directives of the President, His
   Highness Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan (Sheikh Khalifa). Sheikh
   Mohammed said,
   ``As a nation, we have always been forward-looking and planning for the
   future, which has been a key driver of our success. The UAE Strategy for
   the Future is our new approach to planning for the future by predicting,
   analysing and implementing highly effective action plans that accelerate
   development ... The strategy serves as the referral point for
   governmental departments to adopt proactive future planning to usher in
   an even more prosperous tomorrow for our current and future generations.
   To achieve its goals, we must work together and share responsibilities.
   With our future planning model, we will serve as a model for the world.
   The citizens of the UAE are our most important resource in building our
   future. To nurture their skills, we will strengthen education and
   training initiatives.. We will shape the future of the UAE through this
   forward-looking strategy.{''}(9)
   In 2016, Sheikh Mohammed celebrated 10 years as Ruler of Dubai and Vice
   President of UAE. Sheikh Khalifa said,
   ``My brother His Highness Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum has
   completed ten years of ruling and leading a rational and sophisticated
   government, one of the most advanced and efficient governments in
   managing its services.{[}He has] managed to raise the standard of the
   government's competitiveness internationally by establishing
   institutions and work teams that focus on satisfying citizens and making
   them happy. We watched with appreciation over the ten years, {[}as]
   Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid's government, which is characterized {[}by]
   its ability to establish coordination between federal and local
   governments, form national teams and formulate strategic plans to
   achieve the vision of the leadership and continue developing the
   construction laid down by the founders alongside his fellow members of
   the Supreme Council and Rulers of the Emirates.{''}
   Sheikh Mohammed wanted to make the government nimble and responsive to
   the needs of its citizens by adopting the best practices of the private
   sector and embedding technology. At the 2013 World Government Summit
   held in Dubai, the first of its kind in the region, Sheikh Mohammed
   outlined his future vision for the government sector. It was during the
   Summit that he introduced the three-finger salute, symbolizing Win,
   Victory, and Love that has become a trademark sign of his that stands
   for the work ethic, success, and love he has for the nation (see Exhibit
   2.2). As Prime Minister, he continues to launch several initiatives 10
   all in preparation for the year 2021 and beyond. The year 2021 would be
   the Golden Jubilee of the Union.
   The UAE 2021 Vision aims for UAE to be in the top 10 countries in the
   world according to the Global Competitiveness Index, Global
   Entrepreneurship and Development Index (GEDI), and Global Innovation
   Index among other things. What are key focus areas in the years ahead?},

Abstract = {On January 27, 2016, the Mohammed Bin Rashid School of Government
   (MBRSG) hosted a focus group event on ``Family business in the UAE
   challenges, opportunities and lessons.{''} The event uncovered the
   perspectives of family businesses in the UAE in terms of succession
   planning, resilience of family businesses, legal practices, and
   entrepreneurship. This case study highlights the theory behind the
   notions of family businesses with supporting perspectives and examples
   from the hosted event at MBRSG. Interviews were conducted with His
   Excellency Sheikh Sultan Khaled Al-Qassimi, Chairman and CEO of Gulf
   Holdings, Her Excellency Fatima Obaid Al Jaber, Chief Operating Officer,
   Al Jaber Group His Excellency Mohammed Abdul Jalil Al Fahim, Honorary
   Chairman of Al Fahim Group of Companies and a few others. Ideally, the
   focus group discussed the challenges, opportunities and lessons learnt
   with it comes to succession planning and legacies for future
   generations. The context of this case understands that a family business
   in the UAE is a business in which entails at least 51 percent of the
   shares are owned by one single UAE family and at least one member of the
   management team is drawn from the family that owns the business.},

Abstract = {Stability, security and democracy are typically perceived as objectives
   of the European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP). As a result, scholars
   usually reflect on their rival or complementary character, debating EU
   pursuit of interests (stability and security) or values (democracy).
   This article argues that objectives should also be seen as components of
   a narrative, which is a product of strategic agency of EU institutions
   seeking internal legitimacy. While examining key ENP strategy documents,
   the article identifies two major shifts in the ENP narrative. Whereas
   literature usually focuses on how narratives are reproduced and
   sustained when confronted with contestation, this article seeks to
   explain why actors opt for narrative reconstruction instead of narrative
   reproduction. The argument stipulates that narrative shifts are related
   to actors' legitimacy concerns enhanced by uncertainty and insecurity
   resulting from internal and external crises.},

Journal = {LATIN AMERICAN PERSPECTIVES},

Volume = {44},

Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {The current crisis in Venezuela is sometimes said to have been provoked
   by the response of imperialism and the local oligarchy to the
   fundamental changes in economic and political relations fostered during
   the administrations of Hugo Chavez. A quantitative study using various
   statistical sources shows that the significant increase in oil rent
   during the Chavez presidency did not translate into a qualitative
   transformation in the form of state intervention and that, although
   social expenditures increased in that period, most of the income that
   allowed this was obtained through currency overvaluation by inefficient
   national and foreign capital. The current crisis is, therefore, evidence
   of the limits of low-productivity state and private capital reproduction
   due to the decline in oil prices rather than of a conflict between
   overcoming and reproducing capitalism in an alleged ``economic war.{''}},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF EUROPEAN PUBLIC POLICY},

Pages = {1328-1347},
Abstract = {This contribution investigates what motivates the use of European Union
   (EU) law at the street level of migration law implementation. The street
   level is a crucial venue for EU implementation because lower-level
   implementers critically influence the level of EU compliance eventually
   achieved. Employing a bottom-up approach towards implementation, the
   article combines insights from social psychology and the street-level
   literature to develop expectations about the relation between
   individuals' motivations and their use of EU law. The study investigates
   through qualitative interviews to what extent German migration
   administrators use EU law in three multilevel decision contexts. The
   main findings are that uses of EU law vary across contexts and
   individual implementers. Particularly when national regulatory
   frameworks are ambiguous, substantive moral norms and instrumental
   motivations trigger some implementers to rely on EU law. This reliance
   even has the potential to correct for problematic transposition.},

Abstract = {While the January 2015 Paris terrorist attacks presented a crucial
   opportunity for far-right mobilisation, the focus on liberal democratic
   values and Charlie Hebdo's non-conformist progressive profile presented
   challenges for right-wing discourse. Taking Italy as a paradigmatic case
   of public controversies on cultural and religious affairs, this article
   examines the opportunities and constraints generated by multicultural
   crises for far-right framing choices. A qualitative frame analysis
   analyses the discourse of three types of far-right actors. While the
   populist radical right, extreme right, and ultra-religious right groups
   disagree on crucial criteria for outgroup exclusion, they collectively
   employed the Charlie Hebdo controversy to redefine their exclusionary
   discourse on liberal grounds with the goal of gaining legitimacy in the
   mainstream public sphere.},

Abstract = {This paper investigates the design and implementation of Kosovo's
   post-war privatisation regime with reference to the policy ideas
   developed and negotiated within the bounds of Kosovo's international
   transitional administration (UNMIK). Drawing on constructivist analyses
   of institutional change, we rely on semi-structured interviews with
   international officials and a review of legal documents to argue that
   the process of institutional change was driven largely by a contest
   between conflicting legal norms, rather than a contest between
   politically organised interest-based groups. International legal experts
   mobilised various competing normative paradigms residing in the
   background of policy debates to persuade domestic political actors that
   privatisation was in their interest, and to legitimise or disqualify the
   proposed neoliberal privatisation programme. However, the lack of
   consensus on the background paradigm ushered in a protracted period of
   ideational contestation. Privatisation in post-war Kosovo was
   essentially about the `politics of law', as the legalisation of
   privatisation policy led inevitably to the contentious politicisation of
   legal norms.},

Abstract = {Far from leading us to conclude that the fabric of history is
   continuous, does not a reconstruction of the genealogy of democratic
   representations reveal the extent of the break within it? And so, rather
   than seeing democracy as a new episode in the transfer of the religious
   into the political, should we not conclude that the old transfers from
   one register to the other were intended to ensure the preservation of a
   form which has since been abolished, that the theological and the
   political became divorced, that a new experience of the institution of
   the social began to take shape, that the religious is reactivated at the
   weak points of the social, that its efficacy is no longer symbolical but
   imaginary and that, ultimately, it is an expression of the
   unavoidable-and no doubt ontological-difficulty democracy has in reading
   its own story- and the difficulty political or philosophical thought has
   in assuming, without making it travesty, the tragedy of the modern
   condition?},

Title = {Indications and warning in Belgium: Brussels is not Delphi},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF STRATEGIC STUDIES},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {40},
Number = {7},
Pages = {927-962},
Abstract = {The terrorist attacks in France and Belgium of 2015-2016 that occurred
   while these countries were in a heightened state of alert raise
   questions about indications and warning methodology as well as
   effectiveness of the blanket-protection deployment of security services
   assisted even by the military. Response and perhaps even more
   anticipation may require strategic rethinking in light of the predatory
   attacks that target the most vulnerable spots of the public space. This
   study looks at threat analysis in Belgium as conducted through her
   intelligence fusion centre Coordination Unit for Threat Analysis (CUTA)
   since its inception in 2006. With a special focus on what is known, at
   the time of writing, about the terrorist attacks in Paris and Brussels,
   this study hopes to put into context how the system (mal) functions and
   will also consider the preventivemeasures that respond to the threat,
   and the international aspects which have implications far beyond Belgian
   borders. Therefore, a case is made for not just a Belgian homeland
   security framework, but one that fits into an EU-wide security concept.},

Abstract = {The year 1989 represented a decisive turn for the countries of Central
   Europe. With the breakdown of Communist regime a society based on market
   economy, political liberalism, and freedom of belief was
   (re)established. In the Czech environment, harsh atheism, anti-religious
   propaganda, persecution of believers, and dissolution of religious life
   were all parts of the Communist ideology and practice. The Velvet
   Revolution' meant, among others, also the opening of possibilities for
   independent religious life. The rise of religious freedom was
   accompanied by genuine religious plurality and the incoming or founding
   of new religious communities. Immediately, criticism of these
   non-traditional groups appeared (the so-called anti-cult movement)
   labelling the new groups as sects and perceiving them as a threat. The
   movement saw its task in facing up to this threat. The aim of this paper
   is to analyse and compare anti-sectarian narratives in Communist and
   post-Communist eras. The text raises the question of whether there exist
   interpretative frameworks transferrable in time and across diverse
   political and social conditions.},

Abstract = {The fishes of Lake Tana show impressive diversity and unprecedented
   uniqueness. The lake harbors the only species flock of large cyprinids
   in the world, and of the 28 known species, approximately 68\% are
   endemic to the lake. Most of the habitats harboring the ichthyofaunal
   diversity of this lake are relatively intact, and still naturally
   attractive. Most of the fisheries development activities are
   characterized by the traditional reed-raft gillnet fishery and some
   motorized boat gillnet fishery. Fish production from capture fisheries
   including Nile tilapia, Large African barbs and African catfish from the
   lake and its influent and effluent rivers has not yet been able to
   satisfy the ever-growing local demand for fish. No alternative
   aquaculture production system has been developed. Current and past
   research findings depict the importance of the fish and the fisheries in
   Lake Tana, as well as the challenges that these valuable resources are
   facing. Fast increase in human population of the Lake Tana Sub-basin and
   associated human-induced impacts are degrading the natural habitats and
   negatively affecting the fish and the fisheries. The impact on the
   fishes occurs indiscriminately and does not appear taxon-specific.
   However, endemic taxa such as the Large African barbs of the lake can be
   more prone than other widely distributed species. Further research,
   development and conservation activities need to consider proper planning
   and implementation to preserve the fishes and the fisheries in the Lake
   Tana Sub-basin.},

Abstract = {This paper analyses the interplay between international intervention and
   the functioning of the domestic political system in post-war Bosnia and
   Herzegovina. The Dayton Peace Agreement set up a formally sovereign
   consociational power sharing system in which international actors
   nevertheless kept intervening. By doing so, they changed the character
   of the system and, more importantly, the incentive structures for
   political action. The result is an `imposed consociational democracy'
   which promotes extremist rather than accommodative behaviour. Relying on
   interviews with former High Representatives and domestic political
   decision-makers, as well as a longitudinal analysis of newspaper
   coverage, this paper seeks to outline the evolution of the ` imposed
   consociational' system in Bosnia and Herzegovina and its contribution to
   the challenges the country faces today.},

Abstract = {This paper examines ethnofederalism track-record on dealing with the
   indigenous communities who had lived in isolation from the rest of
   Ethiopia until very recently. The particular focus is on the Majang
   people, who inhabit the dense forests of Gambella region. In recent
   years, the Majang have found themselves in contact with rapid
   industrialisation, which brought in investors and settlers into their
   traditional lands. The Majang lack the modern resources to make use of
   the institutional possibilities brought by ethnofederalism. This
   indicates the need to move beyond the lens of ethnofederalism and
   incorporate analytical lenses from the study of indigenous movements.},

   of strategic concepts that were out-of-step with the military
   environment in which it was operating. It maintains that the Alliance
   acquiesced to American leadership on nuclear issues which led to the
   development of tactical nuclear capabilities at the expense of
   conventional war-fighting capabilities for the defence of the European
   Central Front. This resulted in a strategic concept that enhanced
   political cohesion but was militarily unviable.},

Abstract = {Many empirical studies have found that local public contracting reduces
   the inputs and outcomes of public services. However, few studies have
   examined what factors are associated with such inputs and outcomes. To
   address the limitation, this study conceptualizes two competing
   contracting management models (competitive and cooperative) and
   empirically tests the associations between these contracting approaches
   and service inputs and outcomes. The findings report that while local
   governments using competitive contracting elements have lower service
   inputs through reduced local operating expenditures and part-time
   employment; cooperative contracting elements do not necessarily produce
   enhanced service outcomes.},

   with their surroundings, i.e., the emergence of the connected car, we
   see a greater need for cyber security solutions applied within the
   automotive industry and transportation systems. Since millions of
   vehicles and potentially human lives could be affected, the connected
   car scenario can be seen as a critical infrastructure where both
   security and safety are equally paramount. It is imperative to consider
   appropriate cyber security solutions, and especially take into
   consideration solutions that will fulfill automotive requirements in
   terms of safety, performance and cost. This chapter explores automotive
   security advancements such as automotive-grade hardware security
   modules, secure vehicle-to-X (V2X, i.e., vehicle-to-vehicle and
   vehicle-to-infrastructure) communications, secure in-vehicle
   communications and embedded security evaluations of automotive
   components. Automotive hardware security based on EVITA, serves as a
   trust anchor where additional security solutions can be built upon. V2X
   communication is protected based on established industry standards to
   provide both authenticity and privacy. A Secure Onboard Communication
   module is responsible for providing secure in-vehicle network
   communication. For security evaluations, both theoretical evaluations
   and practical security testing of embedded systems are becoming
   increasingly important. Above security advancements provide an insight
   into what is necessary to protect a critical infrastructure such as
   transportation systems.},

Abstract = {One of the most important roles in counterinsurgency (COIN) is to
   maintain adequate security presence to protect lives and properties of
   the affected population and restore law and order in the society.
   Accordingly, the state of affairs in Nigeria's COIN theater has been
   affected by the quantity and quality of security presence, most
   especially the ability of the operatives to gather timely and relevant
   information and mobilize for prompt response. Although the roles of the
   ground operatives have dominated public attention, the local air force
   and the complementary air powers have affected the security situations
   with the level of their presence or absence in the sky for intelligence,
   surveillance, and reconnaissance; firepower; and transportation in the
   theater. This study examines the relevance of security presence to
   achieve the objective of COIN and the prospects of air power in this
   arrangement in Nigeria and the Lake Chad region.},

Abstract = {Integration is an approach used in practical evidence-based policy
   development to learn and share insights between different disciplines,
   models, policy arenas, methods, audiences, researchers and policy
   makers. The aim of this article is to use an institutional perspective
   to investigate an integrative research programme, the Murray-Darling
   Basin Futures Collaborative Research Network based at the University of
   Canberra, Australia, analysing the actors, resources and rules used to
   deliver integration outcomes. This innovative examination of integration
   provides some new insights for the integration literature as well as for
   policy makers and academics involved in integration programmes.
   Specifically the paper identifies that both the formal and informal
   rules are significant in facilitating the process of integration across
   research teams, themes and projects. The case study highlights the
   merits of multiple integration activities structured to encompass
   diverse integration approaches, modes of communication, actors and media
   across both social and cognitive outcomes. It also identifies that the
   set of necessary institutional conditions for integration (i.e.
   favourable institutional arrangements, suitable integrating framework
   and available resources) are not sufficient for delivery unless values
   and behaviour and incentives for action are also achieved.},

Journal = {REVISTA BRASILEIRA DE POLITICA INTERNACIONAL},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {60},
Number = {1},
Abstract = {Constructivism in International Relations (IR) is popular, but
   constructivists seem disappointed. Allegedly something has been lost.
   Such criticisms are misplaced. There was never a uniform Constructivism.
   Since constructivism is socially constructed, to argue that
   constructivism has evolved ``wrongly{''} is odd. This paper explains the
   dissatisfaction with constructivism followed by a second reading of its
   evolution as a tale of two cognitions. These two cognitions distinguish
   genera in the constructivist ``family{''}. A criticism against one genus
   based on the cognition of the other is unfair. A focus on cognitions and
   the use of genera helps in perceiving constructivism's future evolution.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF CHINESE GOVERNANCE},

Volume = {2},

Pages = {127-148},
Abstract = {The previous studies about Chinese policy process give predominant focus
   in the agenda setting or proposing policy issue stage. There is limited
   record and analysis on the policymaking process. Once agenda is set, it
   is government's responsibility to formulate practical and applicable
   policy terms. Therefore, a close examination of how local government
   makes policies is needed. The purpose of this case study is to unveil
   the basic policymaking process practiced in local Chinese government and
   also to establish a starting point for further analysis. The question of
   how and how much citizen participation is involved in the formal and
   legal day-to-day policy process is answered in this particular case
   study. Hence, from the purpose, this paper is descriptive to infer the
   concept of citizen participation in Chinese local government agencies
   and, if possible, to develop theoretical implications to the formal
   Chinese local policy process.},

Abstract = {The framework for equality and the multiple aspects of identity that are
   protected in law, including on the basis of religion and belief, are
   continuously being redefined and reshaped through ongoing legal claims
   in England and Wales. In this article, we examine how religious
   organizations view equality and the extent to which different identity
   rights can be protected. We conducted a survey of religious
   organizations in England and Wales to examine attitudes and experiences
   in relation to changes in the equality laws. We found that equality is
   variously understood and many religious organizations give only limited
   recognition to certain legally protected characteristics including
   gender, sexual orientation and also the identities of other religious
   organizations. If the integration of equality in the form of identity
   rights is to be fully achieved within the legal framework of a liberal
   democratic state and alongside so-called British values, both religious
   and non-religious citizens alike need to take a greater responsibility
   for the understanding and recognition of identity differences.
   Equalities legislation is creating a constitutional framework for
   citizenship and it is important this new citizenship is structured
   around equality in practice at the individual and organizational level.},

Abstract = {This article analyses the institutional entrepreneurship within
   independent regulatory agencies (IRAs) as a variable explaining policy
   change over time and seeks to offer new insight for the identification
   and analysis of structure-agency relationships. The article contributes
   to the institutional entrepreneurship research agenda by connecting
   changes in IRA consumer protection policy to changes in agency
   leadership (specifically, agency presidents). The method used relies
   upon a quantitative and qualitative text analysis approach to connect
   and pinpoint structure-agency dynamics over time. The empirical sections
   compare and contrast the results obtained through the content analysis
   of the annual reports issued between 2000 and 2015 by the Italian
   Communications Authority (Agcom), and illustrate variations between
   periodic changes to Agcom's presidency and changes in ideas, strategies
   and tools in the field of consumer protection in the telecommunications
   sector.},

   evidence-based policy. A response to Newman},
Journal = {CRITICAL POLICY STUDIES},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {11},
Number = {2},
Pages = {235-245},
Abstract = {In his article, Newman aims at overcoming the binary rift between
   rationalists and constructivists, between supporters and opponents of
   evidence-based policy. Both positions, he argues, are not as
   incompatible as it seems. They could coexist by understanding that
   rationalists seek to reduce the influence of ideology on policy and that
   constructivists can show the difficulties of this task. The
   argumentative steps leading to his `deconstruction' of the debate,
   however, do not reflect well the complexity of the subject. The response
   therefore aims at reconstructing the debate over evidence-based policy
   by focusing on three main points: first, the deficits of the distinction
   between rationalists and constructivists; second, the political
   dimension of evidence and the relationship between knowing and
   governing; third, the different uses of evidence in political and
   cultural contexts. Under the conditions of the postnational
   constellation, ignoring the political dimension of evidence and the
   cultural contexts in which expertise operates may even intensify the
   controversies. There are, however, also promising attempts to critically
   redefine the principles and modes of evidence-based policy beyond simple
   dichotomies.},

   SINGLE-PARTY STATE},
Year = {2017},
Pages = {276-299},
Abstract = {Beyond the headline findings, five additional themes emerged from our
   research. First, Chinese governance reforms must be understood on their
   own terms and in the context of the Chinese policymaking process.
   Second, Chinese reforms were only partially successful. Many were not
   fully implemented or failed to achieve the full extent of the outcomes
   envisioned for them. Third, there is no single Chinese model; approaches
   to governance varied widely over time and across Chinese provinces.
   Fourth, reforms were most successful when accompanied by other reform
   initiatives. Fifth, Chinese governance reforms were intentionally not
   embedded in permanent and self-reinforcing institutions. After reviewing
   these themes, we reflect on the implications of our research for the
   future of the Chinese regime. Our analysis draws from the burgeoning
   literatures on authoritarian institutions, regime transition, and
   democratization. We offer the provocative perspective that these reforms
   may pave the way for successful democratization in two respects. First,
   the legacy of a high-quality bureaucracy and strong governance has been
   shown to influence the success of democratic transitions. Second,
   enhanced legitimacy may enable the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), like
   other single-party regime, to concede from a position of strength -
   allowing multiparty competition because it believes it can win in a free
   and fair contest.},

Pages = {103-122},
Abstract = {Background: There is growing interest in psychosocial factors with
   positive attitudes, such as interpersonal trust, as determinants for
   Quality-of-life (QOL) or subjective well-being. Despite their longevity,
   Japanese people report a relatively poor subjective well-being, as well
   as lower interpersonal trust. Our aim in this study was to evaluate the
   possible association between interpersonal trust and QOL among Japanese
   people.
   Methodology and Principal Findings: Based on the cross-sectional data
   for Japanese adults (2008), we analyzed the relationship between
   interpersonal trust and each of four domains of the WHOQOL-BREF.
   Interpersonal trust was assessed using three scales for trust in people,
   in human fairness and in human nature. In a total of 1000 participants
   (mean age: 45 years; 49\% women), greater trust was recognized among
   women (vs. men), those aged 60-69 (vs. 20-29), or the high-income group
   (vs. low-income). Each of three trust scales was positively correlated
   with all domains of QOL. Multiple linear-regression models were
   constructed for each of QOL and the principal component score of the
   trust scales, adjusted for age, gender, area size of residence, income,
   education, and occupation. For all QOL domains, interpersonal trust was
   significantly and positively associated with better QOL with p,0.001 for
   all four domains including physical, psychological, social, and
   environmental QOL. Other factors associated with QOL included gender,
   age class, area size of residence, and income. Education and occupation
   were not associated with QOL.
   Conclusions and Significance: Greater interpersonal trust is strongly
   associated with a better QOL among Japanese adults. If a causal
   relationship is demonstrated in a controlled interventional study,
   social and political measures should be advocated to increase
   interpersonal trust for achieving better QOL.},

   later},
Journal = {REVISTA BRASILEIRA DE POLITICA INTERNACIONAL},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {60},
Number = {2},
Abstract = {UNASUR and its Defence Council (SADC) were created under a promising
   scenario of regional cooperation. Almost ten years later, a growing
   demand for regional cooperation arises, facing, however, low levels of
   political willingness from local governments. Through the lenses of
   structural and neoclassical realism, this paper suggests that the lack
   of support by governments, especially the Brazilian one, due to a change
   in how domestic ideas are developed, and a transformation in the
   regional balance of power, have contributed to these institutions' quick
   obsolescence.},

   governance: the cases of climate engineering, REDD plus and short-lived
   climate pollutants},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL POLITICS},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {26},
Number = {4},
Pages = {669-693},
Abstract = {How and why do institutional architectures, and the roles of private
   institutions therein, differ across separate areas of climate
   governance? Here, institutional complexity is explained in terms of the
   problem-structural characteristics of an issue area and the associated
   demand for, and supply of, private authority. These characteristics can
   help explain the degree of centrality of intergovernmental institutions,
   as well as the distribution of governance functions between these and
   private governance institutions. This framework is applied to three
   emerging areas of climate governance: reducing emissions from
   deforestation and forest degradation (REDD+), short-lived climate
   pollutants (SLCPs) and climate engineering. Conflicts over means and
   values, as well as over relatively and absolutely assessed goods, lead
   to considerable variations in the emergence and roles of private
   institutions across these three cases.},

Abstract = {In established democracies, parties provide ideological cues either with
   their policy stances or with their social group affiliations. In new
   democracies, these signals are still ambiguous. What determines the
   meaning attached to ideological labels in such circumstances? Existing
   explanations emphasise country-specific ethno-linguistic cleavages. I
   propose a different explanation, which rests on the ideological legacy
   of the authoritarian past. Dictatorships are linked either to the left
   or to the right. This association between ideology and the authoritarian
   past persists after the democratic transition, distorting people's
   perceptions of the meaning of ideological labels. This distortion
   translates into a bias against the ideology of the dictator. As the
   party system consolidates, however, the role of history is overcome by
   the accumulation of democratic experience. Focusing on the case of
   Greece, I propose a modelling framework to test the presence of this
   bias, its observational implications and its evolution along the process
   of party system consolidation.},

Abstract = {This article is the first comparative study of the policies taken by
   Russian and Ukrainian emigre's, governments and intellectuals towards
   the legacy of Soviet leader Joseph Stalin. The article analyses how
   these differing approaches have contributed to diverging national
   identities in Russia and Ukraine which preceded, and were reinforced by,
   the 2014 crisis in their relations and war between both countries.
   Stalinization was not a central question for Russian emigres and was
   supported by 50 out of 69 years of the USSR and since 2000 by the
   Russian state. Ukrainian emigres were more influential and the state
   actively supported de-Stalinization over the majority of 25 years of
   independent statehood that integrated de-Stalinisation with national
   identity and since 2015, de-communization. (C) 2017 The Regents of the

Abstract = {This article reviews how scale concepts feature in governance studies
   and demonstrates that scales are overwhelmingly used descriptively.
   Questioning the meaning of scales has been considered peripheral to
   pursuing the aims of public administration studies, and the article
   calls for this to change by conceptualizing scale as a political
   concept. Focusing on the localism agenda reflected in England's academy
   schools policy', the article empirically demonstrates the political
   nature of scale by identifying how the local' functions as a powerful
   political discourse. Analysis shows scales being used strategically by
   frontline workers, exposing scale as a malleable concept for resisting
   or supporting political agendasa practice which is called scalecraft'.
   Revealing contrasting meanings of the local enables analysis to suggest
   how and why localism has been met with contrasting degrees of
   controversy. The article suggests how this new approach to scale can be
   integrated in future studies of governance and frontline work.},

Abstract = {Numbers permeate modern political communication. While current
   scholarship on framing effects has focused on the persuasive effects of
   words and arguments, this article shows that framing of numbers can also
   substantially affect policy preferences. Such effects are caused by
   ratio bias, which is a general tendency to focus on numerators and pay
   insufficient attention to denominators in ratios. Using a
   population-based survey experiment, I demonstrate how differently framed
   but logically equivalent representations of the exact same numerical
   value can have large effects on citizens' preferences regarding salient
   political issues such as education and taxes. Furthermore, the effects
   of numerical framing are found across most groups of the population,
   largely regardless of their political predisposition and their general
   ability to understand and use numerical information. These findings have
   significant implications for our understanding of framing effects and
   the role played by numbers in public opinion formation.},

Abstract = {Do leaders of challenger' parties adopt a niche' strategy in national
   televised debates? This article answers this question by analysing the
   content of the two multiparty televised leaders' debates that took place
   ahead of the 2015 British general election. Using computer-aided text
   analysis (CATA), it provides reliable and valid measures of what the
   leaders said in both debates and develops our theoretical understanding
   of how challenger-party leaders make their pitches. It finds that the UK
   Independence Party (UKIP), Green Party, Scottish National Party (SNP)
   and Plaid Cymru leaders all demonstrated a degree of nicheness' in their

Abstract = {This study explores recursivity in international accounting
   standard-setting, focusing on participation of actors from African
   countries. While the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS)
   Foundation bases its legitimacy claims as a global standard-setter on a
   combination of expertise and a formally transparent set of recursive
   procedures for consultation of stakeholders, empirical results show that
   participation in the latter is geographically very uneven. The article
   argues that conceptual mismatch between the standard-setter's objectives
   on the one hand and the socio-economic, cultural and political
   conditions in many African countries on the other leads to selective
   recursivity that is problematic for the former's legitimacy and
   effectiveness. These findings are of wider relevance for debates on
   global standard-setting and development.},

Volume = {9},
Number = {3},
Pages = {410-435},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {This article is concerned with the debate about interdisciplinary
   methods in international law, in particular the turn to International
   Relations. It finds the historical critique of Martti Koskenniemi
   grounded in a more methodological issue: the turn toward a redefinition
   of norm properties impedes on the critical discursive quality of law.
   Shaping this historical critique into a research question that allows
   for meaningful engagement, the article discusses Koskenniemi's charges
   drawing on recent constructivist scholarship. Giving an account of what
   it means to be obliged' to obey the law, this article defends the
   coherence of Koskenniemi's position and suggests that we should take the
   critique of the interdisciplinary project between law and International
   Relations seriously. While it agrees that a significant part of the
   discourse fails to appreciate the particularities of the law, it
   suggests that understanding legal obligations requires taking the
   institutional autonomy of the law into account. Respecting this
   autonomy, in turn, points to a multi- instead of an interdisciplinary
   project. The reflexive formalist conception of the law that this article
   advocates captures the obligating nature of the law, independent of the
   normative content of particular rules.},

Abstract = {This article calls into question one of the implicit assumptions linking
   democratic accountability to reduced corruption, namely, that citizens
   will expose institutions rife with venality and mobilize for better
   government. Instead, mobilization may be contingent on the type of
   corruption. The study develops a distinction between need and greed
   corruption and suggest that citizens are more likely to engage in the
   fight against corruption when corruption is needed to gain access to
   fair treatment (need corruption) as opposed to special illicit
   advantages (greed corruption). Using data from the Global Corruption
   Barometer 2013, the study suggest that need corruption mobilizes
   citizens, in particular if they perceive that fellow citizens will also
   engage, while greed corruption leads to secrecy, demobilization, and a
   propensity to free ride on other citizens' anticorruption efforts. The
   study thereby contributes to a better understanding of fundamental
   conditions for collective action against corruption and explaining why
   greed corruption persists in societies with well-established
   institutions for accountability.},

Abstract = {This article, which presents a general framework of the arbitration
   centers in Portugal, tested the existence of statistical evidence
   regarding a set of relationships between latent variables associated
   with satisfaction and loyalty of users of these centers. In this sense,
   a sample of 337 users of the 11 arbitration centers sponsored by the
   Portuguese Ministry of Justice was used. The assessment of the validity
   of the research hypotheses was performed by means of a structural
   equation model which revealed to possess quality measures considered as
   good. The hypothesis of the existence of a positive and direct impact of
   the dimension facilities of arbitration centers in the dimension general
   aspects of arbitration centers was refuted. The remaining research
   hypotheses were confirmed by the sample, globally validating the
   structural model proposed for this phenomenon.},

Abstract = {Fragmented authority and service responsibilities within governments can
   impact the design and implementation of policy. Administrative
   structures can play an important role in mitigating the challenges
   associated with coordinating activities across independent units within
   city government. In this study, we use the broad policy arena of
   sustainability as a testbed to explore ``Functional Collective
   Action{''} problems and the consequences of cities' administrative
   design on the portfolio of policy actions related to energy and climate
   protection. Empirical analyses of survey data from a national sample of
   local governments indicate that political institutions, government
   capacity, and community support influence, to varying degrees,
   administrative structures related to sustainability initiatives. Our
   analyses also suggest that these are not inconsequential decisions,
   since they influence the extent to which cities achieve greater policy
   integration.},

Abstract = {Conceiving power relations as a subset of causal relations can be used
   to expose the problems of a certain behaviouralist take on causality and
   develop an interpretivist approach to explanation. The first section of
   this article shows that a behaviouralist approach ultimately clashes
   with a relational understanding of power, since the latter requires
   endogenising values and understandings in an analysis in which several
   causal paths to the same outcome can exist (equifinality) with radically
   different implications for attributing power. Power relations can be
   non-linear, and power dispositional or latent, as well as not
   translating into influence. The second section draws the consequences of
   these contradictions by conceptualising causal/social mechanisms for and
   in an interpretivist framework. Such mechanisms can be part of a wider
   analysis of contingent processes that answer `how possible' questions.
   Although interpretivist process-tracing provides explanations without
   strict regularity, such processes include mechanisms which are
   transferable to other cases, hence generalisable. Finally, the article
   establishes a specific discursive mechanism of crisis reduction in
   foreign policy identity discourses, as developed in the comparative
   study of the processes that make us understand the unexpected return of

Abstract = {This article investigates the commonly assumed link between ethnic
   divisions and clientelism in African politics by examining the role of
   contextual ethnic divisions and specific ethnic affiliations in shaping
   attitudes towards clientelism. The empirical findings, drawing on
   quantitative data for 38,293 survey respondents across 25 African
   countries suggest important country heterogeneity, but also highlight
   some regularities. In particular, the ethnic composition of the
   population in the area of residence, rather than the individual's own
   ethnic affiliation, is important in shaping support for clientelism.
   Individuals living in a region where the majority of the population is
   the president's co-ethnics tend to be more supportive of clientelism,
   regardless of their own ethnic affiliation. The wide coverage of the
   results makes them especially interesting; while a number of studies
   suggest ethnically based targeted transfers in specific sectors or
   settings, this study explores the links between different forms of
   ethnic divisions and support for clientelism in a large multi-country
   African sample.},

Abstract = {This article takes stock of some of the important contributions to the
   study of peacekeeping (PK). Two key topics stand out: peacekeeping
   burden sharing and mission effectiveness. For burden sharing, the
   theoretical foundation is the private provision of public goods and
   joint products. Implications for burden sharing differ whether financial
   or troop contributions are being shared, with the latter driven by
   jointly produced country-specific benefits. Financial burden sharing can
   also differ between United Nations (UN)-led and non-UN-led peacekeeping
   operations, wherein country-specific benefits are especially important
   for the latter. Many articles gauge peacekeeping effectiveness by the
   mission's ability to maintain the peace or to protect lives for a set
   time period. More recently, multiple criteria are raised for evaluating
   peacekeeping in today's world of multifaceted peace-building operations.},

Abstract = {What determines the uptake of private sustainability regulation in
   developing countries? Existing studies point to the local context as the
   key explanatory factor. In particular, they identify local program
   characteristics, industry structures, and the regulatory environment as
   variables influencing program uptake at the point of production.
   However, examining two very similar certification programs in Brazil's
   soy and sugarcane industries, this article finds that local conditions
   fail to account for the observed patterns. A local explanation would
   have predicted similar levels of industry uptake in the two sectors.
   Conversely, it is found that Brazil's soy producers first backed but
   then opposed private sustainability regulation, whereas in the sugarcane
   sector the dynamic was exactly the opposite. Through an in-depth
   analysis and cross-case comparison this article reveals how changing
   transnational conditions were decisive in shaping these outcomes.
   Specifically, shifting end markets exposed the two sectors to different
   economic and regulatory pressures.},

Title = {The socialization of civilians and militia members: Evidence from

Abstract = {When the Guatemalan civil war ended in 1996, the Peace Accords required
   the demobilization of the civil patrols. Yet, nearly two decades after
   the end of the war, the ex-patrollers remain organized and active. At
   first glance, the persistence of Guatemala's civil patrols sounds like a
   triumph of socialization: the men enrolled in the civil patrols were
   effectively socialized during the war, so they continue patrolling
   today. This argument is seductively simple, but it is incorrect. Using
   process tracing to analyze historical documents and interviews with
   former civil patrollers, I show that the military did not succeed in
   socializing most of its patrollers. The military was, however,
   remarkably successful at socializing civilians in conflict zones. After
   enduring a ferocious scorched earth campaign followed by re-education,
   civilians either learned to fear and comply with the military and the
   civil patrols, or they internalized the military-promulgated narrative
   that repression is necessary to guarantee security. Both these outcomes
   facilitate patrolling in postwar Guatemala, where many civilians in
   war-affected areas either embrace or tolerate extralegal security
   patrolling as a means of preventing crime from spreading to their
   communities. Theoretically, the case of Guatemala's civil patrols
   expands our knowledge of socialization in militias and civil defense
   forces. Mass socialization of group members is not necessary for an
   armed group to retain its influence in the long term, even after a
   conflict has ended. Additionally, socialization occurs not just within
   groups, but also dynamically and interactively across group boundaries.
   To fully understand the trajectories of armed groups, it is important to
   analyze both socialization within armed groups and the socialization of
   the broader civilian population.},

   argue that an incumbent government's military forces play a crucial role
   in conflict duration. Specifically, combined arms militaries which bring
   to bear a mixture of mechanized infantry, armor, and aircraft make short
   conflicts more likely. The use of mechanized ground forces in
   combination with airpower increases the likelihood of decisive
   engagements early in a conflict, helping to mitigate information
   asymmetries that can drive violence. By contrast, less-mechanized forces
   face greater difficulty bringing the fight to the enemy. Combined arms
   militaries therefore tend to bring conflicts to more rapid conclusions.
   However, like maneuver warfare in conventional interstate conflict,
   these outcomes do not always favor incumbent governments. To test this
   argument, we employ new, detailed data on military mechanization and
   airpower from civil conflicts between 1967 and 2003. The results
   indicate that national militaries with high combined arms capabilities
   are associated with significantly shorter conflicts. Perhaps
   surprisingly, this relationship remains robust even when we limit the
   analysis to insurgencies.},

Abstract = {This paper uses an analytical framework developed from James C. Scott's
   concept of state sponsored ``high modernism{''} to understand the scope
   and limits of Putin's attempt to reconfigure state-society relations
   under the guise of ``managed democracy.{''} It argues that Kremlin,
   under Putin's first two presidential terms (2000-2008), attempted to
   treat society as a reified object separate from the state and as an
   object of management. The paper analyzes the Russian state's weak
   regulatory capacity that coexists with its relatively strong coercive
   and extractive capacities. It is argued that, in spite of accessing vast
   resources from the energy sector, the state under Putin's presidency was
   unable to successfully carry out civil service reform or implement
   critical reforms in the pension and housing sectors. The analytical
   framework used offers insights into the limits of authoritarian
   state-crafting and modernization in contemporary Russia. (C) 2017 The

Abstract = {This special section analyzes the variety of recursivity in
   transnational regulatory governance. We conceptualize recursivity as a
   complex cycle through which addressees' response to transnational rules
   continuously feeds back into the rulemaking process and triggers rule
   revision. In the introduction to the special section, we emphasize that
   recursivity varies across governance organizations and governance fields
   and develop an analytical framework to capture this variation. We also
   propose a typology of recursive governance organizations. Finally, we
   preview five case studies included in the special section and summarize
   their key findings and conclusions, with particular attention to the
   implications for accountability and legitimacy.},

Abstract = {Isn't the most general of political problems the problem of truth? (
   Foucault 1991, 82)
   Perhaps, the reason why my work irritates people is precisely the fact
   that I'm not interested in constructing a new schema, or in validating
   one that already exists. Perhaps it's because my objective isn't to
   propose a global principle for analyzing society. ( Foucault 1991, 85)
   To us nature is more diverse and interesting than any god, and the body
   is more layered, rich, and creative than the soul. Most immanent
   naturalists support an ethic in which visceral attachment to life and
   the world provides the preliminary soil from which commitment to more
   generous identifications, responsibilities, and connections might be
   cultivated. ( Connolly 2002, 85) Politics is the terrain of competing
   ontologies.
   Politics is about competing visions of how the world is and how it
   should be. Every ontology is political. If there were no ontological
   differences there would be no politics. ( Wight 2006, 2)},

Abstract = {In our contribution, we examine the vernacular memory of the end of
   Communism and the year 1989 in Europe. Analyzing sixteen focus groups
   conducted in Germany, Poland, Spain, and the United Kingdom, we
   concentrate on the question whether the events related to 1989 might
   have the disposition to become a transnational European lieu de memoire.
   We show that 1989 is not a salient historical event for British and
   Spanish participants, while Polish and German respondents do connect it
   with patterns of national identity building. Differences between
   vernacular and official memories could be revealed as respondents hardly
   mentioned the democratic achievements made in the course of the
   transitions. A transnational dimension was only found in Poland, where
   respondents articulate a feeling of neglect toward their own national
   history. The Solidarity movement is being interpreted as a motor of
   liberation and Europeanization of Poland and as a pioneer of
   democratization on a European scale. German respondents remain in their
   national frame, focusing on flashbulb memories of the fall of the Berlin
   Wall and the issue of social integration of East and West Germany after
   1990, which they evaluate as imperfect. The strong national bias of
   Polish and German focus groups raises doubts as to whether 1989 can
   become a transnational basis for a shared European memory.},

Abstract = {This article introduces, summarizes and contextualizes the key questions
   and findings of a special issue of Global Policy on the resourcing of
   international organizations (IOs). The article sets out trends in the
   financial resources available to IOs; discusses their organizational
   consequences; and highlights analytical implications for the study of
   IOs. We discuss resource diversification associated with growing
   complexity of the origins and types of funding available to IOs; the
   importance of non-state actors in IO funding; and contestation over the
   classification of resources. Resource diversification encourages
   organizational differentiation, manifested in major shifts in
   resource-related actor constellations and their impact on the autonomy
   of IOs; adjustments to budgeting procedures; and functional
   differentiation within IOs and the emergence of new types of IOs that
   are partly driven by resourcing. These observations invite an analytical
   perspective in the study of IOs that pays systematic attention to the
   administrative governance dimension of IOs; the entrepreneurial
   character of many IOs; and organizational fields as a focus of analysis.
   Read together, the 11 contributions to the special issue underline that
   paying attention to their resourcing can advance our understanding of
   IOs.},

Abstract = {The story of the founding of the United Nations reflects its complicated
   ideological foundations. Jan Smuts, who wrote the words ``human
   rights{''} into the Charter, was also the premier of white-ruled South
   Africa. Smuts embodies the dualism that runs through international law
   itself: the pursuit of the common good is invariably tied to its own
   interest. It was only through the interventions of the emerging global
   community, and in particular the developing world-and consequently the
   repudiation of Smuts and the apartheid policies of his successors -that
   human rights attained a more universal nature. Human rights have deeper,
   but also darker, roots than many current accounts would have it.},

Abstract = {Drawing on in-depth ethnographic observations among irregularised
   migrant families in Birmingham, UK, this article discusses how
   children's political agency manifests in everyday life. It shows how
   children who become aware of their legal status as deportable' reject
   this subject position and offer their own definitions of who they are
   and where they belong. Simultaneously, it is argued that children with
   varying degrees of knowledge about their legal status also express
   political agency through their struggle to sustain the inclusion they
   experience. Such expressions highlight the duality of children's
   political agency in irregular situations.},

   Contexts},

Abstract = {Psychoanalysis has long been used as a tool to analyze the symptomology
   of individuals and nation states. But can it universally be applied to
   all? This article argues that psychoanalysis was born in the wake of the
   French Revolution as the subject of rights came to understand that it
   could make choices, but that these choices would not always be the right
   ones. In Douzinas' () terms every desire is a potential right (p. 8),
   and this idea links desire to rights in a way that psychoanalytic theory
   and practice must contend. But it also offers the possibility that it is
   rights-bearing subjects who are specifically desiring in the manner that
   psychoanalysis proposes. In this article, I examine the symptoms of
   rights-bearing subjects as they have emerged in a particular
   politico-legal history. I argue that the symptoms of subjects must be
   understood in the context of their politico-legal history, including its
   formation, and I examine how the neglect of this account of
   historyparticularly in the context of Australiacan miss the colonial
   violences that are inherent in law (as a symptom) but also in
   psychoanalysis as itself a symptom of a particular historical scene.},

Title = {Resourcing Global Justice: The Resource Management Design of
   International Courts},
Journal = {GLOBAL POLICY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {8},
Number = {5, SI},
Pages = {62-74},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {This article examines the resource management design of international
   courts (ICs) and asks: how are ICs designed in terms of the management
   of resources and what factors contribute to the resource management
   design of ICs? Theoretically, this article draws on existing literature
   to conceptualize resource management as a design feature of
   international courts and considers three causal mechanisms that might
   shape the resource management design of ICs: diffusion by emulation, the
   uploading of domestic governance norms, and bureaucrats who pursue
   institutional independence and sustainability. Empirically, I examine
   the resource management design of 24 ICs and assess who selects their
   chief administrators and approves their budgets. A case study on the
   Caribbean Court of Justice (CCJ) is also analyzed in order to gain
   traction on the causal mechanisms generating resource management design
   of ICs. The article shows that there is a strong tendency for ICs to
   have greater control over the appointment of their chief administrators,
   but less control over their budgets. States generally retain authority
   to approve ICs' budgets. Moreover, it suggests that domestic judicial
   norms and national legal bureaucrats influenced the design of the CCJ's
   resource management.
   Policy Implications
   This paper has policy implications for how international courts can be
   designed, and that in designing ICs attention to resources and their
   management merits significant consideration.
   The paper shows that the Caribbean Court of Justice offers an innovative
   model of how to finance and govern international courts. This is a model
   that merits further consideration by policy makers as an approach to
   resourcing international courts.
   As policy makers may look to existing ICs for ideas on how to design new
   ICs, the typical (European) models offer only some options. These other
   designs merit careful consideration because they have implications for
   how ICs perform and their independence.
   As policy makers may look to existing ICs for ideas on how to design new
   ICs, domestic judiciaries can also provide a source of inspiration.},

Abstract = {This article analyses international conflicts through defining and
   discussing narrative practices. We distinguish various sites where
   clashes of narratives materialise and specific narrative practices are
   performed: in traditional diplomacy, in public diplomacy and in the
   media. We reach three conclusions: narratives influence all aspects of
   diplomatic practice, including strategic negotiations in secret talks
   and public engagements; state and non-state actors' practices enact
   narratives and the growing interconnectedness can fosters clashes of
   narratives; in crafting and performing political narratives, diplomats
   and non-state actors refer extensively to legal norms and international
   law exploiting them as elements of narration. At a theoretical level, we
   incorporate practice theory into narrative analysis and vice versa,
   building a bridge between the practice turn and the linguistic turn in
   constructivist thinking. To illustrate, we analyse the Crimean crisis in
   February and March 2014 that opposed Russia and Ukraine and its Western
   supporters.},

Volume = {45},

Abstract = {Research has identified a general trend towards depoliticisation.
   Against this trend, we identify opportunities for politicisation through
   the international emergence of a research governance tool: `responsible
   research and innovation' (RRI). Drawing on face-to-face interviews with
   university staff, we reveal two factors that influence whether research
   governance becomes a site of politics: actors' acknowledgement of their
   societal responsibilities, and the meanings these actors attribute to
   RRI. RRI provides a focus for political struggles over the public value
   of research and innovation at a time when science policy is given a
   privileged role in driving economic growth.},

Journal = {AFRICAN AFFAIRS},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {116},
Number = {464},
Pages = {391-413},

Abstract = {The entry of the ANC into the arena of democratic politics provoked a
   dilemma for the party leadership that is familiar to political parties
   in a new democracy: how, if at all, should the party reform its internal
   organization to compete in a new electoral environment? This article
   draws on interviews with senior members of the ANC to develop a theory
   that describes how the `modernization' of the ANC under President Thabo
   Mbeki led to his electoral defeat at the party's national conference in
   2007. It contends that the process of modernization reduced
   systematically the role of the party's activist base in the
   policy-making process, creating a motive to replace the President, but
   left intact the role of activists in the selection of the party's
   leadership, which in turn provided an opportunity to replace the
   President at the party's national conference. The President's opponents
   exploited ruthlessly this opportunity by enlarging and mobilizing the
   party membership, using a clientelistic appeal for support, to deliver a
   resounding victory for their champion, Jacob Zuma. This type of
   clientelistic competition, which has become routine inside the ANC,
   undermined the democratic legitimacy of the party and its capacity to
   govern in the public interest.},

Abstract = {Many studies highlight the role that international intervention can play
   in prolonging civil wars. Yet, direct military intervention is just one
   way that external actors become involved in civil conflicts. In this
   article, a model is developed and analyzed that shows that when the
   government is unsure about how external support to the rebels will help
   rebel war-making capacity, it is the government that will continue
   fighting rather than settle the dispute. Different types of external
   support to rebels influence their fighting capacity differently, and
   some types of support create uncertainty about how new resources will
   translate into war-making ability. Specifically, more fungible sources
   of support (such as direct financial support) generate the most
   uncertainty for states as they attempt to estimate the effect of support
   to rebels on the conflict. Increased uncertainty inhibits bargained
   settlement, and disputes characterized by fungible external support are
   less likely to end than those where rebels receive different kinds of
   support. Empirical analyses demonstrate strong support for this
   argument; rebels that receive highly fungible external support (money
   and guns) are less likely to see conflict termination than rebels that
   do not.},

Abstract = {In the article, we study fmancing and efficiency of Slovenian Public
   General Libraries. We employ a rich dataset of CEZAR - Centre for
   Development of Libraries for the years 2008-2014 for 58 libraries and
   use data envelopment analysis and regression methods to study the
   efficiency of libraries over the years. Our main results show that the
   problems for the libraries in this period did not lie in the lowered
   efficiency but more likely in other system requirements. We also provide
   a grouping of libraries following clustering analysis and show it had
   significant effects on the performance of the libraries.},

Abstract = {This work analyzes the way in which the implementation of SME policies
   and programs (SPP) coming from and/or financed by international
   financing agencies (particularly IDB and UNDP) promotes neoliberal
   characteristics in SME structure and involvement that weakening the
   strategic character of the State in development. In order to do so, by
   acknowledging the disputed nature and the institutional fragility of the
   State in Latin America, the document is interested in noting that the
   implemented SPPs were constituted in technologies of power with capacity
   not only to make feasible and deepen the organizational fragmentation of
   SME state structures and competition between them, but also to
   disseminate ideas and conceptual frameworks that shaped a state
   involvement that prioritizes global insertion over a national
   development project. The research focused its analysis on the Small and
   Medium Enterprise and Regional Development Secretariat and on two of the
   most important SPPs (Business Reconversion Program/Program to Support
   Credit and Competitiveness, and the Local Productive Systems Program)
   implemented in Argentina (2003-2015).},

Abstract = {We contribute to the post-crisis literature on macroeconomic stability
   by arguing that polycentric banking systems can better achieve stability
   than mono-centric systems. Building on the theories of E. Ostrom, we
   engage the literature on free banking systems to show that these systems
   met the requirements of polycentric governance systems, and that the
   unintentional result of the underlying governance institutions was
   macroeconomic stability. In contrast, modern central banking, because it
   is monocentric, lacks important features regarding knowledge aggregation
   and incentive compatibility conducive to generating macroeconomic
   stability. We conclude by discussing various legal barriers that stand
   in the way of a transition from monetary monocentrism to monetary
   polycentrism.},

Abstract = {Recent scholarship has discovered significant racial/ethnic group
   variation in response to political threats such as immigration and
   terrorism. Surprisingly, minority groups often simultaneously perceive
   themselves to be at greater risk from such threats and yet still prefer
   more open immigration policies and civil liberties protections. We
   suggest a group-level empathy process may explain this puzzle: Due to
   their higher levels of empathy for other disadvantaged groups, many
   minority group members support protections for others even when their
   own interests are threatened. Little is known, however, about the unique
   properties of group empathy or its role in policy opinion formation. In
   this study, we examine the reliability and validity of our new measure
   of group empathy, the Group Empathy Index (GEI), demonstrating that it
   is distinct from other social and political predispositions such as
   ethnocentrism, social dominance orientation, authoritarianism, ideology,
   and partisanship. We then propose a theory about the development of
   group empathy in reaction to life experiences based on one's
   race/ethnicity, gender, age, and education. Finally, we examine the
   power of group empathy to predict policy attitudes and political
   behavior.},

Abstract = {Turnout rates are in decline in advanced democracies, but the
   consequences of this trend for inequalities in participation have not
   yet been investigated in a large, comparative study. In this article, we
   investigate educational inequalities in six countries. First, we examine
   whether Tingsten's law of dispersion holds and whether decreasing
   turnout rates imply more unequal participation. Subsequently, we examine
   whether the more gradual over-time process of declining turnout rates
   leads to biased participation. We show that the participation gap
   between low-and high-educated citizens is growing. This pattern is
   strongest in countries where turnout rates have decreased most.},

Abstract = {The rise of Chinese `state capitalism' such as expressed by the global
   expansion of Chinese state-owned enterprises (SOEs) has been met with
   substantial suspicion on the part of the Western corporate and political
   establishment-including among Washington's policy-making elite. The
   underpinning claim that the rise of SOEs would impair market mechanisms,
   we argue, is, however, theoretically problematic and empirically
   incorrect. Taking the example of the global oil and gas sector, the
   article illustrates that at firm level major corporations from rising
   powers, such as China, increasingly cooperate with Western firms,
   including with American oil majors. In that sense, Chinese firms
   participate in capitalist competition just as any Western firm. The
   roots of the assumed threat posed by China's rise, we argue, must rather
   be situated in the distinctive nature of the state-capital nexus in the
   USA and China, respectively, and the configuration of elite networks
   underpinning this nexus. We will illustrate this by analysing the social
   networks in which directors of major Chinese and US oil firms are
   embedded, including the networks of corporate ties, affiliations with
   (transnational) policy planning bodies and state-business ties.},

Abstract = {An understanding of human nature and of the motivations that drive human
   behavior have always informed public policies. The use of behavioral
   research in public policy analysis, which flows largely from social and
   cognitive psychology, behavioral economics, and other behavioral
   sciences, came into sharp focus in the last decade. Since then, policy
   initiatives incorporating behavioral insights have flourished, and
   thousands of research articles have been published on that topic. A lot
   of this research has focused on how behavioral insights used by
   governments at all levels can improve the delivery of governmental
   services and improve compliance and use of government services by the
   public. We review recent trends in policy initiatives that specifically
   incorporate behavioral insights in the United States and outline a
   framework for further integrating behavioral insights into the various
   stages of policy analysis and policy design.},

Abstract = {Since the early 1990s, Chilean democratic governments after Augusto
   Pinochet's dictatorship have made an effort to allocate publicly
   subsidized housing to the lower classes. Nevertheless, the dominance of
   market principles in urban policies has contributed to the formation of
   highly segregated neighborhoods and the gentrification of peripheral
   neighborhoods. As a result, Chilean public opinion is witnessing the
   rearticulation of what in the mid-twentieth century was known as the
   pobladores movement-social mobilizations demanding housing solutions for
   the poor. In the old working-class municipality of Penalolen, severe
   gentrification since the late 1980s has triggered the appearance of
   autonomous grassroots organizations such as the Movimiento de Pobladores
   en Lucha (MPL). The movement has been able to fight social and spatial
   injustice in Santiago through a subversive appropriation of state
   policies. Its experience reveals the potentialities of such
   mobilizations for democratizing cities under a neoliberal regime.},

Abstract = {In addition to everyday political threats, leaders risk removal from
   office through coups and mass movements such as rebellion. Further, all
   leaders face threats from shocks such as downturns in their health,
   their country's economy, or their government's revenue. By integrating
   these risks into the selectorate theory, we characterize the conditions
   under which each threat is pertinent and the countermoves (purges,
   democratization, expansion of public goods, and expansion of private
   benefits) that best enable the leader to survive in office. The model
   identifies new insights into the nature of assassins; the relative risk
   of different types of leader removal as a function of the extant
   institutions of government; and the endogenous factors driving better or
   worse public policy and decisions to democratize or become more
   autocratic. Importantly, the results highlight how an increase in the
   risk of deposition via one means intensifies other removal risks.},

Abstract = {This paper reflects on the role that the emerging powers have developed
   in different spheres of global decision-making. Firstly, it describes
   the current international order, and conceptualizes the category of
   emerging power, as derived from that of middle power. Next, the paper
   focuses on three fields of global governance: commercial sphere (WTO),
   financial sphere (World Bank, FMI, G-20), and environmental sphere
   (summits on climate change). In this way it aims to establish whether
   the role of the emerging powers has led to modifications in
   international forums for decision-making, and how the relationships
   between traditional, emerging and re-emerging powers have been
   reconfigured.},

Abstract = {This article tells the story of the urban Karura forest in Nairobi in
   order to explore access to and control of green spaces in an African
   city at a time of rapid, haphazard urbanization. Using insights from
   critical legal geography, it shows that although in strictly legal terms
   Karura forest remains properly gazetted public land, it continues to
   exclude citizens in important ways. This is because of a neoliberal
   conception of security that has promoted the exercise of significant
   private power over public space. The article examines the powerful ideas
   that were deployed to achieve the enclosure of the forest. Ideas of
   ecological guardianship were mobilized in tandem with arguments that the
   forest must be made `safe and secure'. A number of devices (fences,
   paths, trails, and signposts) played important property functions. This
   case study provides important insights into the politics of access to
   green space and to questions of social justice at a time of rapid urban
   change, not just in Kenya but more widely.},

Abstract = {How do organizations build trust under varying degrees of uncertainty?
   In this article, we propose that different degrees of uncertainty
   require different bases of trust. We distinguish between three different
   forms of trust production (process-based, characteristics-based and
   institution-based) and develop hypotheses regarding their relative
   effectiveness under low versus high levels of product and performance
   uncertainty. Using survey data on 392 interorganizational buyer-seller
   relationships, we find support for our position that a high degree of
   uncertainty favours process-based trust production, whereas
   characteristics-based trust production is relatively more effective when
   uncertainty is low. The effectiveness of institution-based trust
   production is not significantly affected by uncertainty. We derive
   implications for organizational trust production under different degrees
   of uncertainty, which should encourage new research on trust.},

Journal = {BUSINESS AND POLITICS},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {19},
Number = {1},
Pages = {1-40},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Recent research in international political economy has begun to explore
   the implications of producer heterogeneity for trade politics.
   Variations in productivity and size lead to systematic variations in
   market behaviors, especially with respect to firms' abilities to engage
   foreign markets. This heterogeneity similarly leads to systematic
   variations in policy stances: Highly productive firms are more likely to
   favor trade liberalization than their less productive counterparts. I
   test the role of firm heterogeneity on trade-policy stances using
   original and representative survey data of Japanese manufacturers. I
   find that highly productive firms are more likely to favor
   liberalization than others, while a large portion of producers is
   indifferent to trade-policy reform. Other producers do not know how they
   would be impacted by liberalization; these tend to be smaller than their
   counterparts. The relationship between productivity and pro-trade
   attitudes is robust, even when controlling for a wide range of
   internationalization modes.},

Abstract = {Since 2014, we have been producing regular six-month forecasts of the
   probability of irregular leadership changes coups, rebellions, protests
   that result in state leader changes - for most countries in the world
   for the Political Instability Task Force (PITF). During 2015, we issued
   new forecasts each month, with a delay as short as five days and no
   longer than two weeks into each six-month forecasting window. This
   article describes the approach we use to generate our forecasts and
   presents several examples of how we present forecasts. The forecasts are
   derived from a statistical ensemble of seven thematic models, each based
   on a split-population duration model that aims to capture a specific
   argument or related set of covariates. This approach is modular in that
   thematic models can be swapped out or new models integrated, and it
   lessens the need for generalist `kitchen sink' models. Together, the
   models achieve high out-of-sample accuracy. Based on our experience, we
   draw conclusions about the practical, policy, and scientific aspects of
   this and similar undertakings. These include thoughts on how to evaluate
   and present forecasts, the potential role of ensembles in model
   comparison, the role of ensembles and prediction in causal research, and
   considerations for future efforts in forecasting and predictive
   modeling.},

Abstract = {This article describes evidence suggesting that science curiosity
   counteracts politically biased information processing. This finding is
   in tension with two bodies of research. The first casts doubt on the
   existence of curiosity as a measurable disposition. The other suggests
   that individual differences in cognition related to science
   comprehensionof which science curiosity, if it exists, would presumably
   be onedo not mitigate politically biased information processing but
   instead aggravate it. The article describes the scale-development
   strategy employed to overcome the problems associated with measuring
   science curiosity. It also reports data, observational and experimental,
   showing that science curiosity promotes open-minded engagement with
   information that is contrary to individuals' political predispositions.
   We conclude by identifying a series of concrete research questions posed
   by these results.},

   policy},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF HUMAN RIGHTS},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {16},
Number = {4},
Pages = {428-451},
Abstract = {Literature on foreign aid and human rights often presupposes that
   constituents favor using foreign policy to promote human rights abroad
   and lead elected policymakers to pursue such policies to retain
   electoral support. This assumption, although frequently asserted, has
   not been empirically evaluated. And there are reasons to be skeptical
   about whether public opinion supports human rights foreign policy
   compared to other policy objectives. This article explores US public
   opinion about human rights, by asking two questions: Does the public
   think human rights should factor in foreign aid decisions and does the
   contextthe strategic or economic relationship between the donor and
   recipientaffect this? This article uses results from a nationwide
   experimental survey to evaluate these questions. I find that the
   majority of respondents support cutting aid to punish human rights
   violators and that this depends minimally on the importance of the
   recipient.},

Abstract = {Scholarship explores the impact of human rights abuse and state
   repression on terrorism. Heretofore, scholarship has ignored the impact
   of government-sponsored killings on domestic terrorism. This article
   proposes that mass killings create a focal point for terrorist
   mobilization. The vendetta agenda fuels violence by animating
   retributory violence. Additionally, mass atrocities create a permissive
   environment for violent nonstate activity. A spiral of violence ensues
   whereby groups resort to terrorism. Utilizing data from the Global
   Terrorism Database, 1971-2011, the study shows that mass killings
   significantly increase domestic terrorism. It contributes to emerging
   scholarship examining how state policies influence terrorist activity.},

Abstract = {4 Kramarz and Park (2016) claim that global environmental governance's
   increased accountability mechanisms are not matched with environmental
   gains. I assert that this ``accountability paradox{''} develops for
   environmental nongovernmental organizations (ENGOs) due to a convergence
   of trends: ENGOs' increased governance roles coupled with competition
   for funding and agenda space produces a field riddled with opposing or
   diverging views. These organizations cannot fully satisfy other actors'
   demands and achieve ``balanced accountability{''} because of their
   differentiated and conflicting approaches to environmental
   problem-solving. Instead, ENGOs face an accountability dilemma: let the
   various demands of accountability interfere with their ability to
   achieve mission or let their missions interfere with their efforts to be
   accountable. This constrained choice is delineated by Koppell's multiple
   accountabilities disorder and the new concept ``single accountability
   disorder.{''} The qualitative case of the International Marinelife
   Alliance demonstrates how an ENGO moves through the multiple
   accountability states that constitute this paradox.},

   compares activities of both groups in four parameters - violent actions,
   control of territory and provision of services, acquisition of
   resources, and media activities. The author also briefly outlines other
   important influences on the mutual competition and its possible
   implications on the conflict in Yemen and global Salafi-jihadist

Abstract = {This chapter gives a brief description of the Lake Tana Subbasin's (LTB)
   economy analogized with economic development requirements and standards.
   It also highlights the LTB's natural resources role in local economy.
   Although there has not been any attempt to compute the Gross Domestic
   (Geographic) Product for the LTB, available regional and zonal tax
   revenue data shows the contribution of prominent sectoral activities in
   the basin such as agriculture and fisheries, tourism and navigation,
   trade and industry, and transport to the regional revenue is
   substantial. A significant proportion of the Lake Tana Basin's economy
   is attributed to the agricultural sector and the Basin harbors
   considerable untapped potential for irrigation development. This calls
   for a better investigation of the development of a resources efficient
   modern agriculture which will contribute for the economic development of
   the Basin. The rest of the sectors such as industry, are also in a very
   early stage of the economic activity, and need more attention to be
   developed with optimized use of the resources of the basin.},

   Performance does not define measures of a (cost-) efficient conduct of
   foreign policy, but develops benchmarks of an ideal-type emancipatory
   policy constrained by normative principles (Normative Performance as
   output) and derived from undistorted argumentative reasoning (Normative
   Performance as a process). The case study assesses the EU's response to
   the Andijon massacre in Uzbekistan in May 2005.},

Abstract = {Today it is known why, how and when ethnic conflicts erupt, the form
   they will take, and the factors associated with their de-escalation.
   However most research continues to select heavily on the dependent
   variable while comparatively less examines questions about the timing,
   escalation and the duration of group interactions in both its
   cooperative and conflictual forms. In order to understand why some
   ethnic conflicts are prone to violence while others are not, the author
   argues programmes are needed to map out patterns of co-existence on a
   global scale.},

Abstract = {Networked social movements have amplified the emancipation of protesters
   everywhere. In Brazil, a conflict arose after the Sao Paulo State
   Secretariat for Education announced the closing of 94 public schools,
   impacting 311,000 people. In response, about 30 students organized the
   occupation of the State School Fernao Dias Paes. Subsequently, the
   occupation spread to other schools. Based on a case study of the first
   school occupied in the city of Sao Paulo, this research aims to identify
   the role of information and communication technologies (ICTs) and social
   media tools in generating and sustaining the successful occupation
   protest of public schools in Sao Paulo. This chapter covers theories on
   demonstrations initiated online, on the social panorama in Latin America
   and educational issues in Brazil. It also addresses and analyzes the
   occupation process at this school, which reached visibility and support
   at national and international levels using ICTs and social media,
   confirming the steps of occupy movements around the world.},

Journal = {PEACEBUILDING},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {5},
Number = {1, SI},
Pages = {7-21},
Abstract = {This paper reviews the past two decades of peacebuilding in Bosnia
   through the lens of recent debates around inclusivity. It explores how
   the exclusive pact-making of the Dayton Accords - and the elite-centrism
   of the subsequent peace implementation process - has precluded the
   emergence of a social contract between the Bosnian state and Bosnian
   society. In particular, the paper suggests that in combination with the
   Dayton agreement's well-known structural flaws, the broader tendency of
   key international actors to view Bosnia's peace process in terms of
   elite-level relations across the international-domestic divide has
   perpetuated conditions of lowintensity democracy in Bosnia. The growing
   attention to questions of inclusivity, conversely, views peacebuilding
   increasingly in terms of a longer term effort to strengthen
   state-society relations. In the light of emerging insights from the
   inclusivity debate, the paper emphasises the need to attend more
   carefully to the relationship between how, and with whom, peace is
   negotiated in the short term and how it is subsequently implemented over
   the longer term.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF EUROPEAN PUBLIC POLICY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {24},
Number = {8},
Pages = {1233-1251},
Abstract = {Reorienting the welfare state towards social investment (SI) constitutes
   a complex and multidimensional challenge of policy recalibration and
   raises daunting political problems. The temporal mismatch between SI
   reforms and their returns requires a degree of political patience' on
   the side of both current voters and incumbent politicians which is not
   readily available in contemporary democracies. After reviewing recent
   debates about the policy and politics of the long term, the article
   analyzes the strategy pursued by the European Union (EU), with a view to
   assessing their degree of conduciveness' to SI recalibration. It is
   argued that the EU has indeed stimulated policy change at the national
   level, but that its potential as SI facilitator has been hamstrung by a
   number of weaknesses and shortcomings, especially on the discursive

Journal = {CONTEMPORARY SECURITY POLICY},

Volume = {38},

Pages = {371-397},
Abstract = {Why do states make substantial military contributions to coalition
   operations, while at the same time apply reservations, or caveats, to
   how the coalition can use the military contributions? Caveats rose to
   prominence in defense and policy circles with NATO's campaign in
   Afghanistan. In the scholarly security literature, the term remains a
   buzzword for all types of reserved efforts by states in coalition
   warfare, but there are few theoretical accounts addressing caveats. This
   article contributes to the knowledge gap on caveats through a
   comparative case study of Denmark's, the Netherlands', and Norway's
   contributions to NATO's intervention in Libya in 2011. It demonstrates
   that caveats can occur through three different causal pathways:
   compromises from domestic bargaining, handling of alliance commitments,
   and implementation and civil-military relations. Insights into the
   complexity that causes caveats are highly relevant for both political
   and military decision-makers that are trying to coordinate states'
   effort in coalition operations.},

Abstract = {In the European Union, the creation of public debt statistics starts
   with member state governments' reports. The EU's statistical agency -
   Eurostat - then revises. How do these actors' incentives shape reported
   numbers? Governments have incentives to take a more favourable view of
   often ambiguous accounting rules than Eurostat. Lower debt improves
   governments' performance with domestic and external audiences. Eurostat
   is tasked with monitoring budgets for excessive' debts. We expect
   governments to present debt figures that Eurostat then revises upwards.
   This is more likely when governments have high debts, especially when in
   the eurozone, and prior to elections. Financial crises heighten the
   number of policies needing interpretation and both actors have more
   incentives to shape the numbers. We examine these propositions using
   Eurostat's debt revisions. We find debts are revised upwards more for
   eurozone countries with higher debt levels and years with unscheduled
   elections. Financial stress strengthens these effects.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF EUROPEAN PUBLIC POLICY},

Abstract = {Gambling is a major industry in all European countries, generating
   billions in revenue to commercial actors and governments alike. It is
   also a source of addictions adversely affecting millions of individuals.
   The little research that exists on the politics of gambling legislation
   indicates a process of convergence towards a common policy standard.
   Yet, while policy convergence is the general trend, there are still
   significant national differences and, indeed, even divergence. A
   powerful example of this is the policy trajectories of Denmark and
   Norway. These two countries not only resemble each other in terms of
   political system and social model; they also shared virtually identical
   gambling policies for most of the 20th century. Notwithstanding these
   similarities, in recent years Norway has restricted access to gambling,
   whereas Denmark has become one of the most liberalized gambling regimes
   in Europe. The article presents an explanation of these diverse policy
   trends.},

Abstract = {This article investigates the sources of human rights actorhoodthe
   extent to which people understand, support and implement human rightsby
   examining a novel human rights survey that was embedded in the 2011
   Korean General Social Survey. My research uses ordinary-least-squares
   regression analyses to explore the factors that lead to individual
   differences in awareness and engagement. I employ four broad theoretical
   frameworks to explain the determinants of human rights orientations:
   realism, cultural factors, psychology, and world polity. My results
   suggest that multiple theoretical frameworks collectively contribute to
   a better grasp of what shapes human rights actorhood in South Korea. In
   particular, global polity and psychological elements have strong effects
   on awareness and engagement, while human rights education, religion, and
   socioeconomic factors have less of an effect than we might assume. This
   article emphasizes the importance of human agency, suggesting that the
   analysis of individual human rights orientations can help to bolster
   both awareness of and engagement in the global human rights movement.},

Abstract = {With an effort to further develop the economic output of China and
   preserve her social stability, the Government of the People's Republic
   of China is strongly motivated to secure the on-going inflow of crucial
   raw materials concurrently with the continuing outflow of Chinese
   products outside the Mainland China. Regarding the fact that almost
   three quarters of the overall volume of transported resources as well as
   exported production is done by maritime routes, the PRC faces a
   strategic challenge to control these routes in order to prevent their
   interruption. This corresponds with the continuous growth of Chinese
   military expenditures and focus on the further PLA Navy development.},

Abstract = {This paper focuses on civil society in Egypt as a site in which the
   Egyptian rural woman' is made by looking at processes of microfinance
   which often fail' to realise their stated goals of empowerment', poverty
   alleviation' or social mobility'. Using ethnographic material from a
   microfinance programme in the Egyptian governorate of al-Minya, such
   programmes are problematised beyond their stated goals. Instead, such
   initiatives put in place an infrastructure that links micro-borrowers to
   the market. Thus, what it means to be a liberated' woman in the Egyptian
   context is built on access, participation in and creation of the
   market'.},

Abstract = {This article examines the determinants of outsiderness among young
   people and thus contributes to the growing literature on dualization.
   Complementing the argument developed by Palier and Thelen-originally
   developed to characterize the situation in Continental Europe-we provide
   a new explanation to the kind of dualization (age-based) that
   characterizes Southern Europe, Anglo-Saxon countries and (a few) Nordic
   countries. High deindustrialization and social conflict are the
   cornerstone of the theoretical argument developed in this article. It is
   argued that the former reduces the share of available stable jobs and
   the latter brings about an uneven distribution of risk across different
   social groups. Using fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA),
   we show that these two factors are crucial to explain high levels of
   outsiderness among young people. To complement the fsQCA analysis, a
   qualitative discussion is provided of three case studies (Portugal, UK
   and Denmark).},

Abstract = {Terrorism provokes not only policy responses in terms of security but
   also public narratives aimed at restoring routine in shattered
   societies. This paper investigates the relevance and meanings of
   tolerance' in the discursive response to jihadist terrorist attacks. We
   ask how tolerance' as a value of liberal societies and a key concept of
   religious pluralism functions as a tool to facilitate this process of
   reassurance in the immediate aftermath of religiously motivated
   violence. We examine this question in a comparative case study of the
   discursive responses in Austria to the jihadist terrorist attacks in
   Paris in January and November 2015 based on the empirical analysis of
   media articles, press releases and speeches by political and civil
   society actors. We find that very different meanings are attributed to
   tolerance', from a praise of pluralism and freedom of rights to the
   justification of restrictive and exclusionary policies. We argue that
   this variety of usage is rooted in broader contextual developments, such
   as increased migration and politicization thereof, and reveal the
   ambivalent effects of tolerance' as a concept to restore routine in
   liberal democratic societies. Thus, this empirically oriented paper
   contributes to the mostly theoretical debate on presupposed common
   values, including tolerance, in liberal democracies.},

Abstract = {The Lisbon treaty afforded the European Parliament (EP) increased powers
   in foreign policy. These have included new legislative competences in
   the area of international agreements or the European Union's (EU)
   relations with third party states. This article analyses the way the
   last mandate of the EP, which was the first to benefit from the changes
   introduced by the Lisbon treaty, framed EU foreign policy. More
   specifically, it explores the way in which the EP strategically framed
   the EU's approach towards the neighbourhood countries. The focus on the
   neighbourhood is justified by the fact that it is the most salient area
   of the EU's foreign policy. The article shows that the EP pushed for the
   EU to have a stronger presence in the neighbourhood. The EP also
   strategically aimed that it should have a more central role in shaping
   the EU's approach towards the neighbourhood.},

Abstract = {This article presents and analyzes the ``Obama supports terrorism{''}
   campaign, which was launched in Egypt in late June 2013 and was
   instrumental to the framing of some Islamist groups as terrorist both
   before and after the 3 July 2013 coup. The analysis of the visual
   material of the campaign highlights its reliance on various Western
   discourses from the War on Terror, including some whose religious and
   racial content is an odd fit for a non-Western, Muslim country like
   Egypt. Yet, despite the lack of a clear and unified causal narrative to
   justify such framing, the success of the campaign was crucially aided by
   the symbolic and rhetorical power its slogan, which provided a credible
   ``schema of interpretation{''} for its supporters.},

Abstract = {Scholars have long viewed parliamentarians as parochial actors having
   little interest, or incentive to engage, in international diplomacy.
   Yet, parliaments have recently taken on a very active role in various
   international negotiations. This article explores the role of the
   European Parliament (EP) in the European Union (EU)-Canada Comprehensive
   Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA) and the EU-United States
   Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) negotiations.
   Drawing on classic institutionalist insights, it develops the concept of
   parliamentary assertion and explores its usefulness through a
   combination of comparative and process-tracing analyses. The conclusions
   are threefold: (1) the EP has asserted its power in international trade
   matters beyond the simple power of consent; (2) the EP's search for
   legitimacy in the EU polity is driving this phenomenon; and (3) this
   phenomenon is significant beyond the current CETA and TTIP negotiations.},

Abstract = {Rather than becoming obsolete, national parliaments have come back
   obstinately in the politics of trade. This article develops this
   proposition and explores its contribution to the idea of twenty
   first-century trade as contentious market regulation. Contra the Lisbon
   Treaty, national parliaments' assertion entrenches the role of domestic
   actors in the EU trade liberalisation policy, and fleshes out its
   multi-level parliamentary bases. We discuss the role, drivers, and
   patterns of parliamentary assertion and explore parliamentary assertion
   using preliminary survey and case study material. We find that the
   Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership negotiations represented
   the tipping-point of parliamentary assertion. Through interpretation and
   political engagement, national parliaments have forged a role for
   themselves that was unforeseen in the Lisbon Treaty: weighing in on the
   policy-making and the ratification processes. In Europe, parliamentary
   assertion reflected the twin impact of a changing global trade agenda
   and the centralisation of the EU trade policy regime.},

Title = {Global justice and environmental governance: an analysis of the Paris
   Agreement},
Journal = {REVISTA BRASILEIRA DE POLITICA INTERNACIONAL},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {60},
Number = {1},
Abstract = {Based on the major normative political theory contributions on global
   climate justice, the present paper analyzes the new international
   agreement on climate change, adopted at COP 21 in Paris (2015).
   Therefore, a literary review of the extensive normative theoretical
   discussion about global climate justice is made, with special attention
   to the two approaches that have permeated multilateral political
   negotiations - historical responsibility and equal per capita emissions.
   From this normative discussion, this paper recalls the global climate
   change negotiation process, focusing on the Kyoto Protocol. Next, the
   analysis emphasizes on the Paris Agreement in an effort to evaluate the
   normative questions on justice and equity within the environmental
   governance regime. Finally, the set of conclusions indicates that,
   although the flexibility of the Agreement has encompassed some
   dimensions of responsibility, necessity and ability to bear the costs,
   the most complex dimensions of justice and equity has not been
   completely solved, which may hinder the operation of environmental
   governance in a near future.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF EUROPEAN PUBLIC POLICY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {24},
Number = {11, SI},
Pages = {1678-1697},
Abstract = {Scholars of public policy point to standards as a new form of food and
   agriculture policy-making. The contribution complements this literature
   applying analytical concepts from International Relations research and
   organizational theory. Taking into account the increasingly complex and
   fluid nature of global food politics, the study undertakes a critical
   re-evaluation of the organizational field approach. Considering the
   interconnectedness of structure and agency it adds the concepts of
   entrepreneurship and calibration to the analysis of global
   organizational fields. The empirical analysis conducts a qualitative
   historical examination of the construction of the organizational field
   of organic agriculture policy-making through standards. It traces three
   phases of institutional development, identifies areas of contestation
   and distinct paths of institutional change influenced by the interplay
   of entrepreneurship and the institutional dynamics of structuration,
   homogenization and calibration.},

Abstract = {Sinclair Lewis, the first American to win the Nobel Prize in Literature,
   anticipated many aspects of Donald J. Trump's 2016 campaign and election
   in his 1935 satirical dystopia, It Can't Happen Here. It was his most
   popular novel to date and is still satisfying, thought-provoking
   political theater. Lewis was influenced by growing totalitarianism in
   Europe, reported on by his second wife, foreign correspondent, Dorothy
   Thompson. Noting the power of Father Coughlin and Huey Long, among
   others, to mobilize a public still suffering from the Great Depression,
   Lewis feared a fascist takeover of the American government by democratic
   means. Lewis's fictional nightmare features a loutish, ignorant
   demagogue, who is manipulated by a sinister ghostwriter adviser. With
   support from a resentful League of Forgotten Men, the demagogue is
   elected President and quickly establishes a military, racist, and
   anti-Semitic dictatorship. It Can't Happen Here dramatizes the dire
   consequences of this takeover, which is not taken seriously at first by
   Lewis's newspaper editor protagonist, but then is increasingly resisted.
   Lewis is a social satirist in the Mark Twain tradition, and his novel is
   worth reading today for its suggestive parallels with current history
   and its good-hearted humor.},

   change},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL POLITICS},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {26},
Number = {2},
Pages = {212-231},
Abstract = {The politics of climate change is much discussed, but there has been
   little investigation into how politicians themselves understand or
   articulate the issue. Corpus analysis, a method developed within
   linguistics, is used to investigate how UK politicians talk about
   climate change, using the example of the 2008 Climate Change Bill.
   Corpus techniques, including keyword analysis, collocation and semantic
   tagging, are used, alongside critical reading of the text. The analysis
   shows that politicians frame climate change as an economic and technical
   issue, and neglect discussion of the human and social dimensions. They
   are selective in their use of scientific evidence, with little mention
   of abrupt or irreversible change. In doing so, they attempt to `tame'
   climate change, rather than confronting difficult realities. While this
   strategy has the benefit of political acceptability, it does not allow
   for discussion of the full political and social implications of climate
   change, and precludes more radical responses.},

Abstract = {In recent years, there have been many high pro le examples of
   African-Americans mobilizing to influence ``morality policy{''} issues.
   The most galvanizing of these issues has been same-sex marriage. This
   study examines how Black state legislators have responded when faced
   with legislation that would either restrict marriage rights or expand
   the rights of same-sex couples. An examination of Black state
   legislators' votes on these measures reveals that most have opposed
   restrictions on marriage rights, usually at a higher rate than other
   Democrats. When confronted with legislation expanding rights of same-sex
   couples, a majority of Black legislators support these measures. This
   voting record stands in contrast to the attitudes and voting behavior of
   the broader Black population as indicated by opinion data and exit
   polling. This divergence from the position of the broader population is
   likely the result of personal attitudes of the legislators and political
   party strategy.},

Title = {The Politics of Trauma Studies: What Can We Learn From Women Combatants'
   Experiences of Traumatic Events in Conflict Zones?},

Abstract = {Wars, combat, and political developments triggered the study of trauma.
   Knowledge about trauma initially emerged from the experiences of men
   combatants in the battlefield. At a later stage, the study of trauma
   focused on women and children subject to violence and abuse. The current
   research suggests that additional aspects of trauma can be understood
   through the study of competent women exposed to traumatic events and not
   merely as victims of war or abuse. The study offers an analysis of women
   combatants' narratives of their exposure to traumatic events in conflict
   zones. Data were obtained from two focus groups and a series of 30
   personal interviews of women veterans who served in the IDF.
   Interviewing women combat soldiers revealed a variety of narratives of
   their war experiences, including the intertwining of the emotional and
   the physical. The window to understanding the trauma was opened by
   analysis of the responses of the women combatants to potentially
   traumatic events rather than by focusing on post-traumatic stress
   disorder (PTSD) per se. We emphasize the need for a critical perspective
   in the study of trauma and combat trauma and propose that there is value
   in engaging with and listening to diverse narratives of trauma.},

Abstract = {In this study, we examined the impacts of population age groups of 0-14,
   15-64 and 65-above on residential electricity consumption in Azerbaijan
   within the STIRPAT framework. Unlike many prior studies of STIRPAT
   framework, we analyzed this impact, employing co-integration and error
   correction method in order to rule out possible spurious estimation
   results caused by non-stationary data used. Results from the
   Autoregressive Distributed Lags Bounds Testing approach, which is the
   preferred method among alternatives in the case of small samples,
   indicated that the affluence together with age groups have significant
   impact on the residential electricity consumption in Azerbaijan and the
   biggest effect comes from the age group of 15-64, which is the working
   age population. Another finding of the study is that if there is any
   (economic, social, environmental, etc.) shock to the system that
   initially affect residential electricity consumption and affluence, the
   whole shock will be absorbed by the system less than in one year.
   Findings of the study may be useful in making appropriate decisions in
   the fields of residential electricity consumption. (C) 2017 The Regents

Abstract = {Although the United States (US) federal bureaucracy is plagued by high
   vacancy rates generally, quorum requirements and small board sizes make
   vacancies particularly problematic within major independent regulatory
   commissions. Not all vacancies, however, are created equal. By statute,
   some major boards allow members to continue serving beyond their
   original term in the absence of a confirmed replacement. The difference
   between an empty seat and a holdover official is important as it can
   determine whether a board is functional or inoperable. In this article,
   we examine how the presence of holdover provisions within such
   commissions alters confirmation dynamics and vacancy rates. Evidence
   suggests that holdover provisions lead to quicker confirmation on
   nominations as well as fewer complete vacancies. Such structures thus
   help mitigate the short-term problems stemming from staffing independent
   regulatory boards, especially given the tendency towards obstruction in
   the US Senate.},

Title = {Corporate Motivations for Donating to the Police in Bulgaria},
Journal = {EAST EUROPEAN POLITICS AND SOCIETIES},

Abstract = {From 2005 to 2011, the Bulgarian police force collected donations
   exceeding \$90 million from a host of individuals, corporations, foreign
   governments, persons undergoing criminal investigations, and convicts.
   After condemnation both domestically and internationally, the practice
   became completely illegal in 2013. Nevertheless, in 2015, the government
   lifted the donation prohibition, allowing foreign governments and
   international and state organizations to donate to the Interior
   Ministry. Differentiating between utilitarian and moral models of
   corporate social responsibility is important, since genuine donors
   create higher value through their prosocial deeds than self-interested
   ones. Given Bulgaria's excessive spending on public order and the
   ambiguous nature of donations to public servants, we seek to understand
   the corporate motivations for donating to the police. To address this
   question, we draw upon theories of corporate philanthropy, social
   exchange, and entrepreneurial orientation and use unique face-to-face
   interview data from 2011 to 2013 with police officers and
   businesspeople. Our qualitative findings point to multifaceted drivers
   of philanthropy beyond those considered in the dominant
   strategic-instrumental perspective. We argue that donations to the
   police can be an expression of business executives' altruistic values, a
   desire to forge strategic alliances, enhance status in social
   hierarchies, a form of political reconciliation, or a protection
   payment. Lastly, we present descriptive statistics of money donated to
   the Interior Ministry, discuss the potential socioeconomic consequences,
   and propose policies to reduce police reliance on private financing.},

Abstract = {Appointing a successor (the prince) allows the ruler (the king) to alter
   the structures of conflicts that take place between him and his
   potential challengers, as well as the structures of conflicts that take
   place among his potential challengers. Motivated by historical examples
   and using an infinite horizon rulership competition game, we show that
   while an appointed prince constitutes a powerful and dangerous threat to
   the incumbent ruler (the elevated threat effect), the appointed prince
   can also offer the incumbent ruler increased protection against other
   potential challengers (the barrier effect). We determine conditions when
   the overall effect of appointing a successor benefits the incumbent
   ruler and enables him to acquire a larger share of the governance rent
   in equilibrium.},

Abstract = {This article challenges the current research on youth disengagement by
   asking what makes young people active in different political
   organisations. It applies the classic civic voluntarism model to explore
   which factors (skills, attitudes, mobilisation and motivations) best
   distinguish between young activists in political parties' youth
   factions, the British Youth Council and the 2010 National Union of
   Students demonstrations. The results from multinomial logistic
   regression show that there are differences especially in the civic and
   political attitudes. The results also show that different organisations
   attract different kinds of young people, which can be used to
   (re-)engage young people in politics.},

Journal = {HUMAN RIGHTS QUARTERLY},

Volume = {39},

Abstract = {It has been perceived that China has formed a triple-market of
   religions, namely a red market of government-sanctioned religions, a
   black market of government-suppressed religions, and a large gray market
   of folk religion and spiritual groups. Additionally, China has formed a
   legal system to govern religious affairs, although little attention has
   been paid to this. This article develops a tripartite legal theory,
   arguing that freedom of religion has been tripartite. This will serve to
   illustrate the extent to which freedom of religion is protected in
   Chinese law and the conditions under which freedom of religion has been
   restricted in an illiberal context. Specifically, it comprises three
   incremental layers, namely conditional freedom, limited freedom, and no
   freedom. It is further suggested that such a tripartite model is
   dynamic, resilient, and compatible with China's authoritarianism under
   the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party.},

Journal = {POLITICS},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {37},

Abstract = {A survey of ordinary members of the United Kingdom's Conservative Party
   carried out in 2013 revealed that nearly 30\% of them would seriously
   consider voting for the country's radical right wing populist party
   (United Kingdom Independence Party (UKIP)). However, we show that at the
   general election in 2015, only a very small proportion of them - around
   5\% of Tory grassroots members - actually did so, driven it seems mainly
   by alienation from the leadership and David Cameron in particular, as
   well as, perhaps, by concerns about the Conservative-led government's
   austerity policies. However, those party members who did eventually vote
   for UKIP were still much more likely to have expressed a propensity to
   vote for it in 2013 than those who did not. Since the Conservative Party
   has not experienced the same increase in membership as some of its
   competitors, and since members are an important part of parties'
   electoral campaigning, they should avoid alienating those members they
   do have - something of which Theresa May appears to be aware.},

   context and tease out the prospects for a bespoke' UK exit agreement.
   Drawing on classics of social science historyby Barrington Moore,
   Gourevitch and Davisit reflects on suppressed historic choices' and
   historical periodisations. Three key dilemmas are interrogated: the
   Brexit dilemma (control of immigration/regaining of sovereignty vs
   European Union (EU) market access), the Brexiteers' dilemma (sustaining
   economic prosperity while restricting immigration) and the
   Remainers/soft Brexit dilemma (of weakening Parliamentary democracy by
   staying in the Single Market).},

Abstract = {This article combines a theoretical discussion of interculturalism with
   an analysis of intercultural policy programmes in European cities
   (Barcelona, Dublin, Vienna). It contributes in two ways to scholarship
   on superdiversity and migrant integration: first, by reflecting upon the
   potential of intercultural policies to respond to superdiverse
   societies. Second, by engaging with the dominant idea driving the
   adoption of intercultural policies in Europe: the idea that (super)
   diversity has to be harnessed for economic ends. The article indicates
   the need to take the dynamics of the political economy, and issues of
   inequality more into account in scholarly debates about immigrant
   integration and superdiversity.},

Abstract = {The development of a neutral, professional bureaucracy has been a
   profound concern for emerging democracies. International and domestic
   actors have expended significant resources to encourage the development
   of the rule of law, yet many postcommunist societies remain mired in
   corruption. When corrupt behaviors are integrated with a core function
   of democratic states, such as the implementation of free and fair
   elections, the implications of failures to professionalize bureaucrats
   are enhanced. This article empirically evaluates how professionalization
   and corruption interact in election administration, using unique survey
   data from Ukraine. We assess the results of pre- and postelection
   surveys of administrators conducted across Ukraine during the 2014
   parliamentary elections. Our results suggest that aspects of a
   professionalized bureaucracy coexist with corruption and that mitigating
   incentives for state capture is a major challenge for democratization.},

Abstract = {Applying the acculturation framework to the political domain, this
   research examines how Dutch majority members and members of different
   minority groups evaluate the political acculturation strategies of an
   immigrant-origin group. Using an experimental vignette design (N=664),
   the results show that the strategy of political assimilation (only
   advance the interests of society) was evaluated most positively,
   followed by integration (advance the interest of society and of the
   minority group), and then separation (only advance the interest of the
   minority group). This was found for the native Dutch as well as the
   immigrant-origin groups. This suggest that minority members do not view
   minority outgroups as potential allies to counter the dominance of the
   majority group, but rather as competitors for political influence.
   Furthermore, the role of dual identification for the evaluation of
   ingroup political acculturation depended on the type of political
   acculturation strategy.},

Abstract = {Existing neopositivist approaches to causal explanation focus their time
   and effort on the evaluation of nomothetic causal claims, and spend very
   little energy on the question of how, precisely, a nomothetic
   generalization explains a particular observed outcome. Against this
   approach I develop a more pragmatic analysis of the act of explanation
   in order to flesh out the context of causal explanation more broadly.
   Causal explanation, I argue, responds to a problem-situation in which
   the challenge involves how to do something, and unfolds by clarifying
   why and how some outcome rather than some other outcome came about -
   thus giving instructions on how to make the desired outcome happen. The
   resulting account of causal explanation encompasses a wide variety of
   explanatory strategies including the appeal to causal mechanisms,
   dispositional properties, everyday experiences, and even nomothetic
   generalisations; as such, it provides a better and broader basis for
   thinking about causal explanation in international studies than the
   restrictive neopositivist models presently on offer.},

Abstract = {Collaborative governance regimes (CGRs) are often viewed as a means to
   be more inclusive of diverse actors than other forms of governance.
   However, collaboration can also reinforce preexisting power and resource
   dynamics instead of distributing resources and facilitating joint
   action. This article tests seven hypotheses concerning how the
   structural position of an actor within a policy network influences said
   actor's ability to access resources through participation in CGRs. We
   then test these hypotheses using data generated by a survey of 400
   actors within a regional environmental governance network that contains
   57 CGRs. Using exponential random graph models (ERGMs) designed to
   account for network dependencies, we test how various attributes of
   network structure-in terms of an actor's connections to other actors and
   to CGRs-influence that actor's ability to access resources through CGR
   participation. We find that actors who benefit from participation in one
   CGR are more likely to benefit from participation in other CGRs as well,
   speaking to the potential for CGRs to further existing imbalances rather
   than distribute benefits more equitably. Further, CGRs that foster
   principled engagement (increased face-to-face communication, development
   of common problem understanding, and awareness of other network actors)
   are strongly associated with actors' ability to access financial, human,
   and technical resources through participation. Although the CGRs we
   study do improve actors' access to network resources, this can occur in
   ways that further existing inequities in resource access.},

Abstract = {The Paris Agreement was largely viewed as a resounding success by those
   who took part in its negotiation. This paper examines whether these
   claims hold up to closer scrutiny. More specifically, the paper will
   assess whether the Paris Agreement protects the human right to health.
   Considering that the widely celebrated 1.5 degrees C target aims to
   protect present and future generations from the effects of climate
   change, which include substantial threats to human health, this is an
   especially pertinent area of study for climate justice theorists.
   Despite the threats climate change poses to human health, the subject of
   health has been somewhat neglected among climate justice scholars and
   policy makers alike. This paper illustrates that a focus on health can
   reveal much about the inadequacies of the Paris Agreement and
   multilateral climate change governance more widely. Unfolding in two
   parts, the paper first focuses on human health, explaining how this is
   threated by climate change and why a human rights based climate justice
   approach can highlight the importance of these threats and define what
   is morally required of policy makers. Part two of the paper turns to the
   assessment of the Paris Agreement, focusing on whether the policy makers
   who negotiated the Agreement have met these requirements. By briefly
   examining what has been promised in the Convention and what has been
   achieved under the Kyoto Protocol to date, the paper is able to assess
   whether the Paris Agreement represents a significant departure from the
   so far inadequate response to the climate change problem. It will be
   illustrated that although there has been a small step forward, the Paris
   Agreement cannot be said to represent a just response which protects the
   right to health of present and future generations.},

Title = {Toward the Political Economy of Plural Policing: Taking Stock of a
   Burgeoning Literature},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL STUDIES REVIEW},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {19},
Number = {3},
Pages = {407-429},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {In the past two decades, a burgeoning plural policing literature has
   re-focused the attention on the plurality of sponsors and providers that
   populate policing landscapes throughout the world. This article coheres
   and advances this research agenda in two ways. It provides the first
   critical examination of its conceptual and theoretical achievements,
   while also highlighting important gaps that remain in explaining how
   struggles over the political economy affect plural policing and vice
   versa. This requires applying political economy questions about power
   and resources to policing-{''}how,{''} by `` whom,{''} and especially
   for `` whose{''} benefit policing is delivered-and conceptualizing
   policing as one aspect of state-society relations. The article further
   elucidates strengths and weaknesses of the plural policing literature in
   a case study of Indonesia's contemporary plural policing landscape. The
   importance of plural policing goes beyond academic endeavor. Indeed,
   plural policing is ubiquitous throughout the world and affects how
   security is provided, and power exercised, in most social realms whether
   at local, national or international level. It is thus a phenomenon
   difficult to ignore for comparative politics, IR scholars, and
   policymakers alike.},

Abstract = {The 2011 high-level meeting of the United Nations General Assembly on
   non-communicable diseases (NCDs), and subsequent developments in global
   public policy on NCDs can be seen as a contemporary case study in global
   health governance. As the debate on what constitutes appropriate and
   desirable governance continues, highly contrasting models are being
   compared as starting points. We define these as the global health
   initiative model and the convention/strategy model. Each has a different
   strategy at its core and represents a different response to key
   normative challenges that are said to plague global health governance -
   participation, scope of action, balancing power, legitimacy and
   effectiveness. As the current structure of the Global Coordinating
   Mechanism for NCDs within the WHO emerges as a possible new model, we
   argue that these normative challenges need to be addressed to safeguard
   against potential policy ineffectiveness.},

Title = {Contested Implementation: The Unilateral Influence of Member States on
   Peacebuilding Policy in Kosovo},
Journal = {GLOBAL POLICY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {8},
Number = {5, SI},
Pages = {102-112},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {International organizations play an important role in policy
   implementation. As member states do not necessarily resolve political
   disagreements before delegating tasks, this article focuses on how
   individual member states seek to influence policy implementation by
   international organizations. It argues that the institutional context in
   which delegation takes place affects the opportunities for such
   unilateral influence. Particularly when the agent has considerable
   autonomy, implementation is likely to be a contested process. The
   article presents evidence on the implementation of peacebuilding policy
   by three international organizations in Kosovo after independence in
   2008. Despite the fact that the member states within the UN, OSCE and EU
   fundamentally disagree on the legal status of Kosovo, the organizations
   have deployed substantial peacebuilding missions. The UN, OSCE and EU
   have, however, different institutional designs: implementing agents in
   the UN and OSCE have, by default, more autonomy than those in the EU. We
   analogously observe variation in how and to what extent member states
   exert unilateral influence during implementation of peacebuilding policy
   on the ground in Kosovo.
   Policy Implications
   Policy implementation by international organizations can be as
   politically contested as the decision-making by member states. Rather
   than avoiding the delegation of policy implementation, states should
   seek to balance between who gains during decision-making and who gains
   during implementation.
   Strong states have a disproportionate amount of influence over policy
   implementation. Weaker states should focus on the institutional
   constrains in which such unilateral influence plays out. This is an
   effective method of setting boundaries.
   The stricter collective control mechanisms in international
   organizations, the less likely individual member states exert unwanted
   unilateral influence. States should, however, also recognize that strict
   collective control often comes at the expense of the quality of policy
   implementation.
   The nitty-gritty institutional rules on staffing and budget allocation
   significantly affect how individual states can influence policy
   implementation by international organizations. States should be aware
   that these politics of bureaucratic resourcing can also undermine the
   quality of policy implementation.},

Abstract = {The political settlements approach emerged out of a critique of new
   institutional economics developed by Mushtaq Khan in the 1990s. Since
   then, the political settlements approach has proliferated in donor
   programming and academic scholarship on African countries. This has led
   to some confusion about its core conceptual and methodological features.
   This Research Note starts by setting out our understanding of political
   settlements and provides an overview of existing political settlements
   literature on African countries. The note then explores how the key
   concept of `holding power' has been employed in varied ways in the
   political settlements literature, which in turn has led to various
   methodologies to study power. The note discusses a number of these
   methodologies, including studying political ruptures as a window into
   analyzing the distribution of power in African countries, and emphasizes
   the importance of studying economic structure, ideology, violence
   rights, and rents as sources of holding power. The overall contribution
   of the note is to illustrate the varied strategies used in studying
   political settlements and to place them in conversation with one
   another.},

Abstract = {There is a lively ongoing debate about the effects of the widespread
   introduction of robots in work environments. Many people in the labor
   market worry about inequality and possible job loss that robot
   technology may create. However, large-scale studies on the determinants
   of these perceptions are thus far lacking. This article assesses which
   members of the labor force are most fearful of the introduction of
   robots at work by using the 2012 Eurobarometer Public Attitudes towards
   Robots dataset, covering 11 206 respondents in 20 European countries.
   Our study shows that those (a) in economic positions that are more
   likely to be negatively affected by robotics are more likely to be
   fearful of robots at work, along with, to some extent, those living in
   countries (b) with adverse economic conditions and (c) where employees
   are less protected from market forces. The theoretical and practical
   implications of these findings are discussed.},

Abstract = {This article studies whether the pursuit of counterterrorism militarizes
   foreign aid flows. It focuses on the case of US foreign aid to
   sub-Saharan African states, which recently have experienced an increase
   in the presence of al-Qaeda or its affiliate terrorist organizations.
   This article argues that as terrorist groups carry out attacks inside a
   state's territory, aid towards that state will serve such
   counterterrorism goals. For one, the state's executive branch will
   receive increased military aid to immediately fight al-Qaeda or
   affiliates. For the other, the United States also steps up aid for civil
   society and development, which could over time undermine al-Qaeda's
   mobilization and recruitment efforts. In an empirical analysis that
   covers 46 African states from 1996 to 2011, our results largely
   corroborate the hypothesized patterns for attacks that occur on a
   country territory and in the neighborhood. We note, though, that the
   overall composition of aid shifts relative to the military when there
   are direct attacks, something that does not occur when attacks happen in
   the neighborhood only. Our article concludes that concerns about
   militarization of aid are warranted, but that actual manifestations are
   nuanced.},

Abstract = {How effective are systems of transparency, such as Freedom of
   Information (FOI) requests? The ambitious aims of FOI laws hinge on
   whether requests produce the desired information for the citizens or
   groups that use them. The question is whether such legally mandated
   requests work better than more informal mechanisms. Despite the high
   hopes of advocates, organizational routines, lack of awareness or
   resistance may limit legal access and public bodies may seek to comply
   minimally rather than behave in concordance with the spirit of the law.
   This article reports a field experiment that compared FOI requests and
   informal nonlegal asks to assess which is more effective in accessing
   information from English parish councils. The basic premise of statutory
   access is borne out. FOI requests are more effective than simple asks
   and the size or preexisting level of openness of a body appears to make
   little difference to their responsiveness. FOI requests are more
   effective in encouraging bodies to do more than the law asks
   (concordance) than encouraging more minimal levels of legal cooperation,
   when a body simply fulfils its obligations to varying degrees
   (compliance). This finding indicates high levels of support for FOI once
   it is embedded within the system.},

Abstract = {This article investigates the informal networks of Member States that
   are claimed to be the drivers of EU gender and development policy. The
   aim is to highlight the negotiation strategies used in gender and
   development negotiations and to link these to network characteristics. I
   categorise the characteristics of the Nordic and the like-minded
   groupings, relying on network theory and investigate their modes of
   influence. The article is based on interviews with officials at the
   Permanent Representations and EU institutions in Brussels. My results
   demonstrate that the Nordics and the Like-Minded Countries constitute
   informal networks with frequent interaction. Network members share
   information and coordinate initiatives. The findings show a preference
   for gradual entrapment and framing rather than shaming and exclusion.
   The choice of strategies can be linked to network characteristics: the
   like-minded network is non-formalised and open, and as the ambition is
   to spread the norms of the like-minded also to reluctant actors, network
   participants prefer gradual entrapment and traditional diplomatic
   initiatives before confrontation. Norm promotion normally occurs in
   concentric circles negotiations, mirroring the layered structure of the
   network. This article contributes to the literature on informal
   governance in EU foreign policy by highlighting key strategies used in
   intra-EU policy networks.},

Abstract = {In the last 30 years, Chile has become an installation horizon for
   immigrants, which has been increased since the nineties for several
   Latin American and Central American countries (Peru, Argentina, Bolivia,
   Haiti, Colombia and Ecuador). Chile would have some 354,582 migrant's
   people who would correspond to approximately 2\% of the total
   population. Nevertheless, the State has developed isolated responses
   attention to this population that fall into a restricted view of rights,
   subjected to immigration law in effect since the military dictatorship.
   For that, it's necessary to explore the social management of immigration
   from a thoughtful approach to the notion of social
   inclusion/exclusion{''} considering different normative and social
   intervener strategies that has been initiated from the public sector to
   ensure ``human rights{''} of immigrants. For that reason; we'll present
   below a reflection about the barriers that are evident in social
   policies of this country and that is affecting the effective inclusion
   of the immigrant population, taking into account four main areas:
   education., housing, employment and health. These results are from an
   investigation with a mixed approach (quantitative and qualitative)
   developed in four geographical areas of Chile with highest immigrant
   population.
   Through this investigation we could display that different groups of
   immigrants in Chile are facing a number of barriers for their effective
   social inclusion not only derived from socio-cultural apprehensions or a
   rejection of social community-level reception to the foreign, but also
   from, constraints imposed by the State itself at the level of
   accessibility to possible benefits. These difficulties are derived from
   the legislative components that regulate the stay of foreigners in the
   country, but also occur in administrative terms, the management of
   programmatic offer available to the State and direct attention given to
   public services.},

Abstract = {A criticism of consociational power sharing as an institutional response
   to violent conflict is that it buttresses rather than ameliorates the
   underlying (linguistic, religious or ethno-national) divide, hence
   prohibiting the emergence of new dimensions of political competition
   (such as economic left-right or moral liberal-conservative dimensions)
   that are characteristic of normal' societies. We test this argument in
   the context of the illustrative Northern Ireland case, using data from
   expert coding of party policy documents and opinion data derived from
   two Voter Advice Applications (VAAs). We find evidence for a moral
   liberal-conservative dimension of politics in addition to the
   ethno-national dimension. Hence, we caution against assuming that
   consociational polities are unidimensional.},

Abstract = {Most studies of policy interdependence try to observe international
   policy networks by focusing on the diffusion of a specific policy across
   countries. Thus, if that policy is not adopted from one country to the
   next, researchers usually treat that as a sign of weak interdependence
   and the lack of diffusion. In this article, we challenge the notion that
   diffusion processes and interdependence entail the same policy
   diffusing. National governments usually engage in a bundle of diffusing
   policies at the same time. We argue that they are often pressed to
   implement the policy adopted in neighboring countries. But, at the same
   time, their incentive to implement this policy depends, at least in
   part, on how much they rely on foreign resources. The greater their
   dependence, the more likely they are to adopt the policy preferences of
   foreign constituents. Thus, conditional on a neighbor's pressure to
   adopt a policy, states may engage in policy alteration-the adoption of
   an alternative instrument to an internationally diffusing policy. We
   claim that such policy substitution is especially likely in countries
   that are less dependent on economic flows, as their governments enjoy
   more political leeway to turn policy diffusion processes to their
   advantage. We trace this mechanism using two studies of the diffusion of
   alternative environmental policies across space and time.},

Abstract = {This article looks at the progress made on the draft transpacific
   free-trade agreement and the motivations driving the Southeast Asian
   countries. We seek to explain why it has been so difficult, if not
   impossible, to implement an agreement officially adopted by four ASEAN
   countries. Our hypothesis is that countries in Southeast Asia, where
   China and the United States are embroiled in a geopolitical battle, join
   forces only when self-interest dictates. This prevents them from
   collectively seizing the opportunity that this new era in international
   cooperation presents. Most of all, the treaty attests to the dwindling
   influence of the United States in Southeast Asia and highlights China's
   policy of assertiveness and its power of attraction.},

Title = {Education and Social Trust: Testing a Causal Hypothesis Using the

Abstract = {One of the clearest results in previous studies on social trust is the
   robust positive relationship with educational attainment. The most
   common interpretation is that education has a causal effect on social
   trust. The theoretical argument and empirical results in this article
   suggest a different interpretation. We argue that common preadult
   factors such as cognitive abilities and personality traits rooted in
   genes and early-life family environment may confound the relationship
   between educational attainment and social trust. We provide new evidence
   on this question by utilizing the quasi-experiment of twinning. By
   looking at the relationship between education and social trust within
   monozygotic (MZ) twin pairs, we are able to avoid potential confounders
   rooted in genetic factors and common environmental influences because
   the monozygotic twins share both. The results suggest that when
   controlling for such familial factors the estimated effects of education
   on social trust are close to zero and far from reaching statistical
   significance. Further analyses show that the relationship between
   education and social trust largely is driven by common genetic factors.},

   Furthermore, the role played by the Russian media system in the

Abstract = {Workplace safety is an important issue in global public policy. Given
   the failure of many governments to enforce their workplace safety laws,
   might voluntary programs help in this regard? Most studies on the
   effectiveness of voluntary programs focus on their first-order effects
   reflecting program goals. Yet, well-designed programs that focus on
   firms' internal practices and policies can have significant spillover
   effects beyond the program objectives. This insight motivates our study
   of the second- order effect on occupational safety of ISO 9001, the most
   widely adopted voluntary standard in the world. While ISO 9001 is a
   quality management standard, the internal systems that ISO certified
   firms establish can improve workplace safety. This is because some
   workplace practices that lead to poor product quality also contribute to
   an unsafe working environment. Our empirical analysis covering 92
   countries for the period 1993-2012 supports our argument. We find that 1
   per cent increase in country-level ISO 9001 certification count is
   associated with 0.04 per cent decline in occupational injury rate
   (injury per 10,000 working population). Importantly, our finding is more
   pronounced where public law regarding workers' rights is weak,
   suggesting that voluntary programs can fill in the governance gaps.},

Abstract = {This article represents one of the few systematic comparisons of
   left-wing populism with other populisms. Focussing on the manifestos of
   six British parties in 1999-2015, the findings confirm that left-wing
   populists are more socio-economically focussed, more inclusionary but
   less populist than right-wing populists. The article makes four main
   substantive contributions. First, empirically, it shows that the
   much-touted populist Zeitgeist in the United Kingdom barely exists.
   Second, methodologically, it provides a nuanced disaggregated populism
   scale that has advantages over existing methods because it can
   effectively distinguish populist from non-populist parties and analyse
   degrees of populism. Third, theoretically, it shows that host ideology
   is more important than populism per se in explaining differences between
   left and right populisms. Fourth is a broader theoretical point: what is
   often called thin' or mainstream' populism' is not populism but
   demoticism (closeness to ordinary people). Therefore, analysts should
   not label parties populist' just because their rhetoric is demotic.},

Abstract = {An extensive body of literature discusses the disaffection of citizens
   with representative democracy and highlights increasing citizens'
   preferences for political decision-makers beyond elected politicians.
   But so far, little research has been conducted to analyse the relations
   between citizens' respective preferences and their political behaviour.
   To address this void in the literature, our article investigates the
   extent to which citizens' preferences for certain political
   decision-makers (politicians, citizens or expert) have an impact on
   their retrospective and prospective political participation. Our
   analysis draws on data from a survey conducted in autumn of 2014 on a
   probability representative sample in Germany. Results indicate that
   respondents favouring politicians as decision-makers focus mainly on
   voting. Those who favour citizens as decision-makers are more willing to
   get involved in participatory procedures, while those inclined towards
   expert decision-making show mixed participation.},

Abstract = {One of the most important geopolitical events at the end of the
   twentieth century was the appearance of five new nation-states in what
   Halford Mackinder described, in 1904, as the heartland or geographical
   hub of the world. Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, Kazakhstan, Tajikistan and
   Kirghizstan are the countries that make up Central Asia and that
   currently play an important role in global geopolitics and the global
   economy, above all because of their oil and gas reserves. However, given
   their importance in the region, they are experiencing a range of
   conflicts, including incomplete democratization processes, disputes over
   the use and exploitation of the Caspian Sea resources, ethnic problems,
   and a rise in Islamic fundamentalism, all of which impact on regional
   and international stability, in addition to an intense rivalry between
   global and regional powers for influence in the zone. This paper
   identifies the most significant conflicts in Central Asia and sketches
   out some of the possible scenarios for the region's future.},

Title = {Racial Attitudes Predicted Changes in Ostensibly Race-Neutral Political
   Attitudes Under the Obama Administration},
Journal = {POLITICAL PSYCHOLOGY},

Abstract = {Past research demonstrated that racial prejudice played a significant
   role in the 2008 presidential election, but relatively less is known
   about the relationship between prejudice and public opinion throughout
   the Obama administration. In the present research, we examined not only
   whether racial attitudes were associated with evaluations of Mr. Obama
   and his administration, but also whether they may have influenced the
   development of more general political attitudes during the early years
   of the Obama administration. We investigated this question using panel
   data from a nationally representative sample of Americans interviewed
   between September 2008 and July 2010. Racial attitudes measured prior to
   the election predicted early disapproval of President Obama's handling
   of important issues. Early disapproval of President Obama's performance,
   in turn, predicted later perceptions of whether the state of the nation
   was improving. Further, the divergence between high-prejudice and
   low-prejudice individuals in their perceptions of the state of the
   nation became greater over time, consistent with the idea that racial
   attitudes were more powerfully expressed in political judgments as time
   passed.},

Abstract = {Voters reward or punish politicians by deeming them responsible for
   positive and negative outcomes, but how, in turn, do politicians
   attribute responsibility to those who actually deliver public services?
   Inattention to this question renders incomplete current perspectives on
   democratic processes of accountability, even as politicians are
   increasingly provided with performance data to hold bureaucrats
   accountable. We shed light on this issue using a survey experiment of
   elected officials featuring actual performance data. We find that the
   provision of performance data makes elected officials more willing to
   attribute causal responsibility to bureaucratic leaders, but only in
   cases of low performance, suggesting a negativity bias in public sector
   responsibility attribution processes. Additionally, we offer evidence
   that interest group advocates influence how elected officials use
   performance information to attribute responsibility, but contingent on
   ideological alignment.},

Abstract = {Most scholars have highlighted the commonalities of labour market
   reforms under austerity in Europe, mostly in terms of liberalization. We
   argue that a more differentiated analysis is in order, as empirical
   developments point to distinct reform trajectories. We analyse in detail
   the two Southern European cases where pressure for austerity was
   intense, but governments maintained a degree of discretion as they were
   not subjected to direct bailout conditions: Italy and Spain. We examine
   the period since 2010, which includes a major labour market reform in
   each of the two states in 2012. Using a theoretical framework that
   allows distinguishing forms of liberalization, we find that reforms in
   the two states indeed differed markedly. In Spain, flexibilization and
   declining coverage of protection prevailed, whereas in Italy
   flexibilization was combined with improved protection of workers at the
   margin of the labour market. The differing influence of the centre-left
   helps to explain this divergence.},

   particular the notion of bureaucratic `shirking'. Although a popular
   theoretical model among public choice scholars of public administration,
   the `shirking' argument has not been empirically supported. The article
   compares two organisational models of ensuring public servants'
   compliance; a contract regime which is common in public-interest-based,
   Anglo American countries, and a trust-based regime found in Continental
   European, Scandinavian and Asian administrative systems.},

Journal = {GLOBAL POLICY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {8},
Number = {2, SI},
Pages = {60-68},

Abstract = {Efficiency is one of the most potent measures of health system
   performance and is of particular interest to policy makers because it
   seeks to assess the valued outcomes of a health system in relation to
   the resources that are sacrificed to achieve those outcomes. However,
   the production process of the health care system is a complex sequence,
   and most indicators are only able to capture part of that process; these
   indicators offer limited scope for analysis. While researchers have
   previously constructed composite indicators which combine partial
   measures into a single number, the weights used for aggregating data can
   be contentious and may not be universally applicable across systems.
   Data envelopment analysis (DEA) is most often used to compare the
   productivity of different producing entities, including health systems.
   In this article, we instead propose a method that relies on DEA to
   construct composite health system efficiency indicators from several
   partial efficiency measures. Among other noted benefits, this enables
   the construction of composite indicators where different weights are
   attached to partial indicators for each country, allowing countries to
   be viewed according to the weights that cast each in the best light. Our
   application of this method suggests that there is reasonable consistency
   among the countries that are found to be efficient.},

Abstract = {Several theories compete to explain observed race- and ethnicity-based
   environmental injustice in society. This paper focuses on analyzing the
   extent to which firms' siting decisions based on community privilege can
   explain this outcome. A unique feature of this analysis is that we
   include analysis of both unwanted land uses (disamenity firms) and
   desired land uses (amenity firms). The environmental justice analysis of
   amenities other than green spaces is rare, but amenities are crucial
   components of urban areas to which environmental justice studies must
   attend. We use an agent-based model to explore community outcomes when
   environmental disamenities choose locations based on low community
   privilege, and compare this with scenarios in which disamenities only
   seek to minimize the cost of land. We also assess differences in
   environmental justice outcomes when amenities choose locations in areas
   with high community privilege. While disamenities' focus on locating in
   areas with low community privilege indeed affects environmental equity,
   the effect of amenity location is also important, and there are powerful
   interaction effects. The importance of privilege-based location is found
   in these simulations regardless of which social groupmajority or
   minorityis assumed to be the privileged group. This study suggests a
   limitation of EJ policies and models that focus on the politics of
   disamenity siting without considering the politics of amenity siting.},

Abstract = {This article is a critical reflection on the ``logic of practicality{''}
   developed by Vincent Pouliot, who has contributed to the advance of
   international relations theory over the past ten years. Drawing on their
   own work, the authors formulate three questions respecting the logic of
   practicality. First, they question the entrenchment of the logic of
   practicality with reflexive logic in Pouliot's theoretical construction.
   Second, they consider its methodological operationalization. And
   finally, they examine the status of empirical data and its use. In
   acknowledging the break advocated by Pouliot, the authors urge readers
   to contemplate other ``logics of practicality{''} and draw even more
   extensively on ethnographic field research to renew international
   relations theory.},

Abstract = {This article examines the possibilities of interaction and collaboration
   between top-down and bottom-up indicators of peace. It is based on the
   Everyday Peace Indicators project an experimental research project that
   operated in local communities in four sub-Saharan countries. The article
   begins by making the case for bottom-up approaches to the study of
   peace, conflict and security. It goes on to scope out the opportunities
   and obstacles for comparison between bottom-up and top-down indicator
   systems and looks at three issues: comparability, commensurability and
   complementarity. It draws on four well-know measurements of peace,
   conflict and development: the Human Development Index (HDI), the Global
   Peace Index, the Uppsala Conflict Data Program's Georeferenced Event
   Data (UCDP GED), and the Armed Conflict Location and Event Data Program
   (ACLED). We argue for a plurality of vantage points from which to
   measure peace and conflict.},

Abstract = {Political interest is a crucial precursor to political engagement, but
   little is known about how to stimulate greater interest. The article
   explores the role social motives have in generating interest. A
   laboratory experiment is used in which it is possible to manipulate
   beliefs about the social rewards of political engagement as well as
   external efficacy beliefs. Across two types of measures for political
   interest (self-reports and revealed preferences), connecting political
   engagement with social rewards led to substantial increases in political
   interest. Moreover, these effects were particularly strong among
   individuals with low levels of external efficacy. Ultimately, the data
   provide clear evidence that political interest can be positively
   stimulated with social rewards mobilisation techniques and that it is
   rooted in beliefs about the potential motives pursuable through
   politics. The paper concludes with a discussion of the broader
   implications of these results for studies of political participation and
   mobilisation efforts.},

Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {In this article, the issue of communication in Chinese environmental
   criminal law is examined in relation to whether it is understandable to
   the public or not. It is concluded that Chinese environmental criminal
   law is ambiguous. It is argued that poor enforcement of criminal
   environmental law is partly due not only to the failure of the lawmakers
   to make clear rules but also to the failure of communicating important
   moral and aesthetic values to the public so necessary for effective
   protection of the environment. It is affirmed that along with the rules
   of behaviour, law must also communicate values. The Chinese history has
   its own rich pro-environmental ethical tradition of Confucianism,
   Taoism, and Buddhism which must be utilized to address all aspects of
   environmental protection including environmental crime issues.
   Legislation must be an educational tool which communicates vital moral
   values to the public. Environmental protection is one area where such
   communication is particularly important.},

Abstract = {Contemporary global governance architecture has been described as
   fragmented, incoherent, and inefficient. The mandates of prominent
   international organizations (IOs) often overlap and coordination is
   regarded more as the exception than the rule. In this context,
   international institutions designed with an explicit coordination
   mandate hold significant promise. These assembled institutions (AIs),
   like the Global Environment Facility (GEF) and UNAIDS, formally
   incorporate IOs in their designs and seek to coordinate and bring
   coherence to their work in a given issue area. Although praised for
   their bold and innovative designs, little scholarly work has assessed
   the success of these institutions in fulfilling coordination mandates.
   The paper introduces AIs as an organizational form and sheds light on
   two challenges they face that provide barriers to coordination. First,
   concerns regarding status and material losses may cause relevant IOs to
   resist coordination despite ostensibly opting in to participate in the
   assembled institution. Second, the governing bodies of assembled
   institutions are weak relative to the prominent IOs incorporated in
   their designs. The home governing bodies of these institutions often do
   little to reinforce the importance of coordination, hampering
   performance. These challenges are illustrated in the case of the GEF and
   UNAIDS.},

Abstract = {This article contextualizes the seemingly robust Central-Eastern
   European reactions to terrorist events in Western Europe, whilst
   examining the difference between how counterterrorism (CT) in
   Central-Eastern Europe looks in theory and how it works in practice. It
   constitutes the first comparative study, across eight case studies,
   focusing solely on CT-related issues of the post-2004 EU entrants, and
   one of the very first assessing CT developments in post-communist Europe
   available in English. The article addresses a serious gap in terrorism
   studies that are oriented towards works on terrorism or CT in Western
   Europe. It sets out five distinguishing features of CT routines in
   Central-Eastern Europe and consequently argues that Central-Eastern
   Europeans ``reference{''} their CT arrangements from Western Europe in a
   copy and paste manner. Moreover, the Central-Eastern European CT, unlike
   that of their CT ``referees{''} from Western Europe, is not linear in
   nature and does not stem from the local threat perception being filtered
   through CT legacies (developed norms, practices, and routines). By
   thematically analysing the haphazard manner in which the Central-Eastern
   Europeans develop their CT legacies, and depicting how eager they are in
   adopting the Western European rationale for countering a threat that is
   hardly present in their region, the article provides new empirical basis
   (derived from qualitative data, including sixty interviews with
   Central-Eastern European CT experts and officials) for a far-reaching
   argument about a West-East (old EU-new EU) divide on CT in Europe.},

Abstract = {The European Union has declared ambitious objectives for a common
   European foreign policy since the end of the cold war. Through
   successive revisions of its constitutional treaties, it has built may of
   the institutions that might support such a common policy. Incremental
   changes and adaptation through experience of successive crises have
   strengthened practices of cooperation and consultation. Yet the
   retention of sovereignty over foreign and defence policy by national
   governments, and the unwillingness of national governments and
   parliaments to engage in any EU-wide reconsideration of strategic needs
   and objectives has left these common institutions without the permissive
   consensus needed to support effective shared action. National
   inhibitions about subordinating particular interests and assumptions to
   a wider European consensus have left the EU institutions without the
   ability either to promote shared European interests or to act
   effectively when those interests are threatened.},

Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL POLITICS},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {26},
Number = {4},
Pages = {738-763},
Abstract = {A striking development in climate governance is the emergence of systems
   for non-state actors to make voluntary commitments alongside state
   undertakings. Because these commitments involve diverse actors carrying
   out diverse activities in diverse settings, they provide unprecedented
   opportunities for experimentation and learning. Yet voluntary commitment
   systems (VCS) rarely promote experimentation and provide few systematic
   learning mechanisms. Based on work with Duncan Snidal, an argument is
   made for a more strongly experimental approach. First, VCS should
   encourage designed, controlled policy experiments consistent with
   scientific standards. Second, even where formal experiments are
   infeasible, VCS should treat commitments as informal experiments,
   orchestrating them to promote innovation, comparability, analysis and
   systematic learning. Collaborative initiatives and other governance
   organizations can act as orchestrators, encouraging and supporting
   formal and informal experimentation through persuasion, technical and
   material assistance, recognition, third-party assistance and other
   incentives.},

Abstract = {Lake Tana Basin development corridor (LTSBDC) is a corridor in Amhara
   region which covers an area of about 1.5 million hectares. The area is
   known for the variety of annual and perennial crops grown, its breeds of
   livestock and diversified vegetation, and especially its forest
   resources. In the years between 1986 and 2013, both built-up areas and
   cultivated land cover increased. This indicates that, due to expansion
   of cultivated land and human settlements, the natural forest land cover
   declined. Similar to natural forest, grassland cover was also found to
   decrease. Land use and land cover change and consequent land degradation
   in the Lake Tana watershed limits the potential to develop a sustainable
   livelihood for its inhabitants. The effectiveness of the regional and
   local efforts to improve the environment and livelihoods of the
   residents in the Lake Tana watershed through natural resource
   conservation programs are limited due to capacity and financial
   barriers. Land use and water resource related barriers that were
   identified include weak policy implementation, low capacity (technical
   and financial), poor information management system, low or no
   incentives, and frequent restructuring of core and principal
   institutions at national/regional levels. Alleviation of these
   constraints will be important for better delivery of technical support
   and enabling local users to implement good land use related practices,
   to influence policies; reduce dependency on aids and implement
   environmentally friendly watershed management activities; terraces,
   gully rehabilitation check dams and alley cropping as biological
   measures.},

   historical exclusion of African-Americans from effective political
   power. This history of ``distortion of democracy{''} includes the
   Southern-dominated Republican Party's filibuster of Obama administration
   policies, the Democratic filibuster of civil rights legislation in the
   middle twentieth century, the disenfranchisement of minority voters
   prior to the Voting Rights Act, and the two-thirds rule that gave the
   White South an effective veto over Democratic Presidential Nominations.
   Also older constitutional rules and patterns like the three-fifths
   clause, slave-state preferences in Supreme Court nominations, and the
   malapportioned Senate itself have been used by the White South to block
   the will of majority.},
