Abstract = {Steam locomotives, a transformative transportation technology,
   experienced quick and wide adoption among major Western powers in the
   nineteenth century. However, when this technology reached East Asia
   later in the century, japan enthusiastically adopted it while China did
   not. Why was this the case? This article investigates the difference in
   railroad technology adoption between late Qing China and,Meiji-era
   japan. Through analysis of historical accounts as well as original
   source documents, we argue that variations in concern for internal and
   external security were important determinants of the distinct adoption
   decisions. The Qing Court's apprehension that technological change would
   lead to domestic social unrest and make China vulnerable to external
   threats deterred it from adopting railroads. hi japan, die Meiji
   leadership faced a less-pronounced internal and external threat
   environment. This allowed diem to focus on the railroads' potential to
   drive economic growth, consolidate administrative rule, and mobilize
   military resources. Our results suggest that perceptions regarding a
   technology's expected effects may contribute more to technology adoption
   decisions than is suggested by the prevailing literature.},

Journal = {GLOBAL POLICY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {8},
Number = {5, SI},
Pages = {36-45},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {The United Nations and other multilateral organizations have always been
   prominent in the health field. UN agencies like the World Health
   Organization (WHO), however, have come increasingly under the influence
   of major individual donors which provide earmarked funding. Since 2000,
   two major vertical funds in the health field - the Global Fund and the
   GAVI Alliance - provide new models of multilateralism and their funding
   patterns, together with those of WHO, are examined in some detail. We
   review the extent to which the two new funds and WHO conform to
   traditional definitions of multilateralism by reference to several test
   areas: degrees of concentration of funding sources; the influence of
   individual funders; sustainability; and transparency. We also draw
   lessons from the analysis for the UN development organizations.
   Policy Implications
   Patterns of funding in international organizations are a principal
   determinant of multilateralism. The earmarking of donor funding in
   international organizations undermines multilateral principles. New
   funding mechanisms in the health field compete with the operational
   roles of UN organisations, but can provide lessons for the UN's
   operational role.},

Abstract = {In this article, we examine some aspects of the fate of Brazilian
   psychoanalysis during the 1964-85 civil-military dictatorship.
   Presenting data from interviews with Brazilian psychoanalysts and
   focusing on the activities of the Brazilian Psychoanalytic Society of
   SAo Paulo, we argue that the external political situation was paralleled
   by conservatism within the Society, with some dangerous consequences. We
   attend especially to tensions between right- and left-wing
   psychoanalysts, denunciations and fear, and the impact of Bion's ideas.
   We conclude by suggesting that the complicity of the Society with the
   governing norms was coincident both with the self-interests and
   attitudes of particular individuals and with normalizing institutional
   tendencies in psychoanalysis itself.},

Abstract = {This article argues that since fulfillment of social rights is dependent
   on the availability of resources we must look beyond the field of
   international human rights, to economics, to provide a stylized way of
   thinking about measuring compliance. Using conditional rights as a
   starting point, this article argues that there are certain normative and
   practical factors that limit social rights, and it is in allowing for
   these factors that gives rise to the maximum resources dilemma: How can
   the content of social rights be determined if it is allowed to differ
   across resource contexts, and how can compliance be measured if the
   content is not determinate? It argues further that the empirical tools
   of microeconomics offer a systematic way to deal with the dilemma and
   outlines a methodological sketch for measuring compliance.},

Abstract = {Prior surveys have sought to gauge American public opinion toward shale
   gas development. Research on environmental hazards has produced
   conflicting findings related to the role of proximity in predicting
   attitudes. This study analyzes how perceived and actual proximity to
   active shale gas development in Pennsylvania, Ohio, and Texas predicts
   individual preferences for moratoria. We implement a conditionally
   parametric probit, which accounts for geographic variation in
   coefficient values. Our results suggest that attitudes toward the
   potential benefits and risks associated with shale gas development play
   a larger and more consistent role in predicting preference for moratoria
   than proximity or other sociodemographic factors. Our methodology allows
   for inferences related to the extent of geographic variation in
   coefficient values. Our results indicate that the role of proximity in
   predicting preference for moratoria differs based on whether a
   respondent resides in an urban or rural area or within a shale play.},

Abstract = {China and other authoritarian states notoriously keep mum about
   disasters. Yet two recent but dissimilar Chinese responses to infectious
   disease epidemics show that authoritarian crisis management can shift
   from secrecy to openness. China maintained prolonged secrecy during 2003
   SARS, yet was open from day one about 2009 H1N1 flu. To explore why,
   this article links crisis information dilemmas to blame avoidance
   concepts from democratic political theories. We argue that greater
   Chinese transparency about infectious disease response reflects
   evolution in blame avoidance, from heavy reliance on information control
   to insulating leaders by using technical experts and agencies as
   lightning rods. In 2003, the Chinese strategy of information containment
   and secrecy backfired, and the Chinese leadership eventually received
   blame at home and internationally for crisis mismanagement. In 2009,
   China put in place public health specialists and institutions as
   responsible for H1N1 information and responses, thereby insulating the
   top-tier leadership.},

Abstract = {In this article, we critically discuss the hypothesis linking
   routine-biased technical change and job polarization. First, we put it
   in the context of earlier debates on the impact of technology on the
   employment structure and job quality, discussing the difficulties of the
   concept of routine used in this new literature and its
   operationalization. Then, using our own operationalization of tasks, we
   argue that routine tasks are not associated with skills in the
   non-linear polarized way predicted by the discussed hypothesis, nor to
   the observed cases of job polarization in Europe in 19952007. Routine
   and cognitive task content are similarly (albeit in reverse) linked to
   the relative expansion of higher-paid occupations recently observed in
   most European economies. This suggests that the occupational effects of
   Routine-and Skill-Biased technical change are similar, and that the
   phenomenon of job polarization observed in some European countries is
   not primarily the result of technological factors.},

Title = {POLITICAL COMPETITION AND THE INITIATION OF INTERNATIONAL CONFLICT A NEW
   PERSPECTIVE ON THE INSTITUTIONAL FOUNDATIONS OF DEMOCRATIC PEACE},
Journal = {WORLD POLITICS},

Volume = {69},
Number = {3},
Pages = {493+},

Abstract = {Although some scholars claim that the empirical evidence for the very
   low instance of interstate war between democracies is well established,
   others have raised new challenges. But even if democratic peace is
   observed, its theoretical explanation remains unresolved. Consensus has
   not emerged among competing approaches, some of which are criticized for
   offering monadic logic for a dyadic phenomenon. This article synthesizes
   recent literature to advance a simple, but distinct, explicitly dyadic
   theory about institutionalized political competition, leading to
   expectations that it is the most important source of democratic peace.
   While the authors are far from the first to consider political
   competition, their approach stands out in according it the central role
   in a dyadic theory focused on the regime type of initiators and target
   states. They argue that potential vulnerability to opposition criticism
   on target-regime-specific normative and costs-of-war bases is more
   fundamental than mechanisms such as audience costs, informational
   effects, or public goods logic. Incumbents in high-competition states
   will be reluctant to initiate conflict with a democracy due to
   anticipated inability to defend the conflict as right, necessary, and
   winnable. The authors present new and highly robust evidence that
   democratic peace is neither spurious nor a methodological artifact, and
   that it can be attributed to high-competition states' aversion to
   initiating fights with democracies.},

Abstract = {The global financial crisis has stimulated much research about the
   resilience of neoliberalism. However, concrete mechanisms of neoliberal
   resilience are yet to be elaborated. This article elaborates such
   mechanisms by incorporating Amable's notion of institutional hierarchy
   into Mahoney and Thelen's gradual institutional change theory. In doing
   this, it provides a dynamic and politically grounded framework to
   analyze institutional resilience. Neoliberalism is maintained over time
   because dominant social blocs defend those policies and institutions
   that they perceive as more favorable to their interests (high-hierarchy
   institutions), while allowing degrees of freedom in those that matter
   less (low-hierarchy institutions). Four mechanisms account for the
   resilience of high-hierarchy institutions: marginal adjustment,
   solidification, accommodation and compromise. I explore the potential of
   this framework by comparing the trajectory of two related policy
   domains, exchange rates and industrial policy, in countries with a long
   history of neoliberal policymaking: Chile and Estonia.},

Abstract = {The aim of this article is to develop a theoretical understanding of the
   insurrection as a central concept in radical politics in order to
   account for contemporary movements and forms of mobilisation that seek
   to withdraw from governing institutions and affirm autonomous practices
   and forms of life. I will develop a theory of insurrection by
   investigating the parallel thinking of Giorgio Agamben and Max Stirner.
   Starting with Stirner's central distinction between revolution and
   insurrection, and linking this with Agamben's theory of destituent
   power, I show how both thinkers develop an ontologically anarchic
   approach to ethics, subjectivity and life that is designed to destitute
   and profane governing institutions and established categories of
   politics. However, I will argue that Stirner's egoistic' and voluntarist
   approach to insurrection provides a more tangible and positive way of
   thinking about political action and agency than Agamben's at times
   vague, albeit suggestive, notion of inoperativity.},

Title = {Exposure to Offshoring and the Politics of Trade Liberalization: Debate
   and Votes on Free Trade Agreements in the US House of Representatives,

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL STUDIES QUARTERLY},

Abstract = {The movement of jobs overseas-known as ``offshoring{''}-is one of the
   most politically charged aspects of globalization in developed
   countries. The high salience of offshoring reflects growth in
   competitive pressures from globalization that directly target
   individuals' jobs. I argue that, in a world of fragmented production,
   how vulnerable one's occupation is to offshoring helps explain patterns
   of protectionist sentiment not otherwise accounted for by existing work.
   I expect that the negative consequences of offshoring for workers will
   be particularly salient. As a result, vulnerability to offshoring is
   likely to generate protectionist sentiment toward free trade among
   constituents. Therefore, legislators whose constituents are vulnerable
   to offshoring should prove more likely to oppose trade liberalization. I
   measure vulnerability to offshoring at the district level using data
   from the US Census. I analyze roll call votes on free trade in the House
   of Representatives between 2001 and 2006. I find that the larger the
   share of their constituents who are vulnerable to offshoring, the more
   likely legislators are to vote against free trade and to discuss the
   costs of trade for workers in floor debates. My results suggest that the
   dynamics of offshoring constitute an overlooked dimension to the
   political economy of trade.},

Abstract = {Research on issue ownership is accelerating and so is its use in studies
   of voting and party behaviour. Yet we do not know how stable issue
   ownership is. Does it describe a solid, persistent association between a
   party and an issue in the eyes of the electorate, or does it describe a
   more fluid and fragile issue reputation of a party among the electorate?
   Theoretical and empirical work suggests both stability and variability
   in issue ownership. To get closer to an answer, this article presents
   and analyses unprecedented comprehensive data on issue ownership. The
   analysis identifies stability rather than change in issue ownership over
   time and similarity more than difference across countries, and therefore
   suggests that issue ownership is a general and long-term rather than a
   local and short-term phenomenon. The implications for how voters
   perceive parties are important.},

Abstract = {Public discourse in Western countries on the 2014 Ebola epidemic
   provided a unique natural opportunity to study the relationship between
   a disease's sociocultural representation and health policy support. Our
   main prediction stated that among Western citizens, support for
   restrictive health policies (e.g., mandatory quarantining) would be
   determined more through preexisting prejudice towards African immigrants
   than fears of Ebola infection. A questionnaire study with time-lagged
   measurement of predictor and criterion variables employing a German
   sample (N=218) that was heterogeneous in terms of gender, age,
   profession, political orientation, and income level provided clear
   support for this assumption. Although variables related to
   fear-of-infection were significant predictors, prejudice-related
   variables explained several times more variance in participants' support
   for restrictive policies. Moreover, the degree to which participants
   adopted prevalent beliefs regarding the sociocultural origins of Ebola
   (e.g., eating bushmeat) further intensified the impact of
   prejudice-related variables.},

Abstract = {Does ethnic inequality breed coups? The recent literature on civil war
   shows both that inequality between ethnic groups induces war and,
   importantly, that civil wars and coups, although fundamentally
   different, are related. The literature on coups d'etat, however, has yet
   to theorize and test the effect of ethnic inequality on coups. The link
   is plausible because many coups are ethnic coups', which depend on the
   capacity of plotters to mobilize their co-ethnics. We argue that large
   income and wealth disparities between ethnic groups accompanied by
   within-group homogeneity increase the salience of ethnicity and solidify
   within-group preferences vis-a-vis the preferences of other ethnic
   groups, increasing the appeal and feasibility of a coup. We use
   group-level data for 32 sub-Saharan African countries and 141 ethnic
   groups between 1960 and 2005 and provide the first large-N test to date
   of the effect of ethnic inequality on coups. Between- and within-group
   inequality measures are constructed based on survey data from the
   Afrobarometer and the Demographic and Health Surveys. We find strong
   support for our hypothesis: between-ethnic-group inequality (BGI)
   increases the likelihood that an ethnic group stages a coup only when
   within-ethnic-group inequality (WGI) is low. Coups remain frequent in
   sub-Saharan Africa and coups are the main threat to democracy in the
   region, by harming democratic consolidation and economic development,
   and by provoking further political instability. Our work provides a
   novel rationale to be concerned about ethnic inequality, showing that
   when ethnic and income cleavages overlap, destabilizing coups d'etat are
   more likely.},

Abstract = {Ecosystem-based management (EBM) represents a comprehensive approach to
   better govern the environment that also illustrates the collaborative
   trend in policy and public administration. The need for stakeholder
   involvement and collaboration is strongly articulated, yet how and for
   what purposes collaboration would be effective remains largely untested.
   We address this gap by developing and evaluating a set of hypotheses
   specifying how certain patterns of collaborations among actors affect
   their joint ability to accomplish EBM. Content analyses of management
   plans drawn from five EBM planning processes in Sweden are combined with
   analyses of the collaborative networks through which these plans have
   been developed. Our results indicate that system thinking and the
   ability to integrate across different management phases are favored by
   collaborations between different kinds of actors, and by project leaders
   being centrally located in the networks. We also find that dense
   substructures of collaboration increase the level of specificity in the
   plans in regards to explicating constraints on human activities. Having
   many collaborative ties does however not enhance the overall level of
   specificity. Our results also show that different network
   characteristics can give rise to similar EBM outcomes. This observed
   equifinality suggests there is no single blueprint for well-performing
   collaborative networks.},

Abstract = {This article develops a critical engagement with the politics of British
   satire. After first engaging the mainstream critique of satirethat it
   promotes cynicism and apathy by portraying politicians in
   stereotypically corrupt termswe develop a performative approach to
   comedy as an everyday vernacular of political life. Beyond a focus on
   impact', we suggest that satire can be read as an everyday form of
   political reflection that performs within a social context. This
   argument yields an image of Morris, Iannucci and Brooker as important
   critics of contemporary British politics, a point which we explore
   through their interventions on media form, political tragedy and
   political agency.},

Abstract = {This article deals with the rise of memorialization standards and
   policyoriented attempts to engage transitional societies to develop and
   adopt specific normative forms of remembrance. The transitional justice
   paradigm brought a tremendous change moving the paradigm from a ``duty
   to remember{''} to policy-oriented ``memorialization standards{''} that
   promote Western memorial models as a template for the representation of
   past tragedies or mass crimes. The article argues that the human rights
   regime mandates normative standards that de-historicize and
   de-contextualize local knowledge key, which not only disables different
   patterns of dealing with a traumatic past but also may strengthen
   societal divisions on the ground.},

Abstract = {In order to identify the causal mechanisms (rational learning,
   adaptation, and innovation) driving changes in the area of anti-poverty
   policy in Brazil, this article traces the micro-level decision-making
   processes across three presidents. It begins by laying out the politics
   of conditional cash transfers (CCTs) in Brazil and presidential usage of
   this targeted social policy instrument since the 1990s. In contrast to
   previous presidents, President Dilma Rousseff's decisions did not enable
   her rationally intended policy agenda. Why? The President him or herself
   is privileged as the central actor whose decision-making processes
   impact policy development and its subsequent performance. I will argue
   that prior to the most recent changes under Dilma, was the demise of
   CCTs being good enough' from a policy perspective. The major challenge
   for any president in Brazil remains low levels of political and societal
   consensus over the kind of social reforms required to end the
   intergenerational transmission of poverty in Brazil; a policy dilemma
   confounded by the absence of a single unifying institutional actor and
   the extent of power diffusion in Brazilian federalism.},

Abstract = {In this article, we examine the recent shift in financial markets toward
   high-frequency trading (HFT). This turn is being legitimized with
   reference to how algorithms are allegedly more rational and efficient
   than human traders, and less prone to emotionally motivated decisions.
   We argue that although HFT does not render humans irrelevant, it is
   leading to a reconfiguration of both the ideal trading subject and the
   human-machine relations. Drawing on interviews with and ethnographic
   observations of high-frequency traders, as well as HFT `how to' books,
   we analyze the subjectivity and self-techniques of the ideal
   high-frequency trader. We demonstrate that these traders face the
   challenge of avoiding emotional interference in their algorithms and
   that they deploy a set of disciplinary self-techniques to curb the
   importance of emotional attachment.},

Abstract = {What explains different levels of clientelism across countries? Why do
   some politicians deliver clientelistic goods to their electoral
   constituencies, and why do some voters demand them? This article focuses
   on the historical origins of trust in states and shows that they have a
   lasting impact on contemporary patterns of patronage. The shift to
   programmatic politics reflects a historical transition from personalized
   trust in politicians to trust in impersonal bureaucracies tasked by
   political parties to implement policy. Past experience with public
   bureaucracy informs the expectations of voters and parties regarding the
   performance of the state and its ability to provide public goods, which
   in turn shape the degree of clientelistic exchange across societies. To
   capture state capacity, the authors focus on the critical juncture
   before the expansion of women's suffrage, and use the ability of public
   bureaucracies to reduce infant mortality in the interwar period as a
   proxy for historical state capacity and as an instrument to predict
   trust. Macrodata from eighty-eight electoral democracies and microdata
   from the most recent wave of the World Value Survey provide supportive
   evidence for the theory.},

Title = {THE RESOURCE CURSE WITHOUT NATURAL RESOURCES: EXPECTATIONS OF RESOURCE
   BOOMS AND THEIR IMPACT},
Journal = {AFRICAN AFFAIRS},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {116},
Number = {463},
Pages = {233-260},

Abstract = {Many resource-rich countries have experienced a range of negative
   economic and political effects from natural resource extraction, often
   lumped together as the `resource curse'. This article investigates to
   what extent expectations of future natural resource booms in Sao Tome e
   Principe and Madagascar led to `resource curse' effects, even though
   these countries did not experience the expected booms. It finds that
   both countries experienced resource curse effects as a result of future
   expectations, including volatile economic growth and eroded governance.
   The article demonstrates that shared aspirations and expectations alone
   may make for material political and economic outcomes even when they
   become visibly divorced from reality. Thus, there is much more to
   resource curse effects than simply the product of the material
   extraction of natural endowments. At a time of extremely volatile prices
   for primary commodities, and the relatively easy availability of
   investment capital and credit to support speculative ventures that in
   turn incentivize resource hype, it is likely that a growing number of
   countries may suffer the malign effects of a resource curse without
   natural resource extraction.},

Abstract = {How and to what extent do states influence the level of democracy and
   autocracy in other states? We argue that states exist internationally in
   dependence networks with each other and that those networks provide
   pathways for influence on a state's domestic institutions. For any given
   state, a dependence network is a set of partner states with whom it
   regularly engages in exchanges of valued goods, where those exchanges
   would be costly to break. We find that an index of three such
   networks-trade, security and shared international organization
   membership-significantly influences the domestic political institutions
   in a given state. These changes are substantively large in the long run,
   similar in size to regional and global levels of democracy. State
   capabilities figure heavily in our network measures, thus emphasizing
   the role of power in the diffusion of domestic political institutions.
   We also find that network-influenced change works both ways: states can
   become more autocratic or more democratic.},

Abstract = {Article presents the attempts of Central banks in Europe to avoid
   comprehensive supervision over the regularity and performance of their
   operations by referring to their independence. Even though the
   effectiveness of operations of central banks in Europe significant
   influences public finance standings and economic situation in general,
   there is no efficient control established over the central banks in
   Europe. National central banks (NCB) in Eurozone are reluctant to
   account to Supreme Audit Institutions (SAT) since they endeavour to
   achieve the legal prohibition of audit of their operations respectively
   they are willing to agree only to significantly limited audit scope of
   (less important) parts of their operations. The final decisions are in
   hands of national parliaments that are - without prejudice to the
   competence of the EU institutions - independent in determining the scope
   of audit by the national SATs over the national central banks.},

Abstract = {The concept of ontological security has made increasing headway within
   International Relations, in particular through its ability to offer
   alternative explanations of the forces underpinning security dilemmas
   and conflict in world politics. While welcoming the insights already
   provided by its application, this article argues that the concept's use
   to date has been too much geared to questions of identity-related
   stability, with change viewed as disturbing and anxiety-inducing. In
   contrast, the article calls for a more open understanding that: (i)
   links ontological security to reflexivity and avoids collapsing together
   the concepts of self, identity and ontological security; (ii) avoids
   privileging securitization over desecuritization as a means for
   generating ontological security; and (iii) opens out the concept beyond
   a narrow concern with questions of conflict and the conduct of violence
   more towards the theorization of positive change.},

Abstract = {Public managers across countries are faced with challenges of attracting
   and retaining high-quality employees in the context of widespread
   financial constraints and increasing inter-sectoral competition. These
   changing circumstances have reinforced the need to enhance public
   employees' affective organizational commitment, which is related to
   important outcomes such as employees' performance and retention.
   However, we know little about the factors that can positively influence
   affective organizational commitment in a cross-national context. This
   study applies a cross-national comparative approach using data from four
   US states (Oregon, Florida, Washington, and Utah) and India to examine
   the factors influencing affective organizational commitment. We focus
   mainly on the effects of job satisfaction, which is considered to be the
   most important antecedent of affective organizational commitment. Our
   findings indicate that, in both countries' contexts, job satisfaction
   has a significant positive impact on affective organizational
   commitment. We also examine the US-India differences in the levels of
   affective organizational commitment. Findings indicate that, compared to
   the four US states of Oregon, Florida, Washington, and Utah, affective
   organizational commitment is significantly higher among Indian public
   managers.},

Abstract = {In this paper, I seek to contribute to the post-Fukushima literature on
   Japan, much of which accepts uncritically the orthodox narrative
   locating Japan's nuclear origins in the politics of the Cold War and in
   the passivity of Japanese civil society vis-a-vis a `strong' state. In
   contrast, I draw upon Gramsci's work in order to locate these origins
   within wider processes of global structural transformation associated
   with the shift from feudalism to capitalism, and the attendant
   imperialism of the nineteenth century. I treat Japan's Meiji Restoration
   as an instance of passive revolution within this context, one outcome of
   which was the adoption of a specific form of state (the ` developmental
   state') and a specific form of nationalism (technonationalism). I
   further argue that the US Occupation of Japan (1945-1952) can be viewed
   as another instance of passive revolution. In both cases, I examine the
   economic, political and social channels through which state goals were
   communicated to the Japanese populace and either embraced or resisted in
   turn. I suggest that Japan's techno-nationalism survived into the
   post-war era, but was stripped of its overt military trappings and
   portrayed instead as a unique combination of `pacifism' and `economic
   developmentalism'. In this way, despite being victims of nuclear
   weapons, ordinary Japanese people were persuaded to embrace nuclear
   power.},

Abstract = {This article proceeds from a conceptual analysis of how ontological (in)
   security is constructed in terms of `security-of-being' in which
   identity dynamics are explicated in socio-psychological terms. Of
   particular interest is how such dynamics transcend the boundaries of
   individual self/other constructions to define communities and states,
   and how these dynamics are transformed in times of trauma and crises.
   Narratives of everyday traumas are especially significant in creating
   notions of gendered space and (in) security, and for securitising
   subjectivities. This article thus investigates a number of theoretical
   propositions and developments involved in recent debates on the
   emotional dimension of ontological (in) security and its relationship to
   states, traumas and the securitisation of subjectivity. A gendered
   perspective of these debates allows us to analyse, and perhaps move
   beyond, some of the problematic aspects of the ontological security
   literature as originally developed by Laing and Giddens, and later on by
   sociologists and international relations scholars. Using the case of
   India as an example, the article shows how narrative reconstructions of
   traumas and collective memory shape gendered space and the search for
   ontological security, and how attempts to govern these events and
   practices impact on notions of gendered space and ontological
   insecurity.},

Abstract = {Patient-centred care' is a term often used in relation to health care
   policy and delivery, and it might be assumed that the patient
   perspective is an integral part of the decisions made by policy makers
   and health care providers. It might also be assumed that processes such
   as health technology assessments have mechanisms embedded in their
   methodology to faithfully capture what it means to live with an illness
   and the potential benefits (and risks) a new technology will bring to
   the people likely to use it. Although there are many good reasons to
   involve patients in decisions - from the personal to the policy level -
   many issues must be resolved before health care truly delivers nothing
   about me without me' to patients.},

Abstract = {In this brief introduction to the special forum on the topic of
   ``Recursive Easts, Shifting Peripheries: Whither Europe's `Easts' and
   `Peripheries'?{''} the author lays out the conceptual framework for the
   forum's contributions. The forum takes as its starting point the
   supposed ``obsolescence{''} of both the notion of Eastern Europe and the
   scholarship dedicated to this topic, which flourished in the immediate
   aftermath of the Cold War's end. The author argues, instead, the
   continued urgency and value in studying the operation of easternisms and
   processes of peripheralization within the European context. In
   particular, the author highlights the recursive nature of easternisms
   and peripheries.},

Abstract = {Policy advisory systems have been central to moving beyond individual
   actor considerations to assessments of the interactive effects of
   multiple interlocking sets of suppliers, in specific jurisdictions, that
   provide policy advice to policymakers. This article argues, while
   useful, the advisory system concept should be revised given that
   previous approaches animated by the location of supply and government
   control over it have been weakened. We argue for a second wave of
   advisory system studies that: (1) reorients the unit of analysis from
   the public service to advisory systems themselves, (2) better
   contextualizes advisory system operation and dynamics based on the
   subsystems within which they operate, and (3) focuses on questions of
   why advisory system components combine in particular policy instances
   and with what effect. Using access and compatibility, we posit a
   typology of policy advisory networks and develop four archetypes of
   policy ideational compatibility.},

Abstract = {Hard times give rise to greater demand for protection. International
   trade rules include provisions that allow for raising barriers to aid
   industries when they suffer economic injury. Yet widespread use of
   flexibility measures may undermine the trade system and worsen economic
   conditions. How do states balance these conflicting pressures? This
   article assesses the effect of crises on cooperation in trade. We
   hypothesize that governments impose less protectionism during economic
   crisis when economic troubles are widespread across countries than when
   they face crisis in isolation. The lesson of Smoot-Hawley and
   coordination through international economic institutions represent
   mechanisms of informal governance that encourage cooperation to avoid a
   spiral of protectionism. Analysis of industry-level data on protection
   measures for the period from 1996 to 2011 provides support for our claim
   that under conditions of shared hard times, states exercise strategic
   self-restraint to avoid beggar-thy-neighbor policies.},

Abstract = {Political misperceptions can distort public debate and undermine
   people's ability to form meaningful opinions. Why do people often hold
   these false or unsupported beliefs, and why is it sometimes so difficult
   to convince them otherwise? We argue that political misperceptions are
   typically rooted in directionally motivated reasoning, which limits the
   effectiveness of corrective information about controversial issues and
   political figures. We discuss factors known to affect the prevalence of
   directionally motivated reasoning and assess strategies for accurately
   measuring misperceptions in surveys. Finally, we address the normative
   implications of misperceptions for democracy and suggest important
   topics for future research.},

Abstract = {The destabilization of Eastern Europe and of the Southern Mediterranean
   has exposed the limits of the European peace project. Obviously, the
   European Neighbourhood Policy has not succeeded in boosting peace and
   prosperity. This article attributes this failure to a combination of
   functionalist hubris and political myopia that emanates from the
   European Union's peculiar constitution as a regulatory power with weak
   political union. While the projection of the European Union's single
   market acquis has set over-ambitious targets, the needs of the partner
   countries and the wider geopolitical implications of the Neighbourhood
   Policy have received little political attention. In sum, the experience
   at the fringes of the European peace project not only unveils the limits
   of the European Union as a foreign policy actor, but it also raises more
   theoretical questions on the notion of liberal peace'.},

Abstract = {The traditional and still dominant approach to authoritarianism measures
   it as a unidimensional construct. However, in the past few years some
   studies have assessed the three hypothesized authoritarianism components
   (i.e., authoritarian submission, authoritarian aggression, and
   conventionalism) separately. The aims of this study are to verify that
   the three-correlated-factor structure fits the data better than the
   one-factor model and to analyze the distinct effects of the three
   dimensions of authoritarianism on values and prejudice. A total of 169
   Italian citizens responded to a questionnaire. As hypothesized, a
   structural equation model shows that the dimension of authoritarian
   submission is mainly related to the openness to change vs. conservation
   values opposition; the dimension of authoritarian aggression is more
   characterized on the self-transcendence vs. self-enhancement values
   opposition; conventionalism is mainly linked to traditional values. As
   concerns prejudice, this variable is predicted just by authoritarian
   aggression. Theoretical implications as concerns the conceptualization
   of authoritarianism are discussed.},

   Maoist combatants},

Abstract = {This article analyzes combatants' accounts of their engagement with the
   Communist Party of Nepal, MaoistCPN (M). We use Self-Categorization
   Theory (SCT) as a framework and thematic analysis as a method to examine
   how social relationships and contextual factors contributed to political
   party identification during the ten-year-long Maoist insurgency in
   Nepal. Based on the study of autobiographical narratives written by
   Nepali Maoist combatants, we demonstrate that a) key social and
   political experiences cumulatively evoked feeling positively inclined to
   partisan attachment; b) CPN (M) party ideology, which was presented as a
   cure-all to socio-political difficulties, actuated the predisposed
   people's partisan alignment; c) families were largely unsupportive of
   their members' intention to take part in the war; and when they
   participated, the family responded with antagonism; and d) party
   ideologues of the CPN (M), who met the partisan-leaning individuals as
   close friends, accelerated and sustained their friends' motivation to
   become involved in the armed conflict. Together the findings culminate
   in a view that engagement with CPN (M) during the insurgency occurred
   despite resistance from family and increased exponentially because of
   societal and political experiences, the strong appeal of party ideology,
   and social network dynamics.},

Abstract = {The political mobilization of American business elites in the 1970s and
   1980s has been well studied by political scientists. Environmental
   sociologists have explored how industries in this elite countermovement
   have organized to prevent environmental legislation. The literature
   often focuses on the efforts of this movement to shape public opinion on
   climate change. However, political scientists argue business elites are
   running several parallel strategies simultaneously in order to protect
   their interests. FEC data are utilized in multilevel logit models to
   examine how donations from industrial Political Action Committees (PACs)
   relate to Congressional representative's environmental voting behavior
   over a 20-year period. Industries associated with the environmental
   countermovement have increasingly used PAC donations over time, and
   every additional \$10,000 a representative received from countermovement
   industries significantly decreased odds of their taking the
   pro-environmental stance even when controlling for representatives'
   demographics, districts, Congressional polarization and time-period.},

Abstract = {The issue of political party financing is probably one of the most
   discussed political issue among political parties in Ghana. Over the
   years, weaknesses and poor performance of political parties has been
   largely blamed on the inadequate funding of political parties. The
   chapter seeks to increase awareness and promote informed national
   discourse on the issue of political party financing in Ghana. The study
   was as a result a critical review of literature pertaining to the
   political party financing across the world. The review was also spiced
   with expert consultations and interviews on political party financing in
   Ghana. The study revealed that to date, political parties in Ghana have
   resorted to four principal sources funding their operations. Major
   political parties in Ghana are funded privately either through donations
   made by institutions, kickbacks and corruption, fund-raising or
   membership dues, and nomination fees paid by aspirants of executive
   positions in political parties as well as parliamentary and presidential
   aspirants during party primaries and congress. The lack of state funding
   of political parties accounts for the lack of political party dynamism
   and encourages the abuse of incumbency, political support and corruption
   that, in turn, undermine political party competitiveness, thereby
   undermining the entire system of multiparty democracy in Ghana. The
   paper recommends for the establishment of a number of schemes to support
   political parties in Ghana including a regulated fund, common fund and
   matching funds for political parties.},

Abstract = {The British exit from the European Union puts Sweden in a difficult
   position. The UK has been a close partner and has offered protection in
   areas where Sweden's interests have been challenged. This article looks
   at Sweden's relation to the EU and examines Swedish-British cooperation
   and the effects that Sweden can expect following Brexit. The Swedish
   Brexit-debate is scrutinized as are the choices that are now facing the
   country in a shifting strategic environment. It is suggested that the
   political cost of taking on the UK's role as a sceptic in the area of EU
   security and defense policy or as a watchdog in relation to the Eurozone
   will be difficult for Sweden to bear. Consequently, Sweden could come
   out as a more loyal EU member and might with time also find its own role
   within the European integration project.},

Abstract = {There is a tremendous amount of variation in conflict intensity both
   across and within civil conflicts. Some conflicts result in huge numbers
   of battle deaths, while others do not. Conflict intensity is also
   dynamic. Conflict intensity escalates, de-escalates, and persists. What
   explains this variation? We take one of the most prominent explanations
   for the onset and occurrence of civil conflict-variation in economic
   conditions- and apply it to the intensity and dynamics of civil
   conflict. Using an instrumental variables strategy and a rich set of
   empirical models, we find that the intensity of conflict is negatively
   related to per capita income. We also find that economic conditions
   affect conflict dynamics, as poorer countries are likely to experience
   longer and more intense spells of fighting after the onset of conflict.},

Pages = {453-467},
Abstract = {With no formal division between majority and opposition in the
   parliamentary arena, the European Union (EU) calls for an approach to
   political opposition which considers the role of civil society. This
   article explores the case of opposition to the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade
   Agreement (ACTA) within and without the European Parliament (EP) through
   a political opportunity approach, using the case to reflect on
   conditions for effective opposition in the EU. The ACTA campaign saw
   opposed actors within the EP and digital rights groups work together to
   build coalitions against the agreement. Protests then opened the way for
   these groups to broker a change of position among other actors, allowing
   a majority rejection. The ACTA case suggests the need for advocacy by
   organised groups both within and without the Parliament to construct
   majorities. Comparisons to similarly successful campaigns bolster this
   view, as do examples of less effective opposition.},

Abstract = {The primary objective of this chapter is to analyze the support of
   social media for social movements within the context of the
   anti-consumption movement. Social media have proved to be strategic for
   initiating, organizing and communicating social movements. The
   anti-consumption movement is a trend of the postmodernism era that has
   not yet reached a large following. A secondary aim of this chapter is to
   analyze the similarities and differences in the support of social media
   for the anti-consumption movement between one developed and one emerging
   market. To achieve this goal, a content analysis was employed to analyze
   Facebook accounts of anti-consumption online communities in the USA and
   Turkey. The findings show that social media can be the right medium to
   increase coverage of social movements in society. Additionally, the
   online institutionalization and decentralized organization of the online
   community as well as stable social media sharing help support
   non-radical social movements like anti-consumption.},

Abstract = {Labour market policies are multi-dimensional: their design depends on
   factors such as generosity, coverage, the combination of active and
   passive elements, and overall cost. Political conflict on one dimension
   often hides agreement on others, and social groups possibly care about
   different aspects of policies. However, most empirical studies treat
   policy preferences as unidimensional. This article utilizes a novel
   experimental conjoint design to assess how five dimensions affect
   support for labour market policies in Spain. It also assesses if
   individuals' self-interest and ideology affect the importance of each
   dimension for support for a policy. We find that individuals' support
   depends mostly on the generosity of policies for the most destitute and
   on funding. We also find that ideology shapes which dimensions of policy
   citizens care most about, but economic self-interest does not.
   Importantly, our experimental design can be applied to study preferences
   for different social policies.},

   Africa},

Abstract = {Why do states make claims to some border areas and not others? We
   articulate three models of territorial claims and test them using a
   novel geospatial data set that precisely maps disputed and undisputed
   border segments in post-independence Africa. The geospatial approach
   helps eliminate problems of aggregation by permitting an analysis of
   variation both within and between dyadic borders. We find that ethnic
   political considerations are the most important driver of territorial
   claims in Africa, while institutional features of the border play a
   secondary role. Border segments that partition ethnic groups are at
   greatest risk of being challenged when the partitioned groups are
   politically powerful in ethnically homogeneous societies. Border
   segments that follow well-established and clear focal principles such as
   rivers and watersheds are significantly less likely to be disputed,
   while changes to the border in the colonial period created opportunities
   for later disputes to arise. Power considerations or resources play only
   a minor role in explaining the location of territorial claims.},

Abstract = {The Transition movement has experienced remarkable growth in its first
   decade, yet there remains considerable doubt about its ability to appeal
   to a diverse audience. To date, few studies have explicitly examined
   diversity of participation in the movement. Addressing this gap in the
   literature, a case study is presented of Transition Town Tooting (TTT).
   Results from a mixed methods approach comprising semi-structured
   interviews, participant observation, and a quantitative survey indicate
   that the demographic profiles of TTT participants do not represent the
   diversity of the Tooting population. This disparity is exacerbated by
   TTT's `passive' approach to inclusivity within the core group.
   Reflecting upon the implications for Transition's goal of local
   resilience, it is suggested that, particularly within dense urban
   communities, initiatives may have more potential for engaging diverse
   voices through a local `brokering' role between various subcommunities.},

Journal = {PEACEBUILDING},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {5},
Number = {1, SI},
Pages = {1-6},
Abstract = {More than twenty years after the signing of the Dayton Peace Accords,
   Bosnia and Herzegovina remains a prominent case for peacebuilding in
   other divided societies. Scholars and policy-makers alike refer to the
   diverse lessons learned from the Bosnian case. For some, Bosnia's
   political arrangement offers a cautionary example of how ethnic
   differences can become entrenched once they are institutionalised. For
   others, the top-down nature of peacebuilding strategies has resulted in
   a peace process that is disconnected from the lives of ordinary Bosnian
   citizens. The special issue offers a critical, multilevel approach to
   local, regional and international aspects of peacebuilding that provides
   a rather sobering picture of the limits and potential for further
   peacebuilding in Bosnia and Herzegovina. As such, in addition to several
   important insights about the role of elites, political arrangements and
   strategies of transitional justice, the articles in this issue highlight
   the need for further scholarly inclusions of ordinary Bosnians and their
   experiences in building peace. At the same time, several of the articles
   also go beyond the Bosnian and Western Balkan context to highlight how
   dominant liberal peacebuilding approaches have led to similar outcomes
   in diverse contexts. In other words, the issue interweaves several
   strands of research to bring forward a rich discussion of Dayton's
   legacy that examines its impact on local and regional levels but also
   situates it within a broader global peacebuilding approach.},

Title = {Party preferences and institutional transformation: revisiting France's
   relationship with NATO (and the common wisdom on Gaullism)},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF STRATEGIC STUDIES},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {40},
Number = {4, SI},
Pages = {505-531},
Abstract = {France's so-called exceptionalism in multilateral security policy is
   often explained with its Gaullist political culture. However, a closer
   look shows that Gaullism cannot easily capture different French
   policies, particularly toward NATO. To unearth what can explain policy
   variance, this paper asks the question of whether French political
   parties value NATO differently and, if so, to what effect? Looking at
   French governments from 1991 to 2014, I argue that political parties in
   France carry different values, which lead them to interpret NATO's role
   for France's security policy differently. As a result, French parties in
   power encouraged, delayed, or halted NATO institutional transformation
   at specific junctures. This argument builds on the insights of the study
   of ideational factors in IR and the study of party politics in
   Comparative Politics. Through an analysis of French governments' policy
   preferences toward NATO, this paper stresses that institutional
   transformation can be understood through the study of veto points in
   conjunction with national preference formation.},

Journal = {ETHNOPOLITICS},

Number = {4},

Abstract = {Present-day Flanders is characterized by the contrast between the
   impressive electoral successes of the pro-independence Nieuw-Vlaamse
   Alliantie (N-VA), and the very lukewarm attitude of its population
   towards independence. This success should be seen as one of the
   consequences of the regionalization of political identities in Belgium
   and the promotion of a Flemish identity by the Flemish regional
   government. Rather than a vote for independence, however, support for
   the N-VA corresponds with a rejection of interregional solidarity and
   more in general a preference for a more right-wing style of governance
   based on the principles of self-help and responsibility.},

Abstract = {This essay argues that the research on ethnic conflict has for too long
   suffered from significant disciplinary divides among sociologists,
   historians, political scientists, anthropologists, geologists, and
   economists-these divides bring attention to underemphasized factors, but
   can also foster inattention to the influence of factors that fall
   outside of the specific purview of one's field. Even within political
   science, there is a divide between comparativists' focus on state-level
   factors and international relations scholars' work on transnational
   dimensions. The past two decades have seen important cross-fertilization
   due to numerous projects that seek to bridge methodological and
   disciplinary boundaries that hamper fuller understanding of the causes
   and solutions of ethnic conflict. Unfortunately, there remains a strong
   statist bias in the field, which is, however, being challenged by a
   newer generation of scholars who are focusing on conflict processes
   above, below, and beyond the state.},

Abstract = {By drawing on the literature about security regimes, this article posits
   the idea that a particular type of regime, which can be termed a ``tacit
   security regime{''} (TSR), has begun to emerge between Israel, on the
   one hand, and several Gulf Arab states, on the other. It is a regime
   which, unlike liberal institutional variants that attempt to privilege
   the promotion of collective norms, remains configured around perceptions
   of threats to be countered and strategic interests to be realized. By
   examining the development, scope, and scale of this nascent TSR, this
   article explores the extent to which Israel, mindful of Washington, DC's
   regional retrenchment, sees the emergence of such a regime as redefining
   the political and strategic contours of Israel's relations with much of
   the Middle East.},

Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL POLITICS},

Volume = {26},
Number = {5},
Pages = {825-846},
Abstract = {Why do some states and state coalitions, acting within the United
   Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), support harder
   legalization of the global climate regime? In order to explain why, the
   effects of four causal factors are considered: climate vulnerability,
   the emission intensity of the national economy, a state's power
   position, and socialization into climate norms. To identify the
   legalization positions of UNFCCC actors, an original content analysis is
   conducted of all the submission and meeting statements made at the Ad
   Hoc Working Group on the Durban Platform during the years 2012-2015.
   Subsequently, a qualitative comparative analysis is carried out to find
   out which combinations of the causal factors offer a sufficient
   explanation for the analyzed outcome, leading to the identification of
   two causal pathways that lead states to endorse harder legalization of
   the climate regime.},

Abstract = {Twenty years after the end of the inter-ethnic war in Bosnia and
   Herzegovina, it appears the Dayton Peace Agreement has been successful
   in ensuring peace and stability in the country. However, while violence
   has not recurred since 1995, the track record of the Dayton agreement in
   discouraging secession threats and enabling a relatively sustainable
   decision-making political process has been less successful. Reflecting
   on how the peace and post-conflict institutions were negotiated in
   Macedonia in 2001, this paper examines if any lessons learned from
   Bosnia and Herzegovina were applied in the Macedonian case. It argues
   that both external and domestic political actors sought to avoid some of
   the key negative outcomes from the Bosnian case, opting for a
   centralised instead of federal territorial structure and a much more
   flexible power-sharing deal. Still, important limitations remain to the
   lessons learned from the Bosnian case and their wider applicability to
   contemporary conflicts.},

Abstract = {This article presents recommendations for practitioners of
   community-based counterterrorism policing. The recommendations are
   located and explained within two broad propositions: recognize the
   implications and limitations of policing by consent, and respect the
   legitimate religious beliefs of all communities. Highlighting tensions
   between high and low policing and between policing and government
   imperatives, the article helps illustrate how different aspects of
   counterterrorism policy and practice may sometimes be at odds with one
   another. The recommendations are aimed at recognizing and, where
   practicable, reconciling such tensions. They arise from the authors'
   engagement with the issues in London and are understood to have
   application in other towns and cities in the United Kingdom and the
   West, particularly in communities and neighborhoods where Muslim
   citizens are the principal recipients of this form of policing.},

Abstract = {This article explores how public policies regarding domestic violence
   aim at assembling a fragmented domain of views, attitudes and practices
   in a coherent manner. We propose to approach policy from an
   object-oriented anthropology, which makes it necessary to understand how
   objects come into being and to explore their ontology. We argue that
   policy objects, such as domestic violence, become real and multiply in
   practice when they associate in an assemblage: their ontology is
   relational. This implies an emphasis on motion, non-coherence and
   multiplicity in the study of how policy objects are enacted. We
   illustrate this approach by sharing a narrative of the development of a
   policy instrument, the reporting code on domestic violence and child
   abuse in Rotterdam (the Netherlands). The case study is focused on the
   interaction between the reporting code and its normative inscription,
   which is contested by a number of professionals. In order to demonstrate
   that policy instruments aim at constructing a new social order, we draw
   special attention to various modes of syncretism that are applied to
   create coherence.},

Abstract = {While several countries still struggle to return to sustainable growth
   and Euroscepticism has shown growing strength ever since the 2014
   European Elections, Europe is slowly advancing on the path of fiscal
   integration. This paper reassesses how legitimacy is provided and why
   the advancing economic and fiscal integration constitutes a genetic
   change' of the Union. The second section discusses the functional
   deadlock emerging from the interaction between demos democracy and
   redistribution, which invites the EMU to make a fundamental choice
   between convergence of the identities' and `convergence of the
   economies'.},

Abstract = {Studies have begun to look at the potentially crucial impacts of group
   decentralization and inter-group global networking in accounting for the
   extent and severity of violence in insurgencies and terrorism. Groups
   may be able to survive more effectively, evade anti-terror or
   counter-insurgency strategies, and inflict greater damage or more
   civilian attacks by operating under more or less centralized leadership,
   or by making use of the resources of other like-minded groups scattered
   across borders. While some analysts have examined each of these
   possibilities, few if any have done so simultaneously with both
   structural and networking indicators or examined the joint effects of
   these indicators. We propose to do so in this study by combining
   existing datasets on terrorist structure and networks. Hypotheses and
   findings in prior studies have indicated that structural
   decentralization may lead to more civilian attacks if not more
   destruction since local cells are freer to act on their own, and that
   group size and centrality in the global terror networks lead to greater
   lethality and group survival rates. We re-examine such assumptions here
   with OLS and logit models combining these effects, and find that in
   addition to group size, network reach (eigenvalue centrality) rather
   than group interconnections per se (number of allies) appears to have
   primary impacts on group lethality, targeting, and survival, sometimes
   in conjunction with decentralized organizational structure.},

Abstract = {Over the past decades, a pattern has emerged across the Islamic world of
   secular actors struggling to build sustainable social movements while
   Islamists show a higher success rate in doing soa dynamic often
   accompanied by high levels of violence and little space for dialogue
   between actors from across the political spectrum. In this article, we
   illustrate the utility of social movement theory (SMT) in explaining the
   ability of some movements to mobilize en masse, while others become
   marginalized. Furthermore, we suggest that SMT is useful in
   understanding the processes that produce socio-political dynamics
   conducive to violent rather than non-violent tactics. Through a case
   study of Bangladesh, where in 2013 the secular Shahbag mobilization was
   derailed by a massive Islamist counter-mobilization, this article shows
   how movements not only capitalize on, but actually contribute to, shifts
   in cultural discourse through political maneuvering and long-term
   socialization. By anchoring their ideology in pre-existing
   religio-cultural imagery, Islamists have been successful in casting
   themselves as authentic defenders of Islam and their secular opponents
   as atheists. In such a socio-political context, the space for dialogue
   among the various political actors is severely limited and the impetus
   to employ violent tactics strong.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF CHINESE GOVERNANCE},

Abstract = {After nearly four decades of rapid economic development, China has
   positioned itself as the second largest economy in the world. On the
   downside, the country is now facing a veritable environmental challenge,
   which particularly manifests in a pervasive degradation of China's
   environment and a deterioration of its citizens' health. This special
   issue of the Journal of Chinese Governance investigates the patterns of
   governance, which have emerged in response to China's environmental
   challenges. The analytical focus is set on the interactive dynamic
   between state and non-state actors in the light of deteriorating natural
   resources and environments. Based on a conference about China's climate
   and environmental challenges, this edition has selected a set of
   articles that highlight the various governance modes resulting from
   state and non-state actor interactions. Herein, the central questions
   focus on how both sides interact with each other, and whether the
   resulting dynamic is one of conflict or cooperation. The aim of this
   special issue is to contribute to the broader discussion on how both
   state and non-state actors shape the modes of environmental governance
   in China. It concludes by discussing China's experience in environmental
   governance, the advantages as well as shortcomings and the possibilities
   for replication.},

Abstract = {The importance of understanding how terrorist organizations learn and

   literature systematically addressing this subject. This article
   contributes to an evolving conceptualization in this area by proposing a
   preliminary typology of learning and innovation as undertaken by modern
   jihadist groups. It identifies and discusses four categories: (a)
   intergroup learning within a single domestic setting; (b) intergroup
   learning between two or more local groups across a state or national
   boundary; (c) intergroup learning between a transnational group and one
   or more domestic groups; and finally (d) intragroup learning or
   self-learning.},

Title = {Moving beyond legal compliance: innovative approaches to EU multilevel
   implementation},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF EUROPEAN PUBLIC POLICY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {24},
Number = {9},
Pages = {1253-1268},
Abstract = {Research on implementation in the European Union (EU) is characterized
   by a strong focus on legal conformance with EU policy. However, this
   focus has been criticized for insufficiently accounting for the
   implications of the EU's multilevel governance structure, thus providing
   an incomplete picture of EU implementation, its diversity and practice.
   The contributions of this collection represent a shift towards a more
   performance-oriented perspective on EU implementation as
   problem-solving. They approach implementation fundamentally as a process
   of interpretation of superordinate law by actors who are embedded within
   multiple contexts arising from the coexistence of dynamics of
   Europeanization, on the one hand, and what has been termed
   domestication', on the other. Moving beyond legal compliance, the
   contributions provide new evidence on the diversity of domestic
   responses to EU policy, the roles and motivations of actors implementing
   EU policy, and the black box' of EU law in action and its enforcement.},

Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL POLITICS},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {26},
Number = {2},
Pages = {343-360},
Abstract = {The concept of environmental citizenship is employed as an analytical
   tool to determine what kind of climate citizenship(s) the
   citizen-directed material in the European Commission's climate change
   campaign is constructing. The research material is read, analysed and
   interpreted through elements attached to environmental citizenship: the
   realm of activity, political space, depth of activity, level of
   activity, citizen virtues, citizen rights and responsibilities and
   conception of the environment. The results suggest that climate
   citizenship is considered mainly as a private sphere activity performed
   by individuals and consists mainly in small adjustments in daily life.
   Climate citizens are motivated to everyday-life mitigation by personal
   benefit, greenhouse gas emissions and preserving natural resources.},

Abstract = {While the South American Defense Council has been analyzed as a security
   community, we argue that it is best described as an early stage
   community of practice, since it has successfully set in motion a regular
   interaction dynamic between numerous defense actors, as we demonstrate
   with concrete examples. We further discuss political support as a
   prerequisite for regional defense identity.},

Abstract = {The Amhara National Regional State (ANRS), with a total area of
   approximately 170,052 km(2), is situated in the north western and north
   central part of Ethiopia. The forest resource of the Amhara Region that
   may qualify as `forests' following the definition of FAO (2001) is
   estimated to be around 6\% of the total area of the region, which
   includes high forest (0.48\% of the total area); woodlands (4.2\%);
   bamboo and plantation forests (1.23\%). These vegetation types further
   can be classified as: Afroalpine and subafroalpine, Montane dry forest
   and scrub, Combretum-Terminalia woodland, Acacia-Comiphora woodland,
   High and Lowland bamboo, and Plantations. The overall forest resources
   of the region have shown slight increase in area coverage for the last
   15 years. The major plus comes from Eucalyptus plantation and
   rehabilitation efforts in Eastern and recently in Western highlands of
   Amhara. On the other hand, the Afroalpine and Subafroalpine vegetation,
   the high Dry afromontane forests, Bamboo forests and the Woodlands faced
   remarkable shrink not only in area coverage but also degradation in
   their structural and species composition.},

Abstract = {A key organizational challenge for all modern militaries is instituting
   an effective command-and-control (C2) structure for joint operations.
   China has been a relative latecomer to joint operations, with a
   persistent weakness in joint C2. Reforms launched in early 2016 sought
   to overcome this challenge by establishing a permanent two-level joint
   C2 structure. Although not a tipping point' that will lead ineluctably
   to stronger operational effectiveness, this reform is nonetheless an
   important milestone in an evolutionary process towards better PLA joint
   operations. The result could be added operational challenges for several
   of China's neighbors and the United States.},

Title = {Institutional entrepreneurship and organisational learning: financial
   stability policy design in Turkey},
Journal = {POLICY AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {36},
Number = {4},
Pages = {539-555},
Abstract = {In the aftermath of the Global Financial Crisis (GFC), financial
   stability' emerged as one of the key pillars of economic policy-making
   and as a new mandate for central banks. In spite of the acceptance and
   prominence of financial stability goal, we know very little about the
   mechanisms of institutional change and the role of institutional
   entrepreneurship in particular, to pursue financial stability objective
   in national contexts. This study investigates the active financial
   stability pursuit of the Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey (CBRT)
   following the GFC and argues that institutional entrepreneurship of CBRT
   as an organisation and the governor of CBRT as an individual paved the
   way for active financial stability pursuit and resulting institutional
   and policy changes in Turkey by accomplishing organisational learning'
   at the CBRT. Governor of CBRT also played a key role as an institutional
   entrepreneur by gaining Turkish Treasury's political support in design
   of unconventional monetary policy measures for financial stability
   objective. Utilising institutional theory, organisation theory, and
   public policy literature, this study offers an interdisciplinary, agency
   based and process-oriented analysis to the study of the political
   economy of central banking in the aftermath of GFC and sheds light on
   the questions of why and how central banks take specific policy
   decisions from a micro-level analysis.},

Abstract = {The use of policy experiments or innovations, especially at the local
   level, since the opening and reform in China is well documented. Less
   understood is why and how these innovations are developed. This paper
   further enriches our existing understanding by bringing to light an
   institutional element that has been relatively under-studied: the role
   of mission-driven local government agency. Informed by detailed on-site
   ethnography and process-tracing, I use meso-level and micro-level
   analyses of Baoding (Hebei) to illustrate how such an organization
   ushered in unique changes to local governance to facilitate two
   prolonged instances of policy innovation since the early 2000s: clean
   energy industry cluster and low-carbon city. Building on the insights
   from the literatures on communities of practice and experimentalist
   governance, I argue that the ways in which the local agency engendered
   and sustained the innovations can best be described as ``collective{''}
   experimentalist governance. The analyses suggest that local innovations
   in China cannot always be understood as an epiphenomenon of
   centrally-coordinated policy experimentation, cross-regional competition
   or learning, or local leadership that previous studies have frequently
   emphasized. The findings contribute to recent scholarship that has
   revealed varieties of local governance in contemporary China.},

Abstract = {Combining the literature on sovereignty and Europeanisation, this
   article investigates the engagement and impact of the European Union
   (EU) on contested states (states lacking recognition) through a
   comparative study of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus (TRNC) and
   Palestine. We find that characteristics of contested statehood mediate
   EU engagement and impact: the lack of international recognition limits
   EU's engagement but encourages development promotion, international
   integration and assistance of local civil society. Lack of territorial
   control limits engagement, but ineffective government offers
   opportunities for development promotion and state-building. As such, and
   in addition to offering a rich empirical account of two prominent
   contested states, the article contributes to the discussion of
   international engagement by developing an innovative conceptual
   framework for understanding EU's impact on contested statesa topic
   neglected within a literature dominated by conventional statehood or
   conflict resolution themes but very important given extensive
   international engagement in contested statesand related conflicts.},

Abstract = {The abolition of slavery in 1888 failed to eliminate the repressive and
   compulsory use of labor in Brazil. When pressure to reduce slave
   trafficking made African labor scarce, coffee producers in SAo Paulo
   recruited European migrants to replace it. Through indebtedness and
   compulsory work, migrants became captive to the landowners who hired
   them. As the occupation of the Amazon frontier became state policy in
   the 1960s, debt bondage was used against the thousands of migrant
   workers hired to clear the areas for agribusiness projects. Slavery had
   been prohibited since 1940, and in 1965 the Congress entered into two
   international agreements on slavery that included debt bondage. With the
   end of the military government in 1985, the category slave labor was
   incorporated into the regulatory framework for employment practices, and
   since then it has been broadened to include labor forced by violence,
   debt bondage, exhausting labor, and degrading working conditions.
   Tensions around the definition remain, however, and prosecutions under
   the law and guilty verdicts have so far been few.},

Journal = {GLOBAL POLICY},

Abstract = {There is a new role for global climate policy and the Intergovernmental
   Panelon Climate Change (IPCC) to support national implementation. For
   keeping within global ecological limits, public debate has shifted from
   concerns about the reliability of model-based climate projections to
   national legislators considering questions of when, where, and how to
   modify longer term trends. However, modeling remains the essential
   scientific tool by which the climate problem is defined assuming that
   society and the economy can be transformed, actually re-engineered, with
   relative ease. Inputs from the IPCC to the new governance process, the
   global stocktake', suggesting solutions will now influence deliberations
   between stakeholders, national actions and global cooperation. How best
   to shape a different science architecture and agenda linking science
   with both policy and society requires, for example, giving as much
   importance to reports of multilateral bodies and business consultancies
   as to peer-reviewed literature. This paper lays out some ideas how
   legitimacy can be maintained even as the IPCC recommends policy options
   and not just advice that is policy relevant.},

Abstract = {This article discusses the role of child protection and residential care
   institutions in mediating the tension between women's productive and
   reproductive responsibilities in early state socialist Hungary. At a
   time when increasing numbers of women entered paid work in the framework
   of catch-up industrialization but the socialization of care work was
   inadequate, these institutions substituted for missing public child care
   services. Relying on not only policy documents but more than six hundred
   children's case files, including Romani children's files, from three
   different locations in Hungary as well as interviews with former
   children's home residents and personnel, the article examines the
   regulatory framework in which child protection institutions and
   caseworkers operated. It points to the differentiated forms of pressure
   these institutions exercised on Romani and non-Romani mothers to enter
   paid work between the late 1940s and the early 1950s from the
   intersectional perspective of gender and ethnicity. Showing that
   prejudice against Gypsies as work-shy persisted in child protection work
   across the systemic divide of the late 1940s, the article contributes to
   scholarship on state socialism and Stalinism that emphasizes the role of
   historical continuities. At the same time, reflecting on parental
   invention in using child protection as a form of child care, the article
   also complicates a simplistic social control approach to residential
   care institutions in Stalinist Hungary.},

Abstract = {Many see responsiveness towards the majority as sufficient for democracy
   because no other policy position receives more support. By contrast, I
   argue that the primacy of the majority is normatively and empirically
   problematic. From a normative point of view a `good' democracy not only
   needs to maximise the influence of the majority but must also protect
   minorities against oppression by the majority population. These two
   goals are difficult to reconcile when majorities and minorities have
   different policy preferences. From an empirical point of view, a lack of
   policy responsiveness towards minorities has real empirical consequences
   as it may endanger the legitimacy and stability of a democracy by
   decreasing the political support of minority groups. The empirical
   analyses with 28 minority groups confirm the risks of a lack of policy
   responsiveness: minorities exhibit less political support than
   majorities, partly because responsiveness towards them is lower.},

Abstract = {A growing body of policy feedback work demonstrates that citizens'
   experiences with public policy influence the way they participate in
   politics. Most of this work takes place in advanced industrial
   democracies, but the nuances of policy design influencing participation
   in advanced democracies are often irrelevant for those in low-capacity
   democracies. This study extends the policy feedback framework to address
   how policies might feed back differently in low-capacity countries with
   uneven basic service delivery. In low-capacity democracies, the most
   salient distinction is between those who have access to basic
   state-provided services and those who do not. Using original data
   collected in Zambia, it demonstrates that those who have even marginal
   access to state services have higher levels of political engagement and
   political participation than those without access, indicating that
   imperfect extension of services may help boost democratic citizenship in
   developing countries.},

Abstract = {The aim of this article is to assess the effectiveness of the fiscal
   equalization mechanism for municipalities in Poland. The article reviews
   the following hypothesis: The fiscal equalisation mechanism for
   municipalities applied in Poland consists of three parts of the general
   subsidy. It does decrease the discrepancies between municipalities with
   respect to their incomes per capita, but the efficiency of the
   particular transfers varies. The income differences among municipalities
   have been studied with the use of the minimum and the maximum to average
   ratio and the variation coefficient. The most effective transfer is the
   equalising part of the general subsidy. Instruments of horizontal
   equalisation have a limited impact on reducing the discrepancies between
   the revenues of municipalities. These discrepancies may be smoothed by
   redistribution transfers.},

   parliamentary debates on whether and why to increase VAT rates. A
   qualitative comparison reveals that there are remarkable differences
   between the two countries. In Germany, there is a clear and consistent
   shift in the efficiency frame from macroeconomic condemnation to
   microeconomic appraisal even among left politicians. This is not visible
   in British debates, where traditional partisan contestation prevails.
   The difference in efficiency frames is closely related to unemployment
   becoming a much more salient issue in Germany than in the UK. The
   quantitative analysis shows that speakers are indeed more likely to
   mention the efficiency frame when they are concerned about the labour
   market.},

Abstract = {This article studies the gendered role of personal characteristics,
   perceptual variables and country-level culture linked to the choice of
   sector of activity by early-stage entrepreneurs, who are starting their
   own business and are thus the most likely to be making a conscientious
   and deliberate choice regarding the sector of activity in which they
   want to operate. The sectors of activity are classified into three
   groups according to the routine nature of the tasks they involve (high,
   medium and low). Total Early-stage Entrepreneurial Activity data from
   the Global Entrepreneurship Monitor dataset is used, comprising 30
   Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and 46
   non-OECD countries in 2005-2010. The results show how each factor
   considered influences the sector type choice, thus evidencing that
   entrepreneurship is an activity embedded in society. Finally, the
   article provides a framework under which to reconcile the experience of
   OECD and non-OECD countries and the diverse findings of previous
   entrepreneurship research.},

   Model Triggered by Newcomer Learning},

Abstract = {The current article proposes a dual-process model to explain how
   newcomer learning, an outcome of the early socialization experiences of
   new public employees, leads to organizational commitment in public
   organizations. Specifically, we argue that newcomer learning triggers
   two distinct psychological mechanisms: an affective pathway, leading to
   job satisfaction and ultimately to affective commitment, and a cognitive
   pathway, leading to psychological contract fulfillment and normative
   commitment. We conducted a two-wave survey with 728 newcomers in the
   Brazilian Internal Revenue Service to test this dual-pathway model. Our
   findings support the hypothesis that these affective and cognitive
   pathways constitute independent channels in mediating the impact of
   newcomer learning on public servants' organizational commitment.
   Moreover, we observe that the affective component of commitment is
   triggered by job satisfaction, whereas the normative component is more
   closely linked with psychological contract fulfillment. Our findings
   highlight the importance of providing newcomers with the knowledge about
   organizational values, formal procedures and informal norms and skills
   to perform their roles during the early socialization period to
   strengthen their commitment to public organizations and ultimately to
   the public interest.},

Abstract = {Why do African regimes repress certain contentious challenges but not
   others? We argue that in addition to opposition claims and tactics,
   African regimes are especially likely to view challenges expressing
   ethnic and/or religious claims as threatening. However, in theorizing
   the decision to use repression, we relax the assumption that the state
   is a unitary actor. Leaders with a history of factionalism in their
   security forces face a delegation problem: orders to repress may not be
   followed or could even cause intraregime violence and/or defections. For
   this reason, states with divided security forces are less likely to
   enact repression. This potential for fracturing the regime will be
   greatest when the challenge has ethnic or religious claims and targets
   the state, implying an interactive effect. Using the Social Conflict in
   Africa Database, we find that regimes with a history of past military
   factionalism are generally less likely to use repression and are
   especially less likely to repress contentious challenges making ethnic
   or religious claims.},

Abstract = {This research examines the effects of three defining features of
   bureaucratic organizations - hierarchy, centralization of
   decision-making, and the formalization of administrative procedures and
   rules - on the fiscal health of city governments in the US, It utilizes
   data from a national survey of top appointed city officials in the US to
   measure the bureaucratic features of city governments, and assesses
   budgetary solvency using actual financial data from audited financial
   reports. Using factor analysis to develop a composite bureaucracy index,
   and addressing unobserved heterogeneity and possible simultaneity bias
   through least squares dummy variable regression and instrumental
   variable regression, the empirical analysis shows that excessive
   bureaucracy leads to poorer fiscal health. Analysing the effects of the
   individual components of the index, the results indicate that
   centralization and formalization exert a statistically significant and
   negative effect on city budgetary solvency.},

Title = {Expert Knowledge as a Strategic Resource: International Bureaucrats and
   the Shaping of Bioethical Standards},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL STUDIES QUARTERLY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {61},
Number = {3},
Pages = {584-595},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {This article asks how international secretariats can sometimes expand
   their authority in areas that relate neither to their mandate, nor to
   their sphere of expert authority. Existing explanations of mission creep
   assume that IOs act autonomously and expand in those areas that connect
   with their mandates, sense of organizational mission, and sphere of
   expert authority. The claim here is that entrepreneurial bureaucrats can
   succeed in the absence of policy deadlock among states in creating creep
   in unexpected issue domains through the mobilization of external
   expertise. The article examines this dynamic in the domain of bioethical
   standards. It shows that UNESCO acted as a first mover in the field,
   despite having no relevant expertise, and despite bioethics being more
   closely connected to the mandate of other organizations. Entrepreneurial
   bureaucrats within UNESCO were able to create creep in bioethics by
   mobilizing external experts in the field and capturing their skills.
   Working with external experts endowed their organization with the
   capacity to act, gave epistemic authority to their actions, and
   prevented the politicization of debates in a potentially controversial
   issue domain. In pointing to the strategic uses of expertise, the
   article challenges the commonly held view that expert knowledge acts as
   a means of solving problems and rationalizing global governance.},

Title = {Economic Incentives and the Effectiveness of Nonproliferation Norms:
   German Major Conventional Arms Transfers 1953-2013},

Abstract = {Do norms constrain states' foreign policies even in the face of strong
   economic incentives to ignore them? Arms exports provide an excellent
   opportunity to examine this question more closely. They regularly spark
   fierce political debates on whether to trade goods that buyers might
   deploy with devastating effects. We use the case of German arms exports
   to provide an in-depth statistical analysis of the behavior of a major
   arms exporter that claims to follow high normative standards. In
   particular, we investigate to what extent domestic, supranational, and
   international rules and norms shape German decisions about the
   destination and volume of major conventional weapon deliveries. Using
   panel data for the period 19532013, we employ a Heckman selection model
   to capture the two-step nature of the decision-making process. We find
   that German arms export policies often fail to comply with standards
   that prohibit exports to countries embroiled in military conflicts,
   civil wars, or with strong human rights violations. Furthermore, we
   discover, however, that the country fully complied with multilateral
   arms embargoes after 1990. We conclude that the noneffectiveness of
   certain rules and norms stems from both the ambiguity of norms and die
   opacity of decision-making processes.},

Abstract = {Qualitative ethnographic study of the human rights violations committed
   in the course of the militarized combat against drug trafficking
   organizations in rural Michoacan unmasks state practices of coercive
   inclusion. The violation of human rights and the subsequent processing
   of human rights claims paradoxically bind the marginalized population to
   the formal state and foster its subordination. The practical
   configuration of the current arena of human rights is not the lever for
   a democratic, inclusive Mexico but a curtain that conceals the
   repressive practices that it makes possible. In the processing of human
   rights complaints, the legal rights of physical integrity and private
   property become moral rights with no effect of legal justice.},

Abstract = {The unexpected victories of Donald Trump in the United States 2016
   Presidential campaign and of the Leave campaign in the British
   referendum on membership in the European Union have important
   similarities in terms of campaign strategy, rhetoric and social bases of
   support. They are exemplars of a wave of right-wing populism that has
   swept across advanced democracies. The triumph of Brexit also raises
   questions about the future relationship between the United Kingdom and
   United States. While it is too early to be certain about either the
   impact of Brexit or the future direction of the Trump Administration,
   and despite ties between the Trump Administration and British
   politicians who campaigned for or subsequently supported Brexit, the
   United Kingdom could become much less useful as a diplomatic and
   economic partner to the United States after leaving the European Union.},

Journal = {POLICY AND POLITICS},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {45},
Number = {3},
Pages = {343-360},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {This article aims to bring some definitional clarity to the study of
   neoliberalism by investigating the three most common conceptualisations
   of the project as an ideology, mode of regulation, and market-oriented
   governmentality. It is argued that the heretofore somewhat marginalised
   governmentality perspective offers the most untapped potential for new
   analytical insights due to its ability to avoid three problems apparent
   in the literature on neoliberalism: the conflation of the governmental
   and hegemonic politics of neoliberalism; the prevalence of overly
   simplistic periodisations of neoliberalism; and, the failure to grasp
   the importance of processes of subjectification to the practical
   functioning of neoliberalism.},

Abstract = {This article examines to what extent Dutch municipalities have adapted
   new local prostitution regulations to local needs and demands following
   decentralisation in 2000. We examined the extent to which a national
   template is locally adapted, and which factors inspired such
   adaptations. We found that many municipalities extensively copied the
   regulatory template developed by the Dutch Association of
   Municipalities. Our analyses show that unexpectedly and contrary to
   popular arguments on the merits of decentralisation local needs and
   demands played no major role in explaining local policy-adaptations.
   Political fragmentation and size-related municipal resources however do
   explain differences in local adaptations.},

Title = {Frozen Conflicts and Internal Dynamics of De Facto States: Perspectives
   and Directions for Research},

Abstract = {The complex architecture of fragmented authority in the international
   system remains under-theorized. Understanding the world of separatist
   regions that turn into de facto states is high on the research agenda.
   While patron states are said to be a necessary condition, we argue that
   it might not be a sufficient one to explain the varying degrees of
   survival/endurance of de facto states. This analytical essay is an
   effort to establish directions for research that would better account
   for the variation among cases by integrating their internal dynamics
   with what we already know about the role of external factors. Adopting a
   political sociology perspective, this article focuses on understudied
   aspects of internal processes and points to the role of local elites in
   state and nation-building during civil wars and after violence declines.
   We contend that such a perspective helps to account in a more
   comprehensive way for the processes underlying the status quo while, at
   the same time, analyzing the interplay between external and internal
   dynamics of frozen conflicts. We show that students of de facto states
   would gain from employing literatures on state-building and
   nation-building to articulate an analytical framework that would
   reassess the role of local elites in building a state and a nation, and
   analyze the societal (un) responsiveness as well as the strategies of
   passive or active accommodation, resistance or opposition within de
   facto states' populations.},

Abstract = {India is at a crossroads. To develop its industrial capacity and boost
   exports, the country needs to sign new free trade agreements. The
   announcement of a trade agreement as part of the Trans-Pacific
   Partnership (TPP) is putting pressure on India to speed up its own
   negotiations with trade partners. East Asia is an ideal target for
   India, if a return to the Look East policy is any indication. However,
   India has to deal with China, a central player in trade negotiations
   such as the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP). This
   article examines Indian reactions to the TPP and highlights the
   consequences of such an agreement for India.},

Abstract = {In the United States, there is mounting political pressure on public
   agencies to publish internal data. But transparency policy innovation
   brings a unique set of legal and normative challenges regarding how
   sensitive information will be used. It is therefore an open question as
   to what legal-normative conditions favour innovation. Are there specific
   kinds of laws, rules, or normative conditions that are related to
   adoption of new, potentially risky, transparency policies? In this
   article, qualitative comparative analysis with secondary data from
   multiple sources is used to find out what configurations of conditions
   are associated with open data use in 122 police departments. Results
   show three different paths to innovation among police departments:
   mandate driven, city-stakeholder convergence, and network learning. The
   findings are examined and developed through interviews with experts from
   a national police transparency initiative.},

Abstract = {Contemporary Arctic transformations and their global causes and
   consequences have put international cooperation in the Arctic Council,
   the region's most important forum for addressing Arctic affairs, at the
   forefront of research in Northern governance. With interest in Arctic
   regional affairs in world politics being at a historical high, the
   actual participation and contribution by interested actors to regional
   governance arrangements, such as the Arctic Council, has remained very
   much a blind spot. This article introduces and analyses a novel dataset
   on stakeholder participation in the Arctic Council (STAPAC) for all
   member states, Permanent Participants and observers in Ministerial,
   Senior Arctic Officials' and subsidiary body meetings between 1998 and
   2015. The article finds that participation in the Arctic Council varies
   significantly across meeting levels and type of actors, and that new
   admissions to the Council, a source of major contestation in recent
   debates, do not necessarily result in more actors attending. The article
   further discusses these findings in light of three prevalent debates in
   Arctic governance research, and shows the empirical relevance of the
   STAPAC dataset for the study of Arctic cooperation and conflict,
   observer involvement in the Arctic Council system and political
   representation of indigenous Permanent Participants.},

Title = {Decentralisation Reforms and Regionalist Parties' Strength:
   Accommodation, Empowerment or Both?},

Abstract = {The article aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of the impact of
   decentralisation on regionalist parties' strength in both national and
   regional elections. We consider decentralisation both as a putatively
   crucial event, that is, the creation of an elected regional government,
   and as a process. Our study is based on a dataset including aggregate
   vote shares for 227 regionalist parties competing in 329 regions across
   18 Western democracies. Our findings show that decentralisation as an
   event has a strong impact on the number of regionalist parties, as it
   triggers processes of proliferation and diffusion. Decentralisation as a
   process has an overall empowerment effect in regional elections, while
   it does not have an effect in national elections. However, our analysis
   also reveals that the overall null effect in national elections is
   actually the result of an empowering effect on new regionalist parties
   and of an accommodating effect on old regionalist parties.},

Abstract = {In response to massive human rights violations, states are obliged not
   only to prosecute the perpetrators, provide reparations to the victims
   and tell the truth about the violations but also to guarantee their
   non-recurrence. The literature on prosecution, truth-telling and
   reparation abounds but guarantees of non-recurrence remain
   under-explored. This article begins to develop a more systematic
   understanding of this concept, situating it at the interface between
   corrective and distributive justice. While defining guarantees of
   non-recurrence broadly, the article provides criteria for developing
   specific prevention strategies in a given context. Particularly relevant
   in this regard are measures to disable abusive capacities.},

Abstract = {Despite initial promises of a Keynesian-inspired redistribution
   programme by the African National Congress, macroeconomic policy making
   in South Africa has been shaped largely by market orthodoxy ever since
   the 1996 Growth, Employment, and Redistribution programme was unveiled
   by the finance ministry. The article draws on econometric analysis
   combined with interviews, and a rich body of literature that focuses on
   the economic incentives underwriting state industrial policies, in order
   to highlight the causal mechanisms responsible for the persistence of
   neo-liberal orthodoxy in South Africa over a 20-year period. It argues
   that the failure of the developmental state to materialize during the
   post-apartheid era can be attributed to a convergence of interests
   between the national treasury, the business sector, and global financial
   actors. More specifically, it shows that capital account liberalization
   reduced the exchange rate risk for international investors by
   strengthening the rand, thereby generating a decline in South Africa's
   10-year bond yield and facilitating the treasury's access to
   international finance at reduced interest rates.},

Abstract = {We examine the relationship between creditor protection, law reform and
   credit expansion using longitudinal data for four OECD countries between
   1970 and 2005. By decomposing the different elements of creditor
   protection, we show that civil law countries (France and Germany) have
   developed a high level of protection for creditors in the form of
   controls over the management of debtor firms, while common law countries
   (UK and USA) have arrived at a high degree of protection in relation to
   secured creditors' contractual rights over firms' assets. Using panel
   causality tests and dynamic panel data modelling, we show that laws
   strengthening creditors' control over debtor firms in these four
   countries had a long-term positive effect on the expansion of private
   credit, while reforms increasing secured creditors' rights had a
   negative effect. We explore the implications of our findings for legal
   origin theory and the varieties of capitalism approach.},

Abstract = {This paper contributes to current debates by reframing recent
   transformations in housing, policy and property equity in terms of a
   transfigured asset-based welfare regime. The analysis thereby advances
   earlier, more descriptive evaluations of asset-based welfare and
   challenges suggestions that its relevance has faded since the global
   financial crisis. We argue, drawing on the UK as a case with broad
   international salience, that the home has become even more central as an
   asset base of individual welfare since the global financial crisis, yet
   under distorted conditions of access and distribution, with housing
   wealth polarisation undermining financial inclusion and welfare security
   more broadly.},

Abstract = {An important literature has emerged that seeks to explain political
   disaffection and the resulting problem of disengagement by looking into
   citizens' understandings of democratic politics and approaching
   understanding in cognitive terms. On the basis of an empirical study,
   this article proposes an alternative approach that can contribute to a
   deeper appreciation of the way in which citizens approach democratic
   politics; one that we need in order to address political disaffection.
   This article shows how a citizen's understanding should be viewed as the
   outcome of a dynamic between a citizen and the democracy she/he is
   trying to understand. Understanding is then about knowing how politics
   works: an embodied achievement, contextually embedded. This article
   concludes by arguing that confronting political disaffection by changing
   understandings would demand an acknowledgement and appreciation of why a
   certain understanding is a valid way of seeing for a citizen, in order
   then to be able to plausibly shift such understandings.},

Abstract = {The ubiquity of references to happiness and wellbeing indicates
   widespread anxiety that all may not be well, reflecting the erosion of
   the social in late capitalist modernity. The paper finds that, rather
   than helping to solve this problem, individualist formulations of
   wellbeing in policy mimic or deepen the underlying pathology. Drawing on
   empirical research in Zambia and India, it advocates an alternative
   approach, relational wellbeing, which is grounded in a relational
   ontology that can challenge dominant ideologies of the self, places
   central the generative quality of relationality which is critical to
   societal change and engenders a socially inclusive political vision.},

   Municipalities},
Journal = {REVIEW OF POLICY RESEARCH},

Abstract = {New York municipalities passed more than 60 measures promoting
   high-volume hydraulic fracturing (HVHF), 2008-12. These policies and
   resolutions signaled to state officials that municipalities desired
   HVHF's promised economic benefits and were anxious for an end to the
   state's HVHF moratorium. They also may be evidence of municipalities
   proactively preparing for a drilling boom. Why did some jurisdictions
   adopt these measures while others did not? While scholarship suggests
   that policy adoption is facilitated when jurisdictions and citizens
   possess more resources, capacity appears to have a negative or
   negligible impact on pro-HVHF action. Such action appears more likely
   when local actors anticipate HVHF's potential gains but have not
   previously experienced substantial drilling, perceive that the industry
   could be viable locally, and can access relevant policy examples. Some
   lessons from conventional adoption scholarship may not apply when
   policies are symbolic, advocacy may be elite-driven, and mimicry is an
   important diffusion mechanism.},

Abstract = {The governments of Britain, France, and the United States are seeking to
   promote renewed investment in nuclear power through metagovernance.
   Metagovernance describes the way governments can leverage state power
   and resources to shape the behavior of networked actors to advance
   policy goals. To metagovern, governments use a variety of policy tools
   but the factors shaping the design of these policy tools remains
   unclear. Grid-group cultural theory is used to show that the design of
   the policy tools used in metagovernance reflects both an underlying
   cultural bias within government and prevailing institutional
   circumstances. The paper demonstrates the utility of cultural theory in
   the study of metagovernance.},

Abstract = {Rules help ensure consistent employee behaviour, yet rule bending occurs
   in public organizations every day. Previous research indicates that rule
   bending is influenced by organizational structure and personal
   characteristics (DeHart-Davis 2007). This present study considers the
   influence of organizational norms on rule bending by exploring the
   impact of ethical climate, which signals to employees the best course of
   action when faced with situations that are ethical in nature (Victor and
   Cullen 1987, 1988). To investigate this relationship, survey data from
   employees of a large American local government are analysed. Results
   from a structural equation model show that three ethical
   climates-organization interest', team interest', and
   rules/SOP'-significantly influence rule bending. Findings suggest that
   organizational norms play a critical role for employee behaviour and
   public managers can consider rule bending and ethical climate as
   impetuses for organizational change.},

Abstract = {In recent years there has been much policy interest in the development
   of social investment initiatives. Many such proposals depend upon third
   sector organisations (TSOs) loaning working capital in order to bridge
   gaps in cash flow. Existing studies on the willingness of TSOs to borrow
   have tended to used selective samples, which may have led to an
   exaggeration of market demand. This article explores, with reference to
   robust evidence on the attitudes and behaviours of representative
   samples of TSOs from the Third Sector Trends Study in Northern England,
   the extent of interest in borrowing for a range of purposes including to
   buy or upgrade property, buy equipment or facilities, or borrow working
   capital. The article makes observations on current and future market
   demand for loans in light of the way that TSO leaders' balance their
   dependence on given, earned and borrowed money.},

Title = {Fit for purpose? Fitting ontological security studies `into' the
   discipline of International Relations: Towards a vernacular turn},
Journal = {COOPERATION AND CONFLICT},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {52},
Number = {1, SI},

Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {The performance of International Relations (IR) scholarship - as in all
   scholarship - acts to close and police the boundaries of the discipline
   in ways that reflect power-knowledge relations. This has led to the
   development of two strands of work in ontological security studies in
   IR, which divide on questions of ontological choice and the nature of
   the deployment of the concept of dread. Neither strand is intellectually
   superior to the other and both are internally heterogeneous. That there
   are two strands, however, is the product of the performance of IR
   scholarship, and the two strands themselves perform distinct roles. One
   allows ontological security studies to engage with the `mainstream' in
   IR; the other allows `international' elements of ontological security to
   engage with the social sciences more generally. Ironically, both can be
   read as symptoms of the discipline's issues with its own ontological
   (in) security. We reflect on these intellectual dynamics and their
   implications and prompt a new departure by connecting ontological
   security studies in IR with the emerging interdisciplinary fields of the
   `vernacular' and `everyday' via the mutual interest in biographical
   narratives of the self and the work that they do politically.},

Abstract = {Western powers often turn to international sanctions in order to exert
   pressure on incumbent governments and signal their support for the
   opposition. Yet whether, and through what mechanisms, sanctions trigger
   protest remains unclear. We argue that sanction threats work as an
   international stamp of approval for would-be protesters; they encourage
   collective action against governments. Moreover, sanction threats send
   particularly clear and coherent signals if multiple senders issue them
   and if they focus on human rights, which makes such sanctions threats
   more effective in sparking social unrest. Using count models of protest
   activity, we find strong support for our arguments. We corroborate our
   findings with qualitative evidence from the case of Zimbabwe.},

Abstract = {In this brief essay, I explore the relationship between `states' (or
   more broadly, institutions of political authority) and ontological
   security. Drawing from historical examples, I argue that it is a mistake
   to assume that all `states' seek ontological security: this
   generalisation applies only to those polities that claim to be the main
   ontological security providers. I then develop a typology of
   institutional ontological security provision arrangements as have
   existed throughout history, arguing that another reason the concept of
   ontological security is valuable for international relations (IR) is
   because it offers a way to compare systems across time and space without
   assuming the primacy of politics or religion. In summary, IR does not
   have to limit its use of the concept of ontological security to a
   synonym for `state identity' - ontological security can offer much more
   than that by helping the discipline reach across time and space.},

Abstract = {The series of recent hecatombs in the Mediterranean, together with the
   regressive reactions we have witnessed in and around Europe, highlight
   the importance of posing the question of climate change and migration.
   Climate change will interact with a number of drivers of migration, and
   will hit hardest on the weakest and most exposed - which often include
   migrants as well as those too poor to move. However, how the
   climate-migration nexus can be addressed in fair and equitable ways
   (with what concepts, in what fora, through what policies) is far from a
   simple question. This intervention proposes two main arguments. First, a
   brief overview of recent debates suggests that we are still far from any
   progressive approaches to climate migration' - those that have emerged
   are different expressions of biopolitical discourses on sustainable
   development and resilience. Second, this intervention invites to
   reconsider the widely held and depoliticising assumption that climate
   migration is a problem to be solved' - for instance, by UNFCCC. Rather,
   the nexus should be seen as a set of open questions on different
   alternative climate futures, as well as a symptom of the irreducibly
   political tensions inherent in every form of mobility as much as in
   every attempt to discipline/govern it.},

Abstract = {In this article, I argue that the ideological revolutions of the
   twentieth century were fundamentally about human rights, and human
   dignity in particular. By human dignity, I refer to an amalgam of
   primarily economic but also social and political rights. Throughout the
   century, revolutionaries capitalized on conditions of human rights
   deprivations under the ruling regime and mobilized supporters based on
   promises of rectification. Regime changes were far less about ideology
   (e.g., communism, democracy) than they were about ensuring human
   dignity. In most cases, the new ideologies and elites driving change
   brought new sets of human dignity shortcomings with them. I explore this
   argument with an in-depth analysis of regime change in Russia at the
   beginning of the twentieth century and Poland at the end. In each case,
   I find that promises of human dignity, starting with ensuring the
   preservation of life and basic economic conditions for survival, were
   the rallying point for change.},

Abstract = {Recognition is vital for conflict resolution. This study was designed to
   learn more about the factors underlying the willingness to recognize the
   pain and suffering of the opponent in the asymmetrical protracted
   conflict between Israelis and Palestinians. Data were collected through
   a public opinion survey conducted with a representative sample of
   Israeli-Jewish adults (N = 511). Perceptions of threat/distrust toward
   Palestinians and dehumanization of Palestinians each made a significant
   contribution to explaining Jewish-Israeli (un)willingness to recognize
   Palestinian pain and suffering (R-2 = .36). Hawkishness made an added
   significant contribution to the overall explanatory power of the model
   (R-2 = .38). Higher scores on the threat/distrust scale and the
   dehumanization scale, as well as higher hawkishness predicted decreased
   willingness to recognize Palestinian pain and suffering. The
   implications of our findings for understanding the role of recognition
   and of moral concern in conflict resolution are discussed.},

Abstract = {Literature considering international human rights mechanisms stresses
   that they have the best chance of success when they are closest to ideas
   which already exist within national contexts. Research which addresses
   women's human rights bodies, such as the Convention Against All Forms of
   Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW) and United Nations Security Council
   Resolution 1325 (UNSCR 1325), argues that they function best when
   reinterpreted to fit the local context. Yet, situations where this
   domestic norm translation is occurring, but policy change is not
   achieved, have received little consideration. Why do some contexts, even
   where norm translation occurs, resist policy change? This article
   examines Northern Ireland, where these women's rights bodies are used
   extensively in the women's sector, but where change has not occurred. It
   argues that norm translation is not the only important factor, and that
   a greater consideration of local political structures is needed in order
   to more fully explain policy resistance.},

Abstract = {What role did the European Central Bank (ECB) play in EU governance,
   regarding the financial, the economic and sovereign debt crises? How
   should we understand ECB leadership from a theoretical perspective?
   Based on speeches, literature review and interviews, this contribution
   concludes that by using policies such as the Securities Market Programme
   and by promising to do whatever it takes (e.g. Outright Monetary
   Transactions the ECB supported the euro-area faced with an unprecedented
   crisis. Its two presidents during the crisis periods were leaders in
   that they managed to get the ECB followers (its Governing Council; EU
   member states) willing to take part in a common enterprise solving the
   sovereign debt crisis with the bank using exceptional monetary policy
   tools. This contribution argues that both Presidents Jean-Claude Trichet
   and Mario Draghi exercised transformative leadership and were willing to
   take action when no other leaders were willing or able to lead.},

Abstract = {Are organizationally linked suicide attacks deadlier than those launched
   by lone wolf terrorists? This article elaborates a perpetrator-based
   distinction among suicide terrorist attacks between organizations and
   lone wolf terrorists, who operate in the absence of a financially or
   physically supportive terrorist organization. The expectation is that
   terrorist organizations would serve as commitment tools that increase
   the loyalty of suicide bombers to their missions through material and
   non-material incentives. Findings demonstrate that when terrorist
   organizations are involved in the planning and execution of suicide
   terrorist attacks, not only do they increase the lethality of these
   attacks but they also accentuate the tactical advantages of suicide
   terrorism. These findings suggest that despite the recent upsurge and
   concern about lone wolf terrorism, the lethality and security impacts of
   suicide terrorism continue to be driven by terrorist organizations.},

Abstract = {Over the last years, the role of national parliaments (NPs) in the
   European Union (EU) has been upgraded in several ways, most importantly
   through the Early Warning System (EWS) and a new role in Treaty
   revisions established by the Treaty of Lisbon (ToL). These provisions
   formally turn national legislatures into EU actors in their own right
   that can act both individually and collectively at the EU level, as well
   as independently of their national governments. As a result, the EU
   legislative process now presents them with multiple arenas in which they
   can be simultaneously active - a perspective so far neglected in the
   literature. The aim of this research agenda is therefore threefold: to
   take stock of the impact of these provisions by contrasting the formal
   structures and the actual involvement of NPs; to propose a
   conceptualization of this new role of NPs in EU affairs as multi-arena
   players'; and to sketch new avenues for research.},

Abstract = {The fringerejected and marginalized ideas and beliefshas historically
   been clearly divided from the cultural and political mainstream.
   However, recent technological developments have weakened the boundary
   separating them. The Internet and social media have made it possible for
   fringe ideas to move much more readily into the mainstream. The Trump
   campaign was accompanied by the massive infusion of fringe motifs
   including the denigration of ethnic and religious groups; the support of
   political extremists; and the acceptance of conspiracy theories. As the
   fringe becomes legitimated by this mainstreaming, the possibilities for
   violence increase.},

Volume = {16},
Number = {5},
Pages = {471-487},
Abstract = {Many new states have formed in the international system as a result of
   secession. However, such states are rarely entirely homogenous and
   nationalist elites face the challenge of creating a brand new state
   while ensuring minority rights and avoiding future conflict. Why do some
   secessionist states protect minority rights and create inclusive
   political institutions while others marginalize or discriminate against
   minorities? In this paper, the author examines patterns of
   marginalization after secession and provides an overarching theory of
   inclusion in all secessionist cases and all ethnic groups that reside in
   newly established countries.},

Abstract = {Purpose - This study aims to explore the causes, characteristics and
   consequences of workplace anger expression and suppression, with an
   additional aim of testing the emotional dimension of Affective Events
   Theory.
   Design/methodology/approach - Participants (n = 187) from management and
   non-management positions completed an event-contingent anger diary over
   a period of four working weeks, alongside measures on trait anger and
   job satisfaction.
   Findings - Over 50 per cent of the sample disclosed anger-causing
   events. In keeping with Affective Events Theory, disposition was
   important, with trait anger higher in those disclosing anger-causing
   events. There appeared a range of factors predicting the expression of
   anger, with these focused primarily on individual issues and
   pre-existing emotion rather than work characteristics.
   Originality/value - Through consideration of management and
   non-management workers and by using a longitudinal design, the study
   highlights the importance of individual factors in understanding
   workplace anger. It notes the value in focusing on discrete emotion. The
   findings offer a clear direction for future research that could assist
   with enhancing models of workplace emotion, particularly if the aim is
   to account for discrete emotions.},

Abstract = {The paper investigates party-union relationships in Italy (1946-2014) by
   hand-coding parties' parliamentary speeches and trade unions' congress
   motions. In line with the cartel party thesis, a time series analysis
   shows that the ideological closeness between the left-wing Italian
   General Confederation of Labour and left-wing parties deteriorated when
   the Italian Socialist Party (1980) and the heirs of the Italian
   Communist Party (1998) converged toward the centre of the ideological
   spectrum. Conversely, the closeness between the Catholic-inspired
   Italian Confederation of Workers' Unions and the heirs of Christian
   Democracy increased after 1994, when the former party's leftist factions
   became the major part of the Italian Popular Party.},

Pages = {381-398},
Abstract = {Based on a collaboration with the late Lionel Cliffe, this article
   suggests agendas and methods for analysing regional patterns of
   migration and labour mobility in Southern and West Africa. It locates
   local communities in regional patterns and global processes using two
   key organising concepts: first, the regionalisation of Africa, as
   outlined in Samir Amin's work. The authors consider continuities and
   discontinuities with the paradigms of Africa of the labour reserves' and
   Africa of the colonial trade economy' to understand contemporary
   realities. Second, this article explores the mechanisms and
   characteristics of cheap labour on different scales of analysis. This
   includes a discussion of the theories that explored the relations of
   reproduction of labour, and the reproduction of the labour system as a
   whole. In doing so, it rethinks the modes of production discourse to
   highlight the continuing importance of situations where capitalism
   exists alongside non-capitalist relations of production and
   reproduction.},

Pages = {471-482},
Abstract = {Declared operationally ready in 2016, the African Standby Force (ASF)
   has not been deployed in its originally designed form. This is not for
   the lack of opportunities but rather a demonstration of the power of the
   Regional Economic Communities/Regional Mechanisms (RECs/RMs) - Africa's
   sub-regional security structures - over matters of peace and security.
   Experience gathered from its short existence suggests that the ASF may
   never be deployed in its current form. It may instead evolve into a
   robust framework, adaptable mainly by the RECs/RMs, for addressing
   varied security challenges. Four things are critical to enhancing the
   utility of the ASF: the political willingness of the RECs/RMs, the
   strategic interest of the member states, predictable and sustainable
   financing, and clarity on the role of the African Capability for
   Immediate Response to Crisis, the temporary battlegroup that was created
   to provide the African Union with a rapid response capability, pending
   the ASF's operationalization.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF EUROPEAN PUBLIC POLICY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {24},
Number = {5},
Pages = {775-787},
Abstract = {This research agenda contribution starts from the observation that an
   increasing number of interest group studies have been addressing
   questions about framing. Although this emerging literature has made
   great progress towards being able to study interest group framing in
   large-n designs owing to advances in data-gathering techniques, many
   analytical and conceptual challenges still lie ahead. One important
   question that remains is how framing can serve as a political strategy
   and, more precisely, which frames are most effective. This article gives
   an overview of the recent work on interest group framing. It highlights
   some key issues that interest group scholars face when they undertake
   research on framing. Various studies on interest group framing are
   contrasted in terms of the types of frames studied, the level of
   analysis employed and how influence is determined. I conclude by
   developing an agenda with some concrete recommendations for interest
   group scholars that deal with questions about framing.},

Abstract = {Venezuela's communal currencies are unique worldwide as a central
   government initiative. However, efforts to establish significant
   currency systems have failed so far. Their lack of success can be
   interpreted in terms of the experiment's foundation on strong cultural
   optimism and confused concepts of the nature and origins of money.
   Government support has been limited to a single model of
   isolationist-egalitarian ``barter{''} systems. Some form of local
   currency may be relevant to ecosocialist transition in Venezuela, but
   the current spatial organization of the systems is wasteful of transport
   fuel, suggesting that a transition to ecosocialism cannot postpone
   addressing structural challenges.},

Title = {The politics of fiscal rules within the European Union: a dynamic
   analysis of fiscal rules stringency},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF EUROPEAN PUBLIC POLICY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {24},
Number = {6},
Pages = {852-870},
Abstract = {Over the last 25 years, fiscal rules (FRs) have been proliferating in
   Europe bringing in-depth change to the architecture of fiscal
   institutions. This paper investigates different theories explaining the
   changes in national fiscal rules stringency (FRS) using a panel of 28
   European countries from 1990 to 2013. The authors found evidence that
   fiscal stress prevents fiscal reform in the short term, and leads to
   stronger fiscal rules in the long term. This pattern corresponds to the
   war of attrition' argument formulated by Alesina and Drazen {[}(1989)
   Why are stabilizations delayed?', The American Economic Review 81(5):
   1170-88]. The authors found evidence that countries eager to join the EU
   showed their commitment to Maastricht targets by incorporating FRs into
   national laws. Countries facing financial difficulties after the 2009
   sovereign debt crisis were coerced into adopting more stringent FRs to
   obtain fiscal support from the EU. Both cases support the idea that
   coercive diplomacy might explain the strength of national fiscal rules
   in the EU.},

Title = {The irony of epistemic learning: epistemic communities, policy learning
   and the case of Europe's hormones saga},
Journal = {POLICY AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {36},
Number = {2},
Pages = {215-232},
Abstract = {Epistemic communities are at their most powerful in novel and
   technically complex policy issues when decision-makers' and
   stakeholders' understandings are rudimentary. A successful epistemic
   community reduces uncertainty through policy learning. These lessons
   enable policy actors to recognize their preferences thus making such
   issues more tractable. However, policy learning is dynamic and has
   various modes. Where an epistemic community's advice points in
   unfavourable policy directions, rival lessons may be crafted by policy
   actors thus threatening an epistemic community's place as principal
   teacher on an issue. What happens to the influence of epistemic
   communities that do not attend to these alternative interpretations? Can
   epistemic communities teach in the wrong' mode? Using the empirical case
   of the long-running hormone growth promoters saga in the European Union
   (EU) we show how, even in complex technical issues, learning in the
   epistemic mode may not dominate for long. Specifically, we identify a
   key barrier to epistemic communities' influence neglected in the
   literature: the irony of epistemic learning'. In setting the
   foundational knowledge on novel issues, epistemic communities provide
   non-specialist governance actors with the resources to oppose the very
   knowledge these experts have created thereby curtailing their influence.
   We conclude with a discussion about whether epistemic communities can
   and should overcome this irony.},

Abstract = {Lake Tana Basin is the second largest sub-basin of the Blue Nile which
   covers an area of 15,114 km(2). Lake Tana is a tropical Lake with
   surface area of 3111 Km(2). It is the largest fresh water resource of
   Ethiopia (50\%). It is the source of the Blue Nile(Abay) River. Lake
   Tana basin and Blue Nile river provide economic, social, political,
   environmental, ecological and religious benefits also for downstream
   eastern Nile countries. The basin problems have also influence in
   downstream eastern Nile countries. Food security and environmental
   sustainability are grand challenges in the basin. Ensuring adequate
   supply and quality of water for water user sectors in the basin remains
   a challenge. The sanitation and hygiene coverage remains not
   significantly improved compared to the unprecedented population growth.
   The basin suffers from easily perceivable land, soil and water
   degradation which are manifested in different forms: Sedimentation,
   clearing of wetland, canalization of the tributaries, increased trend of
   eutrophication, toxigenic cyano bacteria, occurrence of invasive species
   like water hyacinth (Eichornia crassipes), stakeholders conflict,
   improper damming, construction of buildings in the Lake shore areas that
   are natural breeding and feeding grounds for somefish and bird species,
   poorwastemanagement, increased prevalence of waterborne diseases
   especially in the riparian community which largely depend on raw water
   for drinking and recreation aremajor problems of theBasin. Climate
   change is also having its impact. Though the problems and challenges are
   known in the area, effective measures proportion to the magnitude of the
   problem are not yet taken sufficiently.},

   Substantial general knowledge about ethnopolitics has accumulated. Yet
   too little is known about the processes that link identity, ideologies,
   leadership, mobilization, and political action. A strategy of
   comparative case studies is strongly recommended to provide such
   information.},

Journal = {CRITICAL POLICY STUDIES},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {11},
Number = {3},
Pages = {291-310},
Abstract = {In this article we analyze public sector change as a profoundly
   constructed phenomenon - as performative reforms. Public sector reforms,
   of which policy processes are an integral part, are constituted and
   realized through long chains of interventions. Communicative-discursive
   interventions posit and constitute problems as real and important, while
   technocratic interventions, such as plans, analyses, and schemes
   construct new imagined worlds for possible and attractive instrumental
   solutions. Our empirical results display circular movements of three
   modes of change, making up a continuous policy cycle in the
   transformation of Swedish health, reiterated on different levels of the
   system, in different scales, and with different actors involved. The
   continuity of the reforms is to a large extent the result of a
   successful institutionalization of the policy cycle and its content. It
   is stabilized as a set of discourse and social technologies, distributed
   throughout the entire healthcare system and almost impossible to
   question.},

Abstract = {What does Brexit mean for EU outsider Norway? This article discusses how
   the British decision to leave the EU has influenced Norwegian EU debate
   thus far, and what implications Brexit might have for Norway's relations
   with the EU and with Britain. I begin by presenting Norway's current
   association model with the EU, and the ongoing political and media
   debate about membership and the EEA agreement, before I introduce Brexit
   as a breaking point. In the remainder of the article, I examine how the
   Norwegian government has approached Brexit so far, and reflect on how
   Britain's departure from the EU may influence Norway's relations with
   the EU, the EEA agreement and the British-Norwegian bilateral

   i.e., Kazakhstan, India, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh,

   Kyrgyzstan, and Uzbekistan, this chapter attempts to see key dimensions
   of social capital. Twelve survey questions related to social capital
   included in the AsiaBarometer survey are factor analysed with varimax
   rotation. Three dimensions have emerged: general trust, merit-based
   utilitarianism, and institutional engagement. On these bases, six groups
   of countries have emerged, using hierarchical clustering analysis: (1)
   Sri Lanka, Bhutan, India; (2) Pakistan, the Maldives, (3) Turkmenistan;
   (4) Bangladesh, Tajikistan, Afghanistan; (5) Mongolia, Nepal; (6)

Abstract = {An institutional perspective on nuclear deterrence cooperation within

   security studies, especially relating to bargaining and credibility
   within alliances. This article surveys questions that will be core to
   the research agenda involving alliance institutions and nuclear weapons

Abstract = {How are nonstate actors within the United Nations Framework Convention
   on Climate Change (UNFCCC) held to account? In this article, we
   introduce the concept of ``institutional accountability{''} to
   complement the wider literature(s) on accountability in climate
   governance. Within institutional frameworks, actors employ rules, norms,
   and procedures to demand justifications from one another. In light of
   those justifications, actors then use ``exit, voice, or loyalty{''} to
   positively or negatively sanction each other. To depict the dynamics of
   institutional accountability, we analyze the role of nonstate actors in
   the nine constituency groups of the UNFCCC. We outline the constituency
   structure and the population of observer organizations. We then identify
   examples where nonstate actors employed institutional rules in tandem
   with exit, voice, or loyalty to foster accountability. In making this
   analysis we draw upon three years of on-site participation at UNFCCC
   meetings, document analysis, and more than 40 semistructured interviews
   with state and nonstate actors. We conclude by discussing the scope and
   conditions under which institutional accountability may occur in other
   issue areas of global governance.},

Abstract = {Among the multiple dimensions of the tous azimuths modernisation of
   Chinese naval forces, the development of China's anti-access capacity
   has recently elicited considerable interest. The important link between
   this capacity and an overarching vision of the use of force - i.e. a
   naval doctrine - has, however, often been left implicit. This article
   shows that the particular development of China's naval anti-access
   forces - more precisely, forces with an impact on the naval balance -
   can be explained by a shift of China's naval doctrine towards a
   distinctly pre-emptive posture, which, itself, stems from the set of
   constraints imposed by the framework of local war under informationised
   conditions'.},

Abstract = {Is reconciliation a process of masking conflict in order for it to be
   eradicated from the view, consciousness and responsibility of the state?
   Why do we focus on solutions rather than managing and embracing the
   issues that generate `conflict'? This article draws on the politics of
   reconciliation debates in Australia to highlight the dangers that
   emanate from political efforts to bring about reconciliation merely as a
   mode of conflict resolution. We contend that an uncritical advocacy of
   reconciliation risks losing sight of the centrality of conflict to the
   maintenance of identity and contestation around racial and cultural
   inequalities. We ground this in a discussion of the experiences of
   societies like South Africa and Northern Ireland. The implications of a
   conflict-free approach to reconciliation for Australia are profound
   because it neglects the experiences and concerns of Indigenous people. A
   conflict-free approach to reconciliation ignores the conflict inherent
   in Australian society due to the experience of structural injustice and
   Indigenous inequality. Alternatively, a political narrative that keeps
   conflict in view potentially provides greater legitimacy and is more
   successful in highlighting inequalities around race and identity than
   approaches focused on harmonious social and racial relations. These
   concerns are addressed through a discussion of contemporary debates on
   `changing' and `reforming' the Australian constitution to `recognize'
   Indigenous Australians.},

Abstract = {A number of studies have found that a variety of political phenomena,
   including democracy, can spread through a diffusion process at the
   international level. It is also possible that non-democratic phenomena
   can follow a similar pattern. The spread of a number of different types
   of authoritarian regimes in Europe between the First World War and the
   Second World War provided a classic case to determine whether there were
   such patterns. In fact, the creation of authoritarian political systems
   followed a diffusion pattern in some periods under some circumstances.
   Diffusion was more likely to occur in the 1930s instead of the 1920s.
   There were also indications that those countries that were at lower
   levels of economic development were a factor that led to the
   establishment of authoritarian political systems in many years. The
   evidence for levels of economic development was not present for all time
   periods, indicating that the spread of authoritarian regimes was a
   complex process.},

Abstract = {This article argues that by understanding Islamic State of Iraq and
   Syria (ISIS) state-building processes we are able to understand how ISIS
   has developed while also developing a united citizenship body built from
   people in Iraq and Syria and those making hijra. The fragmentation of
   Iraq and Syria resulted in conditions that would prove conducive to the
   group's expansion and identifying these conditions is imperative to
   understanding Sunni extremism in the Middle East. The article argues
   that ISIS builds citizenship in two ways: first, by developing
   asabiyya-group feeling-among Sunni and second, by securitizing the Shi'a
   threat. Identifying and engaging with the concepts of sovereignty and
   citizenship helps to develop much stronger policy responses.},

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONFLICT AND VIOLENCE},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {11},
Abstract = {This paper explores how processual approaches to political violence,
   which largely focus on patterns of strategic interaction at the
   meso-level of analysis, can be enhanced by paying closer attention to
   conditions, patterns, and the micro-dynamics of violence in face-to-face
   encounters. Discussing characteristic elements of processual and
   situational approaches, and drawing on brief vignettes of episodes of
   violence in political conflicts in Peru, Egypt, and Germany, it argues
   that the theoretical value of this perspective is twofold. Firstly, it
   allows us to capture unintended outcomes of situational interactions,
   which can account for the sudden emergence or escalation of violence.
   Secondly, it argues that situational interaction approaches can refine
   our understanding of meso-level violent processes because they allow us
   to examine how these processes shape and ``produce{''} situational
   conditions and constraints that facilitate and induce violent escalation
   and thus offer ways to capture and conceptualize complex patterns of
   enchainment.},

Abstract = {Dubai Electricity \& Water Authority's (DEWA's) achievements over the
   past four years (2012 - 2016) are the result of it using the strategic
   planning and execution process to overcome the challenges it has faced.
   DEWA was formed on January 1, 1992, by a decree issued by the late
   Highness Sheikh Maktoum bin Rashid Al Maktoum, to merge Dubai
   Electricity Company and Dubai Water Department, which had been operating
   independently before then. The problem facing the decision makers in
   this region was how to develop and execute the strategy map to provide a
   clear visual indicator of how the themes and the perspectives of the
   balanced scorecard interrelate to each other. Besides meeting the needs
   of key stakeholders, a key strategic mission was to establish long-term
   relationships and collaborations with suppliers and clients. A good
   strategic plan at DEWA involved employees, citizens, and other
   stakeholders. It should set annual target on strategic goals, have
   feasibility of proposed strategic actions, ensure budgetary allocation
   for new strategic programs, report performance measures to public, using
   annual reviews of managers to see they are collectively achieving
   organizational strategic goals and compare organizational performance
   data over time.
   The future of DEWA looks bright with all proposed agendas and
   initiatives, the continuous growth, planned synergy and succession
   planning. How could DEWA get maximum leverage between stakeholders'
   group and citizens?},

Abstract = {The proliferation of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) on the battlefield
   does not exclude terrorist actors. Recently, there is an evident
   increase in the number of incidents when the so called Islamic State has
   used UAVs. This article tries to describe this relatively new phenomenon
   and present an overview of main types of the potential Islamic State's
   UAV employment in Europe. Despite the fact, that the UAV use by
   terrorist actors will probably not have strategic impact by itself, it
   constitutes a new challenge for state security agencies.},

Abstract = {India's Afghanistan policy in the 1990s is termed a zero-sum game of
   influence with Pakistan. New Delhi's aversion to the pro-Pakistan
   Taliban regime is considered a marker of this rivalry. This paper
   revisits India's approach towards Afghanistan and examines if New Delhi
   was necessarily averse to engaging with pro-Pakistan political factions
   during 1990s. Based on fresh primary interviews with former Indian
   policymakers, media archives, and official reports, the paper shows that
   India engaged with and accommodated pro-Pakistan factions after the
   Soviet withdrawal in 1989 until 1996. The Taliban's rise to power in
   Kabul in September 1996 challenged India's engage-with-all approach.
   Nonetheless, the decision to sever ties with the Taliban and to bolster
   anti-Taliban factions was highly debated in New Delhi. Many in India saw
   the Taliban as a militant Islamist force sponsored by Pakistan. For
   others, however, it was an ethno-nationalist movement representing
   Pashtun interests, and not necessarily under Islamabad's control.},

Journal = {CRITICAL POLICY STUDIES},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {11},
Number = {1},
Pages = {39-56},
Abstract = {This article argues that a critical engagement with the categories and
   concepts of scale has been absent in policy studies. Integrating
   insights from post-structuralist human geography and policy analysis,
   the article reveals the multiple meanings actors assign to scales as
   they make sense of and construct their policy worlds, and also questions
   the implications of this for the practices and politics of policy. This
   analytical lens is applied to an empirical example of the policy work
   involved in implementing England's academy schools policy in a local
   authority case study. Four scalar practices emerge from the analysis:
   dissolving boundaries of scale, shifting between scales, constructing
   boundaries between scales and emphasizing the interconnectedness of
   scales. Analysis reveals how critically engaging with how actors
   construct and mobilize scale can develop a new angle on the political
   logics shaping policy practices and thus enhance understandings of
   political struggles over meaning in policy-making.},

Abstract = {Snowden's whistleblowing on the NSA program had a powerful impact in
   Brazil, prompting Dilma Rousseff's administration to promote, at the
   United Nations, resolutions on Internet privacy, freedom of expression,
   as well as to host important multistakeholder conferences and,
   domestically, to approve the innovative legislation known as Marco
   Civil. These answers were only possible due to a network of officials
   and activists. However, Brazil's global leadership in Internet
   governance is fragile, with many internal contradictions.},

Journal = {TERRORISM AND POLITICAL VIOLENCE},

Volume = {29},
Number = {4},
Pages = {656-673},
Abstract = {Violence characterized by similar actions, actor motivations, group
   structures, or level of damage still poses qualitatively distinct genera
   of threats to states. For instance, terrorism can threaten a particular
   state, be used by a state, or threaten the entire state system. Building
   on the threat construction literature, this study argues that threat is
   best understood through narratives on the relationship between violence
   and the boundary-producing practices that construct the state. Four
   ideal-typical basic narratives on this relationship are producedentrant,
   resource, revisionist, and criminal. Each narrative is then demonstrated
   by looking at how it was used in a historical case of piracy. The action
   (piracy as raiding at sea) is held constant while the threat in each
   varies with the narrative. Understanding how threat is narratively
   constructed can help us to understand particular historical episodes of
   violence and state responses to them.},

Abstract = {U.S. counterterrorism (CT) forces that deployed to Iraq in 2003 as Task
   Force 714 (TF 714) faced an ugly surprise. Tasked to dismantle the
   al-Qaeda in Iraq (AQI) dominated insurgency, the organization could not
   achieve that mission. General Stanley McChrystal, who commanded TF 714
   concluded, ``we were losing to an enemy. we should have dominated.{''}
   But TF 714 transformed in the midst of war and during 2006-2009 was able
   to largely dismantle AQI's clandestine networks to a degree that they
   could no longer function in a cohesive manner. By developing the
   capacity to operate inside those networks, TF 714 was able, in the words
   of General McChrystal, to ``claw the guts out of AQI.{''} This
   transformation runs counter to what organizational experts identify as
   barriers inhibiting militaries from learning, innovating, and changing,
   especially in wartime. To decipher the puzzle of how TF 714 overcame
   these barriers, two questions are addressed in this study: 1) How did TF
   714 transform from a specialized and compartmented unit customized for
   executing infrequent CT missions in peacetime to a wartime
   industrial-strength CT machine that by 2009 dismantled AQI's networks
   that operated across Iraq; and 2) Why was TF 714 able to achieve this
   remarkable transformation?},

Title = {Tough times, shifting roles: examining the EU's commercial diplomacy in
   foreign energy markets},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF EUROPEAN PUBLIC POLICY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {24},
Number = {7},
Pages = {1048-1068},
Abstract = {Focusing on the strategically important Caspian region, this article
   demonstrates how commercial energy diplomacy- political support for
   foreign-investing businesses- is increasingly conducted at the European
   Union (EU) level. It explains why member states have delegated this
   role, despite a general hesitancy to co-operate in foreign energy policy
   and perceptions of a strong division between diplomacy-based and
   (EU-favoured) governance-based approaches to external energy policy. To
   explain this new role (and its limits), this article employs a
   functional-rationalist framework focusing on the structural demands of a
   more challenging international energy environment and EU-level supply
   factors (economies of scale, increased leverage and more neutral/less
   politicized position of the EU) that help respond to it. Overall, the
   article examines an important area of increasing EU foreign energy
   co-operation and demonstrates how energy governance and diplomacy are
   not necessarily competing approaches, but rather different tools for
   achieving a more secure investment climate for European companies.},

   Sub-basin: The Case of Rice Production and Marketing in Fogera District,
   Northwestern Ethiopia},

   INTEGRATION IN THE LAKE TANA BASIN, ETHIOPIA},

Abstract = {Fogera district is one of the districts adjacent to Lake Tana in South
   Gondar zone in Amhara Regional State, Ethiopia. Floods and related
   water-borne diseases were serious problems in the plains of the Lake
   Tana Basin and Fogera district in particular for centuries. But with the
   introduction of rice as a crop, this environmental characteristic has
   become an opportunity instead of a challenge. To address the lack of
   documentation about this water utilization-induced change in farming
   systems in this area, and the resulting rice production and consumption
   value chain, this chapter presents three survey studies conducted from
   2010/11to 2014 by structured interviews of farming households and
   marketing agents, field observations and group discussions supplemented
   by review of literatures. Survey data was collected from 200 farming
   households of high and medium level rice producing kebeles of Fogera
   district selected randomly, key informant experts and a variety of value
   chain actors. Participation in the rice industry in this area has
   increased from 30 participant households in 2 kebeles and area coverage
   of 6 ha in 1993/94 to 34,249 households in 24 kebeles covering an area
   of 20,230 ha of land in 2014/15. Fogera district jumps from no
   contribution in rice production before two decades to a share of 77\% of
   the rice produced in Amhara and 60\% produced in all of Ethiopia. Rice
   is now the primary crop in the district. In addition to rice production,
   farming households have also adapted to rice consumption by innovative
   value addition practices to local food items. About 82.5\% of the
   respondents were rice producers, with non-producing households having no
   access to irrigation; rice production is significantly related to
   irrigation water utilization. These findings clarify the contribution of
   water resource utilization in shifting farming systems and the value
   addition practices in the area. The study has implications for how to
   promote similar innovations where there are no cultural practices
   related to commodities targeted by extension interventions exemplify the
   impacts of proper water resource use.},

Title = {Moving beyond (non-)compliance: the customization of European Union
   policies in 27 countries},

Abstract = {Europeanization research often neglects that the implementation of
   European Union (EU) policy results in diverse national outcomes, even if
   member states comply with EU law. Such fine-grained Europeanization
   patterns have been explored as `gold-plating' and `customization'. This
   contribution builds and expands on this research to propose a general
   conceptualization and measurement of customization as the changes that
   provisions of EU Directives undergo in their regulatory density and
   restrictiveness during legal transposition. Using unique data on the
   customization of EU directive provisions from two policy areas in 27
   countries, our empirical analysis reveals distinct changes in density
   and restrictiveness, pronounced policy-specific and state-level
   customization patterns. The findings illustrate how national
   customization strategies often follow specific EU regulatory logics in
   different integration contexts. We outline implications for future
   research on the causes and consequences of the inherent diversity of EU
   implementation regarding dimensions of customization, issues of
   legitimacy and effectiveness.},

Abstract = {Leadership theory in IR still lacks a coherent approach, and it is
   analytically useful to use eclectic lenses by combining all factors
   related to power and the usage of power to gain leadership status. I
   define the term ``international leadership{''} as a process in which a
   state mobilizes its resources to influence a group of other states
   (followership) in order to achieve a common goal. In the empirical
   investigation, I will focus on China's abilities to lead in Southeast
   Asia. Despite the fact that there are many advantages for China, the
   mechanism of transforming power resources into regional leadership is
   still questionable.},

Abstract = {Co-creation - where citizens and public organizations work together to
   deal with societal issues - is increasingly considered as a fertile
   solution for various public service delivery problems. During
   co-creation, citizens are not mere consumers, but are actively engaged
   in building resilient societies. In this study, we analyze if and how
   state and governance traditions influence learning and policy change
   within a context of co-creation. We combine insights from the
   co-creation and learning literature. The empirical strategy is a
   comparative case study of co-creation examples within the welfare domain
   in childcare (Estonia), education (Germany) and community work (the
   Netherlands). We show that state and governance traditions may form an
   explanation for whether co-creation, learning and policy change occurs.
   Our paper suggests that this seems to be related to whether there is a
   tradition of working together with citizens and a focus on rule
   following or not.},

Abstract = {Despite the frequent participation of women in armed groups, few studies
   have sought to explain the variation in their roles across different
   rebellions. Herein, we investigate this variation. We argue that the
   political ideology a group adopts plays a central role in determining
   the extent of women's participation, particularly their deployment in
   combat roles. Specifically, we link variations in women's roles in armed
   groups to differences in beliefs about gender hierarchies and
   gender-based divisions of labor inherent in the specific ideologies the
   groups adopt. We evaluate hypotheses drawn from these arguments using a
   novel cross-sectional dataset on female combatants in a global sample of
   rebel organizations active between 1979 and 2009. We find that the
   presence of a Marxist-oriented leftist' ideology increases the
   prevalence of female fighters while Islamist ideologies exert the
   opposite effect. However, we find little evidence that nationalism
   exerts an independent influence on women's combat roles. We also note a
   general inverse relationship between group religiosity and the
   prevalence of female fighters. Our analysis demonstrates that political
   ideology plays a central role in determining whether and to what extent
   resistance movements incorporate female fighters into their armed wings.},

Title = {The art of political ambiguity: top-down intergovernmental information
   asymmetry in China},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CHINESE GOVERNANCE},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {2},
Number = {2},
Pages = {149-168},
Abstract = {China, similar to other countries with multi-level government structure,
   suffers serious information asymmetry between different levels of
   governments. Existing studies mostly focus on how the secret information
   possessed by lower-level governments undermines effective control by
   upper-level governments. However, not enough attention has been paid to
   the fact that higher authorities in China often intentionally issue
   ambivalent orders and withhold crucial information about policy goals
   and means from their subordinates. In face of such top-down information
   asymmetry, lower-level governments have to constantly speculate the true
   intentions of their superiors when implementing directives from above.
   This study tries to make sense of the seemingly counter-productive
   political ambiguity by analyzing cases of intergovernmental
   communication and policy implementation in the campaign of New Socialist
   Countryside Construction. We argue that higher authorities in China may
   strategically deploy political ambiguity to enable flexible policy
   implementation, encourage policy innovation, orient local efforts among
   multiple policy goals, and reduce accountability for policy failures.
   Essentially, political ambiguity enhances the adaptability and
   resilience of the Chinese political system in governing the vastly
   diverse and rapidly developing country of China.},

Abstract = {Previous research suggests that political parties learn from and emulate
   the successful election strategies of governing parties in other
   countries. But what explains variation in the degree of influence that
   governing parties have on their foreign counterparts? We argue that
   clarity of responsibility within government, or the concentration of
   executive responsibility in the hands of a dominant governing party,
   allows parties to learn from the most obviously electorally successful
   incumbents. It therefore enhances the cross-national diffusion of party
   programs. To test this expectation, we analyze parties' policy positions
   in twenty-six established democracies since 1977. Our results indicate
   that parties disproportionately learn from and emulate dominant,
   high-clarity foreign incumbents. This finding contributes to a better
   understanding of the political consequences of government clarity and
   sheds new light on the heuristics that engender party-policy diffusion
   by demonstrating that the most visible foreign incumbents, whose
   platforms have yielded concentrated power in office, influence party
   politics ``at home.{''}.},

Abstract = {Despite considerable scholarly interest and recent advances in research,
   our knowledge of how jurisdiction size influences political efficacy
   remains fragmentary. This study contributes to the literature by
   exploring the linkage between the size of county jurisdiction, in terms
   of county population, and external political efficacy in China. Results
   from simple regressions indicate that, on average, external political
   efficacy declines with the size of county jurisdiction. Further analysis
   via a quantile perspective provides evidence that the influence of size
   upon external political efficacy varies across different parts of the
   outcome distribution. We observe a negative and pronounced effect in the
   lower tail of the distribution, but a positive and trivial effect in the
   upper tail. Our study highlights citizens' divergent perceptions about
   the size of political jurisdiction and offers new insights into the
   research on jurisdictional design and political efficacy.},

   showing that much IR analysis of SF has opted for a reductionist
   reliance on analogical readings. To do so, the article first sets out
   the status of the SF genre, and related fields such as fantasy. The case
   is here presented with greater ambition than is usually the case, paying
   particular attention to utopia, and arguing for a view of SF as part
   hinterland of political theory. In the second part, the underlying
   rationale for pop cultural analysis is revisited, and some standard
   motifs in the study of SF recapitulated, the better to revise critical
   common sense. Having expanded the field of inquiry, a third section
   demonstrates the limits of analogical analysis as currently practiced.
   The article then elaborates and defends a new distinction between
   programmatic and expressive sensibilities in SF to revive the case for a
   more ambivalent and open reading of SF. Having mapped the current limits
   of pop-cultural IR, and offered a somewhat different cartography, a
   final section draws out some implications for methods and future
   discussion.},

Abstract = {This paper discusses competition and cooperation between boundary
   organizations (BOs) in the field of global health. It embeds its
   analysis of BOs in health in contemporary theories on institutional
   fragmentation and governance complexity, arguing that BOs in
   international politics have been a major driving force behind an often
   mind-boggling complexity of actors, institutions, and rule systems
   relevant to many contemporary international issues or regimes. The paper
   argues that growing complexity of global governance structures generates
   new demands for BOs with regard to how they manage their interactions
   with other BOs. Accordingly, the framework suggested in this paper
   builds on a set of hypotheses that do not isolate factors at structural
   and agent level but rather capture the interplay of BOs and their
   organizational environment. The paper's empirical analysis investigates
   two BOs, the Global Polio Eradication Initiative and GAVI, the Vaccine
   Alliance, working in the field of polio eradication.},

Abstract = {Amidst concern about declining youth political engagement, it is often
   suggested that social media can provide a solution to this challenge. In
   this article, however, we argue that these online tools have not thus
   far mobilised a new audience to become engaged in either
   institution-oriented activities or political expression. Instead, we
   found that some young people are far more engaged in using social media
   for political purposes than others, and that a substantial proportion of
   young adults never use social media for this purpose. Using latent class
   analysis (LCA) of a unique web survey of young Britons aged 22-29, we
   show that the principal driver of online political engagement is
   political interest (even after controlling for socio-demographic
   characteristics). On this basis, we conclude that social media may be
   providing a new outlet for some young adults; it is not re-engaging the
   young adults who have already lost interest in politics.},

Abstract = {Existing work has shown that membership in intergovernmental
   organizations (IGOs) can, among other outcomes, reduce conflict, promote
   democratization, and shape crisis bargaining. The traditional approach
   to studying how IGOs can reduce conflict has focused on the effects of
   dyads' direct ties to IGOs. In doing so, these analyses use fairly
   simple counts of the number of IGOs to which the states in each dyad
   share membership. We argue that this approach is too narrow; we instead
   consider the effects of higher-order groupings within the IGO network,
   which we call IGO clusters. Within these IGO clusters, states share
   relatively many IGO connections with each other, both directly and
   through indirect links through third parties, fourth parties, and so on.
   The effects of indirect IGO ties are especially important within such
   structures. We use a modularity maximization approach to detect clusters
   within the IGO network. We find robust empirical support for our
   hypothesis that the pacifying effect of IGO membership stems from the
   extent to which pairs of states are more deeply embedded within the
   wider IGO network. Indeed, we find that once we account for states'
   shared membership in clusters of IGOs, the simpler dyadic measure of
   shared IGO membership no longer shows evidence of a conflict-inhibiting
   effect.},

Abstract = {There has been much disagreement about the relationship between civil
   wars and state economic performance. While civil war is often associated
   with poor economic performance, some states have managed robust growth
   despite periods of domestic armed conflict. We find this disagreement
   results from not accounting for the spatial distribution of conflict
   within a country. A robust literature in economics stresses the role
   major cities play in economic growth. We hypothesize that the economic
   impact of civil conflict is contingent on the conflict's location
   relative to major urban centers within a state. We use subnational data
   on the location of conflict relative to urban areas to test the impact
   of domestic conflict on annual gross domestic product growth. In doing
   so, we bridge the economic development literature on the importance of
   cities with extant literature on the effect of armed conflict to provide
   a novel explanation for the paradox of high macroeconomic growth in
   conflict-ridden countries.},

Abstract = {Public administration scholars tend to take for granted that
   organizational adaptation is important. This common notion that public
   organizations must adapt to stay alive has not been put to the test in
   the field of public administration, however. Intriguingly, organization
   ecologists find that adaptation does not matter and might even be
   counterproductive for individual organizations. They argue that the
   absence of adaptationwhich they refer to as structural inertiaactually
   enhances the likelihood of survival. But organization ecologists focus
   mostly on nonpublic organizations. This prompts the question whether
   adaptation in public organizations really matters. In this article, we
   test these contrasting claims (while controlling for design features) on
   a population of U.S. federal independent public agencies (n=142). Our
   findings suggest a subtle narrative. We conclude that proactive
   adaptation increases termination hazards. But inertia does not seem to
   significantly enhance survival chances.},

Abstract = {Micro-states illustrate deep changes in the international system
   obscured by scholars' traditional focus on great powers. Logically, the
   nature and systemic effects of international anarchy should be most
   apparent in relation to the smallest and weakest states, and least
   apparent in relation to great powers. Focusing on micro-states suggests
   a permissive contemporary international system facilitating the
   proliferation and survival of states independent of their military and
   functional capacities. Micro-states' lack of great power allies
   illustrates the irrelevance of military threats under anarchy, while the
   presence of an international economic safety net attenuates problems of
   economic viability. The lack of association between smallness and
   delegating sovereignty questions functional explanations of hierarchy.
   Instead, varying micro-states strategies of a la carte hierarchy and
   selling sovereign prerogatives demonstrate that the current
   international system presents even its smallest and weakest members with
   choices rather than imperatives.},

Abstract = {The sexual exploitation and abuse (SEA) of civilians by international
   peacekeepers is a form of post-conflict violence that is pernicious and
   understudied, but far from inevitable. However, there are very few
   cross-mission analyses of the phenomenon. This article considers whether
   the socialization experiences of troops in two environments, the
   contributing state military and the peacekeeping mission itself, help to
   explain the observed variation in SEA. Drawing on a dataset of SEA
   allegations between 2007 and 2014, as well as the first publicly
   available data from the United Nations that identify the nationalities
   of alleged perpetrators, this article analyzes the layered nature of
   socialization through the lens of SEA. Specifically, this article
   presents evidence that SEA is positively associated with disciplinary
   breakdowns at the peacekeeping mission's lower levels of command, and
   argues that a peacekeeping mission may carry its own norms and
   socializing processes that either constrain or facilitate the emergence
   and endurance of SEA.},

Abstract = {In this article, I synthesize a number of recent studies exploring how
   exports affect human rights, highlighting a common implication that this
   relationship is conditional on how exports are associated with leaders'
   relative costs of repression and accommodation. Beginning with this
   synthesis, I develop a theory demonstrating how the composition of
   exports affects human rights via its impact on leader expectations. More
   diverse exports promote continued growth and prosperity, provide leaders
   with greater resources, and suggest conditions less conducive to severe
   dissent, all of which reduce the relative costs of accommodation.
   Repression is likely to threaten the benefits otherwise associated with
   greater export diversity; thus its relative cost increases amid greater
   export diversity. I test this theory using commodity-level data from the
   United Nations Comtrade database to create a country-year-level measure
   of export diversity. Statistical analyses spanning 1981 to 2009 support
   my expectation. My results are robust to sample restrictions and the use
   of instrumental variables.},

Title = {Integration against the state: Irregular migrants' agency between

Journal = {POLITICS},

Volume = {37},

Pages = {317-331},

Abstract = {Reducing the number of foreigners residing unlawfully within the borders
   of a state requires either their removal or the legalisation of their
   presence within the territory. Increasingly, governments also employ
   measures of internal control and limit irregular migrants' access to
   rights and services in order to encourage them to leave autonomously.
   This article aims to contribute to current debates on how to
   conceptualise and account for the agency that irregular migrants
   themselves exercise in such contexts. Within critical migration and
   citizenship studies, many of their everyday actions have been described
   as acts of citizenship' but also as instances of becoming
   imperceptible', neither of which captures the whole range of strategies
   irregular migrants employ to strengthen their fragile position vis-a-vis
   the state. I argue that conceptualising their agency in terms of
   (self-)integration allows us to account for both: practices through
   which they actively become political subjects as well as those that
   precisely constitute a deliberate refusal to do so. Empirically, this is
   underpinned by an analysis of recent policy developments in the United
   Kingdom and a series of semi-structured interviews I conducted during 8
   months of fieldwork in London with migrants experiencing different kinds
   and degrees of irregularity.},

Abstract = {European integration has notable impact on the territorial organization
   of Europe, especially after the adoption of the Treaty of Lisbon.
   Therefore, it became urgent to develop guidance and best practices in
   the fields of territorial cohesion, urban matters and spatial planning,
   including with regard to local governments. Despite complicated
   relations in a multi-level governance setting, or because of this
   setting, local governments are an integral part of the construction of
   an European territory. The paper argues that territorial cohesion and
   spatial planning goals will not be achieved without a complementary
   focus on local communities as the engines of growth. It aims to clarify
   issues relating the local communities' role in shaping and implementing
   European strategies and concludes with some recommendations on
   territorial perspectives and new goals and tools that should drive the
   European Union towards higher democratic integration.},

Abstract = {Local administration is a major actor, both stakeholder and beneficiary,
   in the cross-border cooperation actions. However, there are very few
   references in the literature investigating the opinion of public
   managers and employees involved in implementing cross border cooperation
   programs regarding the effectiveness of CBC projects. In this paper we
   address this issue, by reviewing the relevant literature and mostly by
   presenting the results of own survey-based researches conducted on
   field. This article captures the opinion of managers and staff regarding
   the transformations generated by involvement in cross-border actions in
   Bihor - Hajdu - Bihar Euroregion.},

Abstract = {The relationship between emphasis framing and public opinion has
   received considerable attention in political science, psychology, and
   mass communication studies. However, what moderating role perceived
   knowledge plays in influencing emphasis framing remains unsettled. We
   explore this relationship using a survey-experiment embedded within a
   large-N, nationally representative survey that allows us to test two
   specific hypotheses. First, we empirically test whether an emphasis
   frame influences policy support. Second, we test the moderating effect
   of perceived knowledge. We test the emphasis framing effects of the name
   given to a hot-button political issue, while controlling for other
   survey treatments. Furthermore, we evaluate the degree to which
   perceived knowledge of the issue moderates the relationship between the
   emphasis frame and support for hydraulic fracturing. We find support
   both for the role emphasis framing plays and for perceived knowledge as
   a moderator.},

Abstract = {The intention of this paper is to analyze the conditions of Mexican
   refugees in the U.S. due to drug trafficking violence, a sub-system of
   global capitalism based on demand and profit, which treats social costs
   as collateral effects. The normative problems with the Refugee Act and
   its Protocol are explained, as documents that fail to consider current
   needs and need to be revised. The increase in asylum requests made by
   Mexicans in the U.S. is analyzed together with the obstacles they face
   in the process. Finally, the paper argues that it is not enough to make
   legislation more flexible, since asylum and refuge are meant to involve
   isolated situations rather than large-scale movements of people, since
   destination countries are unable to deal with them.},

Abstract = {Direct democracy is often touted as a means of reining in the
   administrative state, but it could also hinder the performance of public
   organizations. In particular, we argue that bargaining dynamics between
   voters and government officials can lead to costly administrative
   disruptions. We explore this issue by estimating the impact of Ohio tax
   referenda on school district administration using a regression
   discontinuity approach. The results suggest that administrators in
   districts where referenda failed sought to insulate core functions from
   revenue declines. Nonetheless, referendum failure ( as opposed to
   passage) led to lower instructional spending, teacher attrition, and
   lower student achievement growth. Spending and performance generally
   rebounded within a few years, however, as districts eventually secured
   approval for a subsequent tax proposal. These results illustrate how
   involving citizens in decision-making can entail short-term transaction
   costs in the form of decreased administrative performance, which in this
   case may have had lasting achievement effects for students attending
   school in the wake of a referendum failure.},

Abstract = {The War on Drugs has had grave humanitarian consequences for Latin
   America. It has encouraged a highly militarized and ultimately
   unsuccessful approach to drug control, leading to violence,
   displacement, and human suffering throughout the region. In
   acknowledging and responding to this suffering, humanitarian
   organizations have recently begun to frame this situation as a
   humanitarian crisis to facilitate humanitarian entry into new spaces.
   There is a need for a conceptual conversation about the use of the label
   humanitarian crisis in reference to the human costs of the War on Drugs
   in Latin America, particularly its rhetorical and normative use by the
   media and civil society and its strategic and moral use by humanitarian
   actors.},

Abstract = {What should be the European Union's role in international politics? How
   should the EU deal with the challenges posed by instability, terrorism,
   radicalisation and conflict to the South and the East? Can the EU's
   commitment to democratisation, human rights and international law be
   upheld or does it require rethinking and reorientation? The European
   Council tasked the EU High Representative and Vice President of the
   European Commission, Federica Mogherini, to address these questions in a
   Global Strategy for the European Union's Foreign and Security Policy
   (EUGS). This article unpacks the EU's journey towards a comprehensive
   foreign and security strategy-the EUGS. It does so by comparing the
   elements and main messages of the 2003 the European Security Strategy,
   under the leadership of Javier Solana, EU High Representative at the
   time, with HRVP Mogherini's EU Global Strategy 13 years later, of which
   the author was the lead pen-holder.},

Abstract = {The Spanish local system rests on two pillars, municipalities and
   provinces. Lately, as a result of the economic crisis and the fiscal
   stress that afflicts most Spanish local governments they are forced to
   rely on inter-municipal cooperation and collaboration. This new local
   landscape challenges and raises concerns about accountability. Different
   theories confirm that working with greater transparency helps the
   effectiveness, efficiency and the control of corruption in the public
   sector and, in this context, municipalities in Spain have decided that
   transparency is a fertile ground that is essential to improve
   performance. This article, based on an analytical revision of the last
   research, attempts to prove that there has been substantial progress in
   this regard, although there is still a long road to achieving full open
   government.},

Abstract = {Moscow's annexation of Crimea and meddling in eastern Ukraine are the
   latest signs of Russia's increasingly assertive behavior in the
   post-Soviet space. Not surprisingly, Moscow's actions have become the
   source of much debate. This article maps the fast-growing literature on
   the subject and assesses four types of explanations: (1) decision-maker
   explanations focusing on Putin's personality traits and worldviews; (2)
   domestic political accounts emphasizing the Kremlin's efforts to deflect
   attention from internal failures; (3) ideational accounts explaining
   Russia's near abroad assertion with reference to its national identity
   and desire for international status; and (4) geopolitical accounts
   highlighting power and security considerations. The article shows that
   each approach offers some valuable insights but fails to provide a
   convincing stand-alone explanation. It is argued that to overcome the
   identified shortcomings, scholars need to devote more attention to
   building synthetic accounts. A theoretical model is outlined that
   specifies how geopolitical pressures, ideas, domestic political
   conditions, and decision-maker influences interact in shaping Russia's
   near abroad policy.},

Abstract = {This article analyses the effect of electoral systems, candidate
   selection methods and the interplay between them on individual
   legislative attitudes and behavioural norms, specifically on two facets
   of party unity: party agreement and party loyalty. Our main argument is
   that one must take into account the effect of inter- as well as
   intra-party competition, and the interaction between the two, in order
   to explain individual legislative attitudes and norms. Using data from
   34 European parties across 10 countries, we show that under exclusive
   candidate selection methods, there are large differences between
   proportional representation and single-member district electoral systems
   in their effect on party agreement and party loyalty. Under inclusive
   candidate selection methods, however, such differences are much less
   apparent. In other words, the candidate selection method conditions the
   influence of the electoral system on legislative attitudes and
   behavioural norms.},

Abstract = {Once regarded as an unstoppable giant and stalwart of the global
   economy, China today shows signs of economic and political fragility.
   The interrelated risks of an abrupt economic slowdown, a collapse of the
   financial system, and political instability in China are now apparent,
   warn international observers. In spite of these risks, or perhaps
   because of them, Chinese foreign policy is at its most assertive and
   activist in decades. A China that is bold, but brittle, presents
   significant new foreign policy challenges for European countries. To
   navigate these successfully, European states must develop a coherent and
   proactive strategy in recognition of both circumstances. This article
   discusses the state of recent international scholarship and controversy
   on China's domestic political economy and global engagement. The
   discussion relates a wave of recent attention to China's mounting
   domestic economic and political vulnerabilities and points to
   implications of these developments for China's ambitions to play a
   leading role in the international system beyond its immediate region.},

Abstract = {Promotion of Personal Autonomy and Care for People in Dependency
   Situation Act 39/2006, is one of the most significant advances in social
   policy in the Welfare State in recent decades in Spain. This legal
   standard, in line with all European countries in our environment, seeks
   to respond mainly to the new demands for long-term care as a result of
   the increase in life expectancy in the population.
   One of the most novel aspects incorporated by act is the subjective
   right of citizenship to receive care. In, this way, the role of the
   State in social protection is reinforced within a family model where
   families, especially women., have traditionally acted as care providers.
   Ten years after the adoption of the act, it is relevant in the analysis
   of the policies and public administration, to know the model of social
   protection of dependency that is being implemented nowadays. For that,
   we first approach aging of the population in advanced societies.
   Secondly, the most relevant theoretical contributions in relation to the
   configuration of the act and its overlap with social welfare regime in
   Spain. Then, the most important normative changes in the system of
   attention to dependency from the beginning of its application to the
   present time. Fourth, it is carry out an analysis of secondary data on
   act management. Finally, it is exposed what are the characteristics that
   identify the model of social protection of dependency in Spain.},

Abstract = {This article seeks to contribute to the understanding of the diffusion
   process of Conditional rash Transfer Programs (CCTs)in Latin Americctand
   the role of experts-reunited in an epistemic community-and International
   Organizations (IOs). CCTs hare been increasingly implemented worldwide
   in the last decades and, until 2010, 17 countries have adopted them in
   Latin America alone. The evidence suggests that this convergence is due
   to a policy diffusion process. After their implementation by regional
   pioneers-Brazil and Mexico-during the middle of the `90s the programs
   caught the attention of International Organizations like the World Bank
   and the Inter-American Development Bank, which in turn contributed to
   their dissemination. These organizations supplied loans and technical
   advice, and also, they developed diverse activities, networks, papers
   and reports which hare contributed to create a consensus on the
   efficiency of CCTs. Moreover, and taking an essential role, the
   existence of an epistemic community increased the available information
   on these programs and contributed to their legitimacy, playing a role in
   the domestic policy making process as well as in the adoption, of CCTs
   by more countries. This matter deserves further attention in order to
   better understand the influence of ideas which can produce convergence
   of policies, the role of the actors involved and the relationship
   between the domestic and international level during the policy making
   process.},

Journal = {PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION},

Volume = {95},

Pages = {498-511},

Abstract = {This article examines the relationship between a meta-governing role of
   government and processes of network formation, based on a study of a
   governance initiative for improvement of refugee `activation' services
   in Sweden. Meta-governance is centred on supporting the development of
   self-regulatory capacity within discretionary spaces of action and has,
   so far, primarily been associated with a specific type of
   interdependency-driven networks. This article focuses on an alternative
   scenario, where uncertainty under such governance arrangements, rather
   than interdependence, becomes the driver of network formation. The
   relevance of this `uncertainty approach' is demonstrated in the Swedish
   case, where meta-governance resulted in networks that were formed on the
   basis of identification rather than organizational complementarity, and
   contributed to increasing homogenization rather than local adaption of
   activation services. The result suggests that theories of
   meta-governance should include a more diversified understanding of
   network responses.},

Abstract = {This paper attempts to analyze the voting behavior of Turkey in the UN
   General Assembly between 2002 and 2014 in comparison with those of the
   Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa (BRICS) countries by using
   selected reference groups of India, Brazil, South Africa (IBSA), EU,
   permanent members of the UN Security Council (P5) and the Western group
   of P5 (USA, UK, France) with the help of a two layered methodology. In
   doing so, this paper, with a two-layered quantitative and qualitative
   methodological model, empirically tests Turkey's voting alignments and
   cohesion scores in the UN General Assembly to provide a comparative
   perspective on the degree of foreign policy cohesion among Turkey and
   its BRICS peers by comparing the group and pair-wise cohesion' results.
   Finally, this paper will qualitatively analyze and discuss Turkey's
   exceptional voting behaviors and alignments with both the Western group
   of P5 and the BRICS to understand the nature of the international issues
   leading to convergences or divisions between Turkey and the BRICS and to
   demonstrate Turkey's in-between and dual foreign policy role in
   international affairs.},

Abstract = {This article's main aim is to propose a novel model explaining the
   continuous domination of identity issues in modern Polish political
   discourse. The model proposed here may also appear useful as an
   explanation of similar tendencies in some other Central European
   countries. It is based on a specific reading of the modern history of
   the regionone relying on a structural perspective and specifically using
   Pierre Bourdieu's notion of a field of power. In conclusion, the article
   suggests that the perspective it proposes may challenge what it calls
   simplistic accounts of processes of long duration.},

Abstract = {This paper first examines two most significant structural shifts in
   China's marine fishery sector in the past decades, namely, expanding
   outward and going after high market value species. It then explains how
   domestic policies and development strategies have shaped the trajectory
   of China's marine fishery sector, and analyzes the obstacles rooted in
   both domestic socio-political settings and global governance that have
   impeded policy reform and effective enforcement in China to ensure
   marine sustainability and international cooperation. Lastly, the paper
   explores possible options for transnational advocacy actors that are
   concerned with the global impact of China's growing fisheries.},

Journal = {SOCIO-ECONOMIC REVIEW},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {15},
Number = {2},
Pages = {331-357},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {The article uses a case study of the American Manufacturing Extension
   Partnership to explore economic and industrial policy in the
   contemporary USA. Extensive quantitative and qualitative data are
   mobilized to show that: (a) the agency is pressured politically to limit
   its activities to `blunt' remedies for identifiable `market failures';
   even as (b) regional centers in fact often orient also, and sometimes
   instead, toward `coordination-oriented' policies to mitigate `network
   failures'; and (c) these latter generate better results, on average, for
   client manufacturers. The findings challenge neo-institutional claims
   that economic policies are most effective only when complementary to the
   dominant institutional coordinating capacities embedded in the existing
   American political economy, or when they have the exceptional support of
   the American security establishment. They are, however, consistent with
   an alternative neo-Polanyian approach that explains when and how
   street-level policymakers dispersed across American federalism sometimes
   sidestep the ideological hegemony of `market fundamentalism'.},

Abstract = {This study examined the relationship between group identification and
   political action in Indonesia. We made four contributions to the
   literature. First, we studied political action on behalf of religious
   groups and examined the role of religious identification alone and in
   combination with national identification. Second, we analyzed political
   action in a non-Western country where social cleavages occur primarily
   along religious lines and where a conflict and nonconflict region can be
   studied. Third, we compared Muslims and Christians, whose majority and
   minority status varies across the two regions, and fourth, we
   investigated both normative and nonnormative forms of political action
   (protest and violence). In line with the dual-identification model of
   politicization, we found that religious identification increased support
   for protest (but not violence) in the conflict region only and
   particularly among high national identifiers. In the nonconflict region,
   religious identification was not related to violence, and it was related
   to lower support for protest among high national identifiers. The
   patterns were largely similar for Muslims and Christians, but some
   differences were found depending on the majority-minority status. We
   conclude that particularities of the intergroup context should be taken
   into consideration when studying politicization.},

Abstract = {A good agricultural policy can reduce the risk of agricultural
   management. In the past, the traditional statistical methods were always
   used for assisting agricultural management. However, the assumptions of
   traditional methods might not fit for real life data, that would affect
   the decision of agricultural management. For this reason, this paper
   uses big data analysis to propose a novel prediction model without any
   assumption to forecast agricultural output for reducing the risk.
   According to the result, the proposed model is better than the existing
   models in terms of prediction accuracy. Accordingly, the proposed model
   can be suggested for reducing the risk of agricultural management of
   government.},

Abstract = {This study empirically examines relationships between conceptions of
   political corruption, perceived levels of corruption, and political
   participation among members of the public. Based on a field study of 298
   Israelis, we show that the effects of perceived levels of corruption on
   participation are significantly influenced by how citizens conceptualize
   corruption. The public's conceptions of corruption influence whether and
   how they will participate. The findings provide strong evidence that
   while the perceived extent of political corruption is a powerful
   determinant of participation, the public's conception of corruption must
   not be overlooked. Rather, both factors should be considered as
   important indicators of participation.},

Abstract = {While emotions are widely regarded as integral to the ``behavioral
   approach{''} to International Relations (IR), a host of fundamental
   problems have delayed the integration of affective influences into
   traditional models of IR. We aim to integrate affect by focusing on
   commitment problems, a body of work that contains strong theoretical
   predictions about how individual decision makers will and should act.
   Across two lab experiments, we use a novel experimental protocol that
   includes a psychophysiological measure of emotional arousal (skin
   conductance reactivity) to study how individuals react to changes in
   bargaining power. While we find support for one key pillar of IR
   theory-individuals do reject offers when they expect the opponent's
   power to increase-we also find that physiological arousal tampers with
   individuals' ability to think strategically in the manner predicted by
   canonical models. Our followup experiment mimics the elements of
   institutional solutions to commitment problems and finds support for
   their efficacy on the individual level. Our novel findings suggest that
   when individuals face large power shifts, emotional arousal
   short-circuits their ability to ``think forward and induct
   backwards,{''} suggesting that emotionally aroused individuals are less
   prone to commitment problems.},

Abstract = {Countries interested in the promotion of political development often
   provide aid in the form of democracy assistance. However, some regimes
   resist these attempts to promote democracy, introducing repressive
   measures to counteract their effectiveness. Hence, democracy assistance
   sometimes has the unintended consequence of curtailing democracy. This
   article explains how the size of the targeted regime's military
   determines the effectiveness of democracy assistance and why it can
   sometimes result in lower levels of political freedom. Large militaries,
   often holding a privileged position in authoritarian regimes, will be
   threatened by political liberalization and its associated redistribution
   of resources. They will thus work with the regime to limit the effect of
   democracy assistance, while their size makes this repression more
   feasible. In states with smaller militaries, regimes have less incentive
   and capacity for repression, and democracy assistance is more successful
   at empowering democratic opposition. Cross-national statistical analysis
   of the United States Agency for International Development democracy
   assistance supports the argument.},

Abstract = {This article analyses European strategy towards Russia during the
   Ukraine crisis between February 2014 and December 2015, conceptualising
   it as a coercive diplomatic strategy and analysing the relationship
   between its ends, ways and means. European strategy sought to reverse
   Russian intervention. However, this overarching aim was flanked by two
   `constraining' aims of avoiding an escalation of the conflict and a
   breakdown of relations with Russia. The strategy shifted between these
   aims, which proved to be irreconcilable: while the EU partly succeeded
   in containing the conflict, it failed to reverse Russian intervention
   and relations between the EU and Russia deteriorated sharply.},

Title = {Structuring composite local governance indicators},
Journal = {POLICY STUDIES},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {38},
Number = {2},
Pages = {109-129},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {The importance of good governance is praised by many academics and
   practitioners. The prominence of the subject suggests that measurement
   is important. However, setting out to measure the quality of governance
   empirically is controversial. Doubts regarding the feasibility and
   meaningfulness of this undertaking are widespread in the literature.
   Recognizing the potential caveats, the current article discusses a set
   of guidelines for structuring a theoretically sound local governance
   assessment tool based on the Decision Analysis and Operational Research
   literatures. The authors argue that using a multi-criteria model which
   employs several objective (quantitative and qualitative) indicators and
   relies on a participatory method to aggregate them is a suitable way of
   developing sensible Local Governance Indicators. The purpose here is to
   provide a detailed roadmap for any country (or region, or locality)
   willing to engage in the assessment of the quality of local governance.
   The real-world implementation of a model developed according to these
   guidelines could help raise awareness, promote good practices and
   increase the governance literacy' of citizens. By operationalizing good
   governance, analysts may also be able to further investigate the
   relationships between local governance practices and several
   socio-economic factors.},

Title = {The concept of violence in international theory: a Double-Intent Account},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL THEORY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {9},
Number = {1},
Pages = {67-100},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {The ability of international ethics and political theory to establish a
   genuinely critical standpoint from which to evaluate uses of armed force
   has been challenged by various lines of argument. On one, theorists
   question the narrow conception of violence on which analysis relies.
   Were they right, it would overturn two key assumptions: first, that
   violence is sufficiently distinctive to merit attention as a category
   separate from other modes of human harming; second, that it is troubling
   in a special way that makes acts of violence peculiarly hard to justify.
   This paper defends a narrow understanding of violence and a special
   ethics governing its use by arguing that a distinctive form of `Violent
   Agency' is the factor uniting the category while partly accounting for
   the fearful connotations of the term. Violent Agency is defined first by
   a double intention (1) to inflict harm using a technique chosen (2) to
   eliminate or evade the target's means of escaping it or defending
   against it. Second, the harms it aims at are destructive (as opposed to
   appropriative). The analysis offered connects the concept of violence to
   themes in international theory such as vulnerability, security, and
   domination, as well as the ethics of war.},

Abstract = {The level of female representation has been found to lead to lower
   military spending and a lower level of state aggression. However, I
   argue that previous work has largely overlooked the impact of the
   international system on these three domestic characteristics.
   Specifically, the presence of an external threat from an interstate
   rival increases military spending, increases state aggression, and
   lowers female representation. Tests of this theory on democratic states
   from the years 1981 to 2007 find that the level of female representation
   decreases in states involved in an interstate rivalry and has a greater
   effect on female representation than factors routinely found to
   influence female representation. This article brings the international
   system into the discussion of factors that influence female
   representation while adding to previous literature on how the
   international system influences domestic politics.},

Abstract = {Decades of research on red tape have still to provide final answers as
   to whether red tape reduces performance. This may be due to not
   distinguishing the different dimensions that public service performance
   consists of. Shifting the focus to rules and their characteristics, this
   study analyses how the degree of compliance burden and lack of
   functionality of rules relates to overall and dimensional public
   performance. Building upon the argument that red tape reduces resources
   and motivation and by doing so influences performance, hypotheses are
   put forward regarding the relationship to performance. Using red tape
   reports from employees in 49 work units and performance rated by the
   supervisor, this study shows that performance is at its lowest when the
   rules have a high compliance burden and lack functionality. Moreover,
   the dimensional analyses show that compliance burden may be most
   detrimental for output, whereas lack of functionality reduces
   responsiveness and democratic outcomes.},

Abstract = {In recent years, students of world politics have been shaken to the core
   by the ascent of post-truth politics, which is a particular style of
   doing politics' by politicians and pundits - a style that strategically
   relies on misrepresentations at best, and at worst, lies. The so-called
   post-truth world has had consequences beyond those who are in the
   business of doing politics. The pervasiveness of presumed causal
   linkages between environmental degradation, violent conflict and human
   mobility has been utilized by policy makers and pundits to shape public
   opinion about the predicament of the Syrian refugees, the human tragedy
   of this decade in the Northern hemisphere. On the one hand, scholarly
   research shows that the relationship between environmental degradation,
   violent conflict and irregular mobility is far too complex to be
   understood in terms of causal linkages. On the other hand, in a
   post-truth world, it is politicians and pundits who repeat falsehoods
   that have shaped public opinion about the Syrian refugees. It is in the
   spirit of engaging with post-truth politics as such that I present what
   follows as a primer: how not to think about human mobility and the
   global environment.},

Abstract = {The latest wave of regional organizations may pose a more serious risk
   of fragmentation in global governance than earlier regional initiatives.
   Although these new organizations offer additional resources for global
   ends, the benefits of specialization, and innovation that could improve
   global governance, they also risk uncoordinated fragmentation,
   competition that undermines global norms, and a neglect of important
   global policy aims. Reinforcing global institutions, building consensus
   on global purposes and a global-regional division of labor, and
   establishing informal and formal organizational links between regional
   and global institutions can offset risks and expand the benefits of the
   new regionalism.},

Abstract = {Drawing upon the theories of social skill and strategic action fields
   (SAFs), this article presents a SAF Framework for Implementation
   Research. In the framework, policy implementation systems are
   conceptualized as multilevel SAFs that form around a public service
   intervention. Within this context, socially skilled actors leverage
   diverse sources of authorityincluding but not limited to political
   authorityto enable change or stability to a public service intervention.
   While the framework has underpinnings in field theory, it is able to
   encompass multiple theoretical perspectives, including complexity
   theories, organizational theories, economic theories, and theories of
   human behavior. Importantly, the SAF Framework allows for the
   integration of results relevant to both management and policychange in
   implementation systems, and change in the behavior or conditions of an
   external target group.},

Abstract = {In this article, I suggest to view children's rights implementation as a
   multi-level governance process. I argue a multi-level framework usefully
   integrates earlier work on norm compliance from International Relations
   (IR) scholarship and on norm vernacularization brought forward in
   Anthropology. Governance concepts move a step forward because they
   horizontally and vertically broaden the state-centric IR literature.
   After developing this multi-level analytical framework, I introduce an
   in-depth case study on children's rights implementation in Bangladesh.
   This case demonstrates that, particularly in weak states where
   capacities are lacking, multi-level activities are relevant for
   transporting global norms to the societal local rights-holders.},

Abstract = {This chapter examines the demographic characteristics of the Lake Tana
   basin through document analysis techniques. It uses demographic
   indicators such as age-sex ratio, dependency ratio, population
   distribution, population density and population growth rate to provide a
   demographic profile at the watershed level. The study also looks at the
   changes in the indicators over time to establish patterns and trends.
   The analysis shows that the age group ranging from 0 to 14 years old is
   the largest population category. As the result the dependency ratio of
   the population in the watershed is very high. In addition the number of
   women in the reproductive age group is also very high which predicts
   even higher the potential growth of population in the watershed. If
   uncontrolled this future population growth will lead to greatly
   unbalanced relationships between resources and population in the
   watershed.},

Journal = {EAST EUROPEAN POLITICS},

Volume = {33},

Pages = {36-55},
Abstract = {Concludingan Association Agreement (AA) has been a major incentive of EU
   conditionality towards Ukraine and most other Eastern Partnership
   countries. Contrary to what was intended and expected, Ukrainian
   government under the presidency of Viktor Yanukovych refused to conclude
   the AA and, in the course of the subsequent countrywide mass uprising,
   turned into a more authoritarian version of itself. To explore EU
   performance, in this case, the article analyses EU conditionality
   towards Ukraine in 2010-2014. If conditionality is conceptualised as
   intergovernmental bargaining, then EU policy failed because the
   conditions were not met by Yanukovych. However, if conditionality is
   conceptualised as a tool of societal mobilisation and differential
   empowerment of domestic actors, then EU policy succeeded because the
   desired outcome was achieved, albeit through an unexpected course of
   events. This second face of conditionality is essential to understanding
   EU performance and anticipating effects of EU policies in the
   neighbourhood.},

   Elucidating the Use of Mass Rape during the Bosnian War},
Journal = {ETHNOPOLITICS},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {16},
Number = {4},
Pages = {388-410},
Abstract = {The widespread and persistent use of rape and sexual violence in armed
   conflict inevitably raises a fundamental question which numerous
   scholars have hitherto sought to answer: Why do men (and some women)
   rape in war? Many existing causal theories operate at high levels of
   abstraction, due to their emphasis on macro structural factors. This
   article, in contrast, approaches the issue of causation from a different
   angle and poses a more specific question: how can the widespread use of
   mass rape and sexual violence during the 1992-1995 Bosnian war be
   explained? Based on 79 interviews conducted in Bosnia-Hercegovina
   between 2014 and 2015 with male and female survivors of these crimes,
   this research uses the interviewees' stories to identify and analyse
   prominent causal factors. It focuses on five factors in particular,
   namely revenge (personal, mirroring and event-triggered), humiliation,
   opportunism, group dynamics and entitlement. These factors are in no way
   unique to the Bosnian war. What makes this research novel, however, is
   that it explores the functionality and role of these causal factors
   within the specific micro context and conflict dynamics of the Bosnian
   war. It thus combines the macro and micro to create a new `fusion'
   analysis of causation.},

Abstract = {Daesh fighters have taken hostage over 100 foreigners in Syria, Iraq,
   and elsewhere since 2012. The kidnappings drew international attention
   in August 2014, when American journalist James Foley was decapitated and
   a video of his death was posted online. But the pattern of kidnappings
   and gruesome videos distributed by violent Salafi-jihadists extends back
   over a decade to the killing of Daniel Pearl in 2002. This article
   traces shifts in the strategic rationale of Al Qaeda and Daesh for
   beheading Western hostages. It argues that terrorists altered their
   calculations on foreign hostages beginning in 2012 and U.S.
   counterterrorism policy does not take these shifts into account.},

   Lord's Resistance Army},
Journal = {PEACEBUILDING},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {5},
Number = {2, SI},
Pages = {136-152},
Abstract = {Recent years have seen a dramatic escalation in the levels and intensity
   of violence associated with the northern Nigerian Islamist group,
   commonly referred to as `Boko Haram'. The deliberate and brutal
   targeting of civilians has been an increasingly pronounced feature of
   this conflict, contributing to acute civilian vulnerability. Often
   ascribed to the specific ideological and ethno-religious configuration
   of Boko Haram, we argue that this violence is similar to that of the
   Lord's Resistance Army (LRA), tactically and in the evolution of both
   groups over time. In addition, violence inflicted on civilians by both
   groups has necessitated complex strategies of civilian navigation of
   insecurity risks, including the establishment of informal local security
   providers. Drawing on both quantitative conflict event data, and
   qualitative sources, we present a comparative analysis of Boko Haram and
   the LRA to demonstrate the importance of common strategies of group
   mobilisation, evolution in rhetoric and tactics, and armed state and
   non-state responses to insurgency, in driving violence against civilians
   in particular. The findings reflect the importance of shared local and
   historical conditions in producing violence; and placing civilian
   protection, and the multifaceted ways in which it is undermined,
   including by state responses, at the centre of peacebuilding theory and
   practice.},

Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL POLITICS},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {26},
Number = {5},
Pages = {870-892},
Abstract = {Policy forums are lightly institutionalized and stable forms of
   governance networks that include administrative authorities, interest
   groups, and scientists. They are said to produce different types of
   outputs, from simple actor coordination to position papers and
   implementation documents, but their productivity has also been
   questioned. Metagovernance strategies can improve the capability of
   policy forums to produce outputs. To determine how different
   metagovernance strategies influence the capability of forums to produce
   joint position papers, 29 policy forums in the Swiss environmental
   sector are compared through a qualitative comparative analysis. Results
   indicate that metagovernance strategies such as state actors as forum
   members or majority decision rules need to be combined with small forum
   size or low actor heterogeneity. Furthermore, forum foundation by the
   state complicates the production of position papers.},

Abstract = {Belligerent nonstate actors including terrorist organizations often
   exploit illicit economies to fund their activities. In Colombia numerous
   belligerent groups are involved in illegal narcotics markets. For more
   than 20 years, the Colombian government has responded with targeted
   eradication of illicit crops, intending to undermine the groups' sources
   of revenue while simultaneously disrupting the illicit drug economy.
   Despite its duration, this policy's effect on guerrilla violence remains
   unclear. Examining the potential for violent backlash to these tactics,
   this research note assesses the impact of aerial coca crop eradication
   in Colombia from 2004-2005 on domestic Colombian guerrilla kidnappings,
   assassinations, and terrorism.},

Volume = {15},

Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {What do markets see when they look at people? Information dragnets
   increasingly yield huge quantities of individual-level data, which are
   analyzed to sort and slot people into categories of taste, riskiness or
   worth. These tools deepen the reach of the market and define new
   strategies of profit-making. We present a new theoretical framework for
   understanding their development. We argue that (a) modern organizations
   follow an institutional data imperative to collect as much data as
   possible; (b) as a result of the analysis and use of this data,
   individuals accrue a form of capital flowing from their positions as
   measured by various digital scoring and ranking methods; and (c) the
   facticity of these scoring methods makes them organizational devices
   with potentially stratifying effects. They offer firms new opportunities
   to structure and price offerings to consumers. For individuals, they
   create classification situations that identify shared life-chances in
   product and service markets. We discuss the implications of these
   processes and argue that they tend toward a new economy of moral
   judgment, where outcomes are experienced as morally deserved positions
   based on prior good actions and good tastes, as measured and classified
   by this new infrastructure of data collection and analysis.},

   from renewable resource shocks to conflict. In this article, we seek to
   advance the literature by drawing out the implications of a well-known
   formal model of the renewable resources-conflict relationship and then
   conducting rigorous statistical tests of its implications in the case of
   a serious ongoing civil conflict in India. We find that a one standard
   deviation decrease in our measure of renewable resources increases
   killings by nearly 60 percent over the long run.},

Abstract = {This article explores how the protection of civilians is being
   militarized by African policymakers and diplomats. I draw on practice
   approaches to analyze what social groups are doing when they claim to
   ``protect civilians.{''} I show how innovative protection mechanisms can
   be seen as a function of officials and diplomats coping with the
   changing circumstances of increasingly militarized politics in Africa.
   Specifically, accountability mechanisms for unintended and intended
   civilian harm by African security operations have originated in
   connection with this development. I argue that these are results of
   anchoring practices, which means that everyday informal interactions in
   one context become linked to another context. I argue that these
   emerging accountability mechanisms represent a new combination of
   practices, with the potential of changing the routine activities and
   mutual learning between policymakers and diplomats.},

Series = {AESS Interdisciplinary Environmental Studies and Sciences Series},

Abstract = {Water is at the forefront of the economic agenda of Ethiopian government
   and Tana basin has been identified as a major economic corridor because
   of the basin's immense water resource potential for socioeconomic
   development. For effective and sustainable utilization of water
   resources in the basin, it is essential to assess the water quality in
   spatial and temporal dimensions. Nonetheless, scientific information on
   Ethiopian water bodies is rare and the available ones are of expeditious
   origin. In Tana basin, there is no detailed and systematic
   characterization of water quality based on long term and spatially
   representative data, due to the absence of a sustainable monitoring
   program. Despite the fact that data and studies are fragmentary, the
   available information on Lake Tana indicates that the trophic status of
   the lake has gradually changed to mesotrophic and eutrophic in some
   places due to nutrient loads. Sedimentation is a threat to Lake Tana.
   Fecal pollution and toxigenic cyanobacteria are detected in the lake
   especially in the shores and river mouths. Although the current dataset
   on water and Lake bottom sediment characteristics and quality impacts is
   spatially and temporally limited, the available information indicates
   occurrence of potential anthropogenic pollution mainly on river mouths
   and shore areas. Impairment of water quality has been going on for
   years, which has significantly affected the basin's potential for
   agriculture, industry, hydroelectric, ecosystem, water supply and
   recreation sectors. Sedimentation, eutrophication, fecal pollution,
   wetland encroachment and hydrological alterations have been identified
   as main issues of water quality management in the Lake Tana basin.
   Efficient monitoring programs based on a practical selection of robust
   water quality indicators are recommended for the basin.},

   killing},
Journal = {CONTEMPORARY SECURITY POLICY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {38},
Number = {2, SI},
Pages = {212-236},
Abstract = {The use of drones to kill suspected militants seems to provide a simple
   technical fix to a complex ethico-political problem: the need to
   discriminate between combatants and noncombatants. The technological
   ability of drones, combined with the rhetorical commitment to reducing
   civilian casualties, suggests that the principle of noncombatant
   immunity is firmly entrenched in debates about targeted killings.
   However, this article will argue that a peculiar effect of this enhanced
   technological capability has been to draw attention to the conceptual
   confusion that surrounds the distinction. Rather than assuming that it
   is a fixed feature of international law, I will argue that it should be
   viewed as a discursive formation that is contingent upon a precarious
   process of repetition and reiteration. Moreover, I will show how the
   laws designed to restrain the violence inflicted on civilian bodies have
   been invoked to render certain civilians vulnerable, constituting them
   as killable, their lives profoundly losable.},

Abstract = {This study aims to advance understanding of the distinctive areas of
   competence for central and local governments. In doing so, we focus on
   the relative impacts of two accountability mechanisms-elections and
   management approaches-on the bureaucratic attitudes and behaviors
   exhibited within central and local governments. We posit that elections
   have dominant impacts in local governments, whereas management systems
   play a relatively larger role in the central government. Due to this
   difference, the central government may be better placed than local
   governments to administer those public service activities that either
   have outputs unobservable to the citizenry or require a lead time that
   is longer than the time between elections. This study investigates this
   argument empirically by taking advantage of a unique quasi-experiment in
   South Korea in which responsibility for administration of local water
   supply services changed from local governments to a central government
   agency. Investigating 7 years' worth of quarterly data, we find that
   following the change in governance, citizen satisfaction deteriorated
   but efficiency improved.},

Abstract = {This paper examines how learning has been treated, generally, in policy
   network theories and what questions have been posed, and answered, about
   this phenomenon to date. We examine to what extent network
   characteristics and especially the presence of various types of brokers
   impede or facilitate policy learning. Next, a case study of the policy
   network surrounding the sustainability of palm oil biodiesel in
   Indonesia over the past two decades is presented using social network
   analysis. This case study focuses on sustainability-oriented policy
   learning in the Indonesian biodiesel governance network and illustrates
   how network features and especially forms of brokerage influence
   learning.},

Abstract = {This article explores a contradiction at the heart of the environmental
   security-development nexus by bringing conceptual and political logics
   of environmental security into critical dialogue with vernaculars of
   security and insecurity in the `margins' of rural southwestern
   Madagascar. The analysis presented here highlights important ways in
   which state-society relations are transformed as development intersects
   with historical patterns of resource access and alienation, and legacies
   of disenfranchisement and violence. Analyses of secondary literature,
   national policy and results of ethnographic research conducted in
   southwestern Madagascar since 2007 reveal a stark disjuncture between
   dominant logics of environmental security that guide exclusionary
   conservation and resource developments and situated understandings and
   experiences on the ground. Understanding contemporary resource conflicts
   and building peace requires a broadening of the notion of conflict,
   methodological deepening as well as a shift in institutional cultures to
   expand types of knowledge and actors' perspectives that are privileged
   and legitimised in both scholarship and policy-making.},

Journal = {CONTEMPORARY SECURITY POLICY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {38},
Number = {2, SI},
Pages = {307-319},
Abstract = {As new technologies make possible new modes of war, they cause tension
   in the previously prevailing conceptual categories. This is evident, as
   the practice of targeted killing by governments has increased in
   frequency and prominence, largely due to the American use of armed
   drones around the world. The essays in this special issue explore how
   norms, rules, and laws that many people thought were settled have been
   roiled by new technologies of targeted killing. This includes rules on
   sovereignty, territory, due process, and the distinction between
   civilian and combatant. The essays sketch an implicit research program
   around the recursive relation between rules and practice. I draw these
   out into a more general model for scholarship at the boundaries between
   law and politics and between concepts and practices.},

Title = {How and why Millennials are initiating conflict in vertical dyads and
   what they are learning A two-stage study},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONFLICT MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {28},
Number = {5},
Pages = {644-670},
Abstract = {Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to contribute to extant conflict
   management theory by presenting evidence from a two-stage study of
   conflict initiated by pre-graduation Millennials in entry-level work
   environments. Design/methodology/approach - The paper presents an
   inductively derived conceptual model, hypotheses and measurement scales
   grounded in Millennials' voices. Then, based on survey data, the scales
   are tested for structural coherence, and hypotheses are validated using
   structural equation modeling methodology.
   Findings - Most Millennials initiate conflict with older coworkers and
   supervisors in the workplace because of the hurt they feel over the
   unfairness they experience. While confronting their superiors, they take
   an aggressive stand ({''}you are wrong, you should change{''}) and learn
   that the organization is duplicitous and that they should initiate
   conflict with superiors in the future to protect against unfairness in a
   duplicitous organization.
   Research limitations/implications - The findings and implications
   reflect the perspectives of Millennials who initiated conflict with
   superiors or more experienced coworkers in entry level workplaces.
   Reports of multiple perspectives and from other contexts are left to
   future research.
   Practical implications - Millennials may well enter the workforce with
   attitudes and behaviors older coworkers and supervisors find aberrant.
   However, the interactions between Millennials, older generations and the
   socio-technical environment of entry-level workplaces lie at the root of
   the conflict Millennials initiate. Older generations may have implicitly
   produced - albeit to varying extents - opaque environments in which
   entry-level Millennials feel manipulated.
   Originality/value - The study reports a relatively rare two-stage study
   that begins with exploration and discovery using qualitative data, and
   concludes with hypotheses tests based on survey data. A new context is
   explored; i.e. Millennials initiating conflict in vertical dyads. New
   concerns about the veracity of the entry-level work environment are
   raised.},

Abstract = {Modern governments are increasingly faced with problems of policy
   coordination. However, coordination does not come naturally to
   organizations as it demands overcoming institutionalized working modes.
   Thus, countries have to find ways to tackle these problems to ensure
   efficient provision of public services. This contribution focuses on a
   specific and complex case, namely policy coordination for higher
   education policy in federal systems. The main research interest is to
   analyse the way in which coordination bodies responsible for higher
   education policy in two federal countries, Canada and Germany, organize
   their activities. Through this the study contributes to the
   understanding of the relevance of policy coordination in multi-level and
   multi-actor policy-making environments as well as the particular
   institutions that are dedicated to this task. Both coordination bodies
   are found to have many commonalities. However, the persisting
   differences, which can be traced to constitutional surroundings, also
   stress the importance of local conditions.},

Title = {Policy failures, policy learning and institutional change: the case of

Volume = {45},

Pages = {87-101},

Abstract = {This article presents an institutionalist perspective on the
   relationship between policy failure and policy learning. It contributes
   both to our understanding of different patterns institutional change as
   well as the conditions for policy learning at the system-wide level.The
   first section elaborates the concept of policy failure in terms of type,
   value and timing. Next, how policy failure may trigger a process of
   deinstitutionalisation and in turn create conditions for subsequent

Title = {Recovering from statelessness: Resettled Bhutanese-Nepali and Karen
   refugees reflect on the lack of legal nationality},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF HUMAN RIGHTS},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {16},
Number = {4},
Pages = {389-406},
Abstract = {The very notion of international human rights relies on state
   governments to serve as the legal duty bearers for protecting rights,
   yet governments are often responsible for creating the conditions that
   necessitate mass displacement. For some refugees, the lack of legal
   nationality creates an added dimension of vulnerability that exacerbates
   suffering. In order to illustrate the human rights challenges inherent
   to statelessness, this article focuses on the lived experiences of 30
   formerly stateless refugees who have been resettled to the United
   States. Qualitative research interviews with 15 Bhutanese-Nepalis and 15
   members of the Karen ethnic minority (from Burma and Thailand), all
   currently resettled in the United States, provide insights into the
   everyday realities of stateless individuals. In both cases,
   statelessness represented a human rights violation in itself as well as
   a contributing factor for further abuses related to recognition and
   membership, denied education, and serious impediments to employment and
   livelihoods.},

   others. Conventional attack methods are by their nature easier to plan
   and prepare for whilst innovative methods may take those responsible for
   security and counterterrorism by surprise and, as such, may have more
   impact and more serious consequences. The present study aimed to develop
   understanding of how, when, and why adversary groups might decide to use
   conventional attack methods or opt to do something innovative instead. A
   literature review was conducted and findings were applied to develop a
   thorough understanding of the decision-making process that underlies an
   adversary group's choice of attack method. Identified are three stages
   preceding the execution of an attack: a) strategic direction; b)
   incubation; and c) planning and preparation, plus overarching and
   contextual factors that can influence the process at each stage. It is
   suggested that it is these factors and how they influence
   decision-making that result in innovative methods being used to execute
   an attack, or convention prevailing. Findings can aid practitioners and
   policy-makers in counterterrorism, security, and law enforcement, to
   support their understanding, evaluation, and countering of current and
   future threats.},

Year = {2017},
Volume = {38},
Number = {1},

Abstract = {Comments that Donald Trump made while campaigning to be U.S. president
   have raised concerns that his administration will pull back from U.S.
   alliance commitments and encourage countries such as Japan and South
   Korea to acquire nuclear arms. The new article by Fruhling and O'Neil
   outlines an institutional framework that can be helpful in assessing the
   risks that Trump administration policies will lead to nuclear
   proliferation. An institutional perspective shows that important
   elements of U.S. security assurances will continue to function, and this
   reduces the chances that President Trump's actions or statements will
   trigger proliferation by U.S. allies. The greatest risk to global
   non-proliferation efforts posed by a Trump administration in fact lies
   elsewhere, in the possibility that President Trump will seek to abrogate
   the Iran nuclear deal.},

Journal = {EAST EUROPEAN POLITICS},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {33},
Number = {4},
Pages = {450-471},
Abstract = {Authoritarian governments remain in power much longer when they
   distribute benefits to their supporters in an institutionalised way.
   Permitting parliament to fulfil a legislative function is an important
   strategy for autocrats to obtain long-lasting support from their allies.
   Political parties play an important role in this process - while having
   strong influence on the behaviour of MPs, empirical evidence from the
   Russian State Duma suggests that loyalty is rewarded with support for
   the legislative proposals of individual members. Amendments to
   government bills are high in quantity and often substantially
   significant. Legislative performance is, however, mostly limited to the
   United Russia party.},

Abstract = {As the United Kingdom has placed some of its Prevent strategy on a
   statutory footing and is proposing to introduce a Counter-Extremism
   Bill, this article argues that a legal definition of extremism must be
   carefully drafted to provide legal certainty. The main recommendation is
   that all forms of violent and nonviolent extremism comes under the
   definition, ensuring it is differentiated from activism. Activism may
   hold radical views counter to the mainstream opinion, but it is required
   in liberal democracies as it encourages healthy debate and can prevent
   the policing of thought in any government strategy or legislation.},

Abstract = {A Capability Approach is adopted to critically analyse, in the interests
   of Climate Justice, whether the Paris Agreement is likely to adequately
   protect human and non-human Capabilities from the worst impacts of
   climate disasters. The mitigation, adaptation, and loss and damage
   provisions of the Paris Agreement are not convincing. Adaptation offers
   only a modest response to climate change, compared with mitigation, and
   current financial commitments to fund adaptation in developing countries
   are far too low. Consequently, the Parties to the United Nations
   Framework Convention on Climate Change have a long way to go in their
   negotiations before they have any hope of meeting their agreed
   temperature goals, and protecting human and non-human Capabilities from
   climate disasters.},

Abstract = {This chapter starts by explaining why a theoretically informed inquiry
   is needed. Such an inquiry is warranted for a number of reasons that
   include political volatility, lack of relevant precedents and the fact
   that conventional approaches do not lead to many policy suggestions for
   solving the hard cases at hand. It is suggested that Brexit may place us
   before a constitutional dilemma: Can Article 50 be taken seriously
   without giving up rights? The functionalist theory that this study
   adopts is outlined and explained. Three ways in which it applies to
   Brexit are distinguished. These three directions of inquiry are
   developed in the rest of the book.},

Pages = {186-202},
Abstract = {Despite the end of the civil war in 2005, many people in South Sudan
   continued to experience a deep sense of insecurity due to the many
   different types of violent conflict in the country. This sense of
   insecurity is exacerbated by the lack of protection from the state and
   the perceived injustice in how power is distributed at the national
   level. Based on a study carried out in 2013, prior to the country's
   relapse into large-scale violence, this article discusses gendered
   insecurity and agency among the Latuko in Imatong state. In response to
   their sense of insecurity, the Latuko have developed security
   arrangements that represent forms of hybrid security governance. Using a
   notion of masculinity, the article will reflect on the gender dynamics
   in these local security arrangements. This shows that the social order
   that customary institutions create can contribute to an increase in
   violence against women at the domestic level. However, although women
   are excluded from the decision-making institutions that govern the
   security arrangements, they exercise subtle forms of agency to influence
   them.},

   European border control},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF EUROPEAN INTEGRATION},

Volume = {39},
Number = {6},
Pages = {689-706},
Abstract = {Scholars have highlighted the importance of Frontex risk analysis in the
   institutionalisation of EU-level border control without, however,
   sufficiently substantiating alleged harmonisation dynamics. This paper
   interrogates how and why EU-level actors seek to exploit risk analysis
   to harmonise European border control. An interpretive policy analysis of
   three contemporary applications of Frontex risk analysis the Eurosur
   impact level assessment, the Schengen evaluation and monitoring
   mechanism and resource allocation in the Internal Security Fund -
   indicates that Frontex and the Commission found their harmonisation
   hopes on the rationalisation promises of risk-based governance -
   efficiency, effectiveness, and transparency gains and de-politicisation
   effects. This multi-functional rationalisation of Community
   decision-making is meant to justify increased EU-level coordination and
   interventions without challenging member state competencies, thereby
   enabling soft harmonisation processes in the weakly integrated and much
   contested domain. Rather than merely adhering to securitisation goals,
   risk analysis represents a magic bullet in the EU's own institutional
   risk management.},

Abstract = {How do high levels of ministerial turnover affect the strength of
   ministers and bureaucrats in the Council of the European Union? We test
   two rival hypotheses - one suggesting that high turnover rates will
   empower bureaucrats, the other suggesting that they will increase
   uncertainty and increase ministerial involvement. We empirically
   document high turnover among ministers in the Council. Next, we develop
   a conceptual framework that identifies four ways that turnover might
   affect institutional balances. Then we outline rival hypotheses about
   turnover's vertical intra-institutional effects and present statistical
   models that gauge turnover's effects on the power of ministers and
   bureaucrats. Our analysis supports the hypothesis that higher turnover
   is associated with lower levels of ministerial control. The article
   generates new insights into institutional dynamics and informs debates
   about the nature of European Union accountability.},

Journal = {STUDIES IN CONFLICT \& TERRORISM},

Pages = {10-23},
Abstract = {The Internet has emerged as a key technology for Al Qaeda and other
   jihadist movements waging their so-called electronic jihad across the
   Middle East and globally, with digital multiplier effects. This study
   will examine the evolving doctrine of electronic jihad and its impact on
   the radicalization of Muslims in Western diaspora communities The study
   describes Internet-based websites that served as online libraries and
   repositories for jihadist literature, as platforms for extremist
   preachers and as forums for radical discourse. Furthermore, the study
   will then detail how Internet connectivity has come to play a more
   direct operational role for jihadi terrorist-related purposes, most
   notably for inciting prospective cadres to action; for recruiting
   jihadist operatives and fighters; for providing virtual training in
   tactical methods and manufacture of explosives; for terrorism financing;
   and for actual planning and preparations for specific terror attacks.
   Whereas contemporary jihadist militants may be shifting from the World
   Wide Web to social media, such as Facebook, YouTube, and Twitter for
   messaging and communications, nevertheless the Internet-based electronic
   jihad remains a significant catalyst for promoting jihadist activism and
   for facilitating terrorist operations.},

Abstract = {Expectations in Pakistan rose, when for the first time, in its history a
   political government in 2013 completed its full term of office and was
   replaced not by the military but by another political government after
   being defeated at the ballot box. It raises questions about what kind of
   democratic space is developing and what type of hybrid regime is
   emergent. The paper reflects upon the concept of hybrid regime and draws
   out key variables: turnover, tutelage and neo-patrimonialism and then
   considers how to categorise development in Pakistan. It concludes that
   Pakistan is in a `gray zone' and that during the period there was
   evidence of it moving towards becoming an illiberal hybrid regime but
   the military went on the offensive and the democratic space contracted
   returning to being an illiberal tutelary hybrid regime. Unless tutelage
   and neo-patrimonialism are not challenged Pakistan will not progress in
   the democratic transition and remain a hybrid regime.},

Abstract = {The article concentrates on the role which the strategic partnership
   with the European Union played in Brazilian foreign policy from 2007 to
   2015, and the shift of focus that took place during the Lula and Dilma
   Rousseff administrations. It analyses the progress of such strategic
   partnership and the exchanges per sector carried out within related
   frameworks. It also discusses and segregates the so-called sector
   dialogues into two types and argues that, since the beginning of the
   Rousseff administration, multilateral exchanges encountered growing
   obstacles to becoming successful, whereas bilateral dialogues found
   increasingly favorable ground.},

Abstract = {Critical infrastructure protection spans an increasing number of
   publicly and privately owned nondefense entities. As cyberspace
   continued to expand, securing society requires a comprehensive approach
   to include business sector cooperation with all levels of government.
   More attention must be devoted to activities and facilities not only on
   the national but also on the municipal level. This will require
   nontraditional governance approaches to complement the usual top-down
   national regulation. We discuss recent cyber security policy
   developments in Israel, and move on to discuss future cyber security
   challenges using water supply as an example. Hopefully the approaches
   discussed in this paper will provide useful information for other
   developed countries.},

   Irregular Way of War},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF STRATEGIC STUDIES},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {40},
Number = {4, SI},
Pages = {554-576},
Abstract = {This article aims at challenging the notion of a French exception in the
   realm of irregular warfare, suggesting that it rather amounts to a
   western variation. Born out of a transatlantic community under British
   influence, the French irregular experience carried on through the early
   Cold War challenges, strengthening France's ties with its Western
   allies. France's subsequent involvement in post-colonial
   counter-insurgencies did contribute to generating some specific
   strategic features, although never totally disconnected from
   international circulation. Finally, the post-Cold War order
   significantly drove French irregular warfare back into its Western fold
   through the adoption of US- and NATO-sponsored concepts and doctrines,
   thus enhancing interoperability and some degree of standardisation.},

Journal = {POLICY STUDIES},

Volume = {38},
Number = {6},
Pages = {553-570},
Abstract = {A growing number of studies have examined the collaboration of actors
   from two or more policy domains in order to integrate aims and concerns
   derived from one policy domain into another. In our literature review,
   we refer to this empirical phenomenon as policy integration',
   exemplified by the Health in All Policies approach. Despite the wealth
   of literature on the subject, the scientific community only has access
   to a portion of the insights that have come out of this field of
   research, due primarily to the fact that policy integration is discussed
   using a variety of different terms, which tend to be specific to the
   policy domain under investigation. To facilitate a more inclusive
   scientific debate on policy integration, we provide a comprehensive
   overview of the different terminologies associated with policy
   integration and analyse the recurring themes in the respective
   literature strands. What is the motivation for policy-makers to promote
   policy integration? What is the design of the instruments used for
   policy integration? How does policy integration affect the policy-making
   process? And how well does policy integration perform? These are the
   four questions guiding our study.},

Title = {Effects of inter-organizational conflicts on construction project added
   value in China},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONFLICT MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {28},
Number = {5},
Pages = {695-723},
Abstract = {Purpose - The purpose of this research is to investigate the effects of
   inter-organizational conflicts on the project added value in the Chinese
   construction industry, and also to examine the mediating effect of
   conflicts on project added value and the moderating effect of conflict
   management strategies.
   Design/methodology/approach - A conceptual model was developed, and a
   structured questionnaire survey was conducted with 667 professionals.
   The structural equation modeling technique was used to analyze the data.
   Findings - The results showed that task conflict, relationship conflict
   and process conflict were influenced by subject characteristics of
   project participants, bilateral relationship characteristics and project
   characteristics. Similarly, these three types of conflicts interact with
   each other. Meanwhile, these three types of conflicts influence the
   added value in construction projects, which are moderated by conflict
   management strategies. Under a collaborating strategy, task conflict and
   process conflict were positively associated with project added value,
   and relationship conflict was negatively associated with project added
   value. Under a competing strategy, task conflict, process conflict and
   relationship conflict were negatively associated with added value in
   construction projects. Therefore, the constructive and destructive
   effects of conflicts on project added value under different conflict
   management strategies are verified in Chinese construction projects.
   Research limitations/implications - The variables may not be exhaustive
   for construction projects and most of them were applied in construction
   projects for the first time. As a result, their rationality and
   effectiveness could be further improved. The results implied that
   inter-organizational conflicts had a constructive effect on project
   added value and should attract broad attention for future research.
   Additionally, different driving factors had different influences on
   these conflicts, and even the driving factors can be divided into
   different dimensions.
   Practical implications - This study provides a better understanding of
   the relationship between inter-organizational conflicts and added value
   in construction projects, and a reliable reference for the project
   manager to effectively deal with these conflicts. In addition, this
   research reveals the effects of conflicts on project added value and the
   path of conflicts transformation. This provides a useful reference for
   project managers to take advantage of the positive effect of task
   conflict and process conflict, and to avoid the negative effect of
   relationship conflict.
   Originality/value - Very few studies attempted to examine the effects of
   inter-organizational conflicts on project added value in construction
   projects. Therefore, this research makes significant theoretical and
   practical contributions to the existing body of knowledge on the
   conflict management and project added value. This research provides an
   empirical evidence to support the viewpoint that different types of
   conflicts can be mutually transformed. Similarly, this study explains
   how conflicts present functional and dysfunctional effects in
   construction projects. Both of them are potential theoretical
   contributions to the existing body of knowledge.},

Title = {Bicameralism and Coalition Cabinets in Presidential Polities: A
   configurational analysis of the coalition formation and duration

Journal = {BRITISH JOURNAL OF POLITICS \& INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {19},

Abstract = {For too long, scholars have studied coalitions under presidential
   regimes as they did under parliamentarism: assuming that the executive
   needed to look for allies in only one chamber. However, symmetric
   bicameralism has made such assumption untenable. As a matter of fact,
   bicameralism, particularly symmetrical bicameralism, as it operates
   under presidential regimes, may entail significant constraints for
   policymaking and coalition duration. Indeed, controlling one of the two
   chambers may not be sufficient for the president to ensure policy
   approvals. This article focuses on the 28 coalition cabinets with a
   bicameral framework in Latin America since the return of democracy. I
   show that bicameralism dramatically affects the composition of the
   coalitions as the absence of a majority in both chambers engenders a
   post-electoral agreement round. Moreover, I show that when a coalition
   holds some kind of majority in both houses, the coalition agreement
   lasts longer.},

Abstract = {Interrogating the assumption that we live in a time `after' crisis, this
   article explores financial crisis, recovery and ongoing questions of
   governance and intervention through a gender `lens'. It locates the
   `afterwards' of the global financial crisis as central to understanding
   how particular relations of gendered power have been able to prevail in
   producing a world of governance post `post-crisis'. Asking what the
   limits, and liminality, of global financial governance are `after'
   crisis, the article argues that governance responses to the crisis can
   be understood in gendered terms: in their efforts to stave off the
   potential instability of an undecided, ambiguous and potentially
   unpredictable economic space, and as concentrating power in the hands of
   financial elites, particularly, elite groups of white men.},

Journal = {GLOBAL POLICY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {8},
Number = {4},
Pages = {455-463},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {The recent pace of international agreement aimed to reduce tax evasion
   and avoidance was completely unpredicted prior to the financial crisis.
   The two targets are often considered to be merely different dimensions
   of the same problem. This paper argues that the two problems actually
   involve very different logics, and this holds the key to the prospects
   for success. The assault on tax evasion confronts a problem that is
   commonly recognized and admits to amelioration through the increased
   information sharing that is rapidly, although unevenly, advancing.
   Attempts to reduce corporate tax avoidance, however, confront ambiguity
   at every turn. National corporate tax systems differ markedly from each
   other in rules as well as rates, and agreement necessarily takes place
   in an ever more competitive international business environment in which
   national rate and rule setting will remain largely independent.
   Moreover, increased attention to the international taxation of business
   seems to have increased rather than dampened unilateral initiatives to
   advance national gain.},

Abstract = {Parties' local campaign efforts can yield electoral dividends in
   plurality elections; in general, the harder they campaign, the more
   votes they receive. However, this is not invariably the case. Different
   parties' campaigns can have different effects. What is more, the
   particular status of a candidacy can also influence how effective the
   local campaign might be. Analyses of constituency campaigning at the
   2015 UK General Election reveal inter-party variations in campaign
   effectiveness. But looking more closely at how a party was placed
   tactically in a seat prior to the election, and at whether sitting MPs
   stood again for their party or retired, reveals distinct variations in
   what parties stand to gain from their local campaigns in different
   circumstances.},

Abstract = {In this article, we contend that the current gender and conflict
   literature ignores the context of military decisions and thus
   underestimates the support of women for certain types of military
   interventions. We argue that the issues related to humanitarian crises
   are likely to provoke support from women. Consequently, as more women
   enter elected positions in state legislatures, the more likely a state
   will become involved in a humanitarian military intervention. To test
   our argument, we compile a data set of humanitarian military
   interventions and women legislators from 1946 to 2003. A series of
   estimation approaches and robustness tests support our assertion that
   more women legislators impact the likelihood that a state will become
   involved in a humanitarian military intervention. Our research has
   specific implications on the role of gender in conflict processes and
   more general implications on the connection between domestic political
   processes and foreign policy decision making.},

Abstract = {During the last years, Transparency has become in a key element in the
   interaction between public administrations and society. However, this is
   a broad concept, which needs to be defined and measured carefully.
   Various authors have addressed this concept, from the perspective of
   different areas, through the creation of dichotomous indexes of
   transparency, but not measuring the quality of the information. In the
   present study, we propose a new method to measure the quality and
   content of municipal information disclosure, avoiding the creation of a
   synthetic index, highlighting the elements of transparency that provide
   optimal information, in quality and quantity. After that, we identify
   differences between local governments with different political
   ideologies, using multidimensional scaling analysis. The results
   obtained show that conservative governments grant more importance to
   transparency indicators, especially regarding legal and institutional
   information, than progressive ones.},

Abstract = {Scholars interested in researching nuclear security are increasingly
   expressing the fear that the ``important questions{''} have already been
   answered. At the same time, recent studies highlight the potential for
   major limitations on the ability to conduct casual inference on nuclear
   proliferation in particular, suggesting perhaps that we know much less
   than was previously believed. Although recognizing these challenges,
   this article argues that there remain ample opportunities to conduct
   innovative scholarship on questions of nuclear security. New nuclear
   challenges bring fresh opportunities for the next generation of research
   on topics including limited nuclear war; nuclear nonproliferation
   diplomacy; emerging technology, weapons proliferation and strategic
   stability; nuclear modernization and arms races; and many other issues.
   More precise theory, new data, and improved methods of inference also
   allow researchers to revisit and possibly resolve persistent debates.
   Although the problems confronting research on nuclear security are
   serious, they can be addressed. In sum, the questions in this field are
   so consequential that they deserve the best available analytical
   attention, even if the resulting answers are not perfect.},

Abstract = {China and North Korea have been allies since the foundation of the
   latter at the end of the 1940s. Their ideological affinity, proximity
   and shared history contributed to creating ties of great importance
   between the two countries. However, the development of the North Korea's
   nuclear program together with China's rise to occupy a global position
   of great importance have changed the dynamics of this relationship. This
   process needs to be examined with care, as historically the relationship
   between the two nations has transcended the bilateral sphere to have
   significant regional implications and is now a priority on the
   international security agenda.},

Abstract = {Why do some individuals embrace nationalist rhetoric and feel proud of
   their citizenship while others do not? This article introduces an
   exchange-theoretic perspective, according to which national pride
   depends on access to political power. Seen from this perspective,
   members of ethnic groups that are not represented in national-level
   government should be less proud of their nation than those included in
   the polity. Furthermore, ethnic violence in the past or power-sharing
   arrangements in the present should reduce trust in the future stability
   of political representation and thus pride in the nation. From a dynamic
   point of view, members of ethnic groups whose level of political
   representation decreased in the past should also see their nation in a
   less positive light today. To show this, the author uses existing
   surveys to assemble a new data set with answers to a similar question
   about national pride. It covers 123 countries that comprise 92 percent
   of the world's population. For roughly half of these countries, the
   ethnic groups listed in the surveys could also be found in another data
   set that contains information on the political status of these groups.

Abstract = {Research on socialization can obscure the agency of its targets,
   presenting socialization as a uni-directional process shaping beliefs
   and behaviors. This assumption is even stronger for the military, a
   totalizing institution often portrayed as fashioning its members into
   violence professionals through a top-down process of domination. In
   contrast, this article argues that even powerful socialization processes
   are not omnipotent, and that individuals retain a measure of agency even
   under pervasive social control. Drawing on the case of the Israel
   Defense Force during the Second Intifada, it shows that norms inculcated
   during military socialization can be undermined by the more ambiguous
   conditions of deployment. When soldiers also subscribe to competing
   norms and receive social support for their dissent, resistance can
   emerge, increase, and become more overt. Analysis of resistance to
   violence underscores the power of military socialization while drawing
   attention to its limits. It therefore challenges homogenizing views of
   soldiers, illuminating the processes through which military violence is
   produced and curbed.},

Abstract = {Issues of university autonomy, self-governance, and centralization and
   decentralization are still at the forefront of higher education in
   Ukraine. This study of university governance suggests that the state is
   a major foe of university autonomy, though certainly not the only one.
   The system of centralized university governance is experiencing changes
   in its content, function, mechanisms, and approaches, while maintaining
   its unity and highly centralized structure. Thus, it is difficult to
   adapt and respond to free market forces and challenges brought to the
   fore by the Euromaidan political turmoil and the war that followed. Such
   phenomena as corruption in education and internal pressures,
   marketization of educational services and financial integrity, changing
   organizational and managerial structures of universities present
   challenges to university governance and force it to change. They may
   also facilitate strengthening of university autonomy. However, as long
   as the disease of corruption exists, all attempts to reform higher
   education are unlikely to be successful. (C) 2017 The Regents of the

Title = {How Financial Resources Affect the Autonomy of International Public
   Administrations},
Journal = {GLOBAL POLICY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {8},
Number = {5, SI},
Pages = {75-84},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Voluntary contributions - often earmarked for specific purposes - have
   become an indispensable source of revenue for international
   organizations (IOs) and the UN organizations in particular. While the
   reasons for this trend are regularly studied, its effects on the
   internal functioning of the organization (especially on the
   international public administration' (IPA) as the organization's
   secretariat) remain unclear. Given this gap, we study the consequences
   of increasing financial dependence for the autonomy of IPA staff. Using
   financial and personnel data of 15 UN agencies over time, our results
   are in line with the intuitive expectation that more financial resources
   in the form of voluntary contributions increase the number of staff. We
   also find evidence, however, that the more an organization depends on
   voluntary resources (within its broader financial portfolio), the more
   it reduces the ratio of permanent staff among its total workforce in the
   subsequent years. The underlying adaption of IPAs' recruitment and
   career structures to growing financial insecurities has important
   implications for the autonomy of international bureaucrats and needs to
   be considered also in terms of its long-term impact on administrative
   professionalism and organizational performance.
   Policy Implications
   The UN organizations are generally responsive to changes in their fiscal
   environment. The increasing dependence on voluntary funding leads them
   to adjust their staffing practices by reducing `long-term liabilities'
   in the form of permanent staff.
   The observed trend has potentially negative consequences for IPAs'
   ability to fulfill their mandate because the institutional memory and
   policy expertise of staff suffers.
   Changing staffing patterns may also impair the performance of IPAs as it
   becomes more difficult for them to attract qualified personnel and keep
   their current staff motivated.
   To counterbalance increasing bilateral influence on the provision of
   public goods, IPAs should continue to reach out to their overall
   membership and demonstrate the importance of organizational core
   activities in order to (re) attract unrestricted financial resources.},

Abstract = {One of the most important phases of case-oriented research is
   identifying the relevant population of cases. The best practice scheme
   suggests first identifying the positive and then the negative cases,
   based on the assumption that the population is small and known. This
   scheme is inapplicable when the population is unknown, as is the case
   with many public administration and public policy outcomes, which are
   often less visible. However, most research either ignores this
   difficulty or recommends a single case study. This article suggests that
   when the population is unknown scholars can apply the possibility
   principle to identify the relevant population of cases. In order to do
   so, a large dataset is required. In policy studies, the Comparative
   Agendas Project (CAP) can serve this aim. This article highlights CAP's
   applicability for case selection based on the possibility principle in
   two less visible policy outcomes: conversion and drift. In that, it not
   only addresses an overlooked challenge but also promotes both CAP as a
   useful tool for qualitative researchers and the expansion of comparative
   work on conversion and drift.},

Abstract = {The main objective of this article is to analyse the determinants of
   women's descriptive representation in the 2014 local elections in the
   Czech Republic and Slovakia. It is shown that although both countries
   are considered democratic and in spite of two decades of
   multi-dimensional transition, women are underrepresented at the local
   level. Especially electoral results in the municipalities which are
   considered sub-regional centres and where almost one-half of the
   population of both countries is concentrated are studied. As it is
   pointed out, factors like local population or political and
   institutional factors play an important role in women's success in local
   politics.},

Abstract = {Protection and creation of environment represents a significant problem
   in Czech society - at the state and local governments. The state,
   regions and municipalities are responsible for creating and maintaining
   a healthy environment for their citizens and for future generations.
   Economic development brings the raising of living standards on one side,
   however, presents on the other side many negative moments resulting from
   the creation of environmental burdens of various kinds, in particular,
   the territory exploitation by mining activities, water and air pollution
   and industrial and municipal waste disposal. The state imposes taxes and
   charges on originators of environmental burdens, whose revenue is then
   used to finance programs and projects for the rehabilitation of the
   environment and its gradual improvement. This article is the outline of
   these payments catalog.},
