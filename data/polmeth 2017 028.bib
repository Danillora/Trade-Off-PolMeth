Abstract = {Little of the discussion of foreign fighters in Syria and Iraq is
   informed by primary data derived from talking with the foreign fighters.
   This article reports some initial findings from interviews with twenty
   foreign fighters in Syria. The findings are compared with three other
   recent studies of European foreign fighters, and aspiring fighters,
   based on some primary data. While those studies emphasize the role of
   low social and economic prospects in motivating the choice to go, this
   study found little evidence of such factors, and alternatively argues
   more attention should be given to existential concerns and the role of
   religiosity. Consideration is also given to the methodological
   challenges posed by using of terrorists' accounts of their motivations.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF EUROPEAN PUBLIC POLICY},

Pages = {1491-1505},
Abstract = {The heated scholarly and public debate on the Transatlantic Trade and
   Investment Partnership (TTIP) has centred predominantly on two
   questions. Firstly, is there something particularly special about TTIP,
   other than the fact that it involves the world's largest trading
   partners? And, secondly, is the concern about TTIP's deleterious effects
   justified? The starting point for our argument is that understanding an
   agreement like TTIP requires an emphasis on the socially constructed
   nature of reality. TTIP is ultimately novel in terms of the regulatory
   scope of its provisions, and it is problematic because it subtly
   promotes the (socially constructed) interests of those who merely see
   regulation as inefficient red tape'.},

Abstract = {This chapter deals with gender and rural livelihood in the Lake Tana
   Basin, which lies within the Lake Tana watershed of Amhara region in the
   North West part of Ethiopia. It includes areas around the lake with
   strong ecological, socioeconomic and cultural linkages to the lake
   itself. In the basin, mainly integrated crop production and livestock
   rising and fishery activities are undertaken. As it is one of the major
   food producing areas of Ethiopia, it has critical regional and national
   significance. In the basin, women and men have different access to, and
   control over, productive assets. Economic capacities and incentives are
   also strongly gender-differentiated in ways, which affect supply
   response, intra household resource allocation, labour productivity, and
   welfare. Women are still working in subsistence agriculture where they
   are in-charge of food production, processing and marketing. Moreover,
   all domestic and reproductive roles like taking care of the health and
   education of children, fetching water, collecting fuel wood, and
   cooking, are entirely done by women and girls. These conditions have
   become constraints on women's self-enhancement and productivity. Women
   have weak access to credit, cash, appropriate technology, and
   information that are essential to increase their productivity and
   income. Girls are victims of various harmful traditional practices such
   as early marriage, female genital mutilation, etc. On the other hand,
   most young farmers have also limited access to resources like farm land
   and finance for their livelihoods. Hence development interventions need
   to consider all these gender gaps.},

Abstract = {This article explores, explains and challenges the state of the art of
   actorness, one of the most recognizable concepts in the study of the
   European Union (EU)'s international functioning. Covering 45 years of
   research (1970-2015), it examines the notion's conceptual history,
   discusses its main findings, analyses its limitations and opportunities,
   and formulates suggestions for future work. It argues that the status
   quo can be seen through two opposing lenses - that of an optimist and
   that of a pessimist - and suggests two research shifts and specific
   recommendations to realize them in order to flip the notion's upcoming
   50th anniversary from gilded to golden.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF EUROPEAN PUBLIC POLICY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {24},
Number = {3, SI},
Pages = {386-405},
Abstract = {The degree to which governments intervene to contain financial crises
   varies considerably. We aim to understand why policy-makers choose the
   level of intervention they do to contain financial shocks. In
   particular, we want to understand why policy-makers may choose policies
   that create outcomes they do not want. We focus on a defining feature of
   financial crisis policy-making that has been largely unaddressed in the
   literature on policy responses to crises: policy-makers lack good
   information about the health of their banking systems. So they rely on
   their bureaucrats and other actors for necessary information. However,
   information providers may have different policy preferences. To
   understand the interactions between these actors and the implications
   for policy choice, we advance a signalling game of financial crisis
   containment. We use a case study of the recent Irish crisis to
   demonstrate how information asymmetries can have a significant impact on
   bailout choices.},

Title = {From rural rebellions to urban riots: political competition and changing
   patterns of violent political revolt in Uganda},
Journal = {COMMONWEALTH \& COMPARATIVE POLITICS},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {55},
Number = {1},
Pages = {22-40},
Abstract = {Violent political revolt has been common in independent Uganda. For a
   long time, such revolts were exclusively expressed as rural-based rebel
   groups fighting the government. Since the mid-2000s, however, this seems
   to have come to an end. Instead, urban riots, very rare in the past,
   have become much more common. This article analyses these changing
   patterns of types and location of violent political revolt in Uganda
   under the National Resistance Movement government. It argues that the
   earlier prevalence of rural rebellions can be explained by the
   combination of a coercive and militarised state, and weak and ethnically
   factionalised political forces who took their violent resistance to
   rural regional bases. Over time, however, government counter-insurgency
   became more effective and the conditions for insurgency were undermined
   by withdrawal of external support. Furthermore, the reintroduction of
   multiparty politics in 2005 opened up new avenues for political
   expression. The changes to the political system were, however, more
   nominal than real in many respects. While the rebel option had become
   less attractive and feasible, a series of social, economic and political
   grievances remained which were only partly channelled through party
   politics. They also found expression through sporadic urban violent
   revolt.},

Pages = {557-572},
Abstract = {Violent nationalism in Northern Ireland has drawn inspiration from a
   tradition of physical-force republicanism that dates back centuries. The
   consequence has been a strong tendency for Irish republicans to draw on
   that history as a source of ideas for their conduct of campaigns of
   violence. However, during Northern Ireland's most recent Troubles from
   the late 1960s to the 1990s, external influence on the republican
   movement was evident in some of the tactics adopted and, even more
   strongly, in the turn toward negotiations. At the same time, Irish
   republicans have directly assisted other groups from Spain to South
   Africa in the employment of particular means such as the culvert bomb.
   But it is more striking that republicans have tended to eschew some of
   the means that have been widely associated with terrorism elsewhere
   since the 1960s such as the hijacking of aircraft for the taking of
   hostages. Transnational influences on Irish nationalists have been
   greater at the level of political ideas and as a source of
   legitimization than as a model for their own campaigns.},

Abstract = {Much has been written about Russian authoritarian promotion in the

   analysis of Russian learning from other regimes. This article argues
   that the Belarusian regime provides lessons to Moscow for overcoming
   democratic protests, having learnt from the 2000 overthrow of Slobodan
   Milosevic in Serbia. The Belarusian case therefore expands a literature
   primarily centred on Russia, extending understanding of authoritarian
   learning and questioning Russia's role as the primary authoritarian
   promoter in the region.},

   Rhetorical Dynamics of Lone Actor Violence},

Year = {2017},
Volume = {29},
Number = {1},
Pages = {52-78},
Abstract = {``Leaderless resistance{''} and ``lone wolf terrorism{''} are concepts
   that have steadily gained importance in the study of oppositional
   subcultures and terrorist groups, being used to describe the operational
   realities of a variety of terrorisms, from groups like Al Qaeda to
   Anders Breivik. In this article, I seek to describe leaderless
   resistance as a rhetorical construct, a meaning-conferring ``ideology of
   effervescence{''} that lifts the spirits of both movement progenitors
   who advocate the strategy as well as incipient lone wolves who consider
   responding to their exhortations. Through an examination of the case of
   Wiebo Ludwig and the EnCana pipeline bombings of 2008-2009, I show how
   these rhetorics emerge in the interactions between activists and their
   political enemies. With this conception, we can (a) understand more
   fully the discursive/rhetorical dynamics involved in asymmetrical
   struggle, (b) problematize the acceptance of the organizational reality
   of leaderless resistance in the terrorism literature, and (c) question
   the assertion of some terrorism scholarship that refers to leaderless
   resistance and other ideologies of effervescence as hallmarks of the
   ``new terrorism.{''}},

Journal = {STUDIES IN CONFLICT \& TERRORISM},

Volume = {40},
Number = {7, SI},
Pages = {523-538},
Abstract = {Terrorists learn every day to gain further knowledge on how to achieve
   their violent objectives. Consequently, understanding terrorist learning
   forms a crucial part of the fight to counter terrorism. However, while
   existing literature within terrorism studies has examined a number of
   different parts of the learning process, there currently fails to exist
   a comprehensive framework to encompass the learning process as a whole.
   This article will rectify this oversight by drawing on wider learning
   literature to develop a new analytical framework for terrorist learning
   that provides a definition, considers the actors involved and identifies
   processes and outcomes. Consequently, the full landscape of current and
   potential research in this important area is revealed.},

Journal = {POLICY STUDIES},

Volume = {38},
Number = {4},
Pages = {375-391},
Abstract = {This paper examines the economy-wide impacts of recent oil price shocks
   on the Malaysian economy. To achieve this objective, an integrated
   methodological framework that combines econometric and input-output
   models is utilized to assess the impacts of an oil price shock on tax
   revenues, employment, labor income and gross domestic product (GDP). Our
   results reveal that the recent oil price shocks significantly affects
   these macroeconomic variables. The decline in oil prices from 2015 to
   2016 reduces tax revenues by 10.5\%, lower GDP by 1.9\% and increases
   the unemployment rate by 0.3\%. As such, the sharp crunch in oil prices
   serves as a reminder to policymakers on the vulnerability inherent in
   overreliance on oil exports and the urgent need to diversify the
   economy.},

Abstract = {Given Brazil's regional prevalence, its low, late and soft investment in
   regional security governance appears puzzling. We approach the puzzle
   through an analysis of contextual features, institutional overlap and
   policy networks, especially regarding nuclear energy and the
   environment. Our findings show that Brazil's behavior is explained by a
   combination of low regional risks, scarce domestic resources, a
   legalistic regional culture of dispute settlement, and transgovernmental
   networks that substitute for formal interstate cooperation and deep
   regional institutions.},

   Following a National Traumatic Event: Evidence from Pakistan},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONFLICT AND VIOLENCE},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {11},
Abstract = {The purpose of this paper is to analyze the impact of terrorism-induced
   fear on employee job attitudes and absenteeism in the weeks following
   the Army Public School attack in Peshawar, Pakistan. The paper is based
   on questionnaire data collected from 204 faculty members of public
   sector universities in Peshawar using snowball sampling technique. We
   applied partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) to
   analyze the entire impact path and found substantial support for our
   hypotheses. The results suggest that fear of terrorism affects
   absenteeism directly, as well as indirectly via job attitudes. Further,
   perceived organizational support is found to attenuate the negative
   relationship between fear of terrorism and job attitudes. Very few
   studies have examined the impact of societal variables such as national
   traumatic events on job related outcomes.},

Abstract = {While the dominant discourse in Zimbabwe on and about soldiers is that
   they are perpetrators of political violence, this does not always
   reflect the lived experiences of soldiers who joined the army in
   post-independence Zimbabwe. Based on army deserters' narratives emerging
   from 44 life history interviews and two focus groups, this article
   argues that not all soldiers have been supportive of President Robert
   Mugabe and ZANU-PF. Rather, ZANU-PF had to work quite hard to ensure the
   political loyalty of its soldiers, who often resisted and challenged
   ZANU-PF political coercion. The barracks constituted a site in which
   `military professionalism' and `politics' were at loggerheads. The
   article analyses the ways in which these army deserters were spied on,
   punished, demoted, and detained: practices which they all contend were
   politicized by partisan commanders in the barracks.},

Abstract = {Lake Tana, the biggest lake in Ethiopia, is very important water
   resource for community living and depending on the lake's resources. It
   plays a role in balancing of the microclimate of local areas in the
   catchment of the lake. However, the recent development activities at the
   catchment areas have negatively affected the natural systems of the Lake
   Tana's catchment. The catchment system and its interface with
   atmosphere, lithosphere, hydrosphere, and biosphere assume greater
   importance to ecosystem management. The study of land use and cover
   changes will help to apply the appropriate land use and land use
   palanning. The changes in different land cover units such as forest,
   wood and bush lands, grass, wetlands and water bodies, and farm and
   settlements were analyzed from different sources. Population change,
   land tenure, poverty and lack of market and credit facilities in the
   watershed area were analyzed as causes of land cover changes. There is a
   need to work against the causative variables to solve the resource
   degradation in the catchment. Despite the large extent of land converted
   to farms and settlements, individual house holding of land and household
   incomes have declined. This is perhaps due to the absence of
   coordination between the land distribution policy and the family
   planning policy. There is degradation of vegetation such as forest and
   grasses and wetland vegetation (riparian vegetation). A detailed
   inspection of land use change (LUC) change is also crucial for those
   planners and decision makers to consider environmental and socioeconomic
   impacts of the land use cover changes (LUCC) in the LTB and design
   sustainable solutions.},

Title = {Reframing obesity: a critical discourse analysis of the UK's first
   social marketing campaign},
Journal = {CRITICAL POLICY STUDIES},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {11},
Number = {4},
Pages = {455-476},
Abstract = {This paper presents a critical discourse analysis of the UK government's
   `Change4Life' antiobesity social marketing campaign, which uses colorful
   cartoon characters and simplified messages to `reframe' the issue of
   obesity, and encourage the public to take an active role in addressing
   this policy problem. It stems from a wider political context in which
   insights from behavioral economics ('nudge') are increasingly turned to
   for solutions to policy problems. The approach particularly emphasizes
   the importance of carefully crafted communication in securing public
   compliance with desired policy outcomes and has gained considerable
   attention in political science, economics, and health research. This
   paper contributes to that growing debate by offering a systematic
   textually oriented critical analysis of the discourse of nudge. It maps
   the public, private, and third sector practices comprising this campaign
   and critically examines the underlying balance of power and vested
   interests. Detailed analysis of the launch advert and surrounding policy
   documents reveals how scientific claims about obesity are
   recontextualized, simplified, and distorted in this campaign. It is
   further argued that the use of behavioral psychology legitimizes
   individualized policy solutions, squeezing out public deliberation over
   the complex structural causes of obesity.},

Abstract = {Regional autonomy is guaranteed in the constitution of Iraq, yet between
   2006 and 2014 the Shiite prime minister at the time, Nouri al-Maliki,
   did his utmost to limit the power of both Kurds and Sunnis. Maliki
   worked to further centralise governance and amassed greater controls and
   power-from militarily to legislative-for his party. Instead of
   strengthening and securing Iraq, Maliki's actions have led to a rise in
   both Kurdish and Sunni nationalisms, which has resulted in civil war and
   the effective failure of the Iraqi state. This article analyses how
   Maliki's actions enabled the rise of the Islamic State, and have changed
   the dynamics of Iraq. It proposes that, in light of these changes, the
   best way forward for the effective running of the country is the
   implementation of federalism across Iraq.},

Abstract = {The European Union (EU) has successfully negotiated with the Republic of
   Korea its first free trade agreement (FTA) under the scheme of the 2006
   Global Europe strategy. The EU-Korea FTA has triggered a number of
   changes, including the emergence of a new paradigm of
   trade-policy-making. While traditional negotiation was dominated by
   governments and/or executive agencies, a new political constellation has
   emerged with stronger involvement by other stakeholders, including
   parliamentary actors and civil society organizations (CSOs). Through a
   case study of FTA negotiations between the EU and Korea, this paper
   shows that the new players have gained weight in the process of
   negotiation both by increasing their influence in regulatory activities
   (Contentious Market Regulation) and creating effective channels for
   their involvement in the policy-making process (Feedback Loop). This
   paper also argues that though the changes that took place in both
   parties were similar, they have had different roots and dimensions.},

Abstract = {This article deals with the use of rights in the Brazilian foreign

   novel understanding of rights that clashed with the traditional statist
   one, and the Brazilian strategies were less a complete rebuttal of
   rights language and more a reading of rights as a possible threat to the
   Abertura process.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF STRATEGIC STUDIES},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {40},
Number = {5},
Pages = {696-730},
Abstract = {China's expanding strength and ambition may foreshadow a violent
   conflict with the United States. I describe two scenarios about how such
   a conflict would unfold. The article begins by examining the prospects
   for nuclear escalation, drawing on theories about politics, psychology,
   and inadvertent escalation. It then examines the prospects for
   protracted conventional war, a scenario that has received far less
   attention. I present a new theory of protraction based on technology,
   geography, and domestic politics. After assessing the logic of both
   scenarios against a hypothetical US-China conflict, I discuss which is
   more likely. The conclusion points to a sobering trade-off: efforts to
   avoid nuclear catastrophe increase the chance of a long and grueling
   fight.},

Title = {Understanding How and Why Young People Enter Radical or Violent

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONFLICT AND VIOLENCE},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {11},
Abstract = {The process of (violent) radicalisation and subsequently joining of
   radical or violent extremist groups was studied using semi-structured
   interviews with (young) people who considered themselves as radicals or
   violent extremists in left-wing, right-wing or religious settings. The
   data was gathered in Belgium from March through November 2013. Though
   modest in number (12), the interviews tell us a lot about factors that
   play a role in (violent) radicalisation and the organisation of radical
   or violent extremist groups through online and offline recruitment and
   daily activities. The results of the interviews are linked to the
   existing theoretical frameworks on (violent) radicalisation, including
   factors underlying engagement and recruitment. They show that new social
   media are not as relevant as currently asserted, but that offline
   methods of recruitment are still uppermost. They also make clear that
   the content of the ideology is not the first impetus for searching, but
   that a general discontent with society comes first, a search for ways of
   dealing with this discontent, and an orientation associated with the
   search. This has implications for the way society should deal with young
   people and radical convictions and the alternatives that should be
   provided.},

Abstract = {Against the background of theoretical arguments and the historical
   record, enlargements of the European Union tend to increase
   differentiated integration. The actual development of differentiation of
   the 2004 and 2007 accession countries can, therefore, be seen as an
   indicator of the Union's integration capacity. We map the newcomers'
   differentiated integration since accession, and also distinguish between
   exemptions and discrimination. Furthermore, we approximate a
   counterfactual scenario of how their level of differentiation might have
   developed in the absence of recent accession through a comparison to the
   Southern member states. Finally, we explore correlations between
   exemptions, discriminations and two structural country characteristics,
   wealth and identity. Overall, the level, trajectory and patterns of
   differentiation point towards a normalization of the new member states'
   integration in the Union.},

Abstract = {In a context where widespread failings in the nature of terrorism
   research are well recognisedyet where the quantity of work is still
   enormousis it possible to fairly assess whether the field is progressing
   or if it has become mired in mediocre research? Citation analysis is
   widely used to reveal the evolution and extent of progress in fields of
   study and to provide valuable insight into major trends and
   achievements. This study identifies and analyses the current 100 most
   cited journal articles in terrorism studies. A search was performed
   using Google Scholar for peer-reviewed journal articles on subjects
   related to terrorism and counter-terrorism. The most cited articles were
   published across sixty-two journals, which reflected the
   interdisciplinary nature of terrorism studies. Compared to other
   articles, the most cited articles were more likely to be the result of
   collaborative research and were also more likely to provide new data.
   Sixty-three of the top 100 articles have been published since 2001. The
   findings are discussed in relation to the evolution of terrorism
   research and current debates on progress in the field.},

Abstract = {The Eastern Partnership is one of the tools of the European Union (EU)
   contributing to the reordering of European security. This article
   addresses the formative processes of the current European security
   order, focusing on the forms of capital being mobilised by the EU and
   Russia in the field of European security. Using post-structuralist
   perspectives in international politics, it argues that the EU's
   promotion of depoliticised forms of politics aims at maintaining a
   hegemonic and hierarchical order, rather than partnerships and
   emancipatory forms of security. This is problematic, due to the
   subjectivities it creates and the lack of objective security provision.},

   overview of various types and levels of the phenomenon. It then tests
   the theoretical analytical 18-box matrix devised with data gathered in
   Prijedor (BiH) during two consecutive periods of fieldwork in order to
   further improve it and to introduce a temporal dimension into the

Title = {Trends and Driving Forces of Eucalyptus Plantation by Smallholders in
   the Lake Tana Watershed of Ethiopia},
Booktitle = {SOCIAL AND ECOLOGICAL SYSTEM DYNAMICS: CHARACTERISTICS, TRENDS, AND
   INTEGRATION IN THE LAKE TANA BASIN, ETHIOPIA},
Series = {AESS Interdisciplinary Environmental Studies and Sciences Series},
Year = {2017},
Pages = {563-580},
Abstract = {Lake Tana watershed is one of the growth corridors of the country
   identified by the government of Ethiopia. The competition for land among
   the different alternative land uses is intense. One of these is
   eucalyptus plantation not only on marginal lands but also on fertile
   plots used for producing annual crops. The trends and driving forces of
   eucalyptus plantation in the Lake Tana watershed and in Amhara region of
   Ethiopia in general are not well documented. This chapter reports on
   findings of a study on the trends and driving forces of eucalyptus
   plantation in Lake Tana sub basin based on preliminary assessment of
   major eucalyptus production areas of Amhara region and a case study from
   Mecha district of West Gojjam, Amhara Regional State. The district
   represents the major eucalyptus plantation area of the watershed. The
   study was conducted in 2011 and 2012. In addition to the visit of the
   major eucalyptus production and marketing sites and key informants
   interview in Amhara region, formal survey was administered to 400 sample
   households randomly and proportionately selected from high, medium and
   low level eucalyptus planting kebeles of Mecha district. Results show
   that close to 77\% of the sample households had planted eucalyptus. The
   trend of eucalyptus plantation is increasing and has been particularly
   high since 2002. Wald test has been used to check the presence of the
   structural break of trend in the year in the yearly cumulated number of
   farming households who started eucalyptus plantation. The result
   confirms the presence of significant structural break in trend for the
   year (p < 0.01). More than 60\% of the eucalyptus growers plant
   eucalyptus in woodlots on plots with plain topography and with medium to
   high levels of soil fertility. This indicates that eucalyptus plantation
   is expanding at the expense of crop production. The major drivers for
   the expansion raised by key informants are the increasing price of farm
   inputs (mainly fertilizer) for crop production, the Ethio-Sudan
   cross-border trade, the rising demand of wood for construction,
   industries and woodwork shops, and inadequacy of wood from natural
   forests due to deforestation. Besides these socioeconomic drivers,
   certain biological properties of eucalyptus make it especially
   appealing. Adaptability to wider agro ecological zones, coppicing
   ability, fast growth rate, straight poles, low labor demand, and
   resistance to diseases and pests are its commonly cited qualities. Given
   the growing demand for wood in the domestic and international market,
   and the expressed intention of most rural households to plant
   eucalyptus, eucalyptus plantation is likely to expand even more in the
   Lake Tana watershed. Therefore, proper land use development and
   organization of appropriate institutes for optimum level of eucalyptus
   plantation and balanced enterprise choice for the rural households and
   overall development of Lake Tana watershed and the region are suggested.},

Pages = {544-561},
Abstract = {This article identifies the limits and possibilities of the federal
   comparison for the European Union party system. Can the literatures on
   parties and party systems in multi-level systems deliver more insights
   to the analysis of the developing life of parties and party competition
   in the European Union? What are the most productive dialogs between
   scholars of federal and multilevel parties and scholars of European
   Union parties? It argues that the study of representation in the EU
   involves two key multi-level challenges: vote choice in a multi-level
   setting and party system development through upward aggregation. Drawing
   more closely from the comparative federalism literature can provide
   analytical leverage for both issues.},

Abstract = {During the 1990s, the International Monetary Fund failed to develop
   clear exchange rate policy norms for developing countries, despite the
   fact that oversight of the international monetary system is central to
   its mandate. Explaining this behaviour requires revising theories of
   autonomous agenda-setting and `ceremonial conformity' in international
   organizations (IOs). I argue that IOs often adopt a posture of strategic
   ambiguity when confronted with a combination of divisions among major
   member states and a lack of consensus in the profession that provides
   the organization's source of expert legitimacy. However, while the
   ambiguity helps avoid conflict in the short run, it undermines
   organizational governance capacity in the medium run, resulting in
   coordination failures. The empirical analysis relies on internal records
   of Fund meetings on the exchange rate issue, interviews with former IMF
   officials and analysis of the organization's governance role during
   currency crises in Mexico, Russia, Brazil and Argentina.},

Abstract = {Public Service Motivation (PSM) is a topic that has generated
   considerable interest among Public Administration scholars. Research on
   PSM has mainly focused on either defining what PSM is and how this
   construct can be measured or on testing how PSM affects individual and
   organizational variables. However, very little is known about how the
   motivation to serve the public interest is influenced by personality. We
   evaluate the psychological antecedents of PSM by distinguishing two
   classes of motives behind PSM: affective versus nonaffective motives.
   Our analysis of data from responses to two independent questionnaires by
   320 undergraduate students reveals that PSM is strongly influenced by
   core personality traits. Our results suggest that affective motives of
   PSM-Compassion (COM) and Self-Sacrifice (SS)-are positively influenced
   by the personality traits of Honesty-Humility, Emotionality, and
   Agreeableness, and negatively by Conscientiousness. In contrast,
   nonaffective PSM motives-Attraction to Policy-Making (APM) and
   Commitment to the Public Interest (CPI)-are positively associated with
   the Openness to Experience trait.},

Abstract = {Co-production is often considered a solution to improve service quality
   and production efficiency, yet research on the reasons why citizens
   participate in the creation and/or implementation of public services is
   still limited to specific sectors. In this article, we study the
   different citizens' motivations discussed in the literature. We
   distinguished two categories of motivations, personal and
   circumstantial. By means of a guided survey, we collected data on these
   different motivations in a Belgian case in the unstudied setting of
   community development. The results show that even in a community
   development case, where material incentives are used to entice citizens
   in a vulnerable socio-economic position to participate, the reasons
   behind co-production are still more diverse and complex than simple
   benefit maximization},

Abstract = {This article examines how Russian privatization helped create the Putin
   political system. During the `who lost Russia' debate in the 1990s,
   American economic advisors were rebuked for allowing a `capture of the
   state' by the oligarchs. A larger time frame reveals that the
   consequences of Russian privatization were quite different from the
   forecasted ones. Because the new class of owners were regarded as
   illegitimate, lacked clear property rights, and ran conglomerates
   immersed in a command economy these owners, that is, oligarchs, were
   easily subdued by the state. As a consequence, there is little chance
   for a coalition of elites to mobilize against Putin. (C) 2017 The

Abstract = {While transparency is viewed as a means of improving citizen
   understanding of public policies and eliciting policy support, there are
   few empirical assessments of these relationships. We address this gap in
   the literature using an experimental design. We predict that exposure to
   less detailed policy information improves policy understanding, and that
   this effect varies according to presentation format. Further, we predict
   that policy understanding will correspond to greater policy support.
   Using a nationally representative panel of US citizens we find that
   exposure to detailed policy information decreases policy understanding
   and that the effect varies by presentation format. In addition, policy
   understanding is negatively associated with policy support. These
   findings culminate in a positive indirect effectincreasing detail
   reduces understanding, which in turn is negatively associated with
   policy support. However, interestingly, policy support was highest among
   those who felt they understood the policy best, yet possessed the lowest
   levels of actual understanding.},

Abstract = {Despite the importance of services in international trade and in the
   support of global production activities, studies of the political
   economy of trade liberalization tend to focus on goods trade and the
   preferences of manufacturing firms and their employees. This article
   advocates greater consideration of service firms and services trade in
   political economy models of trade policy. I build my argument around a
   number of stylized facts about US trade in services. The data suggest
   that the United States maintains a comparative advantage in services
   trade, which for standard accounts of trade politics would suggest more
   homogenous support for trade liberalization within the services sector
   compared with manufacturing. However, the politics of services
   liberalization are complicated by the distinct and complex features of
   international trade in services. Tradable services are delivered
   internationally through cross-border trade (often electronically), but
   also through temporary travel and-most importantly for US firms-by a
   commercial presence, that is, foreign direct investment. These features
   of services trade imply that governments have an array of policy tools
   at their disposal with which to protect domestic firms from foreign
   competition. This article documents the relative importance of various
   modes of US trade in services, assesses the relationship between policy
   restrictions and services trade, and discusses how growth in services
   trade may impact firms' trade policy objectives.},

   Explanations of Policy Change},

Abstract = {We analyze morality policy change from the perspective of punctuated
   equilibrium theory (PET) to test whether reform dynamics in this policy
   sector follow a distinct pattern. First, we propose a new measurement
   scheme capturing changes in the intensity of morality policy output.
   Second, we demonstrate that morality policy change is strongly
   punctuated. Finally, and most importantly, we show that the degree of
   policy punctuations varies between different domains of morality policy,
   but not according to institutional features operating on the country
   level, supporting existing PET research, which has discovered similar
   domain-specific dynamics in changes of public spending. Specifically,
   punctuations are particularly pronounced in areas of manifest morality
   policy, that is, policies characterized by strong value conflicts,
   whereas punctuations are less pronounced for latent morality policies,
   that is, policies in which other dimensions of conflict are present next
   to the value dimension. Significant differences in reform dynamics are
   neither discerned for countries belonging to the religious or the
   secular world, nor for countries with majoritarian or consensual
   democracies. The analysis relies on an original dataset capturing
   legislative changes in five manifest (abortion, euthanasia,
   prostitution, pornography, and homosexuality), and three latent morality
   policies (drugs, gambling, and handguns) in 19 European countries
   (1960-2010).},

Abstract = {This article examines how basic socioeconomic and political factors are
   associated with higher levels of cooperation to garner a local
   community's shared green reputation. We analyze panel data on
   participation efforts in a collective voluntary environmental program,
   the Ecological Blue Flag Program, by the entire population of beach
   communities in Costa Rica between 2001 and 2009. Collective voluntary
   environmental programs are relatively new and aim to improve
   environmental performance and shared green reputation through joint
   participation and certification of multisector groups comprising
   businesses, governmental institutions, and nongovernmental
   organizations. Our results indicate that higher levels of
   within-community cooperation for shared green reputation are more likely
   in seashore localities with lower income inequality and/or a higher
   number of businesses. These findings run counter to research suggesting
   these same characteristics are associated with lower levels of
   cooperation in the management of common pool natural resources such as
   fisheries and forests. We also find that within-community cooperation is
   positively correlated with a greater proportion of expatriates from
   industrialized countries and/or with higher levels of democratic
   political participation.},

Abstract = {Settlers flocking to boomtowns on the American western frontier were
   faced with the same task that communities in weak states across the
   globe face in contemporary times: self-governance. Peer sanctions can
   enforce cooperation in these environments, but their efficacy depends on
   the social networks that transmit information from peer to peer. The
   author uses a game-theoretic model to show that peripheral network
   positions can generate such strong incentives to misbehave that
   persistent cheating occurs in equilibrium. The model reveals that groups
   maintaining high levels of cooperation that face shocks to their
   strategic environment or to their network can ratchet down into less
   cooperative equilibria in which the most peripheral become ostracized.
   Furthermore, population change that features rapid growth, high
   turnover, and enclave settlements can undermine cooperation. The
   insights from this article help to explain the trajectory of cooperation
   in the mining towns of the Wild West in which high levels of cooperation
   deteriorated as the population surged, and help to make sense of why
   only certain nonwhite settlers were targets of hostility and racism.},

Abstract = {This article aims at exploring how `super-diversity' can cover aspects
   of current debates that traditional ways of understanding identity and
   multiculturalism could not. I start by engaging with Gilles Deleuze's
   differential ontology, which conceptualises difference as an inherent
   feature of identity and not some `issue' brought by migration flows. I
   then outline super-diversity's potential implications for diversity
   management, with particular attention to the case of Roma minorities in
   Europe. The main argument is that super-diversity can provide a
   promising framework to address some of multiculturalism's constraints,
   if we focus on the new kind, rather than the new level, of complexity.},

Abstract = {For many sub-national autonomous territories where
   traditional-historical groups ('old minorities') migration is a stable
   and increasingly important reality. From the perspective of the
   autonomous province of Bozen/Bolzano in Italy (South Tyrol), I will
   analyse whether the interests and claims of old and new minority groups
   are in permanent conflict and tension, or whether they can develop
   through various forms of synergy and collaboration. The aim of this
   contribution is to provide deeper insights into the governance of
   superdiversity by looking at the perspective of sub-national units
   characterised by the presence of historical groups and new migrant
   communities.},

Journal = {PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION},

Number = {3},
Pages = {623-637},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Although scholars have assessed how the electoral connection of
   legislators and chief executives affects their support for performance
   measurement, we know less about how electoral considerations might
   influence agency administrators' focus on performance measurement. I
   suggest that independently elected administrators' attention to their
   agency's performance measurement system may be conditional on the
   likelihood that their efforts in this area will help them realize their
   electoral goals. Because there is a greater electoral incentive to focus
   on performance issues when government performance is deficient, elected
   administrators should be as likely as, if not more likely than, their
   non-elected counterparts to focus on performance measurement when the
   government is performing poorly and less likely to do so when the
   government is performing well. I find evidence that supports this
   expectation. This article provides insight into the implications of
   electoral incentives for management decisions.},

Abstract = {This introduction to the special section on memories of 1989 calls for a
   closer analysis of various ways in which narratives of the democratic
   breakthrough in East Central Europe develop at the transnational,
   national, and vernacular levels. The four case studies in this section
   show that the liberal view of 1989 has been neither institutionalized
   nor internalized as its most common understanding. Instead, we observe a
   divergence of interpretations, the replacement of 1989 with other
   symbolic dates, its non-existence in the working memory of Western
   Europeans, as well as disappointments, frustrations, or nostalgia for
   socialism in East Central Europe.},

Title = {Discursive Agency: (Re-)Conceptualizing Actors and Practices in the

Abstract = {Interpretive discourse analysis commonly claims to address the
   interrelation between actors and discourses. However, the analytical
   focus of most approaches is on structures (discourses) while much less
   attention is paid to agency. This paper explicitly addresses discursive
   agency in two steps. First, we systematically review theoretical and
   analytical dimensions of agency in existing interpretive discourse
   analysis approaches. This review reveals a set of shared assumptions;
   most notably a concept of trialectic agency emphasizing the constitution
   of agency among the individual, the (discursive) structures, and the
   researcher's interpretation. Second, we propose an analytical heuristic,
   the Discursive Agency Approach, which is developed on the basis of the
   review and own empirical data. The proposed approach consists of four
   elements: (1) policy discourses, (2) political institutions, (3) agents
   defined via a set of characteristics, and (4) strategic practices. This
   approach is meant to facilitate a systematic exploration of agency under
   a discourse perspective, tackling the question of how a policy is
   constituted through the agency ascribed to its proponents in dynamic
   discursive processes, and how actors acquire political relevance through
   discursive means. To enable this goal, we propose distinct research
   steps and associated methods that link the approach to existing means of
   analysis.},

Abstract = {This study examines whether transnational terrorist attacks impact the
   political survival of leaders. We argue that external security threats,
   such as those from transnational terrorist incidents, can undermine
   incumbent target governments by exposing foreign policy failures and
   damaging society's general well-being. Yet, terrorism may not
   destabilize democratic governments as a result of citizens rallying
   around their elected leaders in threatening times. Focusing on Archigos'
   survival leadership data and International Terrorism: Attributes of
   Terrorist Events' terrorism data for the 1968-2004 period, we find that
   autocrats who experience higher instances of transnational terrorist
   attacks are more likely to exit power. Democrats, however, are
   relatively secure to the destabilizing influence of transnational
   terrorism.},

Abstract = {The politics of migration has become increasingly prominent as a site of
   struggle. However, the active subjecthood of people on the move in
   precarious situations is often overlooked. Irregular migration struggles
   raise questions about how to understand the agency of people who are
   marginalised. What does it mean to engage people produced as irregular'
   as active subjects of trans-border politics? And what new research
   strategies can we employ to this end? The articles presented in this
   Special Issue of Politics each differently explore how actions by or on
   behalf of irregular/ised migrants involve processes of subjectivity
   formation that imply a form of agency. Collectively we explore how
   irregular migration struggles feature as a site marked by active
   subjects of trans-border politics. We propose a research agenda based on
   tracing those processes - both regulatory, activist, and everyday - that
   negotiate and contest how an individual is positioned as an irregular
   migrant'. The ethos behind such research is to explore how the most
   marginalised individuals reclaim or reconfigure subjecthood in ambiguous
   terms.},

   Firstly, theoretical and international backgrounds of the topic are

   municipal policing. Here, a tendency of nationalisation can be observed,
   but from the 1980s the framework of the municipal policing has evolved.
   Thirdly, the mixed nature of the Hungarian municipal policing is
   analysed which system can be characterise as a ``quasi police{''} system

Abstract = {This study examines the relationship between managerial networking and
   the fiscal health of city governments in the United States that faced a
   serious budget crisis during and immediately after the Great Recession.
   Do public managers' ties with external stakeholders help improve the
   fiscal health of these cities? Or do these ties bind city officials to
   decisions that further exacerbate the fiscal difficulties of their
   governments? These questions are answered using data from a survey of
   municipal governments across the United States with a population of
   50,000 or more, and financial data from Comprehensive Annual Financial
   Reports (CAFR) covering more than 200 cities and for three fiscal years.
   Using instrumental variable regression to address possible common source
   bias and simultaneous causation, there is strong evidence that an
   external networking orientation is associated with a decline in city
   government fiscal health, whether the measure used is perceptual or
   CAFR-based.},

Abstract = {The Chilean province of Concepcion was little prepared for the impact of
   the earthquake and subsequent tsunami that took place on February 27,
   2010. Because of the destruction of roads and bridges, the power outage,
   and ineffective communication, each neighborhood was essentially left to
   fend for itself with virtually no assistance from local and provincial
   authorities. Within the first 24 hours, panic hit, with stores being
   looted and local politicians calling for a military presence, and
   neighbors joined together to protect their property from looting gangs,
   even in the poorest neighborhoods. Most of these committees were not
   based on the traditional neighborhood councils that had emerged since
   the return to electoral democracy in 1990. In the emergency camps
   established by families that had lost their houses, the new leaders
   established a more autonomous and horizontal leadership style in their
   search for decent living conditions and a definitive housing solution.
   At first glance, these new leaders appear to be a return to the
   autonomous popular organizations that emerged during the dictatorship
   but were demobilized under electoral democracy. Ironically, the
   earthquake and the new center-right government seem to have offered a
   political opportunity for the reemergence of a more autonomous civil
   society.},

Abstract = {Portrayals of China's bureaucratic behavior tend to emphasize either
   streamlined central control via top-down directives emanating from a
   Leninist system, or a highly fragmented organization characterized by
   continuous horizontal bargaining. While both views have merit, they miss
   important but little-recognized dynamics of Chinese bureaucratic
   behavior. Examination of the 30-year evolution of a single organization,
   China's 863 Program, allows us a unique look inside the black box of
   decision making. First, we highlight a largely unrecognized mechanism of
   top-down control: a signal-response process that fosters substantial
   uncertainty for officials in the system. Second, our case highlights a
   circumstance in which reformers made radical movesdeployed as a band-aid
   layer of rational-instrumentalismto meet a perceived external security
   threat. These moves demonstrate efforts to incorporate Weberian norms,
   and suggest sources of dynamism and learning in a hybrid adaptive
   bureaucracy.},

Abstract = {Political appointees in executive government have received increased
   scholarly attention in recent years. However, few studies have covered
   non-Westminster systems, and apart from classifications that systemize
   variation in assignments, theorizing about appointees has been limited.
   Using large-N survey data, the article finds three distinct roles among
   political appointees in Norway: `stand in', `media adviser' and
   `political coordinator'. The article then combines insights from
   research on political appointees with insights from core executive
   studies (CES) to explain why political appointees perform one role or
   another. The empirical results support the notion that roles of
   appointees within the core executive depend on where they sit,
   supporting the asymmetric power model within CES. The results also show
   that appointees' roles within the executive depend on their personal
   experience, supporting the notion of a resource exchange between
   ministers and their appointees in the mould of the resource-dependency
   perspective within CES.},

Abstract = {Ministerial advisers are said to strengthen the political control of
   bureaucracy. Using a comparative case design, this article investigates
   this claim by studying the roles of ministerial advisers in government
   coordination in Denmark and Sweden. The article demonstrates how the
   roles of advisers differ in coordination: Swedish advisers directly
   control government coordination through hierarchical authority. The
   roles of advisers and bureaucrats are functionally differentiated in
   coordination. In contrast, Danish advisers play a more indirect role in
   coordination. Rather than controlling coordination, they serve to
   reproduce the functional politicization of the permanent bureaucracy in
   government coordination. The findings underline the relevance of
   including advisers in the future study of government coordination. The
   analysis is based on 48 interviews with advisers and top civil servants
   in Denmark and Sweden.},

Abstract = {International trade directly influences US presidential elections. We
   explore the electoral implications of the increasing tradability of
   services and the large US surplus in services trade. Our paper builds on
   prior work showing that job insecurity from import competition in
   manufacturing diminishes political support for incumbents. We construct
   novel measures of the tradability of an industry using
   establishment-level data covering nearly all US economic activity. We
   find increases in incumbent party vote shares in counties with large
   numbers of workers in high-skilled tradable services as well as goods,
   and decreases in counties with high employment in low-skilled
   manufacturing. Incumbent parties are particularly vulnerable to losing
   votes in swing states with many low-skilled manufacturing workers. In
   national-level models, we show for the first time that increasing
   imports (exports) are associated with decreasing (increasing)
   presidential incumbent vote shares. The national-level effects are large
   and politically consequential. We also find an Electoral College
   incentive to protect the manufacturing sector and to oppose trade
   agreements.},

Abstract = {This article reveals Russian paradox: the combination of high level of
   corruption with strong and relatively effective government. In the focus
   of attention lies the examination of relations between the corruption
   and the processes of socio-political transformations of the end of the
   XX beginning of the XXI centuries and the particularities of the
   corruption integration into the government of Russia. Basing upon the
   concept of the corruption as a political and administrative rent the
   author arrives to the conclusion about the formation of the corrupt
   model of governance in Russia. The article analyses factors which give
   relative efficiency to the Russian model of corrupt governance as well
   as the costs and contradictions of it. The author also reaches the
   conclusion that corruption-oriented model of governance is prospectless
   and makes a point that effective anti-corruption measures in Russia can
   be carried out only in case of current regime change and consequent
   realization of democratic, market and administrative reforms. (C) 2017

Abstract = {This article joins together recent work in rhetorical political analysis
   with methodological advances made in intellectual history to prospect a
   historical and linguistic approach to public reason and deliberation. It
   is offered as an alternative to currently dominant approaches that
   emphasise philosophical and normative understanding, especially those
   associated with the deliberative turn' in democratic theory. This
   alternative approach is developed by identifying two points of
   methodological divergence between a rhetorical and philosophical
   orientation to deliberation. First, a rhetorical approach will study
   standards of deliberation that are endogenous to a society instead of
   imposing them on the basis of one form of philosophical reason or
   another. Second, rhetorical analysis does not conceive of deliberation
   as consensus reached through non-coerced reflection but as the strategic
   deployment of shared linguistic resources in a context of contingently
   unfolding non-linguistic events.},

Abstract = {A critical analysis of two conflicts associated with the displacement
   resulting from gentrification in Santiago, Chile, reveals that this
   displacement affects both the urban poor and the middle classes and that
   the common adversary is the real estate sector. The subjective
   experience of the groups involved can be understood in terms of the
   concept of territorial disqualification, a threat both to their
   positions in the social structure and to the recognition of the
   identities, personal and collective, that have been constructed about
   particular neighborhoods. The subject defended in struggles against
   territorial disqualification is the community. While class positions,
   specific demands, and territorial claims differ significantly, the
   structural framework in which neoliberal urbanism develops makes
   possible a confluence of class organizations that are susceptible to
   generating interclass strategies of opposition.},

Abstract = {This article proposes a critique of militant democracy, defined as the
   legal restriction of democratic freedoms for the purpose of insulating
   democratic regimes from the threat of being overthrown by legal means.
   The argument we advance is that this conceptual framework is inadequate
   for addressing the problem it is meant to solve, since restricting the
   freedom of its supposed enemies may make democracy more prone to
   authoritarian abuse, rather than less, in the long run. To demonstrate
   this, we first turn to the theory of militant democracy, both in its
   earliest articulations by Karl Loewenstein and Carl Schmitt, and in the
   more recent theoretical literature on this topic. In the second part, we
   show that the inherent arbitrariness of militant democracy has been
   reflected in a concrete expansion in the range of targets to which the
   logic of militant democracy has been applied: from fascism during the
   inter-war years, to communism during the Cold War, up to several forms
   of religious practice in the present day.},

Journal = {WORLD POLITICS},

Volume = {69},

Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Are large landowners, especially those engaged in labor-dependent
   agriculture, detrimental to democratization and the subsequent survival
   of democracy? This assumption is at the heart of both canonical and
   recent influential work on regime transition and durability. Using an
   original panel data set on the extent of labor-dependent agriculture in
   countries across the world since 1930, the author finds that
   labor-dependent agriculture was indeed historically bad for democratic
   stability and stunted the extension of suffrage, parliamentary
   independence, and free and fair elections. However, the negative
   influence of labor-dependent agriculture on democracy started to turn
   positive around the time of democracy's third wave. The dual threats of
   land reform and costly domestic insurgencies in that period-often with
   more potent consequences under dictators-plausibly prompted landowners
   to push for democracy with strong horizontal constraints and favorable
   institutions that could protect their property more reliably over the
   long term than could dictatorship. The shift in support for democracy by
   labor-dependent landowners is a major untold story of democracy's third
   wave and helps explain the persistent democratic deficit in many new
   democracies.},

   undertakes to provide a detailed picture of the structure of the system
   but in the same time paying special attention to interpersonal relations
   and the work through interpersonal nexuses. According to our hypotesis a
   deep, informal network lies between the authorities and institutions.
   Present study also involves the dimension of social connections in the
   interpretation. We hypothesize that centralization tendencies are not
   affecting the local system of child protection significantly because it
   is a dinamic system with an operation based on the relations of

Abstract = {This paper considers the implications for social rights when welfare
   provision is devolved from the state to the social economy. We bring
   together the idea of social rights as claims that entail
   institutionalised public duties, and that of the social economy as an
   institution for welfare provision based on voluntary, associational
   principles. After clarifying the tensions in rights provision within an
   associational framework, we argue that future research should consider
   how social economy organisations may shoulder collective duties
   independently, or how they could enhance social rights within the
   paradigm of the welfare state.},

Abstract = {The issue of local government reform is high on the agenda in many
   developed democracies. The discussion is often framed in narrow terms,
   focusing on functional efficiency. In this article, we construct a
   normative argument for local government that values local government
   because it fulfills morally desirable purposes in itself, regardless of
   its functional efficiency. The argument is that the same foundational
   value - individual autonomy - constitutes the normative underpinning of
   both democracy and the right to local self-government. The implication
   is that if we value democracy, we must defend a strong and
   constitutionally protected local government.},

Abstract = {Critics of donor-funded democracy promotion claim that these programs
   are frequently designed to reproduce social and governmental models
   drawn from developed countries and imposed on the recipient country
   without regard to local conditions, with experts parachuted in to
   provide guidance based on international best practices. The critique
   focuses on first-generation development with a neutral, technical focus,
   whereas democracy promotion has evolved toward a more politically
   engaged approach to programmingwhat we label as second-generation and,
   more recently, third-generation development practices. We apply this
   distinction to the area of legislative strengthening (LS) by describing
   its history from the post-World War II period to the present and provide
   examples of LS projects to support the argument. The challenge is to
   combine valuable insights from best practices from decades of experience
   while adapting them through political engagement with local partners and
   with bilateral donors.},

Abstract = {Politics in time has recently gained in scholarly attention,
   particularly in the area of EU studies. This article adds to this
   literature by arguing that differences in administrative and political
   actors' time horizon are particularly pronounced in the EU multilevel
   system and showing how this can be used strategically by actors. This
   matters because unlike national administrations with long-term
   perspectives, the EU Commission is endowed with powers in policy-making.
   This combination allows it to turn time into power by opting for
   strategies that yield benefits after a couple of years. The argument is
   illustrated with two long-term strategies employed by the Commission in
   controversial EU equal treatment policy-making.},

Abstract = {This article examines the transposition of the Cross-Border Patients'
   Rights Directive 2011/24/EU (the Directive) in two systems of the
   European Union, Austria and Bulgaria. The specific purpose of the paper
   is to examine and explicate the transposition output in the two cases,
   from a resource perspective. In doing so, the piece studies the
   implications of the socio-economic cleavage in the Union on the nature
   and contents of transposition texts in rich and poor systems. Health
   care sector resources' impact on transposition is examined in detail.
   This factor is derived from the provisions of the Directive and
   identified as critical for the interpretation of the Directive in the
   context of the examined systems. The study's findings establish a
   convergence between the two systems. In spite of divergent sector
   resources, transposition strategies in both cases followed a
   protectionist logic and served to restrict unlimited patient mobility,
   though to a different extent.},

Abstract = {While increasing trade and foreign direct investment, international
   trade agreements create winners and losers. Our paper examines the
   distributional consequences of preferential trade agreements (PTAs) at
   the firm level. We contend that PTAs expand trade among the largest and
   most productive multinationals by lowering preferential tariffs. We
   examine data covering the near universe of US foreign direct investment
   and disaggregated tariff data from PTAs signed by the United States. Our
   results indicate that US preferential tariffs increase sales to the
   United States from the most competitive subsidiaries of multinational
   corporations operating in partner countries. We also find increases in
   market concentration in partner countries following preferential
   liberalization with the United States. By demonstrating that the gains
   from preferential liberalization are unevenly distributed across firms,
   we shed new light on the firm-level, economic sources of political
   mobilization over international trade and investment policies.},

Abstract = {This article addresses two interrelated critiques of
   participatory-deliberative democratic institutions: that they are beset
   by problems of scale and that they achieve weak policy impact. This
   article tests these criticisms through the case of the UK Sustainable
   Communities Act (SCA), a multi-level process that is relatively strongly
   institutionalized. The evidence lends qualified support to these
   critiques. The article differentiates between contextual factors,
   related to the attempt to institutionalize participatory-deliberative
   processes within existing socioeconomic and political structures, and
   design factors to do with institutional and process design. The case of
   the SCA calls for caution about the claim that multi-level
   participatory-deliberative processes can overcome problems of scale and
   policy impact, but the question remains open. The article ends by
   suggesting that expectations of direct policy impact might be too high.
   Rather than determinants of policy, multi-level
   participatory-deliberative processes might function best as
   agenda-setters.},

Abstract = {Large-N studies of civil war overwhelmingly consider the state-specific
   structural conditions that make conflict likely. Meanwhile, policymakers
   often ignore these factors and instead search for patterns among the
   behavioral triggers of violence. This article combines these approaches.
   I use conflict narratives from the International Crisis Group's
   CrisisWatch publications to cross-validate structural analyses of civil
   conflict and confirm the mechanisms that lead to outbreaks of violence
   in conflict-prone countries. I then correct for selection bias in the
   narrative data with an underlying model of conflict likelihood. I find
   that several indicators thought to be causally related to civil conflict
   do indeed continue to have an effect after selection. However, the
   narrative data overemphasizes both the importance of several
   low-intensity, separatist conflicts within developed democracies and the
   potential for conflict among oil-rich states. These analyses highlight
   the importance of combining structural, large-N analyses with
   qualitative assessments of conflict zones. My findings also provide
   support for a state-capacity explanation of conflict behavior.},

Title = {A genealogy of metatheory in IR: how `ontology' emerged from the
   inter-paradigm debate},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL THEORY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {9},
Number = {1},
Pages = {136-170},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Drawn from the philosophy of science, metatheory is generally defined in
   International Relations (IR) as `theorizing about theory' by examining a
   theory's ontology or epistemology. Yet, despite being available to IR
   since at least the 1940s, metatheory `exploded' into IR only in the
   late-1980s. What explains this sudden proliferation of metatheory in
   IR's literature? This article answers this question by conducting a
   genealogy of metatheory in IR. It begins by offering a four-step
   heuristic guide for conducting a genealogical analysis. Then, bracketing
   IR's traditional historical narratives, it problematizes a tacit
   practice undergirding IR's present use of metatheory: theorizing about
   the `world' using the philosophy of science. Tracing and interpreting
   the transformations of this practice through scholarship from the 1940s
   to the present reveals how metatheory emerged unexpectedly from what is
   now considered to be an outmoded and forgotten event: the inter-paradigm
   debate (IPD) of the mid-1980s. The IPD transformed what had always been
   conceptualized as a single, dynamic world for IR theory, into plural,
   static, theoretical worlds best (meta)theorized through a concept of
   ontology drawn from scientific realism. In sum, this genealogy
   demonstrates the implicit power that explicit theoretical practices
   wield over IR scholars, tacitly conditioning the discipline's conceptual
   possibilities and limits.},

Abstract = {In his autobiography, Thomas Hobbes stated that he wrote his most
   influential work of political theory, Leviathan, to absolve the divine
   laws in response to atrocious crimes being attributed to the commands of
   God. This article attempts to take Hobbes seriously, and to read
   Leviathan as a contribution to the religious politics of the English
   Civil War. I demonstrate Hobbes' appropriation of the religious terms
   and sources characterizing civil-war political discourse, and explore
   these terms and sources both in Hobbes' response to religiously
   motivated politics and in the foundations of his most important
   political ideas. Hobbes emerges from this account as a critic of
   Christian politics and enthusiasm broadly conceived, as a political
   philosopher who employed an Israelite political model, and as an
   erstwhile ally of some of those usually considered his deepest
   opponents.},

Abstract = {Why have peace-building and reconstruction efforts so frequently failed
   to create durable institutions that can deter or withstand resurgent
   violence in volatile sites of cyclical conflict? Extant theory predicts
   that new institutions can help overcome violence and mitigate commitment
   problems in postconflict contexts by reducing uncertainty in inherently
   uncertain environments. By contrast, this article argues that
   postconflict institutions often prove limited in their abilities to
   contribute to durable peace because they offer wartime elites new venues
   in which to pursue conflict-era agendas. Through a micro-analysis of
   efforts to build the rule of law in eastern Democratic Republic of
   Congo, I demonstrate that wartime elites capture and instrumentalize new
   legal institutions to maximize their intra-and inter-organizational
   survival; to pursue economic, military, and political agendas behind the
   scenes; and, in some cases, to prepare for an imminent return to war.},

Abstract = {Several conflict theorists have appropriated Hegel's `struggle for
   recognition' to highlight the healthy dimensions of conflict and to
   explore ways of reaching reconciliation through mutual recognition. In
   so doing, some scholars attend to the interpersonal dimension of
   reconciliation, while others focus on the interstate dimension of
   reconciliation. This paper argues that both approaches miss important
   Hegelian insights into the modern state. Hegel understands that freedom
   must be situated and bounded in order to take a concrete form. He
   believes that concrete freedom and domestic reconciliation create an
   atmosphere that can pressure the state to be more confrontational with
   other states by attaining a stronger individuality. Thus, the common
   concern about freedom among Hegelian states remains a `thin' version of
   communication, vulnerable to such factors as national honor or
   recognition status. Hegel's challenge urges peace-inspired scholars to
   explore ways of achieving concrete freedom and domestic reconciliation
   while simultaneously relieving interstate conflict.},

Abstract = {Fragmentation is a common trait of most Latin-American systems. In
   Argentina the lack of integration among sub systems has a deep impact on
   health care access and financial sustainability, leading to exclusion,
   inefficiency, inequality, lack of transparency in administration and one
   of the highest burdens of household catastrophic out-of-pocket spending
   in Latin America. The national budget, although within the average of
   the region, is insufficient to cover the health care needs of the
   uninsured and to fully address the imbalances in social determinants of
   health. In this article, we first present the organizational and
   financial structure of the health care system. We then analyse the
   system dynamics and local health care history, and we explore a few
   possible lines of action and reforms for the next decade. This analysis
   may provide lessons for other countries in the region with analogous
   contexts and facing similar challenges.},

Abstract = {This paper builds upon previous work that has sought to use ontological
   security to understand problematic and violent state practices, and how
   they relate to the securitizing of identity. Yet like much (although not
   all) work which has utilized it in International Relations theory, the
   application of ontological security theory (OST) to state `drives' has
   provided only a superficial unpacking of `the state'. Further, while OST
   scholars have examined environmental or background conditions of `late
   modernity', and how these conditions facilitate anxiety and uncertainty
   for agents, the content of such factors can be further explicated by
   placing OST in conversation with one particular systemic account.
   Alongside `the state' and `late modernity', the paper therefore explores
   several complementary sites shaping the ontological security seeking
   process of, within and around states. The paper reads the 2000s
   re-embrace of torture by the United States by examining ontological
   security alongside: (1) the structural level via Laura Sjoberg's
   `gender-hierarchical' argument; (2) the routinized organizational
   processes (via Graham Allison) of the US intelligence community and
   specifically the Central Intelligence Agency; and (3) the narrated
   interplay between public opinion and elite discourses.},

Abstract = {In November 2009, the European Council elected Herman Van Rompuy its
   first standing President, under the terms of the newly-implemented
   Lisbon Treaty. Using the analytical framework developed by Ingeborg
   Tommel to assess the performance of three Commission presidents, this
   contribution examines Van Rompuy's leadership in the European Council
   during two terms in office (2009-2014). First incumbents are generally
   influential in shaping the positions they occupy. Van Rompuy's personal
   qualities helped him meet the demands of an inherently difficult job in
   an extremely challenging situational context. Yet, institutionally, the
   presidency of the European Council is a weak office. It brings
   prominence and close proximity to power, but not the potential of power
   itself. Nevertheless, Van Rompuy was an effective President because he
   understood the formal and informal rules of the game, making a modest
   contribution to leadership in the European Council during a severe
   financial and political crisis.},

Abstract = {The American States during the 2000s adopted several principles in the
   area of transparency and access to information. To achieve change their
   practices has been necessary to develop the respective institutional
   frameworks and implement actions to ensure their effectiveness in a
   digital age, which in turn has increased the demand for information from
   the citizens. In Ecuador, from May 2004, it has Organic Law of
   Transparency and Access to Public Informatio; in February 2007 declared
   as a State policy the combat against corruption in public
   administration, and in 2008 with the new Constitution of the Republic,
   the Function of Transparency and Social Control, among others, is
   created to protect the exercise and enforcement of rights, prevent and
   combat corruption and to promote and encourage citizen participation.
   This is a case study about Ecuador for the period 2004-2014, which
   analyzes the progress and degree of coherence between the rules and
   instruments developed and actions implemented from the State
   Institutions, regarding transparency in public administration. It
   identifies best practices and contrasts with the results obtained in
   international measurements.
   It was used a qualitative and documentary analysis, with a scheme based
   on a diachronic comparison. Two phases were determined, taking into
   account as relevant aspect the Constitutional changes, and these as a
   essential context for the public actions and the institutional changes
   made.
   The identification of best practices is made on the basis of an analysis
   and valuation in binary form, being mainly: technical instruments
   homologated, technological systems of varying complexity, creation of
   public spaces for citizen participation, community spaces, inclusive
   regulations, codes of ethics, accessibility and training. It is evident
   that as the institutional framework is developed and the mechanisms and
   tools of government transparency are strengthened, the perception of
   corruption decreased slightly.
   The research efforts subsequent to this article may focus on outcomes in
   terms of the sustainability of good practices and its relation with the
   perception of corruption.},

Title = {Public Policy Implementation: Lessons for the Design. Analysis of Cases

Journal = {REVISTA DEL CLAD REFORMA Y DEMOCRACIA},

Abstract = {The article analyzes public policy implementation on, public management
   modernization and health care reform occurred in Chile between 1990s and
   2010s decades. The analysis is based on the framework provided by
   Hasenfeld and Brock (1991), whom identify the following main driving
   forces: the pursuit of rationality, the organization policy-fit, the
   bureaucratic discretion and adaptation, power relation, and leadership
   and competence. This work inquires whether those driving forces have
   been present in the implementation of the analyzed policies and, to do
   that, it concentrate on the political management of them, the readiness
   of the basic conditions, factors and necessary circumstances for the
   operation of the mentioned policies.
   The document identifies lessons to be considered for the design of
   public interventions. It concludes that driving forces influencing the
   public policy implementation process varies in correspondence to the
   government sector of activity they belong to. Because of that,
   implementation would not be a process that concrete in the same manner
   in the different areas of government activity. That implies that public
   policy design should consider this characteristic of the implementation
   process and, mainly, in the definition of the characteristics and
   profile of those who would be in charge of putting in practice the
   public policy.
   The unit of analysis is the inter-organizational network in which these
   public policies have been implemented. Information comes from official
   documents, press clippings, academic literature and 142 interviews to
   key actors of these policies.},

   Tactics},
Journal = {TERRORISM AND POLITICAL VIOLENCE},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {29},
Number = {5},
Pages = {830-851},
Abstract = {Targeted killings have become a central component of counter-terrorism
   strategy. In response to the unprecedented prevalence of this strategy
   around the world, numerous empirical studies have recently examined
   whether ``decapitating{''} militant groups with targeted killings is
   strategically effective. This study builds on that research program by
   examining the impact of targeted killings on militant group tactical
   decision-making. Our empirical strategy exploits variation in the attack
   patterns of militant groups conditional on whether a government's
   targeted killing attempt succeeded against them operationally. In both
   the Afghanistan-Pakistan and Israel-West Bank-Gaza Strip theaters,
   targeted killings significantly alter the nature of militant group
   violence. When their leaderships are degraded with a successful strike,
   militant groups become far less discriminate in their target selection
   by redirecting their violence from military to civilian targets. We then
   analyze several potential causal mechanisms to account for these results
   and find strongest evidence that targeted killings tend to promote
   indiscriminate organizational violence by empowering lower level members
   with weaker civilian restraint.},

Title = {When, why and how institutional change takes place: a systematic review
   and a future research agenda on the importance of policy
   entrepreneurship in macroeconomic bureaucracies},
Journal = {POLICY AND SOCIETY},

Abstract = {Political science and public policy scholars have long emphasised the
   importance of understanding institutional change and policy
   entrepreneurship. This review article is a response to this call in the
   context of reform in macroeconomic bureaucracies. Adopting a systematic'
   approach to reviewing the literature, this paper investigates when, why
   and how institutional reform in key monetary and fiscal macroeconomic
   bureaucracies (i.e. central banks, treasuries, and ministries of
   finance) takes place. It reviews 29 selected articles on reforms in
   these bureaucracies published in Thomson \& Reuters Web of Knowledge's
   Social Science Citation Index, JSTOR, Sage and Wiley databases from 1980
   to 2015. It shows that the current state of knowledge about
   institutional change in key macroeconomic bureaucracies is characterised
   by a lack of sufficient bridge-building among variants of institutional
   approaches as well as between institutional theory and public policy
   theory, resulting in persistent knowledge gaps. Against this background,
   the present review contributes to the body of knowledge on this topic in
   two main areas. First, it reviews the literature systematically to
   provide an overview of the key theoretical and empirical characteristics
   of when, how and why institutional reform takes place in these
   bureaucracies. Second, it identifies gaps and future avenues of research
   to stimulate progress in this important area of study.},

Title = {Larger and more law abiding? The impact of enlargement on compliance in
   the European Union},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF EUROPEAN PUBLIC POLICY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {24},
Number = {2, SI},
Pages = {197-215},
Abstract = {Although enlargement increases the preference diversity in the European
   Union (EU), this paper shows that enlargement has not led to a
   deterioration of compliance with EU law. In three of the EU's four
   enlargement rounds, the new member states comply better with EU law than
   the old member states. The Southern enlargement in the 1980s is the only
   one that led to a substantial increase in non-compliance. Particularly
   surprising for the main compliance theories, which focus on state power,
   adjustment costs, administrative capacities or legitimacy, is the good
   performance of the post-communist Central and Eastern European new
   member states after the Eastern enlargement in the 2000s. Our analysis
   suggests that the use of pre-accession conditionality in the Eastern
   enlargement explains why these new members perform so well - unlike
   their Southern counterparts who faced equally unfavourable country-level
   conditions for compliance.},

Abstract = {Human rights education and training have become one of the principal
   pillars of the international human rights movement. Based on a
   comprehensive survey of training resources and approaches developed for
   police internationally, this article concludes that they principally
   follow a dry information transmission model using a traditional
   lecture-style pedagogy. Looking across the large body of training
   material available internationally, it appears that there is a fixed
   body of resource material that circulates and gets recycled, the
   regularity of its employment rather than its quality now bequeathing it
   the title best practice. Human rights training has taken on a
   ritualistic quality. Rather than simply assuming that such ritualism is
   indicative of mindlessness or cynicism, however, this article treats it
   as a point of curiosity. It asks: How is it that a template of action
   has developed and is continuing to expand, with the support of a range
   of stakeholders when it evidently falls short on key dimensions? Why
   continue to repeat a performance that seems so ill conceived? The
   article proposes eight explanations for the persistence of ritualized
   practices in human rights training for police.},

Title = {Gendering the extraverted state: the politics of the Kenyan sex workers'
   movement},
Journal = {REVIEW OF AFRICAN POLITICAL ECONOMY},

Volume = {44},
Number = {154},
Pages = {595-610},
Abstract = {The Kenyan sex worker movement occupies a peculiar place in Kenyan
   politics - it is an important partner in different programmes and
   policies in the health sector, but individuals selling sex still
   disproportionately suffer from different forms of state and public
   violence and are often marginalised. This article argues that due to the
   gendered nature of the Kenyan state's extraversion processes and the
   resulting dual accountability to national and foreign sovereigns, the
   Kenyan state's approach to gender issues is inconsistent and thus
   produces a situation where social movements with a gender rights agenda
   can be both included and excluded from the national political scene. The
   article also explores how the sex worker movement builds on this duality
   of the Kenyan state when making its strategic choices about engagement
   with national policy bodies.},

Journal = {CRITICAL POLICY STUDIES},

Number = {3},
Pages = {373-380},
Abstract = {The literature on political science and public policy offers many
   explanations for why legal professionals can come to the forefront of
   political processes, as it has remarkably happened in the current
   Brazilian crisis. Building on a political sociology approach, namely
   that set forth by Bourdieu, I treat the legal profession and the state
   as interconnected `fields' and find three signs of change in their
   co-structuration in post-1988 Brazil. These findings shed new light on
   the public prominence of figures like Sergio Moro, Deltan Dallagnol, and
   Julio Marcelo de Oliveira and the emergence of what appears to be a `new
   Republic of Lawyers'. Yet, they also pose questions and concerns about
   the risk this represents to the sustainability of democratic politics in
   that country.},

Title = {Higher education governance in France, Germany, and Italy: Change and
   variation in the impact of transnational soft governance},
Journal = {POLICY AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {36},
Number = {1},
Pages = {67-88},
Abstract = {There is a consensus that transnational soft governance has unleashed
   the forces of change in higher education. However, individual national
   HE systems are still anchored in country-specific regulatory regimes,
   which reflect national-historical, institutional, and cultural
   developments. Against this background, three crucial questions guide our
   study: How does the state react to transnational pressures for change?
   How is transnationally inspired policy change `digested' by the
   preexisting country-specific governance structures? And to what extent
   have national HE systems converged on a common governance model? To
   address these questions, we conduct a multi-level comparative analysis
   of developments in Germany, France, and ltaly. We first break down the
   concept of higher education governance into sub-dimensions and derive
   concrete policy indicators for three historically embedded governance
   ideal types. Drawing on historical institutionalism and institutional
   isomorphism, we explore how historical legacies and transnational
   communication have impacted policy pathways over the past 30 years. We
   graphically illustrate the policy trajectories using our `governance
   triangles', which encompass the balance of power between multiple
   actors, including the state and universities, university management and
   the academic profession, and external stakeholders.},

Abstract = {The article identifies changes in Namibia's society linked to China's
   new role. To understand such changes, it is important to avoid isolating
   Chinese actors' from their host society. The author analyses links
   between Chinese and Namibian actors in three domains: soft power',
   Chinese traders and the construction industry. In all three, the
   presence of Chinese actors does not simply change Namibia's relations
   with the world. It has important repercussions on Namibian society, it
   influences the distribution of capital within Namibia and it engenders
   shifts in the internal balance of power. Since Chinese influence does
   not remain external, the line between Chinese' and Namibian' actors has
   long become blurred - turning Namibian political elites into constituent
   parts of the external' dynamics they are charged with regulating.},

Title = {Learning in the bath-tub: the micro and macro dimensions of the causal
   relationship between learning and policy change},
Journal = {POLICY AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {36},
Number = {2},
Pages = {304-319},
Abstract = {Whilst the literature classifies policy learning in terms of types or
   ontological approaches (reflexive and social constructivist learning
   versus rational up-dating of priors), we offer a three-dimensional
   approach to explore the relationships between individual learning,
   learning in groups and the macro-dimension. Our contribution maps most
   (although not all) lively debates in the field on a multi-dimensional
   space and explores the logic of causality from micro to macro. To
   achieve these two aims, we draw on Coleman's bath-tub'. We map learning
   in the bath-tub by considering prominent studies on learning but also,
   in some cases, by exploring and drawing lessons from political science
   and behavioural sciences. By integrating findings in an eclectic way, we
   explain the logic of learning using a single template and suggest
   methods for empirical analysis. This is not a literature review but an
   original attempt to capture the causal architecture of the field,
   contributing to learning theory with findings from mainstream political
   and behavioural sciences.},

Abstract = {The divergent roles of education in predicting environmental support
   among liberals, conservatives, and moderates in the United States are
   explained by integrating ideological-consistency and information-deficit
   models. Increased political polarization among elites has led to
   divergent environmental positions advocated by liberal and conservative
   political and media leaders; it was predicted that education would
   increase public attention to these elite cues and, consistent with the
   ideological-consistency model, increased education would lead to
   attitudes in line with consensual positions endorsed by party elites.
   Across two nationally representative data sets, higher levels of
   education were associated with stronger environmental support among
   liberals and weaker environmental support among conservatives. Moderates
   were predicted to have fewer elite cues on which to base their
   attitudes; consistent with the information-deficit model, higher levels
   of education among moderates were associated with strengthened
   environmental support. A moderated-mediation model supported the
   differential application of these two theories.},

Abstract = {The paper explores newspapers' portrayals of the European Parliament and
   national parliaments (NPs) in European Union (EU) affairs. To understand
   underlying perceptions of journalists, it takes public parliamentary
   activities and looks at their influence on parliaments' news visibility
   in Finland, Germany and the UK in routine periods in 2011 and 2012. This
   is done against the background that parliaments, regarded as ultimate
   legitimisers of state power, depend on the mass media to reach their
   citizenry. However, journalists follow their own agenda in publishing
   parliamentary news. In this regard, they may highlight the
   complementarity, competition or cooperation of parliaments in the EU's
   unique multi-tier environment. Overall, our results suggest that NPs
   correspond stronger with newsmakers' anticipation of readership
   interest. In addition, findings seem to support the assumption that
   parliaments in the EU are mostly perceived as complementary, separate
   legislative branches in EU decision-making.},

Abstract = {Following four elections in three years, on 16 April 2017 Turkish voters
   once again went to the polls - this time under the emergency law
   established after the failed coup attempt of July 2016 - to vote on
   constitutional amendments aimed at replacing the existing parliamentary
   system with an executive presidency. This article reviews the content of
   the proposed constitutional amendments, analyses the campaign including
   the strategies employed by the main political actors in the Yes' and No'
   camps and the resource advantages enjoyed by the ruling party, assesses
   the electoral performance of both sides through a summary of results
   from provincial areas and geographical regions, and considers how
   Turkish politics are likely to take shape under the new system.},

Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL POLITICS},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {26},
Number = {5},
Pages = {915-937},
Abstract = {To contribute to the literature on transnational sustainability
   governance hybrids, a new fisheries certification program in Iceland
   that was originally developed as an alternative to the non-governmental
   Marine Stewardship Council is examined. While this new program appears
   on the surface to constitute a purely nationalistic reaction against
   external non-state authority, the new governance institution is also
   non-governmental and incorporates international norms and institutions.
   To explain this new governance hybrid, Robert Cox's International
   Political Economy approach to production and power is engaged. This
   approach theorizes the co-constitution of the social forces of
   production, state-society complexes and global governance. It is argued
   that the Icelandic case is not entirely localized or unique; it is part
   of a broader movement in which social forces of production respond to
   new market-oriented transnational sustainability governance institutions
   by developing territorially embedded but transnationally legitimate
   alternatives.},

Abstract = {Increased pressure to use policy transfer as a tool has led
   policy-makers to seek it as a solution for innovation efforts. A
   prominent example is Silicon Valley, whose replication attempts have
   been widely criticised. Based on `Silicon Somewhere' cases in Asia,
   Europe and the US, the research suggests that there are different types
   of learning contributing to the success or failure of policy
   transfer.These variations in the learning processes underlying the
   transfer include imitation, trial and-error and adaptive learning.},

Volume = {16},
Number = {5},

Abstract = {The spectrality of gender in conflict narratives and post-conflict
   politics has implications for how the conflict is framed, and therefore
   managed and normalized. This paper adapts Marysia Zalewski's concept of
   `Gender Ghosts' to analyse and deconstruct the dominant memory
   narratives surrounding the legacy of the Troubles in Northern Ireland.
   This approach underscores the precarious-and often marginalized-role of
   women, femininity and masculinity, and gender in the writing and
   rewriting of the conflictual past. Conceptualized as spectrality, this
   precarity can, however, disrupt and challenge exclusively
   ethno-nationalist constructions of the past.},

Title = {`These streets are ours': Mumbai's urban form and security in the
   vernacular},
Journal = {PEACEBUILDING},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {5},
Number = {2, SI},
Pages = {203-217},
Abstract = {This article contributes to the growing literature on the spatial
   dynamics of urban violence in the developing world. It highlights the
   dialectic between urban form, violence and security provision as
   vernacular in nature, shaped by hyperlocal processes and actors. And
   yet, this dialectic is dominated by state and military-centred
   terminology, and continually underpinned by the state's imposition of
   order to constitute the city as a site for legitimate control. This
   materialises as the often arbitrary recognition of one area as `at the
   margins', and not another, as the recognition of one group of people as
   `slum dwellers' or illegal residents, and not others, or as the
   recognition of some individuals as criminal, and not others. Using
   detailed case study material from a group of inner-city neighbourhoods
   in Mumbai, India, the article suggests that urban form in its physical,
   political and historical characterisations not only influences how
   vigilante protection operates, but also interacts in a non-benign manner
   with the mechanics by which the state endeavours to control violence. As
   such, it shapes who is vulnerable to violence, how vulnerable they are,
   and why. This speaks directly to the nature of security provision
   witnessed across the cities of the developing world.},

Abstract = {Starting in the 1990s, almost all Western democracies recognized
   same-sex partnerships within just over two decades. This study examines
   which factors accelerated or decelerated these legal changes. It focuses
   on the effects of several facets of culture: attitudes towards
   homosexuality in general; attitudes towards gays and lesbians as people;
   and religiosity. An event history analysis of 19 Western countries shows
   that the less tolerant people are of gays and lesbians and the greater a
   country's percentage of regular attendees of religious services, the
   longer the time until a same-sex union law is introduced. The results
   provide new insights into policy effects of culture and point out the
   importance of distinguishing between the various elements of public
   opinion.},

   evidence form the S\&T finance sector},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CHINESE GOVERNANCE},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {2},

Pages = {235-254},
Abstract = {With the deepening of the reform and opening-up process, the National
   Development and Reform Commission, the Ministry of Science and
   Technology, the Ministry of Finance, and other relevant ministries in
   China have jointly promulgated thousands of policies and regulations in
   the last few decades. The objective has been to adjust science and
   technology (S\&T) finance policy tools, and to continually optimize an
   environment of financial support for S\&T innovation and related public
   policies. Studying the diffusion mechanisms of the S\&T finance
   activities in the policy documents jointly issued by these ministries
   cannot only reflect the intersection and linkages between S\&T
   activities and finance and taxation affairs, but can also create a
   scientific and feasible research path for the `black box' that is the
   S\&T finance policy process. Based on a review of policy diffusion
   theory and related literature, and taking China's S\&T finance policy as
   the research subject, 367 central government policies and 3869 local
   government policies issued between 1981 and 2015 were collected using
   the Tsinghua University Government Documents Information System (GDIS).
   By analyzing the external attributes of the policy literature network,
   and the timing of keywords used by the internal tools of the policy
   literature, the process and characteristics of the policy diffusion of
   S\&T achievements transformation were observed along the four dimensions
   of intensity, breadth, speed, and direction.},

Abstract = {Glenn's (2000) assertion on institutional intersectionality, relative to
   other research on intersectionality, has not been substantively
   explored. Using a case study analysis of three AIDS service
   organizations serving primarily women of color, I analyze how
   intersectionality is deployed at the institutional level. Extending
   Black feminist standpoint theory constructs of intersectionality, I use
   an interpretive phenomenological approach to thematically identify and
   analyze what the interview discourses revealed about identity
   construction and understanding among indigenous organizations. The
   representative interviewees display a collective understanding of the
   organizations' identity, which captures how intersecting oppressions
   including but not limited to race, gender, and sexuality influence the
   work they do, as they simultaneously work to challenge the impact of
   such oppressions in service to women who are living at various points of
   oppression. Listening to the doers of intersectionality offers a link
   between the theorizing of abstract systems of power, as articulated in
   intersectionality theory, and its practice.},

Title = {Reform and counter-reform in Kenya's land governance},
Journal = {REVIEW OF AFRICAN POLITICAL ECONOMY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {44},
Number = {154},
Pages = {577-594},
Abstract = {Fashioned within conquest, Kenya's current system of land governance was
   designed to facilitate land expropriation for the few and powerful.
   Post-colonial elites never fundamentally reformed this system of
   concentrated legal and administrative power over land and continue to
   benefit from it. This article explores both recent efforts at land
   governance reform and the numerous ways that counter-reform resistance
   is occurring and currently gaining the upper hand. The authors argue
   that powerful networks of beneficiaries create a strong system of
   control and exclusion around land, producing a path dependency against
   reform. The challenge for reformers is to overcome these powerful forces
   arrayed against change with creative mobilisation strategies, leveraging
   not only the 2010 Constitution and the courts but also public outrage
   and stronger civil society organisation. Overall, an important reform
   struggle in Kenya is just beginning, the outcome uncertain and the
   stakes for the country's future very high.},

Abstract = {The paper addresses the issue of the proliferation of the rocket
   technology deployed in guerrilla warfare throughout the Near East. It
   evaluates assumptions and identifies potential regressions with respect
   to the most recent hot phase in the violent conflict between Hezbollah
   and Israel, with a focus on primary methods based on rocket shelling and
   resistance efforts. In comparing the two military forces, Israel emerges
   as the stronger, even if artillery and tactical ballistic missiles with
   warheads containing substances defined as weapons of mass destruction
   were to be deployed as an extreme first measure by Hezbollah, in which
   case an Israeli or American response would destroy at least parts of
   Lebanon.},

Abstract = {The causes and consequences of the Boko Haram insurgency as well as its
   possible solutions have been subjected to different interpretations
   among scholars, politicians, and journalists. Little is known, however,
   about how the Nigerian populace thinks about the uprising. The present
   study contributes to the literature on Boko Haram by analyzing the
   perceptions of Nigerian students vis-a-vis Boko Haram's agenda and the
   government's response. The results demonstrate a north-south divide with
   Christians or Igbo and Muslims or Hausa-Fulani holding different ideas
   on the causes of the crisis, being differently affected by it, and
   slightly disagreeing on the desirability of military government
   responses. In conclusion, perceptions on Boko Haram lay bare
   ethno-religious fault lines reflecting existing grievances, thereby
   possibly undermining efforts at nation-building and peaceful coexistence
   in the multi-ethnic Nigerian society.},

Volume = {38},
Number = {1},
Pages = {41-46},
Abstract = {In an important and stimulating article, Stephan Fruhling and Andrew
   O'Neil argue in favor of applying institutionalist theory to understand
   the alliance politics of U.S. nuclear weapons strategy. But what promise
   does institutionalist theory really hold in thinking about highly
   unequal alliances nested in their particular threat environments? I
   argue that much work remains to be done to determine how much better
   institutionalist variables explain intra-alliance dynamics over
   alternative arguments that emphasize power and interests. Balances of
   power and the nature of threat environments may already account for key
   aspects of extended deterrent relationships supported by the United
   States in Europe and Asia. Ironically, the implication of this more
   traditional interpretation of alliances is that more continuity than
   change will characterize how Donald Trump will manage U.S. security
   relationships as President.},

Abstract = {If a declining state has incentives for preventive war, the rising state
   should have incentives to delay a confrontation until it is stronger. We
   develop the theoretical paradox and examine the July 1914 crisis. Why
   did Russia, rising relative to Germany, not adopt a buying-time
   strategy? We argue that although most Russian leaders hoped to avoid a
   confrontation, they feared that the failure to support Serbia would lead
   to a loss of Russian credibility and a significant setback to Russia's
   position in the Balkans, one that could not easily be reversed, even
   with Russia's expected increase in relative military power.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF STRATEGIC STUDIES},

Volume = {40},

Abstract = {Since 2012, China's assertion of its sovereignty claim to the contested
   Senkaku/Diaoyu Islands has significantly raised the risk of a
   potentially escalatory political-military crisis with Japan. As
   circumstances worsen, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has championed
   major institutional reforms aimed at centralizing Japanese security
   policy decision-making and vastly improving crisis management. This
   article assesses these reforms' significance for ameliorating Japan's
   long-standing internal crisis management weaknesses, and enhancing its
   ability to communicate with Beijing promptly under challenging
   conditions. While significant issues remain, recent developments -
   especially the establishment of Japan's first-ever National Security
   Council - demonstrate significant progress. Bilaterally, however,
   important firebreaks remain conspicuously absent.},

Abstract = {This article proposes a theory of coups that centers around coordination
   and learning. The military is modeled as many officers who only want to
   join a coup if others join as well (i.e., coordination). If the current
   regime has survived past coup attempts, it is common knowledge that it
   is relatively strong (i.e., learning). Combining these effects, once the
   regime survives the first period, officers know that the regime is
   strong enough that they may refrain from staging a coup-regardless of
   how dissatisfied they may become with the status quo-under the mutually
   enforcing expectation that no other officer will rebel. The model has
   other equilibria where coup attempts can occur after the first period,
   allowing for more detailed empirical predictions. The analysis
   highlights several reasons why new regimes are prone to coups, but among
   regimes surviving the initial turmoil, structural factors that would
   seem to predict coup attempts can have an ambiguous effect. The model
   also makes novel predictions about how the ``initial conditions'' of a
   regime as well as what kinds of changes to payoffs affect the likelihood
   of coups.},

Abstract = {The present article elaborates on struggles over the inclusion and
   exclusion of undocumented children and young people in the Swedish
   school system. Through conducting an in-depth case study on the issue of
   access to school in the city of Malmo in Sweden, our analysis
   demonstrates how the right to education for undocumented migrant
   children is subject to a process of struggle between divergent
   discourses on children's human rights. Internal debates at the city
   level of governance are identified around, for example, whether the
   police could be denied access to schools or if contradictory messages
   from various authorities might lead to a legitimacy problem. Other
   questions are the registration of grades when the children concerned are
   reluctant to be put into a register due to the risks involved; and if
   fictitious names could be used on class lists that police officers can
   request. As the article shows, these local struggles are an expression
   of tensions between different levels of governance that are also
   affected by the migration control regime, as regards rights for children
   who are residing irregularly. In that respect, there is a struggle over
   the appropriate legalistic discourse-as in, to which level should it
   make reference. However, actors contesting a restrictive interpretation
   of the right to education also make substantial use of, what we call
   here, an `experiential' discourse-that is, drawing upon the everyday
   experiences and feelings of those whose rights are in question.
   Struggles at the local governance level also have relevance for
   exploring substantial parts of the broader political context in which
   the human rights of undocumented migrants are (de) contested.},

Abstract = {This chapter looks into establishing whether changes in perceived party
   leadership could result in changes in perceived party behaviour and
   voter choice in Ghana. The chapter also offers insights into who the
   likely voters are for the two dominant parties in Ghana, the National
   Democratic Congress and the New Patriotic Party; how their voting
   patterns have evolved, and the causes of the evolution. In order words,
   it investigates class distribution of voters for the two parties. It
   argues that changes in party leadership over the past 20 years have had
   influenced on voter perceptions on party brands and party choice over
   the years.},

Pages = {61-78},
Abstract = {Following the growth of rights-based approaches, an increasing trend
   within recent research has been to establish the diverse opportunities,
   challenges, and potential pitfalls such approaches offer development
   NGOs. Although these areas remain important to current policy and
   practice, they equally stifle further research that is required
   concerning alternative engagements with human rights. This article
   argues that closer attention must be directed towards understanding how
   and why numerous development NGOs have rejected such approaches, whilst
   also embedding a strong and strategic use of rights talk within everyday
   campaign practice. This article draws upon recent qualitative research
   into practitioner responses to rights-based and wider human rights
   practice and, in so doing, enlists an in-depth analysis of two distinct
   subcategories of development NGOs faith-based and political. The article
   proposes two current perspectives on human rights practice and a new and
   alternative engagement with a discourse of rights.},

Volume = {33},
Number = {1, SI},
Pages = {72-87},
Abstract = {This article examines to what extent EU Twinning projects perform well
   enough to have a lasting impact on administrative reform in the Eastern
   neighbourhood. Through tracing the development of the Twinning
   instrument and analysing the implementation of a sample of Twinning
   projects in Moldova, the analysis concludes that Twinning has
   considerable deficits, in terms of both process, as well as outcome
   performance. To address the latter, the article suggests that Twinning
   needs to be better adapted to the framework of the European
   Neighbourhood Policy, as well as the specific demands of the Eastern
   neighbourhood countries.},

Abstract = {The field of ethnic politics has progressed rapidly as the result of new
   data collection efforts. While progress in the field has been hampered
   by the lack of clear theoretical underpinnings and sparse data, new
   datasets have emerged that help scholars think more critically about how
   ethnic power dynamics foster conflict. In the future, however, greater
   effort should be made to collect systematic information on the
   organizations that claim to represent ethnic groups.},

Abstract = {Research on autocracies has gained new momentum in the last decade. One
   element of this research is the observation that some autocracies are
   characterised by structural conditions that are normally conducive for
   democracy. These `anomalous autocracies' have high levels of
   socioeconomic development and democratic neighbour countries. The study
   of these cases might expose factors that are decisive for autocratic
   stability and studying them might give us a better understanding of
   barriers towards democratisation. This paper contributes to the growing
   literature on autocracies by mapping anomalous autocracies during the
   third wave of democratisation, thereby paving the way for systematic
   case selection in future studies. A large-N analysis of 159 cases
   (1975-2008) identifies Belarus, Chile, China, Cuba, Morocco, North
   Korea, Peru, Singapore, Swaziland, Togo and Zimbabwe. In a second step,
   the paper lays out a theoretical framework that centres on actors and
   institutions. Rulers must establish elite-elite and elite-mass
   interaction, and this papers argues that they can do so through
   quasi-compliance of elites and the masses based on traditional
   institutions woven into a dominant party. The paper uses the framework
   to tentatively examine the resilience of authoritarian rule in Swaziland
   and Morocco, two mostdifferent anomalous cases. In both cases, an
   elaborate traditional institution has co-opted government, business and
   rural elites and coordinated interaction within elite circles and with
   the masses, in turn enabling the remarkable regime resilience.},

Abstract = {Venezuela's communal councils are legally sanctioned organs for popular
   participation implemented mostly in poor communities since 2006. The
   promotores integrales, lower-level state employees who assist the
   communal councils in their everyday work, serve as mediators between
   state policies and community politics, and study of their roles and
   perspectives provides important insights into the complexities of
   implementing policies of popular participation and transforming state
   practices in the context of radical social change. While the cultural
   politics and knowledges of the popular sectors have become imprinted on
   the Venezuelan state, attempts to change the state in accordance with
   Bolivarian ideology are subject to intense contestation and struggle.},

Abstract = {This article evaluates the influence of domestic political factors on
   the performance of Cohesion Policy (CP) in new member states. It argues
   that domestic levels of politicisation, within Central and Eastern
   European countries (CEECs) can mediate the outcome-driven performance of
   the policy. Empirically this is probed against original empirical
   evidence from two cases studies: Bulgaria and Romania. Evidence was
   found to suggest that politicisation can affect the management and
   implementation of EU funds delivery. More specifically, political
   patronage damaged managerial continuity and the development of expertise
   in the specialised institutions managing CP. In addition, political
   clientelism was associated with some of the problems found in the
   selection of EU funded projects and, more pre-eminently, with regard to
   the allocation of public procurement contracts. The article discusses
   the wider theoretical implications of its findings and the impact of
   politicisation on the implementation of EU policies in CEECs.},

Abstract = {The results of this collection allow for preliminary conclusions about
   the nuanced interplay between Europeanization and domestication forces
   in European Union (EU) implementation, which await testing in different
   contexts. Some policies lend themselves more to a strategy allowing for
   extensive domestication than others; but to be effective, decentralized
   implementing actors need both power and capabilities. Europeanization
   dynamics strongly influence the direction of domestication of EU policy,
   but if EU requirements are incompatible with national political
   preferences domestication trumps Europeanization. Domestication equally
   prevails if the relationship between EU and national policy is ambiguous
   and frontline implementers have high discretion. The trend toward the
   Europeanization of direct EU enforcement challenges its legitimacy. This
   has implications for EU researchers and practitioners, and suggests
   methodological challenges and future research trajectories for a
   performance perspective on EU implementation. More comparative research
   is needed about the trade-offs between conformance, diversity, and
   performance in EU multilevel governance.},

Abstract = {This article suggests that there is a paradigm crisis in the sub-field
   of cyber deterrence. Cyber deterrence is evolving slowly and
   unpromisingly as a strategic tool in both theory and practice, mostly
   due to the ill-fitting theoretical framework and underlining assumptions
   it borrows from the absolute-nuclear-deterrence context. Therefore, this
   article suggests replacing the accepted yet inadequate paradigm of
   absolute deterrence with a better-fitting
   restrictive-cumulative-deterrence paradigm that draws on the Israeli
   approach to deterrence, introducing it into the cyber domain. The
   article further criticizes the current discourse in the field, including
   some common knowledge' (mis)understandings of cyberspace and the ways it
   affects the possibility of deterrence.},

Pages = {261-279},
Abstract = {The parliamentary elections of 2016, the first following Cyprus' exit
   from the bailout programme, took place in a context of indifference on
   the part of the citizens. Characterised by a decline in bipartisanship,
   a rise in abstention and a more fragmented party system, the elections
   paved the way for the historical entry into parliament of the far right
   party, ELAM. This article sets these outcomes against the broader
   backdrop of the Great Recession while also paying attention to the
   reinvigoration of the cultural dimension of political conflict, with
   potentially significant constraints for future negotiations on the
   Cyprus problem.},

   as emotional actors},
Journal = {POLICY STUDIES},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {38},
Number = {4},
Pages = {392-409},
Abstract = {Most change management initiatives fail. Here, we explore data which
   emerged from a larger research study of local authority chief
   executives' subjective experiences of New Labour's modernisation
   programme and argue that the route to change so often taken by central
   government is detrimental to the successful embedding of change within
   local government because it ignores fundamental human reactions to
   coercion and control. We demonstrate that the seeds of failure are sown
   in the processes adopted as much as in the content of any programme of
   change. A contributory factor to such failures is the apparent reliance
   on the part of legislators that their policies and procedures will
   receive a neutral reaction. We show that the reality is that legislation
   is responded to and enacted by people who react in ways designed to
   defend their own positions, irrespective of the worth of those
   positions. Whether seen as actors in the policy implementation process,
   or as agents of change, chief executives act and react emotionally. This
   contributes to our theoretical understanding of the policy process and
   the practical application of change programmes. This article will be of
   interest to those in central and local government who are promoting or
   responding to change.},

Abstract = {Job rotation is an important tool in public administration that is used
   to enhance learning and diversify experience among employees, while
   reducing opportunities for rent-seeking behaviour. The benefits of job
   rotation, however, may be reduced if carried out too frequently or for
   narrow partisan reasons. Frequent transfers and postings in a civil
   service characterized by life-long contracts negatively impact
   on-the-job learning, accountability for results, and incentives to
   acquire skills. This study examines the political and internal civil
   service determinants of frequent transfers in the civil service of
   Punjab, Pakistan. We employ Poisson panel estimations for 338 job
   positions for elite management cadres in Pakistan over a five-year
   period from 2006 to 2010. The analysis shows that a change in elected
   government and desirability of a position increase the frequency of
   transfers.},

Abstract = {This paper characterizes politically connected firms and their access to
   bank financing. We determine that the relationship between political
   connections and access to long-term bank loans is weaker in Poland than
   in other emerging economies. The most probable explanation for this
   result is related to the instability of the political climate in Poland.
   We find that only certain kinds of political connections, such as recent
   connections, positively influenced access to bank financing during the
   sample period from 2001 to 2011. Moreover, we obtain also some evidence
   that the value of political connections increased during the 2007 crisis
   period and onward. (C) 2017 The Regents of the University of California.

Abstract = {This article expands our knowledge of how variation in public
   administrative processes affects citizen perceptions of procedural
   fairness (CPPF). Focusing on a specific administrative processthe
   selection and hiring processwe use a survey experimental design among
   823 US citizens and examine the effect of a public hiring process
   involving the appearance of advocacy from an applicant's social contacts
   on CPPF. Moreover, we theoretically and empirically examine the
   moderating effects of two psychological constructs: belief in a just
   world' and public service motivation'. We find that citizens rate the
   procedural fairness of a hiring situation much lower when the situation
   appears to be influenced by an applicant's social contacts. However,
   citizens who report stronger belief in a just world' have less concern
   with a hiring process marked by advocacy, whereas citizens with higher
   levels of public service motivation' have more concern.},

Abstract = {Despite playing a key contributing role in China's economic reforms and
   the Party's regime durability, there has been a noted reduction in local
   policy experimentation. Using semi-structured interviews with
   policymakers in Beijing, Zhejiang and Shenzhen, we find that although
   recentralization efforts at the central-level are impacting local
   officials, a great deal of variation in policy experimentation outcomes
   still exists. Thus, the puzzle motivating this study is how do local
   officials react to these institutional changes to decide whether or not
   to engage in local policy innovation? Our study offers three potential
   explanations for why local officials vary in their willingness to
   continue policy experimentation: (1) the ineffectiveness of the vertical
   reward and punishment systems operated by the Party-state; (2) differing
   base preferences of local officials; and, (3) the presence of a cohort
   effect. These factors ``filter{''} institutional changes to result in
   variation at the local level. As such, we find strong support for an
   evolutionary process predicated on individual preferences interacting
   with institutional incentives such as the evaluation system and the
   networked-structure of cadre knowledge. Although some officials are
   still conducting policy experimentation, the overall reduction in
   innovation strongly suggests that potential solutions to governance
   problems remain trapped at the local level, and that the central
   government might lose this ``adaptable{''} governance mechanism that has
   contributed to its past economic and political successes.},

   World Politics},

Volume = {61},
Number = {4},
Pages = {821-834},

Abstract = {Chinese and Russian foreign policy, in part, reflects both countries'
   ambitions for higher status in the international system. This implies a
   critical question: can accommodating these ambitions prevent, or even
   reverse, the turn toward geopolitically competitive grand strategies by
   Moscow and Beijing? In other words, might accommodation lead them to
   channel their efforts in more benign directions? The dominant framework
   for analyzing the ways in which states seek status-a framework rooted in
   the insights of Social Identity Theory (SIT)-suggests that the answer is
   yes: status-seekers will most likely turn toward geopolitically
   competitive strategies when they face apparently ``impermeable{''}
   obstacles to their ambitions. I argue that this framework depends on a
   ``mistranslation{''} of SIT. Properly translated, the theory tells us
   little about the consequences of persistent status denial for
   international politics. Instead, it implies that status-seeking will
   resolve into geopolitical competition when, first, participants view
   geopolitically significant resources as markers of status and, second,
   when leaders believe that they can successfully change the distribution
   of status. I use analyses of two prominent cases that should prove
   friendly ground for the conventional translation of SIT-Germany before
   World War I and Imperial Japan-to demonstrate the serious problems that
   plague the framework favored by international relations scholars,
   especially with respect to its central claim about the link between
   persistent status denial and geopolitical competition.},

Abstract = {Foreign policy change (FPC) is an important topic and has therefore
   attracted much scholarly attention. Yet, the literature has largely
   overlooked how FPC is related to international norms. This special issue
   seeks to add value to the field of foreign policy analysis by
   strengthening the empirical literature linking FPC and international
   norms. The papers in this issue tease out the intervening factors in
   facilitating the relationship between foreign policy change and the
   international norm. The introductory article introduces the conceptual
   framework which draws on both the structure-agency and ``push-pull''
   debates to provide the cohesive analytical structure for the issue.},

Title = {Government's Unequal Attentiveness to Citizens' Political Priorities},
Journal = {POLICY STUDIES JOURNAL},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {45},
Number = {4},
Pages = {659-687},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {An accumulation of evidence suggests citizens with low incomes have
   relatively little influence over the policy decisions made by lawmakers
   in the United States. However, long before elected officials are asked
   to cast a final vote on a bill's passage, an equally important decision
   has already been made: the decision for government to focus its limited
   attention and agenda space on the issue at all. Therefore, it is
   possible that political inequality is infused earlier in the
   policymaking process at the agenda-setting stage if the issues held
   important by some citizens are given attention while the issues held
   important by others are not. To investigate this question, we develop
   novel state-level measures of citizens' issue priorities and find
   sizable differences in which issues poor and rich citizens think are
   most important and deserving of government attention. We then use bill
   introduction data from state legislatures to measure government
   attention and uncover evidence that state legislators are less likely to
   act on an issue when it is prioritized by low-income citizens as
   compared to affluent citizens. These findings have important
   implications for our understanding of political equality and the
   functioning of American democracy.},

   System},
Journal = {EAST EUROPEAN POLITICS AND SOCIETIES},

Abstract = {Varieties of gerrymandering and malapportionment can appear not only in
   electoral systems where all legislative seats are allocated to plurality
   winners in single-member districts but also in proportional
   Single-Member District (SMD)-based electoral systems and in settings
   where multi-partisan committees draw the district boundaries. This
   article investigates such a case, in which the main parliamentary
   parties collaborated in order to minimize the uncertainty regarding
   intra-party allocation of seats. The 2008 electoral reform in Romania
   created such opportunities, and both the SMD maps and the electoral
   results at the parliamentary election held in the same year indicate
   that the parties collaborated to design a number of safe seats for each
   of them. We draw on a novel data set that measures the degree to which
   the newly created SMDs reflect natural or artificial strongholds of
   concentrated partisan support in otherwise unfavorable political
   territories, and also assess the malapportionment of these districts.
   All three types of mechanisms were frequently used, and our logistic
   regression analyses indicate that nomination from the right type of SMD
   was the main factor deciding which of each party's candidates got
   elected. The statistical analyses are complemented by a qualitative
   investigation of the political composition and design of 9 SMDs.},

Abstract = {This is the first article to use a detailed dataset of the 2010 - 2015
   Parliamentary Conservative Party (PCP) to identify the drivers of MPs'
   positions on legally enshrining a commitment to spend 0.7\% of gross
   national income on foreign aid. We position every Conservative
   parliamentarian into three different categories on international aid -
   (1) aid critics, who openly opposed and/or voted the 0.7\% target; (2)
   aid sceptics, who abstained in parliamentary divisions on the 0.7 target
   and (3) aid advocates, who voted for the 0.7\% and spoke out for it. We
   then draw on a range of political and ideological variables to determine
   drivers of support or opposition to aid. By doing so we identify that
   Cameron achieved remarkable success in transforming opinion towards aid
   amongst Conservative parliamentarians. This article represents a
   quantitative challenge to the prevalent qualitative assumption in the
   academic literature, which claims Cameron's modernistion project was a
   failure.},

Title = {Human Rights Risks in Global Supply Chains: Applying the UK Modern
   Slavery Act to the Public Sector},
Journal = {GLOBAL POLICY},

Volume = {8},

Abstract = {Global supply chains (GSCs) are organised through complex networks which
   leave workers vulnerable to exploitation and unprotected against abusive
   labour practices including modern slavery. In the past decade's,
   attention has focused on business responsibilities for the impact of
   commercial activities on human rights with little focus on the role of
   states as economic actors and their duties regarding their own supply
   chain, including through public procurement. This article analyses the
   application of the Transparency in Supply Chains provision (TiSCs) of
   the UK Modern Slavery Act (2015) to the public sector. Since 2016
   commercial organisations are obliged to report on efforts to identify,
   prevent, and mitigate modern slavery in their supply chain. This
   includes over one hundred higher education institutions (HEIs). This
   article finds that while most reporting in the first year fall short of
   what is expected of institutions according to Government guidance the
   exercise of reporting has initiated an important process of awareness.
   HEIs face a steep learning curve to develop effective human rights due
   diligence in their supply chain however, the TiSCs obligation has proved
   a catalyst for a wider process of understanding human rights risks and
   responsibilities of the public sector, and more specifically HEIs.},

Abstract = {To what extent can international peacekeeping promote micro-foundations
   for positive peace after violence? Drawing on macro-level peacekeeping
   theory, our approach uses novel experimental methods to illustrate how
   monitoring and enforcement by a neutral third party could conceivably
   enhance prosocial behavior between rival groups in a tense, postconflict
   peacekeeping environment. Using a laboratory experiment in postwar
   Kosovo, we find that third-party enforcement is more effective at
   promoting norms of trust between ethnic Serbs and Albanians than
   monitoring alone or no intervention at all. We then consider real-world
   extensions for building positive peace across different intervention
   environments. Using a dictator experiment that exploits heterogeneity in
   NATO peacekeeping in different regions of Kosovo, our inferences about
   monitoring and enforcement appear robust to ecological conditions in the
   field.},

Abstract = {This article examines the neglected question of workers' voice in the
   transnational governance of labour rights. While governance studies
   often neglect worker's agency and labour studies focus on strikes or
   collective bargaining, this article takes the theoretical lenses of
   recursivity to explore and compare new channels for worker participation
   that developed in the context of transnational governance schemes.
   Taking the example of the Fair Labor Association, a prominent
   multistakeholder initiative in the garment industry, the article
   distinguishes between three channels: workers' surveys during audits,
   complaint procedures, and local grievance mediation. Despite the fact
   that such opportunities count as key innovations for the participation
   of labour in transnational governance, statistical and qualitative data
   from FLA's factory audits and self-conducted interviews show that
   locally situated actors, especially workers, are only occasionally able
   to make their voice heard in formally open channels. The article
   identifies two main sources of constraints: the first is workers' lack
   of knowledge of these channels and distrust towards these procedures.
   This is tied, secondly, to the more fundamental problem that business
   continues to have interpretative power over the nature of the problems
   and solutions in transnational labour governance.},

Title = {Unveiling patterns of contestation over Better Regulation reforms in the
   European Union},
Journal = {PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {95},
Number = {3},
Pages = {589-604},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Regulatory reforms labelled `Better Regulation' are a prominent item on
   the political agendas of most advanced democracies and the European
   Union. Governments adopt Better Regulation measures to strengthen their
   democratic legitimacy and increase their regulatory and economic
   effectiveness. Notwithstanding their rhetorical appeal, their design and
   implementation are susceptible to high levels of political contestation.
   We therefore ask: are there systematic differences in stakeholders'
   demands for what Better Regulation should achieve? What explains these
   differences? We argue that conflict over Better Regulation is rooted in
   what stakeholders prefer as a regulatory system of governance.
   Stakeholders demand reforms that lead to one of the following three
   scenarios: deregulation, technocratic or participatory policy-making. We
   examine stakeholders' demands expressed in the EU. We find that national
   authorities responsible for coordinating Better Regulation and
   cross-sectoral business organizations support deregulatory and
   technocratic reforms. Business and public interest organizations are
   equally supportive of strengthening participatory policy-making.},

Abstract = {In current thinking about public service improvement, civil servant
   creativity plays an important role. Using the results of 43
   semi-structured interviews, we assessed the degree to which our
   theoretical knowledge about creativity-based primarily on business
   research-matches the insights of managers in local government.
   Respondents considered employee creativity to be important, but-in
   contrast to the literature-understood creativity as the act of trying
   out new things to better deal with specific problems at hand instead of
   developing new ideas potentially applicable to a wider context. A s
   such, respondents did not see creativity as the main precondition for
   innovation. In line with the literature, there is little consistency
   across respondents about individual- and context-level determinants of
   creativity. Lastly, respondents put forward several factors that have
   received little attention in the literature but are particularly
   relevant in understanding differences in work-related creativity in the
   context of local government.},

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL POLITICS},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {54},

Abstract = {Contemporary populism is rooted in a crisis of legitimacy. Corporate tax
   avoidance by multinationals is one cause of that crisis. Although states
   tend to be increasingly formally committed to tackling avoidance, they
   do so in a system that promotes contradictory sets of behaviour. This
   tends to undermine attempts to solve the problem of avoidance unless a
   more transformative collective approach is taken. Ironically, despite
   its own democratic deficit, the European Commission has taken a leading
   role in promoting such a solution: the Common Consolidated Corporate Tax
   Base (CCCTB). In this paper, I set out the case for `unitary taxation'
   based on the CCCTB and state some of its current problems. The problem
   of corporation tax raises a basic issue in terms of who is sovereignty
   for, and solving the problem provides an important contribution to
   legitimacy of both the state and the EU.},

Title = {Drivers for Policy Agreement in Nascent Subsystems: An Application of
   the Advocacy Coalition Framework to Fracking Policy in Switzerland and
   the UK},
Journal = {POLICY STUDIES JOURNAL},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {45},
Number = {3},

Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {The study of public policy deals with subsystems in which actors
   cooperate or compete to turn their beliefs into policy solutions. Yet,
   most studies concern mature subsystems in which the main actors and
   their allies and enemies can easily be identified. This paper tackles
   the challenge of studying nascent subsystems, in which actors have begun
   to engage in politics but are uncertain about other actors' beliefs.
   Actors therefore find it relatively difficult to identify their allies
   and opponents. Focusing on the Advocacy Coalition Framework, we examine
   three main ways in which actors might agree to support the same policy
   design before they decide whether or not to form long-term relationships
   within advocacy coalitions: they see the issue through the same lenses,
   they follow leaders, or they know each other from earlier cooperation.
   We use the case of fracking policy in Switzerland and the UK as a key
   example, in which actors have begun to agree with each other, but where
   final policy outputs were not yet defined, and long-term relationships
   not yet observable. We find that, when dealing with new issues, actors
   strongly rely on former contacts rather than shared ideologies or
   leadership.},

Title = {Escaping the ``Balkanizing{''} Gaze? Perceptions of Global and Internal
   Developmental Hierarchies in Romania},

Abstract = {The article presents the perceptions of global and internal
   developmental hierarchies in Romania. According to our empirical
   results, the Western-centred developmental paradigm has deeply
   penetrated the worldviews of ordinary people in Romania. As a
   consequence, national self-perceptions, respectively, constructions of
   internal regional and ethnic differences in Romania, are powerfully
   shaped by the idea of East-West developmental hierarchies. Melegh
   introduced the concept of an East-West slope to denote a discursive
   construction used since the eighteenth century. This construction
   suggests that there is a gradual decline of development (or
   civilization) as one moves from the West (North West) toward the East
   (South East). The author argues that this framework not only defines how
   Romanians position themselves in the global developmental hierarchy but
   also how they define their internal (regional and ethnic) hierarchies.
   The article also discusses Todorova's concept of Balkanism. This
   interpretive framework not only defines the perceptions of external
   observers but (following a process of cultural penetration) may also
   shape the self-perceptions of those involved. This article argues that
   Romanians have succeeded in avoidingat least partiallythe most severe
   consequence of the Balkanizing gaze, which is a constant sense of
   inferiority. It is also important, however, that this Balkanizing gaze
   can be reproduced at a national/local level and (in interrelation with
   other types of developmental discourses) can organize internal
   hierarchies.},

Abstract = {Can Egypt achieve economic and security-related stability without first
   achieving some sort of political and civil control? While many regional
   and international actors seem convinced that it can be done, this essay
   argues that stability in post-revolution Egypt is only possible by
   empowering civilian and political actors in cooperation with military
   and security establishments. Based on an analysis of Egyptian civil
   security relations, it shall be shown that the prioritising of economic
   and security sector solutions over political reforms has led to a
   dysfunctional system and a vicious cycle of political violence, economic
   hardships and security failures. In consideration of ways forward, the
   essays end with policy recommendations for the EU and other
   international actors in their approach towards Egypt.},

Journal = {POLITICAL STUDIES},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {65},
Number = {2},
Pages = {339-355},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {The republican tradition in political theory offers a distinct approach
   to thinking about rights that addresses long-standing objections to the
   depoliticising logic of the discourse through its attention to power
   relations and the socially embedded nature of moral claims. However, the
   most systematic republican theories of rights-based citizenship
   translate these theoretical commitments into a tame set of institutional
   proposals that largely affirm existing states. In this article, I
   critique the limits of Philip Pettit's juridical republicanism and
   Richard Bellamy's parliamentary republicanism and set out an alternative
   populist account of republican citizenship based on the notion of rights
   as claims' - a form of speech act that empowers agents with self-respect
   to mobilise popular support and challenge arbitrary power when political
   institutions are unresponsive or unavailable. Populist citizenship takes
   place whenever social groups and classes mobilise directly outside
   constitutional structures in order to contest the legitimacy of the
   political regime and lay claim to new rights through direct appeal to
   the sovereign authority of the people themselves.},

Abstract = {Theory and extensive evidence connect poverty and underdevelopment to
   civil conflict yet evidence on the impact of development programs on
   violence is surprisingly mixed. To break this impasse, we exploit a
   within-country policy experiment to examine the conditions under which
   antipoverty programs reduce violence. The roll-out of India's National
   Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme caused a large long-run reduction in
   Maoist conflict violence, as measured with an original data set based on
   local-language press sources. These pacifying effects were not uniform,
   however, but overwhelmingly concentrated in districts with sufficient
   pre-existing local state capacity to implement the program effectively.
   The results demonstrate the potential for anti-poverty programs to
   mitigate violent civil conflict by improving livelihoods, but also
   highlight the crucial role of state capacity in shaping these effects.},

Abstract = {One of the main characteristics of third-generation regionalism is the
   inclusion of institutional arrangements aimed at bringing the regulatory
   systems of participants closer into line. Two agreements, CETA and the
   TPP, have recently been signed, and both include a special section on
   regulatory cooperation, This topic is also on the agenda of trade
   negotiations between the United States and the European Union, where it
   is both the main focus and the biggest stumbling block. This article
   shows how regulatory provisions in these new agreements are linked to
   the debate over regulatory cooperation at other levels, especially
   within the WTO and the OECD. It also looks at the new parameters framing
   such cooperation and compares the regulatory provisions in the CETA and
   TPP texts we have access to.},

Abstract = {Existing typologies of the European administrative space locate
   decision-making powers with the European Commission, member state
   governments, and EU and national agencies, sometimes aided through
   regulatory networks. This article argues that those typologies are
   incomplete because they do not take into account the existence of
   transnational executive bodies. These are public authorities that are
   responsible for administering and implementing EU policies across
   multiple member states, that are part of neither domestic nor EU
   institutions and whose decisions are legally binding. They represent a
   potentially highly prevalent form of governance in a previously
   uncharted area of the European administrative space. We document their
   workings by presenting a case study of the Rhine-Alpine Corridor
   organization, a transnational executive body implementing parts of the
   EU rail freight policy.},

Abstract = {In a historic referendum, Britain has voted to leave the European Union.
   Some of the polling suggests that a backlash against globalisation
   played a role, alongside themes such as sovereignty and immigration. The
   government has insisted that Britain will maintain its global outlook,
   but how challenging will that be in the face of disengaging from the
   world's biggest economic entity and forging a novel path? The UK is
   doing so with some notable weaknesses in its large trade deficit. This
   article explores the economic uncertainties of Brexit and potential ways
   forward.},

Abstract = {Focusing on European Union (EU) Twinning projects in Azerbaijan and
   Ukraine, this article explores whether EU member states from Central and
   Eastern Europe (CEECs) offer specific added value for the implementation
   of EU Twinning projects in the Eastern neighbourhood compared to the
   older member states. An added value refers to the combined comparative
   advantages of a group of member states for the implementation of a
   Twinning project, as perceived by project stakeholders. The findings
   largely confirm our hypothesis that CEECs mostly offer country-specific
   comparative advantages, rooted in their recent transition and accession
   experience, socio-linguistic proximity, and shared historical legacies
   with the Eastern neighbourhood. In turn, the older member states are
   perceived to offer mainly sector-specific comparative advantages owing
   to their institutional experience, sectoral fit, existing sectoral
   networks in the Eastern neighbourhood, and prior Twinning experience in
   other countries.},

Abstract = {The budgeting literature has long focused on institutional friction as a
   cause of ubiquitous punctuated equilibrium (PE) findings. A recent wave
   of scholarship looks to identify specific institutional mechanisms that
   affect the number of punctuations in policy outputs. We contribute to
   this growing body of research by focusing on the complexity of the
   institutional environment surrounding a policy area as well as that of
   the government as a whole. These factors have opposite effects: the more
   complex a policy area, the greater the likelihood of extreme spending
   changes. But, higher institutional capacity in general leads to greater
   stability. To test these ideas, we develop a novel index of budgetary
   change that balances the conceptual importance of extreme changes while
   analyzing the entire distribution of budget changes, not only the tails.
   In addition, we also demonstrate that findings are robust to a number of
   important distinctions, such as between series associated with slowly
   moving demographic trends or quickly moving stochastic events. We,
   therefore, demonstrate the robustness of important findings from the
   established literature, add a new measure of the dependent variable, and
   push the literature forward with a new focus on issue complexity and
   institutional capacity.},

Abstract = {Under what conditions do autocracies peacefully settle disputes?
   Existing studies tend to focus on the domestic factors that shape
   conflict initiation. In this article, I show how domestic institutions
   interact with international institutions to produce more cooperative
   outcomes. Particularly, this study argues that as autocracies become
   more central in the network of liberal institutions such as preferential
   trade agreements (PTAs), they are less likely to initiate a militarized
   interstate dispute (MID). As a state becomes more democratic, the effect
   of centrality within the PTA network on the peaceful dispute settlement
   dissipates. This is because greater embeddedness in the PTA regime is
   associated with enhanced transparency for autocracies, which allows
   autocracies to mitigate ex ante informational problems in dispute
   resolution. Using a dataset of MID initiation from 1965 to 1999, this
   study finds robust empirical support for the aforementioned hypothesis.
   Moreover, the results are substantively significant. Further analysis
   into the causal mechanisms at work provides evidence in favor of the
   information mechanism. Autocrats who are more embedded in the PTA
   network tend to have higher levels of economic transparency and economic
   transparency itself is associated with lower rates of conflict
   initiation. The results suggest that an autocrat's structural position
   within the international system can help to peacefully settle its
   disputes.},

Abstract = {This article is part of the special section titled From the Iron Curtain
   to the Schengen Area, guest edited by Wolfgang Mueller and Libora
   Oates-Indruchova.Soon after the establishment of communist rule in
   Bulgaria, the state's Southern border (with Turkey and Greece) became
   its most staunchly guarded borderline, stimulated by the ideological
   interpretation of the two countries as imperialist states that posed a
   direct threat to the entire socialist bloc. Since the early 1960scopying
   the strategies applied to the Berlin Wallvarious new measures were
   introduced by the communist state to make this borderline even more
   impermeable, involving the actions of military institutions, propaganda
   units, and the local population. The current article analyzes the
   guarding of the Southern border in communist Bulgaria and interprets it
   as an element of the overall strategy of these years to put borderline
   areas under strict supervision and control. The article presents the
   main steps in the organization of Border Troops in Bulgaria after 1944
   and the various political, educational, and cultural policies developed
   by the communist state to create loyalty among the soldiers, the
   military staff, and the population in general. On the basis of archival
   materials, published memoirs, and literary texts, the article
   reconstructs the maintenance of constant alert about illegal
   trespassing, the organization of voluntary troops for border-guarding,
   the training of the young generations, and the romanticizing of the
   border guard service in those years. In the last part, emphasis is paid
   to the discrepancies between the propaganda messages and the reactions
   of the local population, which outline the multi-faceted encounters with
   ideological policies at the edges of this staunchly guarded world.},

Abstract = {What explains the persistence of racial or ethnic inequalities in
   descriptive representation in the absence of strongly politicized racial
   or ethnic cleavages? This article uses new data to demonstrate a
   substantial racial gap between voters and politicians in Brazil. The
   authors show that this disparity is not plausibly due to racial
   preferences in the electorate as a whole, for instance, deference toward
   white candidates or discrimination against nonwhites, and that barriers
   to candidate entry or discrimination by party leaders do not likely
   explain the gap. Instead, they document persistent resource disparities
   between white and nonwhite candidates, including large differences in
   personal assets and campaign contributions. The findings suggest that
   elite closure-investments by racial and economic elites on behalf of
   elite candidates-help perpetuate a white political class, even in the
   absence of racialized politics. By underscoring this avenue through
   which representational disparities persist, the article contributes to
   research on elite power in democratic settings.},

Abstract = {States traditionally build walls to repel the armies of adversaries and
   consolidate control over territory. More recently, the growth in
   violence by nonstate groups has led governments to use fences to prevent
   insurgent activity and transnational terrorism. This practice, which has
   accelerated since the end of World War II, challenges liberal
   expectations of a borderless world. We use a new and unique data set on
   twentieth century interstate border barriers to evaluate the
   effectiveness of fencing as a defense against transnational terrorist
   attacks. The strategic nature of barrier construction makes the
   assessment of causal effects complex. However, our analyses suggest that
   fences reduce the annual relative risk of a terrorist attack by at least
   67 percent. Much of the literature on transnational terrorism focuses on
   variables such as democracy, development, and distance-that is, factors
   that are difficult for policy-makers to manipulate. But our analysis
   suggests that fencing may provide an effective policy tool for leaders
   seeking to insulate their states from transnational terrorist attacks.},

Abstract = {The politics of decentralisation reforms in Sierra Leone are
   unpredictable and instructive. This article, based on fieldwork,
   analyses party politics within the context of decentralisation, arguing
   that the imperatives of post-conflict decentralisation are not
   necessarily embedded in technical considerations, but in processes of
   political compromise and accommodation. Decentralisation has helped
   facilitate the re-emergence of the old political order, in that the
   country's main political parties have secured a consensus through which
   they have reconfigured the post-conflict state on their own terms. This
   study reveals that the narrative of a divide' within the political class
   is exaggerated, and illustrates the homogeneity and interconnectedness
   of its interests. The extent to which the peace' will be sustained by
   this compromise is uncertain, but this framing is useful in
   understanding the political economy in which fragility' and peace'
   co-exist, illuminating the political class's agency, as well as its
   ability to unite' against others'.},

Abstract = {Prediction and forecasting have now fully reached peace and conflict
   research. We define forecasting as predictions about unrealized outcomes
   given model estimates from realized data, and predictions more generally
   as the assignment of probability distributions to realized or unrealized
   outcomes. Increasingly, scholars present within-and out-of-sample
   prediction results in their publications and sometimes even forecasts
   for unrealized, future outcomes. The articles in this special issue
   demonstrate the ability of current approaches to forecast events of
   interest and contributes to the formulation of best practices for
   forecasting within peace research. We highlight the role of forecasting
   for theory evaluation and as a bridge between academics and
   policymakers, summarize the contributions in the special issue, and
   provide some thoughts on how research on forecasting in peace research
   should proceed. We suggest some best practices, noting the importance of
   theory development, interpretability of models, replicability of
   results, and data collection.},

Abstract = {In the field of international relations, Vincent Pouliot has developed a
   theory of practicality as a ``material{''} theory of practice that
   complements the logics of consequence, appropriateness, and arguing.
   Paradoxically, the logic of practicality may well be the non-theoretical
   foundation for all IR theory. How does Pouliot's approach, inspired by
   Bourdieu, lend itself to this kind of exercise ? In my view, there are
   two questions crucial to a sociological analysis of international
   relations practice from a Webero-Bourdieusian perspective : the role of
   politics, and the domination-and logic-of practice.},

Abstract = {The approach developed by Vincent Pouliot in his article in
   International Organization charts various avenues for rethinking the
   functioning of security communities (in this case NATO) on the basis of
   social practices, and more specifically the logic of practicality
   (unarticulated know-how that underpins action). The purpose of this
   article is to discuss two aspects of this approach. The first has to do
   with Bourdieu's model, which serves as a matrix for the intelligibility
   of practices. It consists of integrating elements disregarded by
   Pouliot, including information capital, rites, the logic of giving and
   counter-giving, and the nature of diplomacy vs. politics. The second
   involves alternative analyses derived from normative theory and offering
   other possible scenarios for exploring this area, particularly the
   thought of Arendt.},

Abstract = {This article extends and tests the trust-as-evaluation approach that is
   dominant in political science. Citizens supposedly grant and withhold
   trust in politics based on an assessment of its merits. We argue that
   the relevance of performances and processes should be conditional on the
   values that citizens hold dear and the accuracy with which they perceive
   them. Through multilevel analyses of the European Value Survey 2008, we
   model the (conditional) effects of a wide range of macro-economic
   outcomes and procedural characteristics on two aspects of political
   trust: satisfaction with democracy and confidence in political
   institutions. We find that macro-economic outcomes do not relate to
   political trust once we control for corruption. The effects of
   corruption and macro-economic outcomes are indeed stronger among the
   higher educated. However, the effect of macro-economic outcomes is not
   conditional on citizens' values. We discuss the theoretical implications
   of these findings for the use of the trust-as-evaluation approach.},

Title = {Social Innovation and Institutional Capacity in Latin America},
Journal = {REVISTA DEL CLAD REFORMA Y DEMOCRACIA},
Year = {2017},
Number = {67},
Pages = {33-68},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {The current economic and financial crisis has caused that the more
   developed countries are giving up the old belief in an omnipotent State
   and an unlimited level of wellbeing, while in Latin America is
   questioning the extension and consolidation of basic public services.
   Today, the ability of States to deal with the diversity of citizen
   demands and needs, to bring public action to the whole population and to
   combat poverty is questioned. To this is added the loss of public
   confidence in public institutions and their members and leaders.
   We are experiencing profound changes in the society and the market that
   show that they are assuming a growing role in the satisfaction of the
   needs of the community. Thus appears an enlarged reality of the public
   service, which can no longer be referred to the administrative or state.
   Simultaneously, the State expands its role as an enabler, guarantor and
   activator of society and is required to be oriented towards inclusion,
   participation, representation and effective partnerships.
   In this context rises up the approach of social innovation that feeds on
   the evolution of ideas and governance of previous decades and the
   principles of the knowledge society, such as collaboration and the
   connection of talent, and which is being built primarily from
   international organizations and governments. One of its main objectives
   is the coproduction of public services in order to promote the renewal
   of the public sector and to cover its insufficiencies.
   It will be maintained that the characteristics of institutional
   development condition social innovation initiatives, specifically the
   characteristics that define institutional capacity, as it has been
   observed in most Latin American countries in the last decade with the
   guarantee and extension of public services. The shortcomings in the
   coverage of these and the rest of unsatisfied needs show a wide field of
   action of social innovation in Latin America.},

Abstract = {Major economies such as the United States, European Union, Japan, and
   even China have shifted trade negotiating emphasis toward mega-regional'
   agreements, including the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), the
   Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP), and the Regional
   Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP). This paper explores why
   countries have chosen to pursue mega-regionals, what is likely to be
   contained in the agreements, and some of their potential implications
   for the multilateral trading system under the World Trade Organization
   (WTO). I call for revisiting the historical approach of introducing
   plurilateral and critical mass agreements - that would cover some of the
   mega-regionals' new provisions - into the WTO so as to avoid a more
   substantial, long-run erosion of the relevance of the nondiscriminatory
   system. I also highlight potential reforms to the WTO's dispute
   settlement procedure that are required to strengthen its already
   prominent role.},

Title = {The Role of Cities in Shaping Transnational Law in Climate Governance},
Journal = {GLOBAL POLICY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {8},
Number = {1},
Pages = {23-31},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Today, many human rights norms are promoted and reinforced as
   transnational law in transnational settings involving a multiplicity of
   state and non-state actors. Over the last few years, debates about
   constitutionalising a human right to an adequate environment as a legal
   instrument to confront the devastating consequences of climate change
   have steadily grown. While the role of states and non-state actors from
   civil society in promoting human rights legislation is widely
   acknowledged, the role of cities remains largely unexplored. Cities are
   major greenhouse gas emitters, profoundly affected by the various
   consequences of climate change, with more than half of the world
   population living in urban environments. By providing a brief overview
   of the principal activities of the largest city networks on climate
   action, ICLEI - Local Governments for Sustainability and the C40 Climate
   Action Leadership Group - the article argues that cities have turned
   into crucial actors in shaping and promoting environmental rights,
   essentially a human right to an adequate environment.},

Abstract = {Parliaments are not generally conceived of as leaders. However, the
   European Parliament (EP) has played a pivotal leadership role in
   transforming the character of representative democracy at EU level. For
   much of its history the EP argued for a representative system based on
   competition between institutions operating on the principle of a
   separation of powers. However, following the Lisbon Treaty and the 2014
   European elections, a rather different paradigm has grown in prominence,
   namely an embryonic form of parliamentary government where executive
   power is channelled through the elected representatives of the people.
   The Parliament has thereby been at the centre of a transformative
   development in the structures of representation of the EU. The precise
   consequences of this change remain uncertain but it is likely to prove
   difficult to reverse the 2014 institutional revolution, with its
   profound implications for the debate about the character of
   representative government at EU level.},

   explores the nexus between policy process research, public management

   description of policy process research, including some of its major
   thematic emphases regarding governance problems and processes. It next
   discusses limitations of policy process research imposed by its scope of
   inquiry, theoretical black boxes, and omitted factors. Three
   strategiesfilling, zooming, and linkingfor addressing these limitations

   at the nexus to advance both specialized and general knowledge about

Title = {When Suicide Kills: An Empirical Analysis of the Lethality of Suicide
   Terrorism},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONFLICT AND VIOLENCE},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {11},
Abstract = {Why are some suicide terrorist attacks deadlier than others? Suicide
   bombers, unlike stationary bombs, are self-guided human weapons; they
   can deliver and detonate explosives at a specific time and place with
   precision. Coding and analyzing new data on over four hundred suicide
   terrorist incidents from all around the world between 1998 and 2015,
   this paper argues that the number of fatalities resulting from suicide
   attacks is a function of strategic choices made by the perpetrators,
   such as where to attack and whom to target. Results of this analysis
   show that suicide attacks that seize targets of opportunity are the most
   lethal. Specifically, suicide attacks that target civilians in enclosed
   and easily accessible places, and that are undertaken by multiple
   perpetrators result in the highest numbers of fatalities. Understanding
   these strategic tactical attributes of suicide terrorism is fundamental
   to devising effective counterterrorism strategies that aim at hardening
   soft targets and minimizing the lethal impact of these attacks.},

Title = {Producing the Climate: States, Scientists, and the Constitution of
   Global Governance Objects},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATION},

Abstract = {This paper argues that the climate came to take on a geophysical rather
   than a bioecological form in global governance because it emerged from a
   dynamic, interactive process between states and scientists. In the
   1950s, state agencies, especially elements of the US military, steered
   and accelerated the development of the geophysical sciences, which set
   the discursive frame within which climate politics now plays out. In the
   1990s, scientists and IO experts responded to states' requests to study
   carbon sinks by expanding the climate to include new greenhouse gases
   and land-use practices. Drawing on Science and Technology Studies as
   well as discursive theories of global governance, I theorize object
   constitution as a process of co-production in which states steer the
   development of scientific knowledge and scientists assemble epistemic
   objects. This contingent interaction of political and scientific actors
   shapes the form and content of global governance objects. The argument
   extends and challenges the epistemic communities literature and theories
   of the global governance life cycle that focus on how problems end up on
   the agenda of states rather than the processes of problem construction.},

Abstract = {This article responds to the following research questions: How and why
   have victims of ETA's terrorism in Spain become an interest group with
   significant influence on the political and legislative agenda of the
   country. The evolution of the associative movement of victims of
   terrorism is assessed in order to explain the process by which their
   influence and impact on the political agenda has gradually grown
   throughout the years. It analyzes the transition from the isolation
   suffered by victims of terrorism in the early days of ETA's campaign to
   the prominent social and political role played at later stages. The
   factors that motivate and explain their active role as interest groups
   are looked into, demonstrating different claims and interests with
   varying degrees of coherence and leverage. The relevancy of victims of
   terrorism within the anti-terrorist policies of various Spanish
   governments will be established, as well as the achievements and
   limitations of such a significant interest group.},

Journal = {TERRORISM AND POLITICAL VIOLENCE},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {29},
Number = {4},
Pages = {593-609},
Abstract = {What does state terrorism look like? How do we distinguish it from other
   forms of mass state violence, such as repression or genocide? Based on
   the developing literature on state terrorism, this study presents three
   expectations that violence perpetrated by the state should meet if it is
   to be classified as state terrorism: these are (a) that the violence is
   perpetrated by agents of the state, (b) that the violence is visible,
   and (c) that state terrorism focused against a state's own citizens will
   be carried out by an autocratic, personalistic regime. Drawing
   substantially on a series of primary sources, this study demonstrates
   that Idi Amin's regime in Uganda from 1971 to 1979 did engage in state
   terrorism against its own citizens.},

   the intermingling of budgets and politics from an assortment of
   theoretical and methodological perspectives. This culminated in a

Abstract = {This study analyses the position of Roma people in the former Yugoslavia
   using state and civil society discourse on human rights implementation.
   It reveals that states are failing to give sufficient prioritisation to
   tackling longstanding discrimination and oppression. Instead of positive
   the effects predicted by complementarity theory, the findings reveal
   `frame dis-alignment' between political elites and NGOs. This raises
   questions of legitimation and performativity in human rights practice.
   States' failure to fully engage with NGOs' policy claims effectively
   renders Roma people `semi-citizens'. Systemic reform by government is

Title = {The economic costs of civil war: Synthetic counterfactual evidence and
   the effects of ethnic fractionalization},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF PEACE RESEARCH},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {54},
Number = {1},
Pages = {80-98},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {There is a consensus that civil wars entail enormous economic costs, but
   there is little systematic analysis of the determinants of their
   heterogeneous destructiveness. Moreover, reliably estimating these costs
   has proven challenging, due to the complexity of the relationship
   between violence and socio-economic conditions. In this article, we
   study the effect of ethnic fractionalization of war-torn countries on
   the economic consequences of civil war. Building on an emerging
   literature on the relationships between ethnicity, trust, economic
   outcomes, and conflict processes, we argue that civil wars erode
   interethnic trust and highly fractionalized societies pay an especially
   high price, as they rely heavily on interethnic business relations. We
   use the synthetic control method to construct appropriate
   counterfactuals and measure the economic impact of civil war. Our focus
   is on the years of armed conflict in a sample of 20 countries for which
   we observe an average annual loss of local GDP per capita of 17.5\%,
   though with remarkable variation across cases. The empirical analysis
   provides supporting evidence in the form of a robust positive
   association between ethnic fractionalization and our measures of
   war-induced economic costs.},

Abstract = {This chapter seeks to highlight the prospects of procedural and
   substantive democracy in Africa, emphasizing the limitation and
   shortcomings of African countries in their pursuit of democracy, citing
   a transformational-transactional leadership mix ('transfor-sactional')
   in countering the shortcomings. It achieves this purpose by reviewing
   literature on democracy, transformational and transactional leadership
   styles to develop a leadership mixture (transfor-sactional) and further
   goes on to draw a conceptual framework to show the relationship between
   transfor-sactional leadership and democracy. This chapter then discusses
   the concepts in the framework by explaining the relationship between
   them. The review of literature shows that procedural democracy has good
   prospects across the continent; however, African countries are lagging
   behind with reference to substantive democracy. Additionally, this
   chapter reveals that, the persistent economic hardship, poverty and
   underdevelopment across the African continent, the role of leaders in
   mitigating these pertinent human problems cannot be overemphasized. As
   such, the complementary role of transformational leadership to
   transactional leadership is shown and thus, leaders who are able to
   effectively combine attributes of the two leadership styles can achieve
   effective leadership which is crucial to African countries in achieving
   growth and development.},

Number = {11, SI},
Abstract = {This paper argues that a policy regime based on a paradigm mix may be
   resilient when challenged by changing power balances and new agendas.
   Controversies between the actors can be contained within the paradigm
   mix as it enables them to legitimize different ideational positions.
   Rather than engaging in conflict over the foundation of the regime, they
   are more likely to rebalance the paradigm blend. We show that despite
   being a mixture of two contradictory paradigms, the World Trade
   Organization (WTO) Agreement on Agriculture has proven resilient when
   the power balance within the WTO and the policy context changed. The
   paradigm mix proved sufficiently flexible to accommodate food security
   concerns and at the same time continue to take steps toward further
   liberalization. Indeed, the main players have not challenged the
   paradigm mix.},

Abstract = {This article examines the role of citizens' discourses as constraints
   and opportunities for future enlargements. Public opinion is an
   increasingly important factor influencing EU's integration capacity.
   When governments' decisions on enlargement are challenged in referenda,
   the credibility of the EU's promise is diminished and integration
   capacity is negatively affected. We take a discursive institutionalist
   approach that focuses on citizens' perceptions and understandings of
   enlargement expressed in several discourses in each member state. We
   argue that political elites can turn to citizen discourses to identify
   conditions under which enlargement would be acceptable to citizens.
   Identifying empirically citizen discourses in two old and two more
   recent member states, we find discourses supportive to enlargement,
   constraining discourses and a third group that would approve of
   enlargement but under certain conditions. Examining these conditions we
   find that to increase integration capacity, enlargement policy needs to
   be objective, to involve citizens in the member states and to promote
   better governance in candidate states.},

Abstract = {The public image of the European Union (EU) has met increasingly
   negative evaluations since the economic and financial crisis hit its
   peak. Although opposition towards the EU has been pitched as a temporary
   phenomenon, it has now become a distinctive characteristic of European
   integration, described as embedded'. Recent analyses on citizens'
   attitudes towards the EU underline a rational utilitarian dimension,
   stressing that EU attachment is affected by future life expectations.
   Are rationalist perspectives the only possible explanation behind the
   rise of Euroscepticism, though? This article offers an alternative
   approach, by using discourse analysis, and examines how emotions, as
   embedded in Eurosceptic discursive frames and practices, may affect
   attitudes towards the EU. We argue that an analysis of citizens'
   opposition through emotions when the salience of the EU increases can
   show how a Eurosceptic emotion-laden public discourse may become
   prominent at the domestic level.},

Abstract = {Although recent interpretations of Brazil's current political crisis are
   not wrong in bringing out the institutional problems related to
   presidencialismo de coalisao and with the judicialization of politics,
   they do not take into account an important factor fueling the crisis:
   the acute decrease in the legitimacy of political institutions, and
   particularly of the president. After briefly showing that this decrease
   cannot be credited to poor economic performance, I analyze the big media
   coverage of President Dilma Rousseff and of her party (Workers' Party),
   to reveal its tremendous negative bias, if compared to other political
   figures and parties. I conclude by pointing out that the oligopolistic
   hold that the large politically active conservative media conglomerates
   have on the flux of political information must be take into account in
   political analysis and that it is a major problem for the stability of
   democracy in Brazil.},

Abstract = {Coordinated welfare capitalism has been subject to comprehensive change
   since the 1990s, with workfare measures and the deregulation of
   employment protection at the heart of labor market reforms. Developments
   in Sweden, Germany, and South Korea challenge not only the assumption of
   relative stability that is commonly associated with the study of
   coordinated market economies, but also the assertion that this stability
   is associated with the persistence of established political coalitions.
   The authors contend that a collapse of longstanding welfare state
   coalitions is the key political driver of labor market reform, with the
   withdrawal of employers from previous welfare settlements at the center
   of this development.},

Abstract = {A curious interconnectedness/consent conundrum marks today's world.
   Whereas states and societies are becoming more closely interconnected,
   increased proximity need not increase popular acceptance of federal
   democracy. Nowhere is this conundrum more apparent than in the European
   Union. The EU is engaged in a process of democratic federalization, but
   this process is clearly shaped by the interconnectedness/consent
   conundrum. In the EU democratic federalization unfolds under conditions
   of polity contestation. This article discusses what we may learn about
   democratic federalization from reflecting on the EU experience. For that
   we need adequate analytical tools because no ready-made analytical
   framework that fully captures democratic federalization is available,
   certainly not one that is amenable toward resolving the
   interconnectedness/consent conundrum. This article provides the bare
   bones of such a framework. The framework consists of the core components
   or dimensions of democratic federalization, which are devised to address
   the specific challenges that the interconnectedness/consent conundrum
   raises.},

Abstract = {Information and communication technologies (ICTs) are alleviating
   frictions associated with the gathering and distribution of information,
   as well as reducing transaction costs related to the identifying,
   monitoring, and coordination of citizens dissatisfied with certain
   government policies. We conducted a random-effect logit tests based on a
   uniquely developed panel dataset of 138 countries from 2005 to 2014 to
   determine, ceteris paribus, whether or not ICTs play a role in
   facilitating changes to the status quo that gravitate against government
   policies. We found that ICTs although it can reduce hysteresis, the
   tendency to remain passive, inertia, is stronger. In addition, because
   ICTs are multi-purpose technologies they also support other beneficial
   economic and political activities which can explain why we don't see
   greater evidence of social unrest with these technologies. The
   literature on social unrest provide some clues about this phenomenon.
   People are willing to engage in these movements but it appears that only
   during a crisis.},

Abstract = {Contrary to what the EU's image as a civilian power suggests, the EU
   member states have had 50,000-100,000 troops deployed outside their home
   countries for most of the post-Cold-War period. Although the vast
   majority of these troops were active in operations with a strong
   European presence, the member states' patterns of military engagement
   differ significantly. This study provides a systematic analysis of the
   member states' contributions to military operations. More specifically,
   it examines which (combinations of) conditions consistently led to
   participation in EUFOR Congo, UNIFIL II, EUFOR Chad, the 2011 military
   intervention in Libya and the air strikes against the Islamic State.
   Methodologically, it builds on most different similar outcome/most
   similar different outcome and qualitative comparative analysis. The
   results of the analysis show that four conditions account for the bulk
   of the member states' patterns of military engagements: military
   resources, competing deployments, UN peacekeeping tradition and regional
   trade.},

Title = {Trusts and financialization},
Journal = {SOCIO-ECONOMIC REVIEW},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {15},
Number = {1},
Pages = {31-63},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {This article identifies trusts as a legal structure associated with the
   global spread of financialization. Although trusts originated in
   Medieval England, they have acquired a new significance in contemporary
   finance by virtue of their advantages in terms of profit maximization
   and capital mobility. As a result, trusts have become common in
   contemporary structured finance for corporations, in addition to their
   traditional functions as estate planning and asset protection vehicles
   for high-net-worth individuals. This article specifies three ways in
   which the trust structure has facilitated the global spread of
   financialization: by privileging the rentier-investor within the world
   economy; by perpetuating a distinctively Anglo-American approach to
   finance internationally; and by increasing the autonomy of finance
   vis-a-vis the nation-state. This study shares the primarily descriptive

Abstract = {This article analyzes the political utility of US drone strikes
   theoretically and deductively. Placing strikes within the context of the
   theorized political functions of force and considering how they fit into
   two grand strategies, restraint and selective engagement, I argue that
   these strikes buy the United States relatively little in the way of
   political effects assuring its own security because the terrorism threat
   they are intended to combat is a limited one within the skein of US
   global interests. Furthermore, their contribution to counter-terrorism
   efforts is likely to diminish with the adoption of armed drones by
   non-state actors. Drone strikes can, however, provide leverage over
   recalcitrant US client states while reassuring liberal partners and
   giving them some leverage over US choices. In addition, within the
   counter-terrorism sphere, drone strikes are less likely to inflame
   popular opinion than are alternative uses of force. This analysis
   contributes to an increasingly rigorous examination of the strikes' role
   in US foreign and security policy.},

Abstract = {For several years now, the role that digitally mediated social movements
   and online communities play in challenging authoritarian regimes in the
   Middle East and North Africa has been extensively debated. The focus of
   attention on the political use of the Internet shapes conventional
   wisdom that political issues are widespread in online communities in
   these contexts and that the users are predominantly oppositional users
   with political democratic motivations. Using fresh methods and
   techniques to gather a variety of online data, this chapter argues and
   reveals that, at least in the case of Iran, this view selectively
   overlooks the diversity of users and the broad range of issues
   frequently and intensively discussed among users in online communities.
   The failure to examine a broader range of issues means that scholars
   have neglected how consensus forms and develops among online users in
   other issues. This study broadens our understanding of the current
   social issues and possible areas of change in Iran through investigating
   a more comprehensive frame of the Iranian web.},

Abstract = {The final version of the Comprehensive Economic Trade Agreement (CETA)
   between the European Union (EU) and Canada represents the archetype for
   new trade regimes. Ratification, however, has become an increasingly
   contentious issue for the EU. We argue that while CETA was pushed by a
   coalition of sectoral actors, the support for such an agreement
   increasingly dwindled. This is due to a vehement anti-FTA sentiment
   across the EU, propagated by the onset of Transatlantic Trade and
   Investment Partnership negotiations. We state as paradox that the
   Commission insisted to include the Canadian provinces in order to secure
   the operation of an agreement and at the same time neglected its own
   weak political power to settle the agreement. CETA came into being but
   may not become the comprehensive agreement as it was being negotiated as
   the investment chapter may run into ratification problems by a small
   number of member states.},

Journal = {POLITICS RELIGION \& IDEOLOGY},

Volume = {18},
Number = {2},
Pages = {135-156},
Abstract = {Giorgio Agamben's discourse on Franciscan monasticism is generally
   received in accordance with his presentation of it: as a genealogy or
   archaeology of the way in which the Franciscans were the first to embody
   an exemplary form of life. This paper offers a different view, arguing
   that Agamben's account of the Franciscans is actually an allegory whose
   underlying structure and meaning is supplied by Heideggerian
   metaphysics. One of the striking features of Agamben's discourse is that
   it treats actual historical events as allegorical symbols or `paradigms'
   of a hidden metaphysical reality whose decipherment both clarifies the
   past and reveals the future. It is shown that this exemplary way of
   viewing historical events is embedded in a specialized spiritual
   exercise. Here, allegorical writing and reading act as practices of
   self-transformation that promise exalted insight into the hidden meaning
   of historical `paradigms' regardless of historical scholarship.},

Abstract = {The withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union is
   predominantly seen as negative development in Finland. The outcome of
   the referendum astonished Finland, yet the country had become
   increasingly concerned about the direction of UK's EU relations for a
   longer period of the time. The direct economic and political
   ramifications of the UK exit appears to be manageable for Finland. The
   indirect ones for the EU's economy, future and security are seen as more
   pertinent concerns for Finland. Thus the first priority for Finland has
   been to engage in mitigating the negative consequences of the Brexit for
   the EU, and consolidating European integration.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF EUROPEAN PUBLIC POLICY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {24},
Number = {5},
Pages = {714-734},
Abstract = {What is the causal relationship between crisis, learning and change? How
   did causality unfold in the key years of 2009-2010 when the European
   Union had to face the most formidable attacks to the single currency and
   responded with substantial reforms of the euro area? We question the
   conventional identification of the cause-and-effect relationship
   provided by theories of crisis management, integration and policy
   learning. Drawing on models of contingent learning developed within
   psychology and behavioural economics, we theorize that surprise produces
   behavioural change via a fast-paced associative mechanism and that
   policy learning follows change. We then run our exercise in causal
   identification through a plausibility probe. We show that our argument
   passes the plausibility probe. Our conclusions on cognition and
   situational effects on learning during crises suggest a new research
   agenda, more sensitive to how individuals behave in the real world and
   more robust in its micro-foundations.},

Abstract = {Although the objectives of hard Eurosceptic parties are focused on the
   European Union (EU), a presence in the European Parliament (EP) is not
   their final goal. In order to fulfil their main objective - disbanding
   of the EU - they need to be relevant at the national level as well.
   Thus, being represented at the EU level can be used by them as a
   springboard to the domestic scene. This article analyses how such a
   process may occur. As its main finding, it claims that success in the EP
   elections can be Pyrrhic victory for hard Eurosceptics, since it
   reinforces their niche status.},

Abstract = {This paper analyzes the effects of electoral rules for reserved seats in
   parliaments on representatives' ability and motivation to represent
   minorities. While most previous studies treat reserved seats as a
   uniform mechanism, the author argues that we can distinguish varieties
   along two attributes: electorate and candidacy. Limiting electorate
   means that only minority members can vote for reserved seat candidates,
   which motivates representatives to defend minority interests with the
   objective of optimizing re-election chances. Limiting candidacy to
   minority members obliges being a group member to all candidates for
   reserved seats, which improves minority members' acceptance of the
   political system they live in. Evidence from the case of indigenous
   people in New Zealand, Venezuela and Taiwan supports the fruitfulness of
   electoral rules for reserved seats as a factor explaining the quality of
   minority representation.},

Abstract = {This article first reviews and compares Human Rights Council and
   University Period Review (HRC/UPR) research published during and shortly
   after the institution-building period (2006-2009) to more recent work
   (2010-2014) to identify patterns of scholarly interest in NGO roles and
   behavior at the HRC/UPR. It divides research into that which either
   ignores NGOs or offers indirect attention, direct attention, or
   foregrounds NGO activity, concluding that NGOs are surprisingly
   underexamined, given remarkable new participatory opportunities in the
   HRC/UPR and the centrality of NGO information provision to the success
   of the new body. Empirical analysis of NGO statements from the CHR to
   the HRC indicates sharply increasing NGO participation, particularly
   among domestic, regional, and Southern NGOs. The increased volume and
   changing characteristics of participating NGOs may have important
   effects on the HRC/UPR and should also encourage further analysis.},

Abstract = {That terrorists, criminals, and their facilitators exploit the global
   marketplace is well known. While the global movement of illicit goods is
   well documented, robust empirical evidence linking terrorism and
   organized crime remains elusive. This article posits Network Science as
   a means of making these links more apparent. As a critical case study,
   Hezbollah is quite possibly the most mature globalized terrorist
   organization, although it thinks of itself as the ``Party of God.{''}
   However, the means seem to justify the ends: this article shows that
   Hezbollah's holy men have no qualms about resorting to pornography,
   contraband cigarettes, immigration fraud, and credit card fraud to raise
   funds. Beyond establishing links, Social Network Analysis reveals other
   important characteristics, such as the relative autonomy from Hezbollah
   headquarters that local fundraising networks enjoy. That finding implies
   a paradigm shift: Hezbollah is no less a terrorist organization than an
   organized crime syndicate. This is apparent in a network's structure.
   Transnational Organized Crime is typically about nodes being connected
   to many others in the network. Yet, Hezbollah fundraising networks allow
   such connectivity because of the group's typically high levels of mutual
   trust and familial relationships. This creates a vulnerability that can
   be exploited by law enforcement and intelligence organizations.},

Abstract = {Does the enumeration of ethnic, racial, and/or religious categories on
   national household censuses increase the likelihood of conflict? The
   authors propose a theory of intergroup relations that emphasizes the
   conflictual effects of institutionalizing boundaries between social
   identity groups. The article investigates the relationship between
   counting and various forms of conflict with an original, global data set
   that classifies the type of enumeration used in more than one thousand
   census questionnaires in more than 150 countries spanning more than two
   centuries. Through a series of cross-national statistical analyses, the
   authors find a robust association between enumeration of ethnic
   cleavages on the census and various forms of competition and conflict,
   including violent ethnic civil war. The plausibility of the theory is
   further demonstrated through case study analysis of religious conflict
   in India.},

Abstract = {China has experienced significant social, economic and political
   transformations since its economic reform started in the late 1970s.
   Considerable changes in its policy-making and implementation approaches
   have also emerged. Confronted with the intensified tension between the
   call for efficiency and strong pressure to improve social welfare, the
   Chinese government had no choice but to become instrumentally pragmatic
   in adopting different governance strategies to address the increasingly
   complex social, economic and political developments. Thus, neoliberal
   tenets were introduced. This article sets out to examine, against the
   wider policy context, how neoliberal tenets, particularly its emphasis
   on market principles, have been injected in higher education governance.
   This article aims to explore how the multi-faceted dynamics shaped the
   development of transnational higher education and influenced the
   governance of Sino-foreign cooperation universities.},

   Lethality},
Journal = {TERRORISM AND POLITICAL VIOLENCE},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {29},
Number = {3},
Pages = {533-549},
Abstract = {Scholars, politicians, and pundits increasingly suggest lone wolf
   terrorists are substantial threats, but we know little about how
   dangerous these actors areespecially relative to other terrorist actors.
   How deadly are lone actor terrorists? A growing body of empirical
   research focuses on terrorist organizations, but similar work on lone
   actors is sparse. Furthermore, attempts to explicitly compare these or
   other types of terrorist actors are almost non-existent. This article
   considers theoretical arguments for why lone wolves ought to be
   especially lethal. However, it presents an argument for why terrorist
   groups should generally be more lethal. This argument is conditional
   upon the environment in which actors operate. Lone wolves should only be
   more deadly in states with especially strong counterterrorism capacity.
   The article uses data on terrorist attacks in fifteen developed
   countries, 1970-2010, to compare the lethality of terrorist acts. Around
   the world, attacks by organizations tend to be far more lethal than
   attacks by other actors. In the United States, however, lone wolves are
   generally the more lethal terrorist actors. This is argued to be because
   the robust counterterrorism capacity makes organized terrorism more
   difficult to accomplish.},

Abstract = {It remains contested whether peacekeeping works. The impact of
   peacekeepers' actions at the local subnational level for overall mission
   success has lately received critical attention. Local peacekeeping is
   expected to matter because it reassures local actors, deters resumption
   of armed hostilities, coerces parties to halt fighting, and makes
   commitment to agreements credible. Thus peacekeepers affect the
   relations between central and local elites and avoid the emergence of
   local power vacuums and areas of lawlessness. This study uses new
   subnational data on the deployment of United Nations peacekeepers. It
   uses matching and recursive bivariate probit models with exogenous
   variables for temporal and spatial variation to deal with possible
   nonrandom assignment of the treatment. We demonstrate that conflict
   episodes last for shorter periods when peacekeepers are deployed to
   conflict-prone locations inside a country, even with comparatively
   modest deployment. The effect of peacekeeping on the onset of local
   conflict is, however, less clear cut.},

Pages = {139-176},
Abstract = {``Smart cities{''} promise to employ advanced digital technologies and
   data analytics to revolutionize the ways hundreds of thousands of people
   live in and interact with the city. As such, the journey toward building
   a smart city is considered a major socio-technical transformation with
   wide policy implications. Despite this, an increasing number of cities
   around the world are embarking on this journey, but are facing numerous
   organizational, societal, political, and technological challenges. This
   study 1 describes the critical first phase of Dubai's
   mega-transformation into a ``smart{''} city. The city's officially
   stated vision is to become the ``smartest{''} city in the world by 2017,
   merely three years after the launch of the project. According to the
   city's vision, this does not only mean making the city more responsive,
   efficient, and environmentally sustainable, but at the core of this
   ambitious goal is transforming the city to one of the ``happiest{''}
   places on earth to live and work. The ``Smart Dubai Office{''} is the
   entity mandated with driving the city's transformation in partnership
   with numerous government and private sector partners. During the first
   phase of Dubai's smart city initiative, these stakeholders realized that
   achieving such ambitious goals requires tackling multifaceted
   challenges. This case study illustrates these challenges from the
   stakeholders' perspective. It also describes the milestones reached
   during the critical first phase of Dubai's stride toward building the
   smart city and documents the multifaceted complexities and policy
   responses during this journey.},

Abstract = {South Korea is threatened by its troubled relationship with North Korea.
   North Korea possesses a large cache of missiles as well as chemical and
   biological weapons, and the future potential to mount nuclear weapons on
   its missiles. The United States is also challenged because of its
   defense commitments to Seoul. As a countermeasure, the United States and
   South Korea decided to deploy Terminal High Altitude Area Defense
   (THAAD) missile defenses in South Korea. However, China has objected.
   Chinese scholars believe the THAAD radar would be able to track Chinese
   inter-continental ballistic missiles, thereby weakening their deterrent.
   A technical analysis does not support this assertion. However, it is
   vital for South Korea, given its proximity and economic interdependence,
   to reassure China. South Korea should highlight that THAAD will be
   deployed by the United States Forces Korea and is not a commitment by
   Seoul to become part of U.S.-led missile defenses in the Asia-Pacific.},

Abstract = {How can public engagement assist in the development of just processes
   and outcomes in adaptation discourse and policymaking? A concern with
   justice is at the center of thinking about adaptation that is not only
   resilient, but also public, engaging, and transformative. Theoretically,
   the intersection of adaptation, transformation, and environmental and
   climate justice is examined, before exploring the specific concerns and
   normative foundations for adaptation policy articulated by local
   governments, environmental groups, and local residents engaged in
   adaptation planning in Australia. Despite a discursive disconnect
   between governmental focus on a risk or resilience-based approach and a
   community concern with the vulnerability of basic needs and capabilities
   of everyday life, deliberative engagement in adaptation planning can
   both address issues of justice and represent a transformative practice.},

Abstract = {This research evaluates changes in attitudes toward immigrants and
   immigration policy over five decades. Utilizing data from Gallup and CBS
   opinion polls between 1964 and 2012, this study explores mass opinion
   regarding appropriate levels of immigration, whether immigrants create
   competition over employment opportunities, granting of amnesty, and the
   likelihood of immigrants becoming productive citizens and contributing
   to the American economy. With particular focus on trends among
   African-American respondents, it is among the first empirical studies to
   conduct a longitudinal exploration of African-American attitudes toward
   immigrants and immigration policy. In contrast to literature that
   emphasizes competition and conflict between Blacks and Latinos, our
   results indicate that Blacks were more likely than Whites to express
   proimmigrant sentiments. Socioeconomic variables had a slightly greater
   effect among Whites than Blacks. In line with previous studies,
   respondents with less education and/or lower income were more likely to
   oppose the rights of immigrants. Some of these differences seem to have
   widened in recent years.},

Abstract = {The transformation of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT)
   rights into a ``standard for civilisation{''} has not been without
   consequences. With LGBT Pride parades becoming a symbol for Europeanness
   in the European Union (EU) accession process, this article asks how the
   litmus test character of Belgrade Pride has transformed LGBT politics in
   Serbia. Empirically, the analysis provides an in-depth analysis of how
   Serbia's EU accession process has shaped the politics of Belgrade Pride
   between 2001 and 2015 and vice versa. It is argued that the
   international symbolic usage of Pride is no innocent practice as it has
   foreclosed its local politicality. Indeed, whilst Belgrade Pride became
   politicised as a litmus test in the EU accession process, domestically
   it developed into an apolitical ritualised event devoid of LGBT
   politics.},

Abstract = {Emirates Global Aluminium (EGA) is considered as one of the world's top
   five aluminium producers in the world and is acclaimed to be as a market
   leader in the aluminium industry. EGA was formed by combining Dubai
   Aluminium ({''}DUBAL{''}) and Emirates Aluminium ({''}EMAL{''}), which
   had begun operating in 1979 and 2009. 1 EGA is equally owned by Mubadala
   Development Company of Abu Dhabi and Investment Corporation of Dubai. 2
   Currently, EGA is an aluminium conglomerate and has significant
   interests in bauxite/alumina and primary aluminium smelting; with plans
   for significant local growth and international expansion. 3 After
   merging DUBAL and EMAL in 2013, EGA has served over 300 industrial
   customers and 70 different countries in the region and overseas. On

Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL POLITICS},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {26},
Number = {6},
Pages = {973-993},
Abstract = {The variety of ideas about ways nature is valued' in public policymaking
   are investigated. A theoretical ideational approach is combined with
   empirical analysis of the UK's ecosystem services framework. Several
   types of ideas are identified, and how they interact is examined: ideas
   about nature itself; about the role that different research on the value
   of nature can or should play in decision-making; and about how policy
   decisions are made. In particular, the ways these ideas appear in
   academic debates, especially in ecological economics and philosophy, are
   confronted with how ideas appear in the policy practice of employing a
   valuing nature' concept. This reveals political dynamics sometimes
   missed by both advocates and critics of the concept of ecosystem
   services, such as the importance of promoting organisations and their
   agendas and activities, persuading different actors to change positions,
   and institutional commitments and sunk costs.},

Abstract = {Using the case of democracy and human rights promotion, this article
   examines the concept of ``differentiation{''} in relations between
   Azerbaijan and the European Union (EU). Post-independence, Azerbaijan
   increasingly positions itself as a strong and influential actor,
   demanding more discretion from the EU, based on equal input and interest
   representation. This article argues that the EU approach remains too
   unilateral, causing the Azerbaijani government to resist and gain
   influence through different routes, including lobbying activities. The
   article concludes that EU policy-making mechanisms could become more
   differentiated to reflect the political reality of changing power
   dynamics between the EU and Azerbaijan.},

Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL POLITICS},

Pages = {715-737},
Abstract = {The Lima-Paris Action Agenda (LPAA), launched in 2014 to mobilize
   non-state and subnational climate action in the run-up to the 21st
   Conference of the Parties (COP21) of the United Nations Framework
   Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), is conceptualized as an
   orchestration attempt where the French COP21 and Peruvian COP20
   presidencies together with the United Nation Secretary General's office
   and the UNFCCC Secretariat enlisted non-state and subnational actors to
   influence states. Using a method seldom used in global governance
   research to reconstruct the intervention theory of the LPAA, the
   assumptions and expectations underpinning its performance are unveiled,
   suggesting a series of micro-steps between input, output and outcome
   that the evaluator must link causally to understand the LPAA's
   performance. This contributes insights for orchestration theory and
   global climate policy, suggesting that leadership and institutional
   environment were conducive for the LPAA's creation. The benefits and
   challenges of reconstructing intervention theory in global governance
   research are also discussed.},

Abstract = {While the psychological underpinnings of social ideology are well
   established, less is known about the psychological underpinnings of
   economic ideology. In this study, I assess whether Big Five personality
   traits are associated with economic ideology and when personality traits
   are more strongly or more weakly associated with economic ideology. I
   hypothesize that low income attenuates the association between the Big
   Five traits and economic ideology. Studies conducted in Denmark, the
   United Kingdom, and the United States show that Conscientiousness is
   positively correlated with economic conservatism, while Agreeableness
   and Neuroticism are negatively correlated with economic conservatism.
   Moreover, low income attenuates the association between personality
   traits and economic ideology. I report a weaker association between
   Agreeableness and economic ideology among poor people compared to
   wealthier people in all three countries. Low income also attenuates the
   association between economic ideology and the traits Openness (Denmark),
   Extraversion (United Kingdom), and Neuroticism (United States). I
   contribute to the literature addressing the psychological correlates of
   economic ideology by showing that (1) economic ideology has a distinct
   set of personality correlates and (2) low income attenuates the
   association between some personality traits and economic ideology.},

Abstract = {The United States and the European Union include several environmental
   clauses in their respective preferential trade agreements (PTAs).
   Building on an exhaustive and fine-grained dataset of PTAs'
   environmental clauses, this article makes two contributions. First, it
   shows that the United States and the European Union have initially
   favored different approaches to environmental protection in their PTAs.
   The United States' concerns over regulatory sovereignty and level
   playing field have led to a legalistic and adversarial approach, while
   the European Union's concerns for policy coherence have led to a more
   procedural and cooperative approach. Second, this article provides
   evidence that European and American trade negotiators have gradually
   converged on a shared set of environmental norms. Although the United
   States and the European Union initially pursued different objectives,
   they learned from each other and drew similar lessons. As a result,
   recent American agreements have become more Europeanlike, and European
   agreements have become more Americanized. This article concludes that
   U.S. and E.U. approaches, far from being incompatible, can usefully be
   combined and reinforce each other.},

Abstract = {Democratic theories expect citizens to be able to accurately evaluate
   fulfilment of parties' election pledges. We use specifically designed
   survey items from the Swedish National Election Study to compare
   citizens' perceptions of the fulfilment of specific party pledges with
   actual fulfilment and assess circumstances that lead to correct
   evaluations. We find that political knowledge triumphs partisan
   attachments to incumbent parties when it comes to explaining why voters
   are correct. The results are interesting in light of common knowledge
   about the importance of partisan attachment in evaluations of general
   government performance: We argue that when specific election pledges are
   being evaluated, personal heuristics, such as attachments to incumbent
   parties, play a lesser role for judgements. Instead, the specificity
   embedded in the evaluation encourages citizens to engage in a more
   knowledge-based evaluation of whether pledges are fulfilled or not.},

Abstract = {This article studies how transnational advocacy networks can influence
   international development finance. Transnational activists shaped the
   World Bank's lending by increasing its transparency and limiting its
   socioenvironmental impacts. Developing countries can now look toward
   rising powers' national development banks to finance their
   infrastructure and energy projects. The national development banks' weak
   transparency and socioenvironmental standards pose a new challenge for
   transnational activism. Can activists leverage strategies used in World
   Bank reform to influence emerging power national development banks? We
   argue that whether a target is a supranational or national institution
   shapes the deployment and effectiveness of the strategies activists can
   use for influence. A supranational mandate and structure facilitates the
   deployment and effectiveness of a direct strategy focused on the
   transnational level, targeting the bank itself, and an indirect strategy
   focused on the national contexts of the bank's shareholders and
   borrowers. In contrast, a national mandate and structure encourages
   activists to deploy influence strategies solely in the context of the
   lending state. They furthermore make indirect strategies more effective
   than direct ones. We illustrate our argument by exploiting variation in
   the success across campaigns of a transnational network created to
   reform the Brazilian National Development Bank.},

Abstract = {With the promised return of Parliamentary powers, Brexit is supposed to
   be a fillip for representative democracy. There is a significant danger
   that will not be so. EU membership weakened the conditions for
   representative democracy within those fields governed by the EU.
   Whitehall will almost be the central player in the reform of EU-derived
   law. And policy styles are being developed which marginalise rather than
   consolidate UK legislatures in these fields. Restoration of
   representative democracy will require a realistic re-evaluation of its
   virtues so that these can be protected and a re-imagination of the
   possibilities and limits of parliaments within such a landscape.},

Abstract = {Public sector actors express rising interest in multi-stakeholder
   initiatives as a means of expanding private sector contributions to
   address sustainable development goals. Private sector interests in
   participating in such initiatives have however received limited
   attention. This article examines business motives for associating with
   global multi-stakeholder initiatives by analyzing corporate engagement
   with the Energy Efficiency Accelerator Platform of the Sustainable
   Energy for All (SEforALL) initiative. The analysis of the
   characteristics of participating firms highlights that the platform has
   mainly attracted companies based in Europe and those with a broad
   geographical reach. The article identifies clear economic rationales for
   companies to participate. The analysis emphasizes that indirect gains to
   firms through activities designed to shape the market for the uptake of
   energy efficient technologies and direct gains related to connecting
   with potential customers through networking activities are key motives
   for business participation. This case indicates that multi-stakeholder
   initiatives can provide a platform for transforming markets by
   facilitating interactions between private sector actors and national and
   subnational governments.},

   Microfinance},
Journal = {GLOBAL POLICY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {8},
Number = {4},
Pages = {540-552},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {This paper studies the governance of microfinance and asks about its
   recursivity: whether the system is responsive to changes prompted by
   feedback from borrowers or not. It draws on Hirschmann's heuristic of
   exit and voice and the idea of participation in development, to examine
   three channels of feedback from borrowers to rule-makers and ask to what
   extent they have facilitated or restricted recursivity in microfinance.
   The standardisation of microfinance along a financial template is shown
   to have created very open flows of financial information, useful for
   monitoring clients' exit, but not granting them voice. The more recent
   creation of systems for social performance management and pursuing
   responsible' microfinance, however, has not resulted in similarly robust
   information flows, because, despite intentions to capture client
   satisfaction and feedback, these channels are severely restricted. They
   offer borrowers little chance to practically exercise voice and convey
   feedback which affects the rules. Recursivity studies, it is suggested,
   might integrate participation and exit/voice frameworks to explore the
   prospects of feedback from grassroots rule-subjects and better
   understand the factors that can restrict it. For microfinance, it is
   suggested that government regulation and clients' collective action
   could be necessary where the sector's governance system shows itself to
   be unresponsive.},

Title = {Anarcho-Metropolitan Contradiction: Municipal Decentralization and
   Regional Centralism in Chile},
Journal = {REVISTA DEL CLAD REFORMA Y DEMOCRACIA},
Year = {2017},
Number = {69},
Pages = {133-158},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {In Chile, a strong state centralism coexists with a notable municipal
   decentralization. This contradiction implies that regions are governed
   by authorities designated by the national government, while municipal
   authorities are elected and have political and financial autonomy. This
   administrative contradiction results, in part, in non-existent regional
   governments-despite the recent election. of regional councilors- since
   they are, strictly speaking, central government delegates, including
   regional ministerial secretaries (governors are not yet elected).
   Another expression of this contradiction is the municipal atomization,
   with communes that reproduce inequality and territorial segregation in
   their capacities and resources, with divided and weakened intermunicipal
   associations.
   The conjunction of these two realities, centralism in larger
   administrative divisions, and atomized municipal decentralization in
   smaller areas, collapse in pluricomunal metropolitan areas, which are
   literally without government. Although centralism inhibits regional
   development, and municipal fragmentation reproduces inequality, the
   ``anarcho-metropolitan contradiction{''} is the most serious consequence
   of both of these conditions. The lack of government results is
   inequality for the majority, and in inefficiency for the urban and
   national economy.
   Despite the gravity and urgency of this ``anarcho-metropolitan
   contradiction{''}, alternative solutions have been politically unviable.
   The possibility of an elected metropolitan government -with the risks
   that whoever presides over it turns into a powerful political competitor
   counterbalanced by a council of intercommunal mayors seems to be a
   possible option to evaluate.},

Abstract = {This article begins by asking how have elites, who are more fragmented,
   transitory and precarious than ever, continued to do so well out of
   discredited, financialised capitalist democracy? One possible answer
   lies in what I term the new professional econocracy. As the article
   reveals, an increasing proportion of elite figures at the top of
   business and government now have educational and/or professional
   experiences of economics and related disciplines. On the one hand, this
   provides the basis of a shared professional discourse and accompanying
   set of norms, values and practices. This unites disparate and mobile
   elites. On the other hand, such knowledge enables these elites both to
   move across sectors and to game the economic and accounting systems that
   they have helped construct. Thus, elites reflexively adapt to, and
   benefit from, economic rules while also rigidly dictating them to those

Abstract = {The article investigates the democratic model of the European Union (EU)
   from a comparative perspective. A democratic model concerns the way in
   which systemic divisions, expression of structural cleavages, are
   institutionally and politically regulated in order to generate
   authoritative decisions applicable to all members (citizens and
   territorial units) of the political system. On the bases of a critique
   of the statist paradigm that influences comparative politics literature,
   the article has shown that unions of asymmetrical and differentiated
   states (as the United States, Switzerland and the supranational EU)
   function according to a democratic logic different from the ones
   characterizing the nation states. Unions of states function without both
   a government and a state because structured on multiple separation of
   powers that segment sovereignty horizontally and vertically. The
   segmentation of sovereignty constitutes a condition for preventing
   domination of the larger and powerful states on the smaller and weaker
   ones.},

Abstract = {Do references to God in political discourse increase confidence in the
   U.S. sociopolitical system? Using a system justification framework (Jost
   \& Banaji, ), five studies provide evidence that, (1) increasingly
   governments symbolically associate the nation with God when public
   confidence in the social system may be threatened and (2) associating
   the nation with God serves a system-justifying function by increasing
   public confidence in the system. In an analysis of U.S. presidential
   speeches, presidents were more likely to symbolically associate the
   nation with God during threatening times (Study 1). Among religious
   individuals, referencing God in political rhetoric increased the
   perceived trustworthiness of politicians, compared to patriotic secular
   rhetoric (Study 2) or simply priming the concept of God (Study 3). These
   effects were also unique to politicians from one's own sociopolitical
   system (Study 4). Finally, believing God has a plan for the United
   States attenuates the deleterious effect that perceptions of national
   decline have on system confidence (Study 5). Implications for the
   system-justifying function of religion are discussed.},

Abstract = {The present research investigated a multilevel person-context
   interactionist framework for the relationship between right-wing
   ideologies and prejudice across two large, representative samples (Study
   1: European Social Survey: N=56,752; Study 2: World Values Survey:
   N=74,042). Across three different operationalizations of right-wing
   ideology, two contextual levels (regional and national) of right-wing
   climate, and three types of outgroup attitudes (i.e., age-, ethnicity-,
   and gender-based), the analyses consistently revealed cross-level
   interactions, showing a strong association between right-wing attitudes
   and negative outgroup attitudes at the individual level in contexts with
   a low right-wing climate, whereas this relationship is weaker and often
   even absent in contexts with a high right-wing climate. These
   cross-level interactions remained significant after controlling for
   statistical artefacts (i.e., restriction of range and outliers). The
   authors propose norm setting as the mobilizing mechanism through which a
   right-wing climate develops and curbs the influence of individual
   right-wing social-ideological attitudes on outgroup attitudes.},

Abstract = {Recent surveys revealed few producers in an export sector participate in
   trade. Economists explained this result by relaxing their assumption
   about firms' operations, to produce a novel observation: Trade
   liberalization disproportionately benefits the most efficient producers
   in the sector, while potentially harming the least efficient. Political
   scientists have begun exploring the consequences of this variation,
   especially in lobbying. This article explores whether the impact of this
   finer-grained description of interests can be observed in the later
   stages of our demand-driven models of the politics of trade. I focus on
   one case with characteristics favorable to observing intra-industry
   differences: the American steel industry in Taft's presidency. A
   trade-based cleavage inside the sector determined firms' interests.
   Demands shaped policy, as observed in three pieces of legislation: the
   Payne-Aldrich Act, reciprocity with Canada, and the 1912 tariff. The
   first liberalized trade in steel, intensifying competition in the
   industry. The second promised to do the same, with a similar impact. The
   third had no effect, however, because Taft vetoed the bill. This case
   illustrates intra-industry firm heterogeneity can provide additional
   accuracy, revealing a previously undiscovered cleavage. Nonetheless,
   preferences alone did not determine policy.},

Abstract = {Like other types of diaspora groups, conflict-generated diasporas
   display a strong attachment to their countries of origin, and structure
   their identities and ideologies around discourses referring to their
   homeland. However, their inner cleavages, born out of the conflicts
   raging in their home countries, can run very deep. The maintenance of
   their ethnic, religious, linguistic or political divisions even
   generations after the migration process has taken place sometimes leads
   to conflict transportation processes, whereby the conflicts raging in
   their home countries are reproduced and maintained in countries of
   settlement. Incidents opposing rival diaspora groups are thus often
   interpreted as a prolongation or reproduction of core conflicts raging
   in their regions of origin. Against this assumption, this article argues
   that if transported conflicts often formally take the shape of core
   conflicts, and emulate them by using the same language, symbols and
   ethnic/religious/linguistic categories, they are also deeply transformed
   by the migration process itself. In this perspective, this article
   explores the transformation and reinvention of conflict-generated
   diasporas' politics, and proposes to look at the autonomisation
   processes they display vis-a-vis the core conflicts, in terms of content
   but also of objectives, ultimately generating a drift at the political
   and organisational levels.},

Abstract = {While we know why rebels may recruit children for their cause, our
   understanding of the consequences of child soldiering by non-state armed
   groups remains limited. The following research contributes to addressing
   this by examining how rebels' child recruitment practice affects the
   duration of internal armed conflicts. We advance the argument that child
   soldiering increases the strength of rebel organizations vis-a-vis the
   government. This, in turn, lowers the capability asymmetry between these
   non-state actors and the incumbent, allowing the former to sustain
   dispute. Ultimately, the duration of armed conflicts is likely to be
   prolonged. We analyse this relationship with quantitative data on child
   soldier recruitment by rebel groups in the post-1989 period. The results
   confirm our main hypothesis: disputes are substantially longer when
   rebels recruit children. This work has important implications for the
   study of armed conflicts, conflict duration and our understanding of
   child soldiering.},

Abstract = {Of the 11 post-socialist states that have already become European Union
   members only five have joined the common currency Eurozone. The other
   six, including Poland, the region's largest economy, have, pursuant to
   accession treaties, the right and obligation to adopt euro as their
   currency. They fail to exercise their right and meet their obligation,
   which has both causes and consequences. These are economic and political
   in nature and that is why there is no certainty about how the situation
   will evolve in future. However, from both of those perspectives, and
   especially for economic reasons, Eastern European EU members should join
   the Eurozone, as the resulting benefits, not only for Poland,
   significantly outweigh the conversion costs. Thus, new countries,
   especially Poland, adopting euro would have a positive impact on the
   European integration process, which is experiencing a serious
   structural, institutional and political crisis. (C) 2017 The Regents of

Title = {The paradox of peace and power: Contamination or enablement?},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL POLITICS},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {54},
Number = {5},
Pages = {637-658},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {In debates about peace most discussions of power implicitly revolve
   around four types: (1) the hegemonic exercise of direct power related to
   force; (2) relatedly, the existence and impact of structural power
   related to geopolitics or the global political economy; (3) the exercise
   of international governmentality, soft or normative power, by IOs; and
   (4) local agency, resistance, discursive or physical. Each of these
   types of power, while relational, may be exercised from different sites
   of legitimate authority: the international, the state, and the local,
   and their legitimacy is constructed via specific understandings of time
   and space. Each type of power and its related site of authority has
   implications for making peace. This paper examines in theoretical terms
   how types of power block, contaminate, or enable peace of various sorts.},

Abstract = {I study civilians' cooperation with an armed group in an irregular war.
   In the model, civilians differ in their valuation of siding with the
   armed group and make cooperation decisions without knowing others'
   motivations or cooperation choices. I find that a superior military
   force is not sufficient to bring high cooperation and that full
   cooperation can only be attained if military power is complemented by
   expectations of punishment for helping the enemy. The model challenges
   the idea that random violence aimed at punishing enemy cooperators is
   used when selectivity is difficult to implement, and it shows that
   indiscriminate reprisals induce lower levels of cooperation, even when
   enemy cooperators are less likely to be punished with selective methods.
   Finally, I find that communities that have a highly centralized process
   of decision making are expected to give their support to only one group
   of combatants and to be exposed to less violence.},

Title = {More dissimilar than alike? Public values preferences across US minority
   and white managers},

Abstract = {Interest in public values has grown considerably over the past two
   decades. Much of this attention reflects a growing awareness that public
   values hold considerable significance for citizens and public employees.
   Yet, despite the rapid expansion of research on public values, we still
   know little about the role of race in shaping and determining public
   employees' values preferences. To begin remedying this gap, this article
   examines whether minority and white public managers in large US local
   governments exhibit the same value preferences when making departmental
   decisions. Results from a multiple group confirmatory factor analysis
   indicate that minority and white managers express similar preferences
   for traditional public administration values; however, minority managers
   report a stronger preference for both traditional public administration
   (e.g., efficiency and effectiveness) and social equity-oriented (e.g.,
   equity, representation) values.},

Abstract = {Why do civil wars reoccur? Some scholars emphasize the role of post-war
   factors, while others locate the causes of civil war recurrence in the
   dynamics of the conflicts themselves. We build a theory that bridges
   these arguments by focusing on mass killing. We argue that government
   mass killing during war reduces opportunities for the opposition to
   return to military conflict in the future. This allows for longer
   periods of post-conflict peace. However, government atrocities that
   begin after the end of a civil war create new grievances without
   diminishing the ability of opponents to fight. This makes a faster
   return to conflict more likely. Statistical analysis of all civil wars
   between 1946 and 2006 strongly supports our arguments, even when we
   account for selection effects regarding when governments are more likely
   to engage in mass killing. These results reveal that both during-war and
   post-war tactics influence civil war recurrence, but that the same
   tactic can produce different effects depending on the timing of its use.},

Abstract = {This article contributes to the debate on employer preferences. It
   challenges varieties of capitalism's argument that manufacturing
   employers in Coordinated Market Economies (CMEs) will tend to defend
   non-liberal institutions because of the comparative institutional
   advantage that they provide. It examines Germany and Sweden, two
   critical cases in this debate. It is based on interviews with key
   officials and an in-depth examination of the Initiative Neue Soziale
   Marktwirtschaft (INSM) and Timbro, think-tanks sponsored by German and
   Swedish employers to shape public opinion. In line with power resource
   theory, I find that both German and Swedish employers have a strong
   preference for liberalization. In both cases, they responded to
   left-wing threats, institutional constraints and situations of ` crisis'
   by launching a counteroffensive and promoting welfare state reform,
   labor market flexibility and deregulation. Employers have used discourse
   as a power resource to pursue an aggressive liberalizing agenda and to
   attack institutions that required active deregulation on the part of the
   state. Whether employers in CMEs seek to dismantle existing institutions
   altogether or soften and reengineer these institutions from within, one
   thing is clear: their use of radical neoliberal discourse is
   incompatible with the claim that they defend traditional institutions in
   any meaningful sense.},

Abstract = {International organizations are increasingly paying attention to the
   problem of sexual violence. One outcome of this attention has been the
   adoption of instruments that call on states to punish perpetrators of
   rape and end impunity for this crime. The reporting of rape to law
   enforcement agencies is key to formally holding perpetrators
   accountable. This article examines the influence of police officers and
   gendarmes and of social forces on survivors' decision to report rape in
   post-conflict Cote d'Ivoire. It also investigates the challenges that
   confront those who choose to seek redress from the state. It argues that
   the Ivorian conflict contributed to fostering a preference for redress
   from the state over informal justice mechanisms. On the other hand, the
   blaming and shaming of rape survivors was pervasive and discouraged them
   from reporting. Support from friends and relatives increased the
   likelihood that survivors would report rape but negative social
   reactions had adverse psychosocial effects on them. The article explores
   the implications of these findings for ending impunity and for
   post-conflict gender relations.},

Abstract = {While some borders are real firewalls against conflicts, others appear
   like tinder just waiting for the smallest spark. Only recently has
   research focused on the transnational perspective of conflict and
   current research has focused mostly on isolated aspects of this
   phenomenon. In this article, we provide a unified framework for conflict
   contagion that takes into account receiver, sender, dyad, and network
   effects. This is a novel perspective on conflict contagion, and our
   empirical results suggest that distinguishing between sender and
   receiver effects allows for a better understanding of spillover effects.
   We provide insights that especially excluded ethnic groups impact the
   risk of countries sending and receiving conflicts from its neighbors.},

Abstract = {Britain's vote to withdraw from the EU came as an unexpected shock to
   many in the UK, the rest of the EU and around the world. The UK and the
   remaining EU now face a fraught and potentially lengthy period of
   negotiations to settle Brexit. How might this change Europe? And how
   might it change the rest of the world's views of Europe? This article
   looks at how Brexit could shape worldviews of Europe. It does so firstly
   by looking at the international and European roles Britain sees for
   itself and how the rest of Europe views those roles. The article then
   turns to views of both the UK and the EU from the USA, Russia and China.
   It argues that neither the UK nor the EU should overlook how external
   perceptions of Europe, the UK and Brexit matter because they will
   determine the strategic context in which the Brexit negotiations unfold.},

   about the impact of fmancial self-sufficiency, we use regression
   analysis. The results obtained did not confirmed the hypothesis.},

Abstract = {This study analyses impacts of China's outward foreign direct investment
   on host country policies and on the bilateral relationship with China by
   unravelling European and Chinese perceptions. We compare how China's
   takeover of German robotics manufacturer KUKA AG and the investment into
   nuclear power project Hinkley Point C in the UK were perceived amongst
   European societal, economic and political stakeholders. Based on media
   articles, companies' statements, political statements and interviews in
   China and the UK, we argue that China's investments in Europe lead to
   threat perceptions amongst host country stakeholders and fuel debates on
   whether and how to regulate deals that could harm security and
   technology interests. While rising threat perceptions have already
   altered FDI policies in the UK, the German case inherits the potential
   to alter economic policies.},

Abstract = {Service individualization is high on the agenda of active welfare
   states. Especially for the long-term unemployed and other people with
   complex problems, individualized employment and social services are seen
   as a crucial precondition for social and labour market integration. To
   achieve tailor-made service delivery, welfare states have introduced new
   governance mechanisms such as client profiling, performance indicators,
   game-theoretical incentives or institutionalized discretion. However,
   comparative research on how these governance mechanisms affect service
   individualization is still rare. To fill this gap, this article presents
   an exploratory vignette study on Denmark and the Netherlands conducted
   in 2010-12. The main finding of this study is that institutionalized
   discretion, as it is implemented in the Dutch minimum income system,
   increases the variety and innovativeness of employment services, makes
   service provision more holistic (especially for vulnerable clients), and
   increases the targeting capacity of service allocation between
   vulnerable and work-ready clients.},

Abstract = {Recent research on political advisers is characterized by an expansion
   beyond Westminster and clearer connections with proximate literatures.
   This article speaks to the second of these features by applying the
   Public Service Bargain (PSB) lens to minister/political adviser
   relationships in new ways. Extant PSB analyses either position political
   advisers as an independent variable influencing the core bargain between
   ministers and senior officials, or face difficulties when viewing
   advisers through existing perspectives developed to explain deals
   between politicians and public servants. Consequently, the nature of
   `the bargain applying to political advisers' (Hood and Lodge 2006, p.
   128) remains unclear. This article addresses that lacuna by deploying
   the reward, competence and loyalty dimensions of PSBs to specify the
   broad terms of the political adviser bargain, and considers the
   theoretical and empirical implications of such compacts.},

   Initiatives in Labor Repressive Regimes},
Journal = {GLOBAL POLICY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {8},
Number = {3, SI},
Pages = {56-65},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Since the early 1990s, a range of corporate monitoring and
   multi-stakeholder initiatives have sought to address the violation of
   workers' rights by monitoring suppliers in global supply chain and
   attempting to remediate violations. However, their effectiveness in the
   area of freedom of association rights has been limited, particularly in
   labor-repressive regimes. This is because these initiatives have pursued
   inadequate strategies and lack either traditional forms of state power,
   notably the ability to sanction violators, or the leverage provided by
   activist campaigns. Recent social compliance program approaches, such as

Abstract = {In this article, we provide evidence that civilian and military
   government spending have specific characteristics that can affect
   private consumption differently. Our vector autoregressive (VAR)
   estimates for the US economy for the period 1960-2013 show that civilian
   expenditure induces a positive and significant response on private
   consumption, whereas military spending has a negative impact. We also
   analyze the effects of these public spending components for the
   subsamples 1960-79 and 1983-2013, respectively. Our results show that
   the main transmission channels of both civilian and military
   expenditures have changed over time. We adopt a new Keynesian approach
   and develop a dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) model in
   order to simulate the empirical evidence. Both the larger persistence of
   shocks in military spending and the different financing mechanisms,
   which account for the propensity of policymakers to use budget deficits
   to finance wars, mimic the differences in the empirical responses of
   private consumption. Simulated impulse response functions of alternative
   specification models prove the robustness of our analysis. In
   particular, we assess the impact of civilian and military shocks in the
   presence of different (i) shares of heterogeneous households, (ii) price
   rigidities, and (iii) monetary reactions in response to different
   government shocks.},

Volume = {19},

Abstract = {How do strategies of state capture adapt to tight fiscal conditions? The
   article uses a historical institutionalist approach and content analysis
   to study the case of Greece. Three theoretically relevant patterns of
   institutional adaptation are unearthed: first, limited resources for
   state capture do indeed trigger self-limitation initiatives as expected,
   but these initiatives replace costly benefits with less costly ones.
   Second, different forms of capture have different implications for the
   terms of political competition. Third, there is a mutually reinforcing
   relationship between clientelism and corruption, which becomes
   pronounced in the creative ways by which strategies of capture adjust to
   shifting opportunities and constraints. Clients are appointed in state
   offices and extract bribes directly from citizens. Client corruption'
   replaces extraction from the state with extraction through the state,
   which is less costly for the public finances: the benefit the governing
   party gives to its clients is the right' to extract rents for
   themselves.},

Abstract = {Goal 14 of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals recognises
   the continued pressure on marine ecosystems and the need to implement
   performance based management arrangements for fisheries. Reformulating
   governance arrangements are prerequisites for achieving this: rectifying
   gaps while giving effect to existing hortatory obligations enable
   effective management decisions including for new and/or emerging issues
   such as climate change. This is particularly evident in the Indian
   Ocean, which is surrounded by developing states, and where the climate
   change impacts already evident. Indian Ocean fisheries governance
   arrangements are also imperfect: there is incomplete coverage of highly
   migratory species and high seas areas; and no one organisation where all
   relevant states share membership. Furthermore, the limited resources of
   developing coastal states restricts the ability to effectively
   understand and sustainably manage the resources. If developing coastal
   states are to meet 21st century challenges, governance arrangements must
   be modernised to address species, spatial and membership gaps while
   supporting the implementation of hortatory obligations and ocean-wide,
   cross-sectorial and cross-jurisdictional programs that: facilitate
   ocean-wide scientific monitoring of ecological processes and
   anthropogenic impacts, and enable integrated monitoring, control and
   surveillance (MCS) of fishing with the adopted management measures to
   improve certainty of the management.},

Abstract = {There is growing interest in the United Kingdom in holding a
   constitutional convention (CC) to deliberate possible reforms to the
   political system. What form should a CC take? Having identified a range
   of possible models, we examine their merits according to stated
   normative criteria, focusing specifically on (1) how CC membership is
   determined, (2) whether a CC should have agenda-setting power and (3)
   whether it should have power to send proposals to binding referendum. We
   find good reasons to support a citizen majority' membership (chosen in a
   near-random fashion from the general public), agenda-setting power and
   referendum power. However, none of these features is likely to be the
   most appropriate in all contexts. Further design issues concerning
   citizen-majority conventions, such as whether they ought to include
   politicians as a minority or exclude them, are also considered. While
   the immediate focus of discussion is the United Kingdom, the core
   argument has wider relevance.},

Abstract = {Comparative public policy combines theories of the policy process with
   the study of political systems and specific issue areas. Yet, some
   ambiguity surrounds what distinguishes the comparative approach from
   other perspectives on public policy. This review brings greater clarity
   to the comparative policy project by emphasizing the need to be
   attentive to similarities and differences regarding the institutional
   contexts in which policymaking takes place. This attention is necessary
   to avoid forcing a fit between the empirical reality and theories and
   frameworks designed with specific institutional configurations in mind.
   While forced fit posed problems for past research, recent theoretical
   advancements have been devised to facilitate comparison across
   dissimilar institutional settings. The following discussion highlights
   amendments to established approaches intended to deal with problems of
   comparison and identifies promising new perspectives from which
   comparative analysis may be conducted. The latest wave of comparative
   policy scholarship, having accounted for institutional variation, looks
   beyond institutions to policy discourses in order to explain how ideas,
   norms, and political culture affect how policy actors maneuver within,
   maintain, or change the institutional environment in which they operate.},

Abstract = {The primary objective of this article is to theorise transformations of
   Western order in a manner that does not presuppose a fixed understanding
   of `the West' as a pre-constituted political space, ready-made and
   waiting for social scientific enquiry. We argue that the Copenhagen
   School's understanding of securitisation dynamics provides an adequate
   methodological starting point for such an endeavour. Rather than taking
   for granted the existence of a Western `security community', we thus
   focus on the performative effects of a security semantics in which `the
   West' figures as the threatened, yet notoriously vague referent object
   that has to be defended against alleged challenges. The empirical part
   of the article reconstructs such securitisation dynamics in three
   different fields: the implications of representing China's rise as a
   challenge to Western order, the effects of the transformation of the
   North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) towards a global security
   actor, and the consequences of extraordinary renditions and practices of
   torture for the normative infrastructure of `the West'. We conclude that
   Western securitisation dynamics can be understood as a discursive shift
   away from a legally enshrined culture of restraint and towards more
   assertive forms of self-authorisation.},

Abstract = {Existing studies on interlocal collaboration have focused on whether or
   not to form collaboration. However, we examine the extent to which local
   governments collaborate with each other. We measure collaboration by the
   number of partnering local governments in different partnerships, and
   test hypotheses on the potential factors affecting the degree of
   collaboration among local governments from a resource-based view. With a
   sample of 70 partnerships established for local economic development
   among 116 local governments in South Korea, we find that local
   governments with less financial resources and private sector capacity
   are likely to establish more collaborative partnerships. By contrast,
   local governments with more human resources are likely to build more
   partnerships with others.},

Abstract = {This article presents a normative critique of the coherence of democracy
   promotion in the European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP). As an immanent
   critique, the paper derives its normative standards internally from an
   analysis of key ENP policy documents. It is argued that democracy
   promotion is in conflict with some of the other goals of the ENP such as
   market liberalisation, trade policy reforms and private sector
   development. Further, the incentive of market integration is argued to
   undermine democracy promotion. Though the ENP's current way of pursuing
   the goal of democratisation is normatively incoherent, this article also
   argues that incentivising democratisation through conditionality is not
   inherently contradictory. Two potential ways democratisation could be
   coherently promoted are suggested: delimiting the policy to unilateral
   transfers conditional on democratisation alone (simple transfers'), or
   offering EU membership to ENP countries (no integration without
   incorporation').},

   Multi-criteria Decision Analysis Problem of Value?},

Abstract = {A methodological approach is needed for allocating health care resources
   in an efficient and fair way that gives legitimacy to decisions.
   Currently, most priority setting approaches tend to focus on single or
   limited benefit dimensions, even though the value of new health care
   interventions is multi-dimensional. Explicit elicitation of social value
   trade-offs is usually not possible and decision-makers often adopt
   intuitive or heuristic modes for simplification purposes as part of an
   ad hoc decision-making process which might diminish the reasonableness
   and credibility of the decisions. In this paper, we suggest that
   multi-criteria decision analysis could provide a more comprehensive and
   transparent approach in health care to systematically capture
   decision-makers' concerns, compare value trade-offs and elicit their
   value preferences. We conclude that such methods could inform the
   development of a decision support system in health care, contributing
   towards more efficient, rational and legitimate resource allocation
   decisions.},

Abstract = {This article aims to examine why ethnic allegiances have persisted as
   the most dominant platform used by the elites to organise collective
   action in Kenya. The author formulates a broad theoretical framework
   centred around the organisational role of ethnicity in negotiating
   social orders. Empirically, it is shown that ethnic allegiances in Kenya
   are deeply rooted in group inequalities and feelings of historical
   injustice. Moreover, the historical structure of the economy has skewed
   the distribution of economic rents toward group-specific activities and
   resources. Therefore, the early institutions of the country were
   designed in such a way that the stability of political order would
   depend on the elites' ability to use ethnicity as a bargaining chip.
   Ethnicity continues to be politically salient partly because economic
   rents are not individualised enough to sustainably support trans-ethnic
   forms of organisation.},

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL THEORY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {9},
Number = {1},
Pages = {1-32},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {This paper examines recognition in the cosmopolitan sphere of
   recognition - a sphere of ethical life and social freedom formed in the
   processes of recognition between individuals and groups across, over,
   and beyond, the state. The paper contends that Axel Honneth's
   recognition theory can overcome many of the limitations inherent to
   established cosmopolitan paradigms, and, through normative
   reconstruction, provide a unique methodological framework from which
   existing cosmopolitan social relations can be examined. This will
   provide the foundations for a relational cosmopolitanism. The paper
   argues that only a form of mutual recognition that satisfies both local
   and cosmopolitan ties of political community could adequately secure the
   intersubjective conditions necessitated in the Hegelian, ontological
   notion of freedom (freedom as being at home with oneself in one's
   other'). This contention is pursued through three interrelated
   arguments: (i) an engagement with Honneth's analysis of the
   intersubjective conditions necessary for leading a `good' or
   `successful' life through mutual recognition; (ii) deploying the method
   of normative reconstruction to identify social freedoms in the
   cosmopolitan sphere, and; (iii) by exploring the existence of
   cosmopolitan recognition as a unique form of personal relations, an
   extension of rights in transnational civil society, and, as a unique
   form of solidarity in an emergent cosmopolitan public sphere.},

Abstract = {The ongoing health crisis in the Ukraine has persisted for 48 years with
   a clear division of gender-based outcomes as seen in the decline of male
   life expectancy and stagnation of female longevity. The purpose of this
   paper is to investigate differences in self-rated health and system
   barriers to health care applicable to gender and its intersections
   because of the differing negative health outcomes for men and women.
   Intersectionality theory provides an analytic framework for interpreting
   our results. Utilizing a nationwide sample of the Ukrainian population
   (N = 1908), we found that low socioeconomic status (SES) women rate
   their health worse than men generally and any other socioeconomic group.
   Yet women also face the greatest barriers to health care until older
   ages when the ailments of men cause them to likewise face the obstacles.
   In reviewing the barrier to health care scale, one barrier that of
   health care services being too expensive dominated the responses with
   some 52.5 percent of the sample reporting it. Consequently, the greatest
   problem in Ukraine with respect to health reform reported by the
   population is the out-of-pocket costs for care in a system that is
   officially free. These costs, constituting some 40 percent of all
   national health expenditures, affect women and the aged the most. (c)

Title = {Financing rebellion: Using piracy to explain and predict conflict
   intensity in Africa and Southeast Asia},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF PEACE RESEARCH},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {54},
Number = {2, SI},
Pages = {215-230},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {A prominent explanation of the resource-conflict relationship suggests
   that natural resources finance rebellion by permitting rebel leaders the
   opportunity to purchase weapons, fighters, and local support. The
   bunkering of oil in the Niger Delta by quasi-criminal syndicates is an
   example of how the black-market selling of stolen oil may help finance
   anti-state groups. More systematic assessments have also shown that the
   risk and duration of conflict increases in the proximity of oil and
   diamond deposits. Yet despite the emphasis on rebel resource extraction
   in these arguments, empirical assessments rely almost exclusively on
   latent resource availability rather than actual resource extraction.
   Focusing on maritime piracy, this article argues that piracy is a
   funding strategy neglected in current research. Anecdotal evidence
   connects piracy in the Greater Gulf of Aden to arms trafficking, the
   drug trade, and human slavery. The revenue from attacks may find its way
   to Al-Shabaab. In Nigeria, increasing attacks against oil transports may
   signal an effort by insurgents to use the profits from piracy as an
   additional revenue stream to fund their campaign against the Nigerian
   government. The article hypothesizes that piracy incidents, that is,
   actual acts of looting, increase the intensity of civil conflict. Using
   inferential statistics and predictive assessments, our evidence from
   conflicts in coastal African and Southeast Asian states from 1993 to
   2010 shows that maritime piracy increases conflict intensity, and that
   the inclusion of dynamic factors helps improve the predictive
   performance of empirical models of conflict events in in-sample and
   out-of-sample forecasts.},

Abstract = {This article explores the historical and contemporary problem of health
   care provision with a focus on the least developed countries (LDCs) and
   heavily indebted poor countries (HIPCs). The paper concludes that, while
   there may be advantages to state-run insurance systems for vulnerable
   populations (e.g. the indigent or the widowed elderly), there is likely
   a space for fee-for-service and pay-per-premium health care to develop
   alongside other familiar western institutions, like retail banking and
   telecommunications services. This discussion of financial evolution
   concludes with a comparison to postwar Japan and other contexts in which
   complex, locally unprecedented payment systems have been quick to take
   root and have been very successful.},

Volume = {71},
Number = {2},

Abstract = {Does the International Criminal Court's (ICC) pursuit of justice
   facilitate peace or prolong conflict? This paper addresses the ``peace
   versus justice{''} debate by examining the ICC's impact on civil
   conflict termination. Active ICC involvement in a conflict increases the
   threat of punishment for rebel and state leaders, which, under certain
   conditions, generates incentives for these leaders to continue the
   conflict as a way to avoid capture, transfer to the Hague, and
   prosecution. The impact of ICC involvement is conditional upon the
   threat of domestic punishment that leaders face; as the risk of domestic
   punishment increases, the conflict-prolonging effects of ICC involvement
   diminish. I test these theoretical expectations on a data set of all
   civil conflict dyads from 2002 to 2013. Findings support the
   hypothesized relationship. Even after addressing potential selection and
   endogeneity concerns, I find that active involvement by the ICC
   significantly decreases the likelihood of conflict termination when the
   threat of domestic punishment is relatively low.},

Abstract = {This study provides an overview of the development of contemporary China
   studies in Singapore from the regional Cold War to the present. It
   argues that the waxing and waning of China studies in Singapore were
   intertwined with state interests at different points in time, defined in
   accordance with the state's self-professed ``pragmatism{''}. In
   particular, this paper suggests that the state's ostensible aversion to
   communist China during the regional Cold War, the decline of the Chinese
   language under its bilingual policy, and the state's active courting of
   China from the 1990s have profound and lasting influence on the state of
   China studies in Singapore. All in all, in the context of a rising China
   and the state's `'pragmatic'' responses, it is likely that China studies
   in Singapore shall continue to gravitate toward policy research for many
   years to come.},

Abstract = {It is important to monitor equity of access to health services in all
   countries. We assessed the levels of out-of-pocket (OOP) health spending
   in three European countries: Denmark, Germany and Poland. Using data
   from national databases (i.e., Statistics Denmark, German Socio-Economic
   Panel, and National Statistical Office of Poland) for the period
   2000-2010, we applied common methods to assess the rate of households
   with catastrophic' OOP health spending and the concentration of health
   spending in income-ordered groups of citizens. 20.3 per cent of Polish
   households experienced catastrophic' expenditure defined by OOP health
   spending/income ratio >10 per cent, compared to 1.0 per cent of
   households in Germany and 3.2 per cent of households in Denmark. 8.8 per
   cent of Polish households experienced catastrophic' expenditure defined
   by OOP health spending/capacity to pay ratio >40 per cent, compared to
   0.4 per cent of households in Germany and 0.8 per cent of households in
   Denmark. Concentration indexes for OOP on drugs in 2010 were 0.01978 and
   -0.114 for Denmark and Poland, respectively. The rate of households with
   catastrophic' OOP expenditure in Poland is much higher than in both
   Denmark and Germany; health spending in Poland is concentrated among the
   worst-off groups of citizens while in Denmark and Germany they are
   distributed more equitably.},

Abstract = {Both threats and assurances can be useful in international negotiations.
   Threats help convince the adversary that a state will fight if
   challenged, and assurances can convince the adversary that a state will
   not attack if not challenged. We develop a model that analyzes when
   threats and assurances are used. Threats are widely useful because there
   is typically a range of outcomes that are preferable to war for each
   side, and threats can secure a better deal within that range by
   strengthening a state's bottom line. In contrast, assurances are only
   necessary when war would result without them because of insufficiently
   valued intermediate outcomes or shifting power. We discuss insights from
   the model, including the role of false assurances, in the context of
   both the Sudetenland crisis and Cold War Europe.},

Abstract = {Over the last decades, the number of international organizations (IOs)
   and regional groups (RGs) increased tremendously, and states are now
   simultaneously members of several RGs and IOs. This article inquiries
   how states act in settings of complexly nested and overlapping
   institutions on the regional and international levels. How frequently do
   states voice regional positions in international negotiations and why
   are some more active in this respect than others? Why are some RGs more
   vocal than others? Multiple state memberships in RGs foster the
   regionalization of international negotiation dynamics via burden-sharing
   mechanisms. In addition, state capacity and power, the age and policy
   scope of RGs and the institutional design of IOs also shape negotiation
   dynamics. This article concludes with reflections on implications of
   regionalized international negotiations for the efficiency and
   legitimacy of governance beyond the nation-state.},

   British policy},
Journal = {POLICY STUDIES},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {38},
Number = {6},
Pages = {640-663},
Abstract = {The concept of the political settlement has risen to occupy a central
   place in British policy toward conflict-affected and fragile states.
   Yet, at around the turn of the millennium, the term was barely mentioned
   in official circles and the so-called good governance' approach held
   sway as the dominant operational mode. So, how had this transformation
   in policy approach come about and what was the role of research? In this
   article, we demonstrate that research played a central role in
   influencing the rhetoric of policymakers through a process we term
   cumulative influence'. Indeed, the subject of political settlements
   represents an excellent case study for understanding the dynamics of
   research utilisation. It allows us to build on existing models and
   suggest useful ways forward in this important area of public policy
   analysis.},

Volume = {11},
Number = {1},
Pages = {1-18},
Abstract = {Although much has been written about `identity politics' in the narrow
   sense of the term, students of politics and public policy can take a
   more systematic look at the connection between identity and politics, as
   related to public policy. This essay shows that, by putting identity at
   the center of their analysis of politics and public policy, scholars can
   gain powerful insight about both explanation and policy prescription. In
   other words, how actors understand themselves and are seen by others are
   key aspects of political and policy analysis and they each deserve a
   systematic and interdisciplinary treatment. The essay suggests this by
   drawing on recent social science literature, such as identity economics,
   to explore the relevance of the connection between identity and politics
   for policy research across different policy areas and regions of the
   world. Because several of these literatures are seldom discussed
   together, this essay offers a particularly broad and multi-faceted
   identity perspective for the analysis of politics and public policy.},

Abstract = {This introduction provides a descriptive typology and normative analysis
   of the ways boundaries are being questioned in Europe. We distinguish
   between boundary-making (defining or redefining the territorial borders
   of a polity), boundary-crossing (determining the rules of access to
   territorial borders) and boundary-unbundling (allowing boundary-making
   and boundary-crossing to vary between policies and polities), noting
   each of these categories possesses internal and external dimensions.
   Cosmopolitans and statists offer contrasting normative evaluations of
   these processes, favouring weakening and maintaining or strengthening
   state boundaries respectively. We endorse a demoicratic approach lying
   between these two as better reflecting how individuals relate to each
   other and to the EU, a view shared by some but not all contributors to
   this volume. We conclude by situating the contributions within our
   topological framework, highlighting how they illustrate the contemporary
   questioning of European boundaries.},

Abstract = {This chapter describes the fight against cybercrime from a European
   perspective. Law enforcement agencies always have had an important role
   when it comes to fighting crime. However, in this digital era, several
   problems hamper the effectiveness of the police combating crime.
   Therefore, the first part of this chapter describes the difficulties the
   police have in fighting cybercrime. The second part of the chapter
   focuses on one of the strategies to overcome some of these difficulties,
   namely forming alliances with private institutes. This joint-up approach
   is mostly realized by public-private partnerships (PPPs), consisting of
   formalized cooperation between governmental authorities and important
   stakeholders. Cooperation between governmental and private actors is no
   sinecure, as will appear from a public administration perspective.
   Successful cooperation depends on several factors, which will be
   theoretically described and practically illustrated. Conclusively, the
   discussion paragraph handles the common dilemma of the extent to which
   the government should play a leading role in the fight against (cyber)
   crime.},

Abstract = {While the Commission's influence on Council decisions has attracted
   considerable scholarly attention, its internal dynamics are still not
   well known, in particular regarding the individual entrepreneurship of
   Commissioners. Aiming to contribute to the literature on the
   Commission's inner workings, this article draws comparisons between the
   levels of influence thattwo Commissioners were able to exert in the
   course oftwo legislative drafting processes; one of these efforts
   resulted in the Commission proposal for a Climate and Energy Framework,
   and the other aimed at introducing a Smart Border Package. Based on
   document analysis and interviews, it is argued that the influence of a
   particular Commissioner is best explained by a combination of
   institutional and discursive analysis. While low levels of
   interdepartmental coordination serve to increase the discretion of
   Commissioners, their level of influence also depends on their ability to
   justify their position with value-based arguments.},

Title = {Intelligence reform and the transformation of the state: the end of a
   French exception},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF STRATEGIC STUDIES},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {40},
Number = {4, SI},
Pages = {532-553},
Abstract = {This article argues that the intelligence sector is a privileged vantage
   point to observe and analyse a transformation of the State in France, as
   this transformation deeply affects the heart of the executive power and
   the French intelligence and security apparatus. Traditionally,
   intelligence was not conceived in France as a functional tool in the
   hands of the decision-maker but was rather defined as a regalian power'.
   Intelligence activities were derived from a very specific conception of
   the State, and especially the particular notion of reason of State'
   (raison d'Etat). The current intelligence reform prompts speculation as
   to whether it represents more than a simple' functional reorganisation
   or in fact could signify that intelligence is now recognised as a tool
   in the hands of a Etat de droit' (liberal state'). The idea of a French
   exceptionalism' is addressed through a theoretical approach of the way
   France redefines intelligence and surveillance in relation with a major
   evolution of the notion of reason of State' itself. Then the article
   illustrates the assumption of a lost tradition' of reason of State
   through an analysis of the current reform of the intelligence sector in
   France. This reform is based on processes of rationalisation,
   centralization, modernisation and normalisation of both intelligence
   activities and intelligence services in France. As a conclusion, the
   article addresses the reactions to the January and November 2015
   terrorist attacks in Paris, and asks whether resilience towards
   terrorism requires to accelerate the pace of the transformation of the
   French intelligence sector.},

Abstract = {This article analyses the composition of European commissioners' private
   offices (cabinets) in order to explain their intended behaviour when
   deciding between serving European or member states' interests. The
   article conceptualizes the relationship between the home country and the
   commissioner as a principalagent relationship. It also accounts for
   contextual impacts on cabinet composition. This article analyses the
   biographical information of 1,343 members of 149 individual cabinets, as
   well as data from 11 expert interviews. It finds that both the
   relationship to the home country and the context in which a commissioner
   works affect her cabinet composition. Surprisingly, member states'
   selection efforts do not have the intended effects. The Commission is
   neither completely independent nor a member state agent. The growing
   importance of supranational actors and a more regulated context can
   impede individual commissioners from serving the interest of the `
   country they know best'.},

Journal = {CAMBRIDGE REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {30},
Number = {2-3},
Pages = {177-194},
Abstract = {Conceptualizing the EU as a postmodern cooperative power that transcends
   realism provides ideological scaffolding for an exclusive conception of
   Europe and veils a zero-sum geopolitical project as European
   integration. Neoclassical realism considers assigning morally opposite
   political identities to the EU and Russia to be rational to the extent
   it strengthens internal cohesion and mobilizes resources to enhance
   security in accordance with the balance of power logic. Yet, the
   artificial binary construction can also produce a Manichean Trap when
   compromises required to enhance security are depicted as a betrayal of
   indispensable virtues and Europe. The ability to harmonize competing
   security interests diminishes as the conceptual space for comparing the
   EU and Russia is de-constructed. Competition is framed in uncompromising
   terms as European integration versus Russian spheres of influence and
   democracy versus authoritarianism.},
