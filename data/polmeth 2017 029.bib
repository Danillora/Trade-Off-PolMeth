Abstract = {Natural resource degradation in the form of soil erosion, deforestation,
   and wetland resource depletion, is a major problem in Lake Tana
   Sub-Basin, Ethiopia. Various measures have been taken by the government
   and its development partners in response. This study investigates
   whether measures such as formulation of policies, strategies, laws and
   proclamations as well as establishment of organizations contribute to
   the protection and/or management of natural resource management of the
   Lake Tana Sub-Basin or not. Government reports, journals, articles and
   other relevant sources were used to examine whether the measures taken
   fulfil their objectives. The findings of the study indicate that the
   policy measures and the efforts of translating them into practice do
   support conservation of natural resources in Lake Tana Sub-Basin.
   Various sustainable land management (SLM) technologies introduced by the
   government and development partners helped to address soil degradation.
   The remnants offorests around the lake and in the upper sub basin have
   been preserved and protected. Yet, land degradation in various forms
   still outweighs the rehabilitation of degraded lands and conservation of
   the natural resources in the sub basin. Lack of genuine participation of
   the local people, technical and policy failure, lack of enforcement of
   some policies/laws, overlapping and conflicting responsibilities of
   different government institutions and conflict of interests accounted to
   failure of achieve the desired outcomes. The findings suggest ways
   policy makers and development actors can address the multifaceted
   barriers to improve policy effectiveness.},

Abstract = {A core claim about agricultural policy making is that it is
   compartmentalized' and exceptional'. In this picture, the policy process
   is insulated from other policy concerns, has a distinctive system of
   actors and institutional structures, and is rooted in extensive
   governmental intervention in the market and the redistribution of
   resources from taxpayers to food producers. Recently there have been
   suggestions that a post-exceptional' agricultural politics has emerged,
   which is more market-driven, has reduced state intervention, and where
   policies reflect influences relating to non-food issues such as the
   environment. This contribution discusses the concepts of
   compartmentalization and exceptionalism and then applies indicators of
   change' to a case study of the 2013 reform of the Common Agricultural
   Policy (CAP). It concludes that the reform provides evidence for
   shallow' post-exceptionalism where a historically persistent
   agricultural policy subsystem has opened up to new actors, incorporated
   some programme change but left the ideational framework largely intact.},

Abstract = {This study compared the effects of three interventions and a
   no-intervention control on the settlement of resource and value
   conflicts. These variables were arranged in a two (conflict issue:
   resources vs. values) by four (no intervention vs. other affirmation vs.
   shared identity vs. transaction costs) between-dyads design in which 127
   dyads engaged in a negotiation task. Negotiators reached generally lower
   joint outcomes in the value conflict compared to the resource conflict,
   but after the other-affirmation intervention, this pattern was reversed.
   The shared-identity intervention did not result in higher joint outcomes
   for value conflicts. Stressing positive concern for the other negotiator
   may be a more effective strategy than stressing commonalities between
   the parties: increased concern for self and decreased defense of own
   opinions may account for this result. Forcing and logrolling behavior
   are shown to be mediating variables between the type of conflict and
   outcomes.},

Abstract = {The present study uses the concept of technological efficacy derived
   from ecological psychology and design studies to offer an alternative
   way of analyzing how policy instruments affect change. Reasoning from
   this, the paper outlines a framework for analyzing policy instruments in
   terms of their affordances. We define affordances as the means through
   which an instrument exerts influence on its intended target audience.
   Using this approach, we contend that policy instruments may be analyzed
   as interfaces that organize social relations and create structures of
   opportunity and/or restrict possibilities for action. We argue that
   explicating the pathways through which instruments afford or constrain
   action is a central task for policy analysis. Our proposed framework of
   analysis builds on the idea that instruments yield effects by
   facilitating action and learning. We further contend that the actions
   that an instrument can facilitate or inhibit are determined by specific
   affordance modalities of the instrument in conjunction with
   contingencies of the actor and the policy environment. Examples from
   research policy are used to illustrate some of these effects.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF CHINESE GOVERNANCE},

Volume = {2},

Pages = {385-410},
Abstract = {The global production and demand of electronic appliances is
   exponentially growing, increasingly depleting natural resources. This is
   resulting in increasing amounts of electronic waste (e-waste), which is
   a challenge for resource management, as e-waste holds valuable resources
   that can be channeled back into the electronics production cycle. China,
   as one of the world's main recipients of e-waste, is facing a twofold
   burden. Increasing amounts of e-waste are generated domestically, and
   there is a continuous flow of illegally imported e-waste. E-waste
   entering China from abroad is handled entirely by the informal recycling
   sector, which also covers most of nationally generated e-waste.
   Recycling practices in the informal sector are predominantly at
   primitive levels, not only posing serious harm to the environment and
   public health, but also resulting in inefficient resource recovery
   results. This paper analyzes the structure of the informal e-waste
   sector in China and challenges that impede the effective integration of
   the informal into the formal system. It also identifies good practices
   that may be applied to address these challenges and establish a
   sustainable e-waste management system in the country, which will allow
   China to recover valuable resources from e-waste and mitigate harm to
   the environment and human health.},

Abstract = {This article examines the link between human security, social identity,
   and al-Shabaab. The first section explores how social identity group
   theory can help explain al-Shabaab's recruitment. The second part
   focuses on the counterterrorism campaign against al-Shabaab, which
   involves decapitation, aggressive peacekeeping through a proxy in the
   shape of the African Union Mission in Somalia, and the role of a
   domestic de-radicalization program. The article concludes that
   al-Shabaab's allure is in decline and the group is facing internal
   turmoil, which makes its overtures toward the Islamic State of Iraq and
   the Levant very dangerous, as al-Shabaab could act as an effective
   conduit between the Arabian Peninsula and Africa.},

Abstract = {The relationship between terrorism and culture was systematically
   examined using three high-quality global databases. Contrary to prior
   research, terrorism-collapsed across form and era-was not related to any
   of Hofstede's cultural dimensions. Yet, particular forms of
   terrorism-incidents involving substantial casualties and damage, suicide
   bombings, and the proportion of incidents involving fatalities-all
   showed relationships with cultural dimensions. Tolerance of terrorism
   and relative tolerance of the 9/11 attack were related to cultural
   dimensions and terrorist events. Finally, populations that were
   relatively voiceless, disengaged from their communities, suffering,
   angry, and hopeless showed more tolerance of terrorism and incidents of
   terrorism.},

Journal = {EAST EUROPEAN POLITICS},

Volume = {33},

Pages = {253-274},
Abstract = {Does electoral fraud encourage post-electoral protests? To explore the
   likelihood that citizens would pick up on electoral irregularities
   perpetrated in their region and engage in post-electoral protest we
   analyse regional protest event data and voting results for 95,415
   precincts in Russia's 2012 presidential elections. We find that regional
   fraud is associated with post-electoral sub-national protests. Our
   analysis has important theoretical and policy implications. Protests
   that not only target specific issues like fraud, but show awareness of
   where it had been perpetrated can be much more effective than those
   where blame attribution is vague and generic.},

Title = {Conflict management systems for large scientific research projects},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONFLICT MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {28},
Number = {3},
Pages = {322-345},
Abstract = {Purpose - This paper aims to analyze the transferability of a conflict
   management model developed for business organizations to a temporary and
   international research project to serve as a support tool for internal
   communication and in case of conflict.
   Design/methodology/approach - The authors analyze the transferability of
   a conflict management model that was initially developed for business
   organizations to an international, inter-organizational and temporary
   research project that is third-party funded. Using a case study, a
   participatory approach is applied with both qualitative and quantitative
   methods used.
   Findings - The transferability is possible but only with the adaption of
   conflict prevention. The project's international and
   inter-organizational structure further results in a need for
   decentralization of conflict management responsibilities and
   diversification of conflict management approaches. Time, financial
   resources and a high autonomy of cooperation partners limit the degree
   of participation in the design process.
   Research limitations/implications - The research is based on a case
   study. Research on comparative design processes are needed to verify or
   extrapolate findings and to help assess the impact of conflict
   management systems in other large research projects.
   Originality/value - This paper contributes to the body of knowledge on
   conflict management systems. By implementing a conflict management
   system in a temporary, international and scientific project environment,
   this case study identifies contextual factors relevant for the system
   design and provides initial test results. As conflict management systems
   in research projects are not yet prominent, this adapted model of
   conflict prevention and management can benefit similar projects.},

Abstract = {Liberal peacebuilding strategies have brought a semblance of peace to
   many post-accord societies. However, these strategies have fallen short,
   unable to create a sustainable peace or to overcome divisions at the
   societal level. The `in-betweeness' that lingers within the war-to-peace
   transition for many of these societies continues to persist decades
   after peace agreements have been signed, constraining and shaping the
   possibilities for bottom-up peacebuilding. Through the case studies of
   Bosnia and Herzegovina and Northern Ireland, I aim to generate an
   account of everyday peace politics that allows for the representation of
   inclusionary, exclusionary and ambivalent practices of ordinary
   citizens. I treat the everyday as political in order to explore the ways
   in which ordinary citizens are active and engaged in shaping the type of
   peace that emerges. I highlight that local practices are neither
   progressive nor regressive, but rather reflect the different attempts of
   citizens to navigate the uncertainty of the incomplete war-to-peace
   transitions.},

Abstract = {In this final chapter some conclusions as to the nature of Union
   citizenship are drawn. Union citizenship is found to constitute, as a
   reflection of the Union itself, a status sui generis: It consists of
   both supranational and transnational elements. Some parallels are also
   drawn to the way citizenship and interstate equality is framed in
   American constitutional case-law. Being clear about what European
   citizenship is helps us to resolve the constitutional dilemma formulated
   in Chapter 4: Do we need to choose between sacrificing EU citizens'
   rights or taking Article 50 seriously? The chapter shows why this is not
   the case.},

Abstract = {Why do some people support peaceful demonstration and expression rights
   and others do not? This article focuses on individual-level opinions
   concerning the rights to peaceful demonstration and expression in 18
   countries. Drawing on theories from social psychology and contentious
   politics, we argue that opinions about these rights are associated with
   a country's past experiences with nonviolent and violent dissent. A
   country's experiences with nonviolent protests are associated with more
   support for peaceful demonstration and expression rights. Conversely,
   past experiences with violent dissent are associated with less
   individual-level support of these rights. These past experiences can
   demonstrate the efficacy of collective action. Using multilevel modeling
   techniques, we find support for our argument when it comes to public
   opinion regarding the right to peaceful demonstration. Our argument
   serves as another pathway through which a country's past experiences
   with protest could influence the nature of current dissent and human
   rights within a state.},

   This Debate piece argues that a Bourdieu-inspired, multidimensional
   class analysis opens promising perspectives for understanding class
   dynamics in Africa. This implies notably bridging objectivist and
   subjectivist approaches to class analysis, and working with a
   multidimensional idea of the social space.},

Abstract = {Using public opinion survey data, this study investigates the
   determinants of inter-ethnic (in)tolerance among Turks and Kurds in
   Turkey. Our empirical analyses show that, compared with Turks, Kurds
   have a relatively higher level of tolerance towards the ethnic
   out-group. Our findings also suggest that different dynamics and factors
   mould Turks' and Kurds' tolerance towards ethnic out-group members.
   Religiosity, (ethno)nationalist orientations, inter-ethnic contact,
   threat perception and economic factors are the most consistent variables
   shaping Turks' tolerance towards Kurds. In contrast, religion-related
   factors and inter-ethnic social contact do not have a statistically
   significant effect on Kurds' tolerance towards Turks. (Ethno)nationalist
   orientations, however, appear to reduce Kurds' tolerance.},

Abstract = {Based on the ``street-level{''} and the ``theory of the bureaucracy{''}
   approaches, the article contends that national bureaucracies may play an
   important role in explaining the relation between Brazilian foreign
   policy and international technical cooperation. Drawing lessons from a
   2009 ENAP-ISAP project in Mozambique, we concluded that the Brazilian
   National School of Public Administration - ENAP's interests and autonomy

Abstract = {The Bolivarian Revolution is characterized by the gradual and peaceful
   conquest of political power without an immediate break with the
   capitalist order, following the legitimate path of democratic
   radicalization to the creation of a multiple system of property with the
   medium-to-long-term goal of overcoming the pillars of capitalist
   domination. Petroleum redistribution policy continues to strengthen some
   capitalist factions. The tactic of a gradual transition to socialism
   tends to reinforce the capitalist system of accumulation for certain
   factions and could interfere with the revolution.},

Abstract = {In this chapter we examine the emergent role of participatory
   decision-making in China. We begin by introducing the theoretical
   framework that we use to understand public participation in single-party
   regimes like China. Next, we track the origins and evolution of
   participatory decision-making in China itself. Initially adopted as a
   means for implementing unpopular price changes, public participation
   procedures (e.g., expert consultations, public hearings, and, more
   recently, online notice-and-comment) have increasingly made their way
   into central and local decision-making procedures. Whereas only a
   handful of provinces experimented with participatory decision-making in
   the early 2000s, today nearly all legislation and administrative policy
   proceeds through at least one of these procedures. Why are China's
   leaders encouraging their citizens to engage in policy? We put forward
   the proposition that authoritarian policy crafted with public input is
   more likely to be perceived as legitimate, more likely to be complied
   with, and less prone to fail.},

Abstract = {The relevance of motivation literature in the study and understanding of
   human behaviour has been widely acknowledged. This work integrates
   popular motivation theories and extends them to electoral market to help
   understand why the electorate behave the way they do in elections. Using
   qualitative approach, 48 respondents purposively chosen from 12
   communities across the three regions of northern Ghana were interviewed.
   The study found that voter motivation (among the study sample) is
   multidimensional. It can be positive, negative or neutral. Contrary to
   the view that extrinsic factors do not have motivational characteristic,
   the study found in particular, that material/financial inducements and
   social relations are strong positive motivators of voter behaviour among
   the sample studied in northern Ghana.},

Abstract = {Since its earliest days, U.S. economic prosperity has been dependent
   upon maritime trade. The ships, boats, terminals, and related maritime
   critical infrastructure that support this trade are increasingly
   dependent on cyber technology. Cyber incidents involving navigation,
   cargo control, and other industrial processes could threaten lives, the
   environment, property, and could significantly disrupt regular trade
   activity. The U.S. Coast Guard, with long standing authority to address
   safety and security risks in the marine transportation system (MTS),
   encourages ship and vessel operators to establish a risk assessment and
   mitigation process to address cyber-related threats. State and local
   governments can contribute to this process through information sharing,
   and in Area Maritime Security Committees and other forums designed to
   address risk.},

Abstract = {The impact of votes on Council decision-making is a widely studied
   subject. A large body of theory supports the contention that more votes,
   ceteris paribus, translate into more influence. Empirical studies have,
   however, shown a negative relationship between the voting power of a
   member state and its bargaining success. Based on a new data set, this
   study shows empirically that there is a robust positive relationship
   between the number of votes backing a member state request to change
   European legislation and its success probability. The analysis is based
   on all unique member state requests for exemptions, lower standards or
   longer transitional time periods in the field of environmental policy
   between the first wave of Eastern Enlargement in 2004 and the entry into
   force of the Lisbon treaty in 2009 (N = 216). It also shows that member
   state requests are often successful, contrary to the image of an
   unresponsive Brussels.},

Abstract = {This review paper presents the compositions, distribution, abundance,
   biomass and production of plankton communities in Lake Tana from various
   research works. A total of 85 phytoplankton species, consisting of 15
   blue greens, 37 diatoms, 28 greens, and 5 other minor groups are
   recorded. The phytoplankton biomass showed a certain decline when
   turbidity increased during the rainy season. Microcystis sp. was found
   to dominate the phytoplankton community of Lake Tana throughout the
   rainy and post-rainy seasons. The chlorophyll a concentration in the
   water column of the lake varied between 0.03 and 13.44 mu g L-1 and
   showed marked seasonal variations. The highest chlorophyll
   concentrations were observed in the post-rainy season. The average gross
   primary production in Lake Tana (mean: 1.8 g O-2 m(-2) d(-1)) is
   relatively lower compared to African lakes. A number of studies on
   zooplankton in Lake Tana recorded a total of 26 zooplankton species,
   consisting of 3 copepods, 11 cladocerans and 12 rotifers. Copepods
   showed usually higher densities than cladocerans and rotifers. In the
   case of Lake Tana, the major factors responsible for temporal and
   spatial change of the plankton are resource limitations and a high
   sediment concentration. During the productive season (PORS), the
   phytoplankton is dominated by large species (e.g. Melosira and
   Microcystis spp.), which are difficult to be consumed by the herbivorous
   zooplankton.},

Abstract = {This article explores the associations between self-reported Public
   Service Motivation (PSM) and preferred job traits, study choice, and
   observable prosocial behaviour. We studied three subject pools covering
   over 250 university students in Germany. We used laboratory experiments
   with monetary rewards to measure altruism, fairness, strategic fairness,
   and cooperativeness, and a post-experimental survey on subjects' PSM.
   Higher levels of PSM were not associated with studying public
   administration but were positively associated with altruism and
   negatively with strategic fairness. The experimental data reveal robust
   subject pool effects. After controlling for PSM, public administration
   students behaved more altruistically and displayed less merely strategic
   fairness than business students. And they behaved more cooperatively
   than business and law students. These behavioural findings about future
   bureaucrats corroborate cumulative earlier survey evidence about the
   higher prosocial tendencies of public sector employees. They point to
   the danger of crowding out such tendencies through overly extrinsic
   management tools.},

Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {The use of trigger warnings (TW) in higher education (HE) is a point of
   significant contention. Discussion has centred on academic perspectives.
   This study turns that around to ask what the student experiences of TW
   are, how they are perceived, and what this contributes to the existing
   debate. Based on survey and focus group data from two undergraduate
   modules, this article demonstrates that students are similarly divided
   on TW. It also re-assesses the current debate with respect to
   positive/negative effects on students, in-class applications of TW, how
   far students believe their learning environment should be `controlled',
   and perceived censorship.},

Abstract = {A key issue in territorial studies in recent years has been the
   transition in urban governance from managerialism to entrepreneurialism.
   North American and European cities were pioneers in this transition, and
   Latin American metropolises adapted their postulates to a different
   reality. Middle-sized cities in the region seem to have copied the
   intervention models of the nearest metropolis, uncritically applying
   them to a context characterized by important urban and social
   deficiencies and low standards of urban governance. The result has been
   a transition from no management to urban entrepreneurialism. In the case
   of one middle-sized city, this model has generated islands of investment
   attractive to foreign capital without resolving such long-standing
   problems as poverty, inequality, underemployment, and scarcity.},

Abstract = {Existing research has paid increasing attention to the role of political
   institutions such as legislatures and opposition parties in autocracies.
   So far, however, the relationship between nondemocratic institutions and
   state repression has remained largely unclear. This article argues that
   authoritarian institutions are related to divergent conflicting dynamics
   between incumbent regimes and opposition actors, which provide leaders
   with opposite incentives to repress. While authoritarian legislatures
   enhance leaders' capacity to prevent conflict and reduce their need for
   repression, the presence of opposition parties helps opposition actors
   to overcome collective action barriers and mobilize against the
   incumbent regime, increasing the states' need for repression. A panel
   data analysis of nondemocracies from 1976 to 2007 shows that
   authoritarian-elected legislatures reduce repression and the presence of
   opposition parties increases it. Moreover, the results indicate that
   autocracies with opposition parties and an elected legislature
   experience lower repression than autocracies with opposition parties but
   no elected legislature.},

Abstract = {This article reviews the literature on civil war. We focus on the most
   recent period of scholarly activity, beginning in the early 2000s when
   the publication of prominent quantitative studies triggered a surge in
   the empirical research of civil war as a well-defined conceptual
   category. We identify three explanatory logics that have dominated much
   of this literature and that view civil wars as a consequence of greed,
   grievances, and opportunities, respectively. We evaluate the arguments
   and findings of these theoretical approaches with respect to each of the
   main phases of war: outbreak, wartime dynamics, conflict termination,
   and postwar recovery. The article concludes by identifying key
   challenges confronting future civil war research. In particular, we
   emphasize the continuing need to advance theories that bridge the main
   explanatory logics as well as the different phases of conflict.
   Researchers should also pay more attention to defining the appropriate
   spatio-temporal scope of their studies.},

Abstract = {Self-censorship, defined as an act of intentionally and voluntarily
   withholding information from others in the absence of formal obstacles
   often serves as a barrier to resolving intractable conflicts.
   Specifically, in order to protect the group, and in absence of objective
   constraints such as institutionalized censorship, individuals practice
   self-censorship and support its practice by other society members. This
   prevents free flow and transparency of information, within a society,
   regarding the conflict and the adversary. In an attempt to investigate
   the factors that contribute to the functioning of self-censorship as a
   sociopsychological barrier to conflict resolution, a longitudinal study
   was conducted among a large sample of Jews in Israel. The survey was
   administered in three waves: a few months before, during, and a few
   months after Israel's Operation Pillar of Defense in the Gaza Strip. The
   findings showed that armed confrontation can increase support for
   self-censorship. In addition, the findings revealed that personal
   characteristics (e.g., authoritarianism, ethnocentrism, siege mentality)
   predicted support for self-censorship, which, in turn, mediated the
   effect of personal characteristics on support for negotiations and for
   providing humanitarian aid. The theoretical as well as the applied
   implications of the findings are discussed.},

Abstract = {Delegation of administrative authority is commonly thought to involve a
   tradeoff between the discretion necessary for bureaucratic effectiveness
   and democratic responsiveness. In many contexts, however, discretion and
   responsiveness go hand-in-hand: Street-level bureaucrats may adapt their
   behavior to accommodate local norms and values, even when implementing
   the identical statutory language. I argue that this type of bureaucratic
   adaptation can explain local variation in participation rates in the
   national food stamp program. By exploiting between-state differences in
   the level at which the program is administered, I further show that
   administrative centralization does not appear to moderate such
   responsiveness, which is high across institutional settings. Using data
   on application denial rates for a subset of these states, I offer
   additional evidence that some of the county-level variation in program
   participation is a product of decisions made by local caseworkers.
   Together, these findings offer important insights on the institutional
   preconditions for bureaucratic responsiveness and control.},

   empirical analyses. The concept itself represents the finality of
   multiple approaches, assessing and operationalizing the impact of the
   changes induced by internal and external environment on the current
   status of a public or private organization. The current paper aims the
   first integrative synthesis of those processes or stateof-the-art, in
   view to provide a complex framework and vision to the development of
   more profound future analyses. Our approach sustains the implementation
   of a conscious and substantiated vision concerning adaptation in public
   organizations and/or public administration, revealing their specificity,
   need for improving the managerial and evaluation instruments, as well as
   multidisciplinary valorisation of various aspects on organisational

   Protests},
Journal = {POLITICAL STUDIES},

Volume = {65},
Number = {3},

Abstract = {Protest activists employ various strategies to challenge regimes, and
   regimes deploy multifaceted tactics to respond to such challenges.
   Existing studies on regime protest responses focus on repression and
   concession, but little attention is devoted to toleration, which is
   often regarded as government inaction. Drawing on primary sources and
   interviews, this article analyses regime responses to Hong Kong's
   Umbrella Movement to expand the conceptualisation of toleration. First,
   it demonstrates that regimes adapt multiple strategies to protesters'
   reactions rather than adhering to a single response. Second, it shows
   that toleration, other than ignoring protests, entails proactive tactics
   that we summarise as attrition. While `tolerating' street occupation,
   the regime sought to eliminate political opportunities by maintaining
   elite cohesion, increase participation costs by mobilising
   countermovements and bolster legitimacy by leveraging the court as a
   revered institution. This new conceptual distinction thus captures
   regime innovation in counteracting protests and broadens the typology of
   regime responses.},

Abstract = {This article examines recursive processes in the Forest Stewardship
   Council (FSC), a nonstate forest standard-setting and accreditation
   organization. The FSC has developed numerous organizational structures
   and procedures that help it pool and analyze stakeholder input and
   feedback in standard-setting and implementation. We conceptualize
   recursive processes of stakeholder input and feedback and organizational
   responsiveness as recursivity by design. The article focuses on
   organizational legitimacy as a driver of recursive processes. The FSC's
   extensive participation procedures and structures present opportunities
   for incorporating stakeholder input and feedback in standard-setting and
   make it a responsive, legitimate, and effective governance scheme. It
   also enables the FSC to deal with challenges to its legitimacy and
   effectiveness. Whereas challenges associated with stakeholder
   participation and on-the-ground standard implementation are
   conceptualized in the literature as sources of organizational fragility
   and crisis, we argue that FSC's recursive structures help it accommodate
   criticism of and information about its performance and adjust its system
   to continuously emerging demands for more credibility and quality.},

Abstract = {After 1990, nature conservation areas multiplied all over Central and
   Eastern Europe. National parks came into being as part of a dramatically
   changing society, economy, and culture. Scholarly efforts to understand
   national parks rely either on arguments about the social construction of
   nature or on political ecology. In this article, I attempt to point to
   the analytical potential of the literature on ruins for expanding
   studies carried out in both theoretical traditions. I draw from
   fieldwork in nature conservation areas in southeastern Romania to
   explore how actors gain access to critical discourses and complex ways
   of narrating and enrolling the landscapes. The mechanisms that
   counterpoise safeguarding and development are analyzed as parts of a
   longue duree articulation of ruination and modernization.},

Abstract = {Urban and regional reconstruction after the February 27, 2010,
   earthquake and tsunami in Chile was organized by master plans at the
   local level. These plans, based on public-private partnerships, can be
   considered an innovation as an instrument of postdisaster
   reconstruction. They emerged as a commitment to privatization of urban
   planning in Chile. An analysis of two master plans based on field
   research carried out between 2011 and 2014 reveals that they had limited
   impact because of weak public-private ties, lack of comprehensiveness,
   and lack of legitimacy. They can be read as failed attempts at

Abstract = {The social care sector has been identified as a potential source of job
   creation for young people by policymakers, however the quality of such
   employment opportunities requires closer scrutiny. This study reveals
   how job creation strategies focused upon sectors such as social care
   which have high levels of employment insecurity can contribute towards
   reinforcing patterns of precarious work across Europe. Drawing upon
   research involving young people and representatives from the sector,
   this study argues that while attracting new employees is a worthy
   objective, the capacity of the social care sector to offer secure
   employment for young people is questionable.},

Title = {Is Self-determination Contagious? A Spatial Analysis of the Spread of
   Self-Determination Claims},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATION},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {71},
Number = {3},
Pages = {585-604},

Abstract = {Self-determination claims have abounded in the international system
   since the end of World War II. But these claims have not emerged
   everywhere. About half of the states in the international system face
   some challenge related to self-determination today. Why do some states
   face these demands while others do not? We argue that ethno-national
   self-determination is one of many identities with which individuals can
   find affinity. While an international norm related to self-determination
   has developed globally, its use as a basis for political claims has
   diffused regionally. Diffusion of self-determination occurs through
   observation of others using self-determination as a basis of
   organization, generating a sense of legitimacy, sensitivity to related
   grievance, and perceptions of tangible benefits related to
   self-determination identification. We test this empirically on global
   data on self-determination claims from 1960 to 2005 and find evidence of
   spatial diffusion, suggesting that self-determination is, to some
   extent, contagious.},

Title = {Polarized Opinions on Racial Progress and Inequality: Measurement and
   Application to Affirmative Action Preferences},
Journal = {POLITICAL PSYCHOLOGY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {38},
Number = {3},
Pages = {481-498},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {This study presents new measures of opinion about progress toward racial
   equality and provides a multifaceted rationale for preferring the new
   measures to the old ones. To reduce several sources of measurement error
   and improve analytic bite by breaking progress into its constituent
   elements, surveys should ask about past, present, and ideal conditions,
   not progress. These questions reveal racially polarized opinions: Black
   and White Americans agree on the goal of equality and agree that
   conditions were worse in the past, but Blacks think conditions were much
   worse than Whites do. They especially differ in opinions on current
   conditions and thus in how much change is required to achieve the goal
   of equality. Blacks see much more current inequality than Whites do.
   These opinions help explain preferences for affirmative action (AA).
   Contrary to previously published findings, reactions to AA do not depend
   on opinions on progress but depend strongly on something related but
   distinct: how much current racial conditions differ from the ideal.
   Implications for theories of policy preferences, racial attitudes,
   progress, and equality are discussed.},

   across International Issues},

Abstract = {When and how do elite messages shape mass opinion on international
   issues? Do informational or partisan components of elite cues dominate?
   Recent survey experiments offer conflicting insights. We argue that
   issue context matters, and that the single-issue nature of most survey
   experiments masks systematic variation in how elite cues affect
   attitudes across international issues. These effects depend on the
   baseline distribution of mass opinion on the issues themselves. Two
   characteristics of underlying opinion prove crucial: first, the share of
   those not aligned with expert opinion, and second, the degree of
   partisan polarization. Where polarization is limited, information
   effects should dominate. Where issues are polarized, information intake
   should be limited by partisan attribution. We test these hypotheses
   using nine survey experiments across a range of issues, including the
   rise of China, climate change, international institutions, and the use
   of force. At one extreme, all messages-even those endorsed by generic or
   opposition experts-can shift opinion; at the other, only
   partisan-attributed messages matter. Our findings are important not only
   for understanding public opinion about international issues but also for
   those interested in mobilizing opinion in a democratic setting.},

Abstract = {After a decade of economic and political crises, the European Union has
   arrived at a critical juncture, as has its foreign policy. The
   long-running debate on gaining more coherence in EU's external action as
   a global security provider has gained more traction than ever before.
   The Union is weakened due to recent internal crises from which it is
   only slowly recovering: the trust placed in Brussels' institutions by
   both European citizens and global partners is shrinking and the citizens
   of one of the EU's largest member states, the United Kingdom, have just
   voted to leave. Based on an analysis of the current state of theUnion,
   this paper takes stock of the outcomes of the Dahrendorf Foresight
   Project and looks ahead at the EU's role in the world of 2025. By
   following the narrative of driving forces beyond the EU's foreign
   policy, this article makes four policy recommendations for development
   within the next decade.},

Title = {Reciprocity and Discrimination: An Experiment of Hindu-Muslim
   Cooperation in Indian Slums},

Abstract = {This article shows that indirect positive reciprocity triggered by
   experiencing short and superficial cooperation with outgroups'
   individual members reduces discrimination of other members of the same
   group. The field research combined a lab-in-the-field experiment and a
   survey conducted in the slums of Mumbai, an Indian city notorious for
   Hindu-Muslim violence. After the treatment manipulated expectations of
   cooperative behavior, ethnically heterogeneous groups produced as much
   public goods in a public goods game as homogeneous groups. This positive
   experience radically reduced Hindu subjects' discriminatory attitudes
   towards the Muslim minority after the experiment. The effect was equally
   strong among voters of two extremist parties implicated in ethnic riots.
   The survey compared reciprocity with alternative explanations of why
   people discriminate against some, but not other ethnic groups. Indirect
   positive reciprocity and intergroup contact are associated with less,
   and relative size of the outgroup with more discriminatory attitudes.},

Abstract = {Poland is commonly regarded as the diamond in the ring of friends of
   Ukraine among EU Member States. This article examines the evolution of
   Poland's sponsorship of Ukraine at the European level up until fall
   2015, with some reflections on later developments. Drawing on a variety
   of primary and secondary sources, including semi-structured expert
   interviews, the article examines Poland's policy along the lines of
   preferences and interests, institutions and procedures, and strategies
   and actions. The findings reveal persistent continuity despite
   considerable change in relevant context conditions. The endPoland's aim
   to support Ukraine's European futurehas remained intact over the
   decades, with only slight modification. Yet the understanding of the
   most efficient meansstrategies and institutional structuresto achieve
   this end has altered, indicating a change in outlook. A number of
   nuances regarding the influence of Poland's EU membership on Poland's
   and EU's Eastern neighborhood and specifically Ukraine policies, as well
   as the role of Ukraine-related developments, contribute to various
   strands in the literature on the relationship between EU policies
   towards the post-Soviet space and Central and Eastern European member
   states.},

Abstract = {Climate adaptation is a complex policy area, in which knowledge,
   authority, and resources are fragmented among numerous public agencies,
   multiple levels of government, and a wide range of nongovernmental
   actors. Mobilizing and coordinating disparate public and private efforts
   is a key challenge in this policy domain, and this has focused research
   attention on the governance of adaptation, including the dynamics of
   interaction among interests and the institutions that facilitate
   collective action. This paper contributes to the study of adaptation
   governance by adopting the policy regimes perspective, an analytical
   framework designed to make sense of the loose governing arrangements
   surrounding complex, fragmented problems. The perspective's constructs
   are applied to a longitudinal case study of adaptation governance in
   Canada, which identifies, analyzes, and evaluates the policy ideas,
   institutions, and interests that comprise Canada's adaptation policy
   regime.},

Abstract = {The article begins the process of outlining the way in which maritime
   security challenges are publicly articulated by Small Island Developing
   States (SIDS) in order to better understand the backdrop against which
   security policy and practice emerge. To do this the article discusses
   the results of an initial, exploratory content analysis of UN SIDS
   conference documents framed by the central research question, In the
   SIDS' public conceptualisation of sustainable development, how are
   maritime security threats articulated?' The article argues that for SIDS
   their conceptualisation of maritime security is inextricably wrapped up
   in concerns about sustainable development, with concern about challenges
   such as illegal fishing being pinpointed as threats to food security.
   The article calls for more research on the extent to which SIDS'
   conceptualisation of maritime security differs regionally; highlights a
   vulnerability straitjacket SIDS may find themselves wearing; and
   suggests that SIDS consider the development of holistic sustainable blue
   growth strategies to bring multiple stakeholders together to enhance
   human wellbeing. To conclude, the article argues that ultimately efforts
   to pursue enhanced maritime security by SIDS will be determined by how
   they chart a path between emphasising their own vulnerability and the
   opportunities associated with their maritime domain.},

Abstract = {``Urban informality{''} is a signifier that is disputed by real estate
   developers, politicians, and residents in undertaking strategies of
   social distinction and gaining particular political and economic
   benefits. Research in the western periphery of Mexico City distinguishes
   three cases of such use of informality. First, real estate developers
   employ informality as a threat to valorize and justify an enclosed
   ``First World{''} lifestyle in gated communities. Second, informality
   motivates homeowners' associations to take on a neighborhood-defending
   and state-monitoring role. Third, besides its function in reconstituting
   class frontiers, it serves as a referent for broader social mobilization
   against the perceived informality of the local elite. By facilitating
   social distinction, informality continues to marginalize communities as
   it influences planning decisions and access to land in urban Latin
   America.},

Title = {Imagining the Balkans as a Space of Revolution: The Federalist Vision of
   Serbian Socialism, 1870-1914},
Journal = {EAST EUROPEAN POLITICS AND SOCIETIES},

Volume = {31},

Abstract = {Between the years 1870 and 1914, leftist intellectuals in the Kingdom of
   Serbia theorized and promoted a project of Balkan Federation as a
   strategic priority in the social, economic, and political transformation
   of the region. This article offers a genealogy of these federalist ideas
   and places them in dialogue with rival projects of regional unification
   in the Balkans and Eastern Europe during the long nineteenth century. It
   begins by developing a typology of federalist projects in Europe,
   categorizing these according to the underlying models of sovereignty
   upon which they were founded. I identify four categories:
   revolutionary-republican, imperial-reformist, imperial-irredentist, and
   revolutionary-social. Instead of organizing these federalisms according
   to their authors' ideological commitments (socialist, nationalist,
   pan-Slavic) or their geographic scope (Balkan, Danubian), the article
   argues that examining their respective models of sovereignty offers
   intellectual historians a more productive approach to identify the
   unexpected convergences and divergences of federalist projects during
   this period. The article then moves into a discussion of the development
   of Serbian socialist ideas of Balkan Federation, beginning first with
   the work of Svetozar Markovi (1846-1875) and then turning to the
   writings of the fin de siecle Social Democratic Party in the decade
   before World War I. Situating this genealogy of socialist Balkan
   federalism in its broader European intellectual milieu, I use the above
   typology to identify the ways in which Serbian socialists converged and
   diverged from contemporary federalist projects, including the reformist
   ideas of the Austro-Marxists, the irredentist strategy of the Serbian
   Progressive Party, and the republican ideas of Karel Kautsky.},

Abstract = {China's provision of development finance to other countries is sizable
   but reliable information is scarce. We introduce a new open-source
   methodology for collecting project-level development finance information
   and create a database of Chinese official finance (OF) to Africa from
   2000 to 2011. We find that China's commitments amounted to approximately
   US\$73 billion, of which US\$15 billion are comparable to Official
   Development Assistance following Organization for Economic Cooperation
   and Development definitions. We provide details on 1,511 projects to
   fifty African countries. We use this database to extend previous
   research on aid and conflict, which suffers from omitted-variable bias
   due to the exclusion of Chinese development finance. Our results show
   that sudden withdrawals of `traditional'' aid no longer induce conflict
   in the presence of sufficient alternative funding from China. Our
   findings highlight the importance of gathering more complete data on the
   development activities of `nontraditional donors'' to better understand
   the link between aid and conflict.},

Abstract = {Voters do not associate female candidates with feminine stereotypes, but
   voters also do not associate female candidates with the qualities most
   valued in political leaders such as experience and knowledge. Current
   research offers conflicting conclusions on whether female candidates
   benefit from breaking with feminine norms or face a backlash for being
   too aggressive and not likable enough. Using a series of experiments, I
   show how counterstereotypic gender strategies, including women
   emphasizing masculine trait competencies, improve evaluations of female
   candidates along both masculine and feminine leadership dimensions.
   These results offer novel insights into how female candidates can
   overcome perceptual deficits among voters that they lack critical
   masculine leadership qualities. I also show that female candidates can
   overcome these biases without losing on traditional feminine strengths
   such as warmth and likability. However, counterstereotypic female
   candidates can face a ``likability{''} backlash from out-partisan
   voters. These findings suggest counterstereotypes may be more beneficial
   for female candidates in a primary election context when voters are
   copartisans rather than general elections where candidates often need
   cross-partisan support.},

Abstract = {Various deliberative practices have been argued to constitute viable
   supplements to traditional representative decision making. At the same
   time, doubts have been raised as to whether ordinary citizens want to be
   involved in such demanding forms of political participation. This
   question has been difficult to resolve since few citizens have had the
   chance to take part in genuine deliberative practices. For this reason,
   we examine how participation in a deliberative mini-public affected
   attitudes towards discursive participation as a supplement to
   representative decision making. Moreover, we investigate how group
   composition and individual-level factors affect these developments. Our
   data come from an experimental deliberative forum on the issue of
   immigration arranged in Finland in 2012. The results suggest that the
   participants grew more positive towards the use of deliberative
   practices regardless of individual socio-demographic resources, whereas
   the effects of prior political engagement depend on the composition of
   the group the participants were assigned to.},

Abstract = {This article investigates whether or not the dominance of neo-liberalism
   in the European Union's (EU's) trade and development politics has been
   moderated by the global economic crisis and the changing global economic
   order. It combines the methods of Critical Discourse Analysis (CDA) with
   critical forms of international political economy. It demonstrates how
   neo-liberalism has infused the EU's approach, and the concept of
   interdiscursivity is used to analyse how neo-liberalism is articulated
   with other discourses, and how this has evolved. Key policy discourses
   and nodal discourses are traced in two major EU texts on trade and
   development. The one from 2002 articulates a strongly neo-liberal vision
   of globalisation, free market reform and inter-regional integration. In
   the 2012 document, the sense of a neo-liberal trajectory is downplayed
   and a more realist geoeconomic discourse emerges. A review of the EU's
   other texts and its behaviour reveals a tougher approach, which creates
   a new subset of worthy developing countries and treats the others as
   emerging rivals. In conclusion, the core tenets of neo-liberalism are
   still present, however, they are embedded in a new policy configuration
   and geoeconomic context.},

Abstract = {Gender differences regarding support for the use of force average around
   8 percent and are twice the size of differences on non-force issues.
   This article investigates a related gender gap in support for the use of
   torture. I investigate threat perceptions as a possible explanation for
   the gap and find strong support for this hypothesis. Specifically,
   increased threat perceptions lead men but not women to be more likely to
   support the use of torture. In addition to providing an explanation for
   the gender gap in support for torture, this extends prior work that
   finds increased threat perceptions with respect to terrorism lead to

Abstract = {This paper attempts to define the EU system of government through an
   innovative approach that, taking into account both the legal framework
   and the political practice, focuses on the confidence relationship
   between the executive and legislative branches. This approach simplifies
   the comparative study of regime types, capturing the main distinctive
   features of systems that are neither presidential, nor parliamentary.
   The paper shows that the EU model does not belong to any of the
   traditional regime types; indeed, it represents a distinct system of
   government, characterised by a peculiar confidence scheme. Although the
   legal framework of the EU Treaties presents some elements of
   parliamentarism, the nature of the inter-institutional relations in the
   EU is not parliamentary; in particular, the role played by the European
   Council in the formation process of the Commission is not merely formal,
   and involves a much more complex confidence relationship.},

Abstract = {Ethics commissions address policies that are external to the policy
   maker, the enforcement of which may be damaging to the policymaker.
   Given this potential for harm it is likely that delegation to
   commissions is transactional with elected officials controlling autonomy
   based on a set of specific goals. The author tests this argument by
   examining how executive and legislative control of a commission's
   autonomy impacts the effectiveness of a commission's oversight. Findings
   suggest that elected officials attempt to influence commissions in a
   strategic manner based upon whether they want to direct attention away
   from themselves or toward the other branch of government.},

Abstract = {The dominant approach to the study of international political economy
   assumes that the policy preferences of individuals and groups reflect
   economic self-interest. Recent research has called this assumption into
   question by suggesting that voters do not have economically
   self-interested preferences about trade policy. We investigate one
   potential explanation for this puzzling finding: economic ignorance. We
   show that most voters do not understand the economic consequences of
   protectionism. We then use experiments to study how voters would respond
   if they had more information about how trade barriers affect the
   distribution of income. We find that distributional cues generate two
   opposing effects: they make people more likely to express self-serving
   policy preferences, but they also make people more sensitive to the
   interests of others. In our study both reactions were evident, but
   selfish responses outweighed altruistic ones. Thus, if people knew more
   about the distributional effects of trade, the correlation between
   personal interests and policy preferences would tighten. By showing how
   the explanatory power of economic self-interest depends on beliefs about
   causality, this research provides a foundation for more realistic,
   behaviorally informed theories of international political economy.},

Abstract = {Existing research on war and peace lacks analysis of what allows
   peace-building to succeed at the subnational level. Instead, most
   scholars focus on peacebuilding failure and macro-level dynamics. This
   is unfortunate because the obstacles to peacebuilding are such that the
   most puzzling question is why international efforts sometimes succeed,
   rather than why they fail. The lack of focus on success is also
   problematic because it results in ambiguous findings. On the one hand,
   there is an emerging consensus that local conflict resolution is crucial
   to building peace. There is also an agreement that, all else being
   equal, international support tends to increase the chances of successful
   peacebuilding. On the other hand, when international actors have tried
   to back local initiatives, they have often generated counterproductive
   consequences and worsened the situation. Should international actors
   support local peacebuilding processes? If so, how can they actually do
   this?
   Drawing on in-depth interviews, field and participant observations in
   nine different conflict zones, and document analysis, this article takes
   the first step in explaining whether, how, why, and under what
   conditions international interveners (including donors, diplomats,
   peacekeepers, and the foreign staff of international and
   non-governmental organizations) can contribute to successful local and
   bottom-up peace efforts. It makes three central contributions. First, it
   shows that the policy and scholarly literatures suffer from a dearth of
   findings on successful international support to local conflict
   resolution. Second, it emphasizes the critical-and under-researched-role
   of assumptions in shaping peacebuilding initiatives. Third, it develops
   a theoretical framework to analyze how assumptions influence
   international peace efforts. By way of illustration, the article
   analyzes three widespread assumptions about peacebuilding and the role
   of peacebuilders. In each case, it challenges assumptions that
   international interveners take for granted but that are actually
   unfounded and detrimental, while identifying assumptions that promote
   peacebuilding effectiveness.},

Abstract = {The Environmental Protection Agency developed the Clean Air Interstate
   Rule (CAIR) to minimize sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide emissions from
   power plants and prevent pollution spillover into downwind states. While
   observers of CAIR claim success in the reduction of air pollution, our
   innovative multivariate statistical analysis based on spatial and
   facility-level panel data finds mixed results concerning the rule's
   effectiveness. On the one hand, we find that CAIR facilities are
   associated with increases in the reduction rate of pollution compared to
   non-CAIR facilities. However, the evidence suggests that sulfur dioxide
   levels decreased in CAIR-mandated facilities before the actual
   implementation of the program. Additionally, on the one hand, CAIR
   facilities in the interior of states are associated with slower
   pollution reduction rates than those on the border. However, this
   difference in reduction rate does not change dramatically before or
   after the adoption or implementation of this rule. This suggests that
   the CAIR program was ineffective in targeting specific facilities most
   likely to contribute to interstate pollution. We conclude that while
   CAIR spurred the electrical utility industry to reduce air pollution,
   some of these reductions occurred before the actual implementation of
   the program. More substantially, gains in interstate spillover pollution
   did not occur by targeting specific facilities most likely to spillover
   but rather through the overall reduction of air pollution in the eastern
   states.},

   sustainable financing. A broad literature review was undertaken to
   identify the various types of health care programmes to develop a
   taxonomy. Then, a targeted literature review of each type of health care
   programme was undertaken to collect evidence on the ability of
   programmes to address health policy objectives. Many health care
   programmes were identified and grouped into six categories: financial
   support, patient education, integrated care, special population,
   national/regional plans, and disease management. Design and
   implementation of these programmes varied widely within and across
   categories. Evidence surrounding impact of health care programmes was
   largely mixed, with evidence of both successful and unsuccessful
   initiatives. The evidence suggests that when properly implemented,
   health care programmes can help generate cost savings, improve patient
   adherence to treatment, address inequities in access to health care, and
   improve patient health outcomes. However, the evidence relies on a
   highly heterogeneous sample of studies, study populations and diseases
   studied; studies are often of variable quality. Further research on this
   subject would therefore be beneficial.},

Abstract = {This article investigates whether gender imbalance may be conducive to
   domestic terrorism in developing countries. A female-dominated society
   may not provide sufficient administration, law, or order to limit
   domestic terrorism, especially since societies in developing countries
   primarily turn to males for administration, policing, and paramilitary
   forces. Other economic considerations support female imbalance resulting
   in grievance-generated terrorism. Because male dominance may also be
   linked to terrorism, empirical tests are ultimately needed to support
   our prediction. Based on panel data for 128 developing countries for
   1975 to 2011, we find that female gender imbalance results in more total
   and domestic terrorist attacks. This female gender imbalance does not
   affect transnational terrorism in developing countries or domestic and
   transnational terrorism in developed countries. Further tests show that
   gender imbalance affects terrorism only when bureaucratic institutions
   are weak. Many robustness tests support our results.},

Number = {2},

Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {This study examines the effect of foreign military interventions on the
   incidence of suicide attacks. It presents three theoretical
   explanations. Foreign military interventions may boost insurgent use of
   suicide attacks by (a) fomenting a nationalist backlash that sanctions
   the use of more extreme and unconventional tactics like suicide attacks,
   (b) providing more and better targets against which suicide attacks can
   be launched, or (c) prompting insurgents to use suicide tactics in order
   to overcome their power asymmetries and to confront better defended
   targets that are enhanced by interventions. We test these competing
   explanations using a battery of statistical tests on cross-national,
   time-series data for 138 countries during the period from 1981 to 2005.
   We find that only foreign interventions with specific
   featurespro-government interventions involving larger numbers of ground
   troopsboost suicide attacks in countries experiencing interventions.
   This finding suggests that by tipping the balance of power against
   insurgents and hardening targets in the context of assisting a local
   government, foreign military interventions are likely to increase the
   use of suicide attacks by regime challengers.},

Abstract = {Political leadership in the European Commission tends to be associated
   with high politics and the intervention therein of the Commission
   President. This contribution takes a different approach by viewing
   policy leadership by the Commission as a form of political leadership.
   When the Commission finds it difficult to perform a broader political
   agenda-setting role, it may still be able to set and deliver new policy
   initiatives. The contribution considers the conditions under which
   successful policy leadership occurs. It identifies two types of
   condition - political agency and policy capacity - and argues that both,
   together, are important in explaining successful policy leadership.
   Evidence is drawn from the case of European mobile roaming.},

Journal = {HUMAN RIGHTS QUARTERLY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {39},
Number = {1},
Pages = {1-36},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {New Realist critics of international law, like many international
   relations realists who came before, are taking aim at human rights for
   its hopeless legalism. These critics rely on a regulative model that
   narrowly conceives of human rights laws as potentially enforceable rules
   without teeth. The article defines and elaborates an alternative
   constitutive model of human rights law, which understands the role of
   law as being both constituted by, and generative of, political
   interactions. This understanding is superior to legalist and regulative
   models because it better describes a number of rights-related phenomena
   observed in the world.},

Abstract = {This contribution introduces the concept of integration capacity and
   summarizes our research on the European Union (EU)'s integration
   capacity in Eastern enlargement. Integration capacity refers to the
   ability of the EU to prepare non-members for membership (external
   integration capacity) and to preserve its functioning and cohesion once
   they join (internal integration capacity). In general, we find strong
   evidence for the EU's external capacity to prepare candidates for
   membership and for the EU's internal institutional capacity to integrate
   new member states. By contrast, the absence of a membership perspective
   reduces external capacity, and sceptical publics weaken internal
   capacity. In addition, our results support the centrality of
   conditionality as a mode of integration. We conclude by highlighting the
   policy implications of our research for future enlargement and relations
   with associated states.},

   comparing EU and US responses},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF EUROPEAN INTEGRATION},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {39},
Number = {7, SI},
Pages = {795-809},
Abstract = {This paper examines mobilisation of civil society organizations (CSOs),
   focusing primarily on the highly-contested politics engendered by the
   Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP), by posing the
   question, how can we account for strong opposition to TTIP in the EU,
   while being nearly non-existent in the US?' It is argued that European
   CSO opposition to TTIP and mobilisation of European public opinion
   against TTIP can be traced to the European Commission's employment of
   myths - specifically a green, social, and humanitarian Europe in a
   process of othering' to build a sense of European national identity.
   Salient issues in transatlantic trade and regulatory capacity both
   factor into CSO opposition, themselves also a function of myth making,
   but also a product of the EU's governance system. It will be difficult
   for the EU to accommodate and appease such oppositional groups because
   of perceptions among many Europeans that Americans tolerate lower
   regulatory protections.},

Title = {Entrepreneurial failure in the transition to electric vehicles: a case
   study of support for sustainability policy in Israel},

Abstract = {Why do entrepreneurs who gained initial remarkable government support
   for sustainability policy lose it rapidly and what may be learned from
   such failure? In May 2013, a national attempt for transition of
   transportation industry from internal combustion engine to electric
   vehicle by building country-wide infrastructure in Israel went bankrupt.
   Only short period before, the company, Better Place, seemed to be
   successful both in recruiting \$850million from investors and gaining
   institutional and political support via successful policy
   entrepreneurship from top governmental echelons to cut dependence on
   oil. The case study investigates what caused policy entrepreneur to lose
   political support and why the government did not provide a bailout plan
   for the company. Based on in-depth interviews over a period of several
   years with company employees and government officials in Israel and use
   of secondary data sources, the study concludes that, in the wake of
   national demonstrations for social justice in 2011, politicians shifted
   their agenda from national security concerns to welfare issues. This
   case fills a gap in the literature which tends to focus on successful
   ventures, by deriving insights from a case of entrepreneurial failure,
   as much can be learned from failure too. The practical lesson learned as
   the global movement for social justice spread is that initial success of
   policy entrepreneurship, which exploits a political window of
   opportunity, does not guarantee long-term governmental support for
   sustainability policy.},

   building a parliament house in post-independence Myanmar},

Abstract = {This article focuses on the contested, and frequently postponed,
   construction of a new parliament house in postcolonial Myanmar. Since
   the late colonial period, the country's legislative bodies have convened
   in four different buildings, three located in the former capital Yangon
   and the latest one in Naypyitaw. Drawing on legislative proceedings and
   media reports, this study interrogates the relationship between
   decolonisation, national identity, state-building, and public
   architecture in post-independence Myanmar. It suggests that the
   commissioning and construction of a new legislative house has always
   served a dual objective: projecting state power and national pride in
   both Myanmar's early postcolonial and later post-junta political
   contexts, whilst symbolising a sense of nationhood grounded on the
   representational ideals of the dominant and ruling ethnic Bamar elites.},

Abstract = {Territorial autonomy for ethnic groups is an important component of
   Ethiopian federalism designed to deal with the challenges of ethnic
   diversity. The constitutional decision to use ethnicity as a basis for
   the organisation of the state represents a recognition of the political
   relevance of ethnicity. However, the decision that each major ethnic
   group should be dominant in one and only subnational unit has elevated
   ethnic identity to a primary political identity. This approach overlooks
   other historically and politically relevant territorial identities. The
   constitution thus misses an opportunity to respond to ethnic concerns
   without freezing ethnicity as an exclusive political identity.},

Abstract = {This article analyses how a recent series of Sri Lankan history
   textbooks construct and disseminate a particular form of nationalism
   that is both exclusively Sinhalese and authoritarian. It argues that
   their use of language and storylines perpetuates a Sinhalese-centric
   historical narrative that presents disputed myths, symbols and heroes as
   official history. This narrative legitimises the Sinhalese claim for
   sovereignty and the protection of the territorial integrity of Sri Lanka
   as a major goal of Sinhalese nationalism. This article also highlights
   how the textbooks further encourage authoritarian patriotism,
   potentially mobilising future citizens into participation in the
   reproduction of an exclusive and ethnocentric version of Sinhalese
   nationalism.},

Abstract = {A range of psychological, social, and environmental factors render some
   individuals more susceptible to militant Islam than others. Research
   also suggests that there are certain triggers, which help to explain why
   it is that only some individuals exposed to the same societal structural
   influences turn to violence. This article seeks to contribute to future
   empirical research in this area by studying the significance of certain
   charismatic preachers in this process and examining the role the
   Internet plays in strengthening the charismatic bond. Difficulties in
   defining and measuring charisma may help in part to explain the paucity
   of research on this aspect of radicalization but since charismatic
   authority derives from the bond between preacher and follower, an
   examination of the activities, strategies, and techniques used to build
   relationships and win adherents to Salafi-jihadism may provide valuable
   insights for countering radicalization.},

Abstract = {The Kantian peace theory emphasises the mutually enforcing pacifying
   effects of democracy and economic interdependence. Nevertheless, the
   last decade, which has seen record levels of interdependence and
   democratisation, provides anecdotal evidence that challenges the
   simplicity of the democracy-interdependence-peace argument. In this
   paper, I contrast Kant's approach to this conundrum with that of
   Rousseau's. While Kant's well-known argument suggests a mutually
   reinforcing relation between democracy, interdependence and peace,
   Rousseau postulates that the pacifying effects of democracy are not
   sustainable under conditions of heightened interdependence. Rousseau's
   analysis adds complexity to the familiar Kantian argument by qualifying
   the conditions under which we can expect democracy and/or
   democratisation to reduce the probability of conflict, and by adding an
   important social and ideational component to the largely material
   approach of the Kantian peace theory.},

Abstract = {This chapter synthesizes the research needs presented in the book and
   proposes actions for addressing them. It highlights the socioeconomic
   and biophysical characteristics, development, production and consumption
   patterns, challenges and threats and management approaches that were
   discussed in the preceding chapters and discusses the priorities for
   future Lake Tana basin research that were raised. The analysis shows
   that the basin has many unique features, and great potential for
   sustainable development, especially in water resources. The lake and
   basin provide multiple benefits to the local community, the region and
   downstream riparian countries. Many of the problematic trends in the
   region result from an imbalance between resource production and
   consumption patterns, and limited or poorly implemented conservation
   measures. The many and complex challenges and threats in the basin are
   caused, in part, by the lack of an integrated basin plan and poor
   collaborative mechanisms to share data and find sustainable solutions.
   The available data and information about the basin is limited. It is not
   well-organized, accessible, or used well for the basin's resource
   management. The identification of major research gaps and priorities for
   future research highlighted in this book, as well as the systems
   framework for integration and collaboration, provide a basis for further
   research and policy decisions to promote sustainability in the region.},

Abstract = {Recent studies on European Union (EU) Enlargement have emphasised the
   importance of usages of `Europe' by domestic actors as a necessary
   condition for the EU to have an impact on domestic politics. We study
   the usages of Europe in the critical case of Turkey's nuclear energy
   policy. We analyse the narratives and actions of domestic actors in
   Turkey to identify if they use `Europe' (the EU and the idea of Europe).
   We reach the counter-intuitive finding of usages by both state and
   non-state actors, which illustrates that usages of Europe can persist
   despite enlargement stasis in candidate states.},

Pages = {225-262},
Abstract = {The concept of the command of the sea has its roots in medieval notions
   of the sovereignty of coastal waters, as claimed by several monarchs and
   polities of Europe. In the sixteenth century, a surge of intellectual
   creativity, especially in Elizabethan England, fused this notion with
   the Thucydidean term thalassocracy' - the rule of the sea. In the light
   of the explorations of the oceans, this led to a new conceptualisation
   of naval warfare, developed in theory and then put into practice. This
   falsifies the mistaken but widespread assumption that there was no
   significant writing on naval strategy before the nineteenth century.},

Abstract = {To better connect the concept of policy problems to policy solutions,
   this article builds on Guy Peters' framework for identifying and
   applying attributes' of policy problems. It does so by applying the
   seven attributes of policy problems identified in Peters' past work to a
   range of policy problems in the United States. The problems investigated
   include access to healthcare, the organization of public health
   services, and water pollution. By applying Peters' attributes to these
   policy problems, we assess the range of the framework's application to
   different types of policy problems. We also identify insights that can
   be used to enable improvements to the framework over time, which may
   enhance our ability to characterize policy problems in ways that guide
   policy design.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF CHINESE GOVERNANCE},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {2},

Abstract = {In China, a significant issue remains as to how to ensure accountability
   and what kind of accountability should be built under China's
   multilayered `principal-agent' relationships. In implementing `Peaceful
   Zhejiang,' a comprehensive approach to development in this province,
   accountability needs to be shared among Party and government
   organizations across different levels of government, as the project aims
   to bring together efforts across Party and government organizations.
   Such joint and individual accountability, however, also raises the risk
   of `conspiracy' among organizations at lower government levels, weakens
   the capacity to differentiate responsibility, and to evaluate
   performance, and may undermine motivation for successful implementation
   of Peaceful Zhejiang. Higher-level local governments, if able to reduce
   information asymmetry, adjust work priorities continuously, and improve
   assessment criteria and associated rewards and punishment, can enhance
   the incentives provided by the assessment system. With both pressure
   from the top-down and the risk of `conspiracy' from the bottom-up,
   however, local authorities are prone to be anxious and languid, and may
   do the least required and leave things to chance or do it at any cost.
   To break through the multilayered `principal-agent' relationships, China
   needs to create some horizontal accountability mechanism to build more
   responsive governments based on delegation of power.},

Abstract = {This article focuses on the so-called ``brutalization{''} of terrorism.
   The brutalization thesis as part of the larger theoretical concept of
   ``new terrorism{''} argues that ``new terrorism{''} is more brutal than
   ``old terrorism.{''} Many scholars claim that the 9/11 attacks mark the
   beginning of a new era of terrorism that has lifted international as
   well as domestic terrorism to a new level of violent brutality. Others
   argue that this process had already started in the early 1990s. After
   discussing possible ways to operationalize a brutalization of terrorism,
   for example focusing on suicide bombings or terrorist attacks against
   soft targets, this article tests the empirical credibility of the
   brutalization thesis regarding both potential starting points. Data from
   the Global Terrorism Database (GTD) shows that only three out of nine
   indicators increased significantly during the 1990s, partially backing
   the idea of a general brutalization, whereas increasing numbers of
   suicide attacks and beheadings after 9/11 support the notion of a
   qualitative change in terrorism and its brutality connected with the
   idea of maximizing media and public attention. Yet, these developments
   are regionally limited and the brutality of this ``new terrorism{''}
   exceeds the levels known from the zenith of ``old terrorism{''} in the
   1970s and 1980s in only a few cases.},

Abstract = {While a considerable amount of research has been conducted on
   community-based initiatives aimed at preventing violence, including the
   role of the ex-political prisoner community in preventative and
   counterterrorism work, little is known about how the ex-prisoners
   themselves manage their identity transition between the role they
   occupied during the conflict and their current role in violence
   prevention. We argue that it is important to consider the perspective of
   ex-prisoners who are both architects of their own process of desistance
   from political violence, as well active leaders of bespoke desistance
   programs. While many researchers have recognized the utility of the role
   of ex-prisoners in violence prevention work, theoretically, the way in
   which ex-prisoners do violence prevention through their use of language
   and intergroup contact and other resources, is poorly understood.
   Ultimately, the aim of the article is twofold: to understand the
   resources (discursive or otherwise) that the community of ex-political
   prisoners use in their preventative work and (2) to understand how this
   community understand their role in desistance programs in the context of
   their personal involvement in violent conflict, including the ways in
   which participants manage their identity transition.},

Abstract = {The relationship between the Pacific islands and the region's `bigger
   brothers' - Australia and New Zealand - is often seen in two-dimensional
   terms with the latter appearing to act in concert and in terms
   characterised by underlying neo-colonial attitudes and a determination
   to dominate the regional agenda. Given that both are former colonial
   powers with considerable political and economic resources and are the
   major aid donors in the region as well as being members of the powerful
   geopolitical entity known as `the West', it is not difficult to sustain
   an image of neo-colonial dominance. But to do so also requires casting
   Pacific island countries in a certain role, not only lacking agency but
   also cohering around a common identity and set of interests. This
   article examines key aspects of regional relations as played out through
   the region's premier organisation, the Pacific Islands Forum, and
   assesses the extent to which a simple political divide between Australia
   and New Zealand on the one hand, and the island states on the other, can
   be maintained.},

Pages = {69-96},
Abstract = {Political Parties have sprung up in Ghana under the fourth republic to
   participate fully in national elections and to promote democracy for the
   people of Ghana. In recent times, academics, political and media
   observers as well as practitioners have spoken of politicians and
   parties as brands. This observation has been given prominence by
   research findings that offer valuable insights on political party
   behaviour, candidates' personalities and policy attributes. The concept
   of branding is known in commerce as a tool used to create difference;
   aiding consumers to make a purchase decision easily. Hence, the idea of
   branding as a differentiator is transferred on to political party
   management, candidate grooming and policy development. This research was
   motivated to investigate political party branding and voter choice in
   Ghana with the aim of assessing how party brand elements are
   differentiated from each other to establish difference and clarity in
   Ghana's Political arena. The study employed sequential mixed method
   approach in collecting data from political parties with representation
   in parliament of Ghana and a survey of 450 (four hundred and fifty)
   Ghanaian student voters. Interview guide was developed to collect data
   from the political parties to provide detailed in-depth information
   about the thought process that went into the selection of brand elements
   to build their party brand. A likert-scale questionnaire was used to
   collect data from voters about political party branding and their impact
   on voters preferred choice of political party in Ghana. The findings
   showed that, political party branding elements such as ideology, policy
   and colours are statistically significant and have positive influence on
   voter's choice of political party in Ghana. The research provides policy
   guidelines for branding political parties in Ghana.},

Abstract = {This article asks what features should characterise the boundaries
   between the EU and the outside world from the standpoint of demoicracy.
   Section one summarises the normative core of that view and grounds it in
   the values of autonomy, equal recognition and non-domination. Section
   two categorises the issues that arise for the demoicrat when it comes to
   the consequences of political borders. We demonstrate - through the
   example of intra-demoicracy border crossing - why demoicrats will seek
   to follow the three desiderata of procedural fairness, just outcomes,
   and overall consistency in designing political solutions. Section three
   defends a set of principles that would ideally govern large-scale
   arrival of refugees. Section four addresses questions of non-ideal
   theory, reflecting on how demoicratic theorists should think about
   current EU policies. Though we do not offer a comprehensive solution to
   the tensions we identify, the conclusion offers some proposals of how
   demoicrats may alleviate them.},

Abstract = {The Blue Nile (Abay) River is originating in the Lake Tana basin where
   many perennial and seasonal streams feed the largest lake of Ethiopia
   (Tana). The basin is characterized by different volcanic formations
   covered by thick alluvial and residual Quaternary sediments at the
   center of the basin around Lake Tana. In this study, an attempt was made
   to outline the hydrogeology of the basin based on limited information
   from well lithologic logs and previous relevant works. The Lake Tana
   basin is considered as a potential area for surface water and
   groundwater development corridors. The hydrogeology and groundwater
   occurrence is complex due to tectonism and existence of different
   volcanic rocks covered with thick alluvial sediments at the center of
   the basin. The shallow aquifer systems in the middle of the basin from
   the alluvial sediments are tapped by local communities using shallow
   wells fitted with hand pumps. The volcanic aquifers are multi-layer and
   tapped from different volcanic layers. The latter are highly productive
   depending up on the degree of fracturing and weathering. In few cases,
   as in the case of Kola Diba area there are artesian wells. The
   groundwater system converges towards the center of the basin. The Lake
   Tana basin leaks groundwater to the adjacent Beles basin and through the
   Blue Nile outlet.},

   Modelling target selection and learning in NGO advocacy},

Abstract = {In conducting advocacy, non- governmental organisations (NGOs) often
   repeatedly lobby targets that have already made reforms, while also
   ignoring some serious, unreformed offenders. Drawing on recent
   literature on the economic influences on NGO activity, this article
   proposes a new model of target selection that explains such behaviour.
   In the model, NGOs select their targets in order to maximise the level
   of reform achieved with their available resources. Initial target
   selection is based on limited information. Target response to initial
   advocacy reveals whether the target is `soft' (low cost to benefit
   ratio) or `hard' (high cost to benefit ratio). NGOs employ this
   information to maximise the benefits of their resources, abandoning
   targets deemed too costly to change and repeatedly lobbying those deemed
   likely to make changes at little cost. We demonstrate the applicability
   of the model using two cases from the Jubilee debt relief movement. We
   then explore the implications of our findings for NGOs' performance as
   watchdogs.},

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONFLICT AND VIOLENCE},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {11},
Abstract = {This paper explores why new ways of ``knowing{''} and acting on violence
   could lead to a reconsideration of Weber's pessimistic coupling of
   politics and violence. This coupling remains hugely influential almost a
   century after it was formulated. It has become possible to revisit it,
   firstly, because of the potential for new interdisciplinary
   conversations. These have opened up ways of understanding violence as a
   properly social phenomenon and the significance of our vulnerable,
   social bodies to its reproduction. Secondly, social action onviolence
   has led to recognition as ``violence{''} of varied acts of somatic harm
   previously not named as such. In the process, expressions of violence
   reproduced over time and through spaces of socialization (from the
   intimate to the construction of the nation state) are socially and
   politically de-sanctioned. Politics and the State could be
   reconceptualised as essential for reducing (rather than monopolizing)
   violence and creating conditions to live together without it.},

Abstract = {This article provides an analysis of the external operations wing of IS
   -the so-called Amn al-Kharji - focusing on its activities in the West.
   Apart from describing the organisation's leadership, internal hierarchy,
   strategy and means of communication and attack coordination, the author
   asserts there is a link between recent deadly cells-based attacks and
   generally unsuccessful lone actor attacks; this connection between the
   two is not accidental but a result of a grand strategy, designed to hide
   the planning of larger plots by overloading security services with
   numerous smaller attacks.},

   limits of material sanctions and the scope of social pressure},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF EUROPEAN PUBLIC POLICY},

Volume = {24},
Number = {3, SI},
Pages = {337-351},
Abstract = {When confronting democratic backsliding in its member states, the
   European Union (EU) cannot rely on material sanctions. There are
   formidable obstacles to using the one political safeguard that entails
   material sanctions, namely Article 7 of the Treaty on European Union
   (TEU). Moreover, the experience of the EU's pre-accession conditionality
   suggests that even a credible threat of material sanctions is least
   effective the more severe the breaches of liberal democracy. However, EU
   interventions without material leverage are not necessarily doomed, as
   the case of Romania in 2012 shows. Under favourable conditions the EU
   can thus elicit governments to repeal illiberal practices by relying
   primarily on social pressure and persuasion. This contribution assesses
   to what extent novel instruments that EU institutions have developed to
   confront democratic backsliding meet the requirements for effective
   social influence. It argues that the Commission's Rule of Law Framework
   has potential because it meets the criteria of formalization, publicity
   and impartiality. Yet, to increase the likelihood of influence, it needs
   to be applied more consistently and should be embedded in a process of
   regular monitoring through a democracy scoreboard covering all member
   states.},

Journal = {PEACEBUILDING},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {5},
Number = {3},
Pages = {305-319},
Abstract = {The critiques of the liberal peacebuilding framework led to
   recommendations of further enhancing local involvement during a
   peacebuilding process, including transitional justice. Previous studies
   highlight the importance of grounding transitional justice mechanisms on
   local contexts to better address the needs of victims in post-conflict
   societies. However, there are instances when local actors exploit the
   legitimacy of liberal institutions to advance their political interests
   or deny the pursuit of justice for the sake of short-term stability.
   This has happened in Cambodia, Kosovo and Timor-Leste when the decisions
   of the local elite failed to reflect the local aspirations for justice
   and reconciliation. This article raises caution over the potential
   pitfalls of exclusive local involvement in transitional justice.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF EUROPEAN PUBLIC POLICY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {24},
Number = {1},
Pages = {21-41},
Abstract = {This article traces European Union (EU) biofuels policy development from
   the late 1990s through to 2015, demonstrating the effects of the early
   multiple rationales for biofuels in generating both self-reinforcing
   processes of policy continuity as well as self-undermining processes of
   policy discontinuity. It argues that features of the EU political and
   institutional context - most importantly, institutional imperatives for
   a consensus across multiple EU decision-making bodies and the provision
   of institutionalised opportunities for policy reviews - are deeply
   implicated in both self-reinforcing and self-undermining feedback
   processes. The shift in the balance away from self-reinforcing feedback
   processes to self-undermining processes after 2009 is explained by the
   interaction of biofuel interpretive feedbacks with contextual changes,
   including processes of knowledge accumulation regarding the negative
   environmental impacts of food-based biofuels.},

Abstract = {This article explores the way in which the concept of `public' is
   continually and unpredictably constituted, redefined, and unmade in Gulu
   District, northern Uganda. It uses case studies of three local security
   initiatives and their conflicts with state agents to examine how public
   authorities establish power through a dynamic process of both claiming
   and denying authority, thereby divesting themselves of responsibility to
   intervene. It also shows that the state maintains its power over other
   claimants to public authority such as the local security initiatives by
   unpredictably shifting the boundary between public and private, and
   enforcing these seemingly arbitrary definitions with a very real threat
   of violent force. Together, these two phenomena prevent civilians from
   developing expectations of public authorities or creating alternative
   public authorities, which helps to explain the lack of state
   accountability to citizens in northern Uganda.},

Abstract = {The linguistic premises of European policy-making often remain hidden
   from public debate and the scrutiny of social scientists, despite the
   fact that rhetorical framing' is a widely recognized strategy and frame
   theory has dominated the way social scientists talk about ideas in
   social movements. Our concern is how the European Commission uses the
   master frame' of neoliberalism to establish a mandate for
   sector-specific policies that can be pursued via autonomous action by
   the Commission and/or collective action by adherents of Commission
   policies. Using critical discourse analysis (CDA) to decode the speeches
   of Siim Kallas, former commissioner for transport and advocate of an
   open market for port services, we demonstrate how rhetorical framing
   supports a strategy designed to divide-and-conquer' opponents of freedom
   of establishment and the right to provide services in the single
   European market.},

Title = {How does policy learning occur? The case of Belgian mental health care
   reforms},
Journal = {POLICY AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {36},
Number = {2},
Pages = {270-287},
Abstract = {This article asks how policy learning is achieved and whether and how it
   impacts on policy change. By drawing on the empirical case of Belgian
   mental health reforms, it shows that policy learning occurs through the
   very practice of policy-making. In-depth analyses of the process of
   preparing and devising, a current reform of mental health care delivery,
   called Reform 107, evidence that the transformation of policy learning -
   through verbal expression, inscription in documents or enactment in
   social situations such as meetings - is crucial to its impact on policy
   change. A phenomenological approach to knowledge in policy helps to
   perceive and describe the transformation of policy learning through
   practical actions and interactions involved in devising policy change.
   Analytically, looking at this transformation entails shifting the focus
   from big and visible changes in policy objectives and instruments to
   micro policy practices such as meeting and writing documents. Placing
   the focus on micro policy practices should not lead, however, to a
   disregard for the social context in which they develop. The
   interactionist concept of linked ecologies provides the means to
   consider social regulations influencing policy learning without
   underestimating their very ephemeral and contingent nature.},

Abstract = {Marie Deschamps released her External Review into Sexual Misconduct and
   Sexual Harassment in the Canadian Armed Forces in 2015. Its effect was
   that military authorities at last acknowledged the existence of a
   sexualized culture conducive to sexual harassment and assault in the
   military as well as the need for long-term cultural change. In
   addressing sexual violence the Canadian Armed Forces elected to go with
   an operational approach (Operation honour). The organization has since
   established ``strength through diversity{''} as its platform for dealing
   with internal gender dynamics. The article looks at how the military's
   current approach to gender issues compares with its predecessors.},

Abstract = {Under which conditions are principals able to regain control when agency
   slack has occured? While existing research highlights a number of
   important factors related to the conditions under which agents engage in
   slack, scholars have to a less extent investigated which causal
   mechanisms affect the ability of states to regain control of their
   errant agents. Extending the principal-agent literature, this
   contribution argues that the ability of principals to regain control of
   their agents depends on three causal mechanisms: the type of monitoring
   mechanisms; the extent of fragmentation within an international
   organization; and the credibility of sanctions available to member
   states. To illustrate this argument, I compare two cases of agency
   slack: at the European Commission during the Eurozone crisis in 2015;
   and at the World Health Organization in the 1990s. The findings suggest
   that regaining control of runaway agents after slack has occurred is
   easier when there is a low level of fragmentation within an organization
   and states have centralized monitoring mechanisms and credible sanction
   mechanisms, such as budgetary contractions, at their disposal.},

Abstract = {The Leave majority recorded in England was decisive in determining the
   UK-wide referendum result. Brexit was made in England. We take this as a
   prompt to challenge the conventional Anglo-British mindset that animates
   most studies of British politics' and has shaped public attitudes
   research on the United Kingdom. We explore the persistence of
   distinctive Eurosceptic views in England and their relationship to
   English national identity prior to the referendum. We then model
   referendum vote choice using data from the Future of England Survey. Our
   analysis shows that immigration concerns played a major role in the
   Brexit referendum, alongside a general willingness to take risks,
   right-wing views, older age, and English national identity. Therefore,
   Brexit was not just made in England, but Englishness was also a
   significant driver of the choice for Leave.},

Abstract = {Since its establishment in 1963, the Correlates of War (COW) project has
   sought to build cumulative knowledge about international conflict
   through the application of the scientific method to the study of
   militarized interstate behavior. Early analyses from the COW project
   found substantial variation in the causal model of war across the
   nineteenth and twentieth centuries, but COW scholars later sought to
   develop a general model of war that avoided post hoc historical
   periodization. We use out of sample cross validation to evaluate the
   plausibility of assuming temporal homogeneity for statistical models of
   international conflict that span the nineteenth and twentieth centuries.
   Our results suggest that the causal model of war changes substantially
   across historical eras. In particular, great care should be taken in
   generalizing Cold War findings to other historical eras. Our findings
   demonstrate the importance of exploring temporal variation in the causal
   model of war.},

Abstract = {Beginning in 2002, Kenyan water governance transitioned from a
   monocentric, top-down system to one exhibiting traits of polycentricity.
   In this paper, we investigate the changes made to water policy following
   the 2002 reform, outcomes produced in a collection of community- and
   catchment-level user groups in the Mount Kenya region, and the
   conformance of these changes and outcomes with principles of
   polycentricity. A new framework is used to capture the complex
   institutional arrangements and interactions existing before and after
   the polycentric transformation. Unlike many previous polycentricity
   studies, the present research focuses primarily on the outcomes of the
   polycentric shift and determines if these correspond to predictions from
   polycentricity theory. We utilize survey data collected in 2013 from
   water managers, as well as archival research to interrogate congruence
   with principles of polycentricity. This study contributes to the broader
   discussion on polycentricity in two fundamental ways: (i) It documents
   the functioning of a water management system following a top-down
   imposed polycentric reform, and (ii) It empirically inspects whether
   these polycentric reforms have produced benefits predicted by
   polycentricity theorists, such as experimentation by local water users,
   increased collective action, and improved coordination between levels of
   management.},

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL THEORY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {9},
Number = {3},
Pages = {436-465},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {The Lisbon Treaty from 2009 introduced the possibility for individual
   member states to withdraw from the European Union (EU) on the basis of a
   unilateral decision. In June 2016 the United Kingdom decided to leave
   the EU invoking article 50 of the treaty. But is withdrawal
   democratically legitimate? In fact, the all-affected principle suggests
   that it is undemocratic for subunits to leave larger political units
   when it adversely affects other citizens without including them in the
   decision. However, it is unclear what the currency of this affectedness
   is and, hence, why withdrawal would be undemocratic. We argue that it is
   the effect of withdrawal on the status of citizens as free and equal
   that is decisive and that explains why unilateral withdrawal of subunits
   from larger units is democratically illegitimate. Moreover, on the
   all-affected status principle' that we develop, even multilaterally
   agreed withdrawal is undemocratic because the latter diminishes the
   future ability of citizens to make decisions together regarding issues
   that affect their status as free and equal. On this basis, we conclude
   that it is undemocratic for a member state such as the United Kingdom to
   withdraw from the EU.},

   Polarization},

Abstract = {Several recent studies link rising income inequality in the United
   States to the global financial crisis, arguing that US politicians did
   not respond to growing inequality with fiscal redistribution. Instead,
   Americans saved less and borrowed more to maintain relative consumption
   in the face of widening economic disparities. This article proposes a
   theory in which fiscal redistribution dampens the willingness of
   citizens to borrow to fund current consumption. A key implication is
   that pretax inequality will be more tightly linked with credit in less
   redistributive countries. The long-run partisan composition of
   government is, in turn, a key determinant of redistributive effort.
   Examining a panel of eighteen OECD democracies, the authors find that
   countries with limited histories of left-wing participation in
   government are significantly more likely see credit expansion as prefisc
   inequality grows compared to those in which the political left has been
   more influential.},

Abstract = {The language of democracy has become common in international law, the
   legal system that regulates relations between nation states. This
   interest in democracy has however largely ignored democracy at the
   international level and focused instead on national democratic
   standards. In this paper, I start by sketching the threadbare debates
   about democracy beyond political borders in international law and then
   turn to the way that international institutions have developed this
   concept, particularly in the peace and state-building boom associated
   with the end of the Cold War. The two contexts for democracy have taken
   different directions. In the case of democracy at the international
   level, the discussion has become polarised between global North and
   South, with democracy being promoted by the South as an omnibus agenda
   to remedy economic and political inequalities. In the case of
   democracies within states, international lawyers have taken democracy to
   have a fixed form, associated with specific institutional practices and
   structures, limiting its capacity for transformation.},

Abstract = {Scholarly knowledge about considerations underlying citizens'
   evaluations of the role of municipal councillors as democratic
   representatives is scant. In this paper we begin filling this gap. On
   the basis of a representative survey amongst 500 Dutch citizens we first
   establish what citizens feel that representatives should do (normative
   expectations). Subsequently, we analyse how such expectations affect
   citizens' satisfaction with the actual performance of councillors as
   representatives. This paper's results help in understanding the reasons
   why people are (dis) satisfied with their local democratic
   representatives and the backgrounds of confidence in municipal councils.},

Abstract = {A core task for elected officials is to hold bureaucratic leaders
   responsible, but how do they determine if public managers actually
   influence outcomes? We propose that partisan and leadership heuristics
   affect how politicians apply a logic of individualized responsibility,
   that is, focus on individual bureaucrats rather than situational factors
   to explain organizational outcomes. We match survey data of local
   elected officials in Denmark with individual partisan variables and
   objective performance data about the schools they oversee. We provide
   evidence that partisan beliefs matter, with conservative elected
   officials more willing to pursue a logic of individualized
   responsibility. We also find that elected officials are more likely to
   assume that bureaucratic leaders determine organizational outcomes where
   performance is very high or low, a leadership attribution heuristic
   previously established in private sector studies. We argue that our
   findings have important implications for contemporary governance, given
   the growing reliance on performance metrics to assign responsibility.},

Abstract = {There is no single definition for `preferential voting' or `preference
   voting' since the terms are used for a number of different election
   systems and groups of such systems. They can be synonymous with the
   single-transferable vote, the alternative vote, open-list proportional
   representation, or the group of all ranking methods. This article offers
   an overview of the various definitions and classifications of
   preferential voting and other terms used in the literature to describe
   it. It proposes a common understanding of preferential voting. I suggest
   that preferentiality ought to be one of the characteristics by which
   electoral systems are evaluated. All election systems are preferential,
   though to varying degrees. I offer a classification of numerous
   electoral schemes according to their preferentiality.},

Abstract = {The recent economic and fiscal crisis provides an opportunity for
   learning lessons of general and practical relevance about how
   governments face shocks affecting their financial conditions. This
   article draws on the resilience concept to investigate the
   organizational capacities that are deployed and/or built by local
   governments (LGs) to respond to such shocks, looking at their
   combinations and interactions with environmental conditions. The article
   presents the results of a multiple-case analysis of 12 European LG s
   across Austria, Italy and England. The analysis allows us to highlight
   and operationalize different patterns of financial resilience, that is,
   self-regulation, constrained or reactive adaptation, contented or
   powerless fatalism, that are the result of the interaction and
   development over time of different internal and external dimensions.},

   ideal-type approach},
Journal = {PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {95},
Number = {3},
Pages = {555-570},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {International Public Administrations (IPAs), that is, the secretariats
   of international organizations, are important actors in global
   governance. This article develops a new typology of IPAs that captures
   the potential influence of these bureaucratic bodies on international
   policy-making. The main argument is that when conceptualizing the
   varying roles and potential policy impact of IPAs, it is useful to
   distinguish between their ability to develop autonomous preferences
   (autonomy of will) on the one hand, and their capacity to transform
   these preferences into action (autonomy of action) on the other. Based
   on this premise, the article introduces four distinct ideal-types of
   international bureaucracies and suggests indicators to locate a diverse
   sample of 20 administrations within the four-fold typology. The results
   reveal the empirical diversity of IPA autonomy and allow for a first
   empirical assessment of the factors behind this pattern.},

Abstract = {Drawing on accounts of regulatory capture in which an industry's
   influence activities pull regulation in its direction, apart from
   incentives or information, this article develops a formal model of
   capture as a shift in a policy-making agent's preferences, due to costly
   actions by the industry. One type of action is rentseeking that produces
   only capture, whereas the other type also improves regulatory quality by
   producing information that reduces policy uncertainty. The model shows
   how the ability to capture the agent can incentivise the interest group
   to produce more information. Thus, aligning an agent's preferences with
   a political principal's and immunising him from capture is not generally
   optimal; instead, the principal prefers an agent who is susceptible to
   capture associated with quality improvements but also initially more
   opposed to the group than the principal. A comparison of two Securities
   and Exchange Commission rulemakings illustrates the logic of the model.},

Abstract = {This article examines portrayals of Muslim women in US news media. I
   test two hypotheses derived from theories of gendered orientalism.
   First, US news coverage of women abroad is driven by confirmation bias.
   Journalists are more likely to report on women living in Muslim and
   Middle Eastern countries if their rights are violated but report on
   women in other societies when their rights are respected. Second,
   stories about Muslim women emphasize the theme of women's rights
   violations and gender inequality, even for countries with relatively
   good records of women's rights. Stories about non-Muslim women, on the
   other hand, emphasize other topics. I test these hypotheses on data from
   thirty-five years of New York Times and Washington Post reporting using
   a structural topic model along with statistical analysis. The results
   suggest that US news media propagate the perception that Muslims are
   distinctly sexist. This, in turn, may shape public attitudes toward
   Muslims, as well as influence policies that involve Muslims at home and
   abroad.},

Abstract = {Though approximately one in four coup attempts takes place during an
   ongoing civil war, scholars have not yet analyzed how the incidence of
   civil war affects coup attempts and outcomes. We conduct the first
   empirical analysis of the relationship between ongoing civil war and
   coup activity, finding (1) war increases the risk of a coup attempt,
   though (2) war-time coup attempts are significantly less likely to be
   successful, and (3) the risk of war-time coup is much higher when states
   face stronger rebel groups that pose greater threats to the political
   survival of the incumbent government. We attribute these findings to the
   pernicious effect of ongoing war on the welfare of the military elites
   and soldiers who have the greatest capacity to execute a coup attempt.
   As war diminishes their welfare and creates uncertainty about the future
   of the state, potential plotters become more willing to accept riskier
   coup attempts than they might plot during peace-time. Coup motivations
   are greatest when incumbents are more likely to lose their wars, and
   this causes coup plotters to attempt more and riskier coups when rebels
   are relatively strong.},

Abstract = {I researched two forms of shortened food supply chain in Poland from the
   perspective of social relations. This involves qualitative analysis of
   interviews with the customers of seven open-air food markets in
   Maopolska region and the members of one Krakow cooperative. Such markets
   are traditional forms, continuously and deeply rooted in households'
   everyday provision strategies, whereas food cooperatives are typical
   Alternative Food Networks inspired by Western experiences and have only
   existed in Poland for a few years. The two forms have distinct
   similarities, as they refer to directness and locality and are critical
   of dominant, mass economic institutions. However, the analysis of
   consumers' interviews points to clear differences rooted in historical
   and structural determinants. These differences result in their different
   dynamic and contrasting roles in the food system and food culture of
   Poland. Owing to their inclusiveness and comparative popularity,
   open-air markets in Poland offer a universally accessible source of
   fresh produce. Furthermore, their strong social embeddedness increases
   their capacity to adapt to the current economic conditions and clients'
   needs. The social-network nature of cooperatives, meanwhile, results in
   limitations in the scope of their operation, yet at the same time leads
   to innovative solutions and political narratives that are critical
   toward the mainstream food system. The criticism of markets, on the
   other hand, is based on conservative resistance, related to everyday
   food practices, private experiences, cultural values, and nostalgia.},

   applying psychoanalytic ideas to account for American resistance to
   engage in a process of reconciliation. Contemporary authors claim that
   racial repair requires a moral and ethical acknowledgment of and
   responsibility for harms committed to African Americans. This article
   demonstrates, in addition, reparations as a psychological necessity.
   Racism, however, emphasizing the reality of racial difference,
   continues, as always, to serve as a powerful defense thwarting the
   reparative impulse. The result has been the securing of physical
   separation between Whites and Blacks and the persistence of psychic
   enmeshment. Absent the implementation of a politics of reparations,
   African Americans will never achieve externality, or independence, from
   the White mind.},

Abstract = {The United Nations (UN) is embarking on a new era of selective
   multilateralism, shaped by intergovernmental policy impasses and a
   growing reliance on corporate-led solutions to global problems. Multiple
   partnerships between corporations, philanthropic foundations and the UN
   have been established in recent years. Private funding from corporations
   and philanthropic foundations such as the Bill \& Melinda Gates
   Foundation for UN activities has increased steadily. The changes in
   funding practices have deep implications for global governance. Private
   funding runs the risk of turning UN agencies, funds and programmes into
   contractors for bilateral or public-private projects, eroding the
   multilateral character of the system and undermining democratic global
   governance.
   Policy Implications In order to reverse the current trend governments
   should take the following steps: they have to close the gap between the
   scale of the global problems and the (financial) capacity of the UN to
   solve them.
   They have to overcome `minilateralism' by reducing the share of non-core
   contributions and earmarked trust funds in UN finance.
   They have to reconsider the often unconditioned opening of the UN to the
   business sector and corporate philanthropy.
   They have to reverse the trend of outsourcing funding and
   decision-making to global partnerships outside the UN system.},

Abstract = {Using the little-known BBC Monitoring Service (BBCM) archives, this
   article shows how Romanian governments in the period 1938-1948 chose to
   represent themselves via the medium of radio to the rest of the world.
   After introducing the BBCM and discussing the problems of using such
   Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) material, the article shows how four
   key aspects of Romanian history were presented by the Romanian
   authorities at this time: the wartime expropriation of Jews prior to
   their planned deportation; Romania's changing of sides in the war as of
   23 August 1944; the return of Jewish deportees after the war; and the
   communist governments' changing attitudes towards Palestine/Israel and
   Jewish emigration. The article suggests that these sources are highly
   revealing but that they need to be used with considerable caution when
   trying to understand the tumultuous events of wartime Romanian history.},

Abstract = {Main aim of our research was to empirically test how the supervisor's
   authentic leadership relates to the four independent constructs
   representing followers' psychological empowerment in Slovenian local
   self-government institutions. We tested four hypotheses in one
   structural model by using structural equation modelling (SEM). The
   quantitative data for our analysis was collected through a survey on 169
   employees of Slovenian municipalities. Findings show that the
   supervisor's authentic leadership is positively related to the
   dimensions constructing followers' psychological empowerment; especially
   when it comes to self-determination and impact, less when it comes to
   meaning and at least when it comes to competence.},

Abstract = {The e-government has been profoundly changing the expectations of
   citizens towards local governments worldwide. Policyholders in Serbia
   have been very active proponents of the implementation of novel
   e-services in local governments. However, the capacities for full
   implementation of e-governments are still humble. This paper reports on
   findings from the study on transparency and online visibility,
   responsiveness to e-mails, and interactivity of local governments,
   especially with regard to financial inquires. The study used a
   multi-step methodology to examine the proactive, reactive and
   interactive transparency of 169 local governments in Serbia. The results
   indicate that local governments are relatively transparent, but
   responsiveness and interactivity are far below expectations.},

Abstract = {The Katangese artisanal mining sector has grown spectacularly since the
   late 1990s. Faced with political instability and economic crisis, tens
   of thousands of men have moved to the mining areas in order to find new
   sources of income. This article offers a detailed ethnographic
   description of how male migrant workers experience and cope with the
   challenging realities of life on the mines against the backdrop of
   recent changes in Katanga's political economy. More specifically, it
   examines the relationship between money, migration and masculinity
   through an extended case study of a money dispute among a group of
   artisanal miners working in the Kalabi mine near Lwambo, a small town
   situated 20 kilometres north of Likasi. It is found that the conspicuous
   consumption of money plays a vital role in the mining subculture; that
   credit and debt dominate life on the mines; and that artisanal mining
   has given rise to significant changes in gender relations and household
   organisation.},

Abstract = {In an important article on the state of European Union (EU) foreign
   policy research, Keuleers, Fonck and Keukeleire show that academics
   excessively focus on the study of the EU foreign policy system and EU
   implementation rather than the consequences of EU foreign policy for
   recipient countries. While the article is empirical, based on a dataset
   of 451 published articles on EU foreign policy, the normative message is
   that it is time to stop navel-gazing' and pay more attention to those on
   the receiving end of EU foreign policy. We welcome this contribution,
   but wonder why certain research questions have been privileged over
   others. We argue that this has primarily to do with the predominant
   puzzles of the time. We also invite Keuleers, Fonck and Keukeleire to
   make a theoretical case for a research agenda with more attention to
   outside-in approaches. We conclude by briefly reflecting on future
   research agendas in EU foreign policy.},

Title = {Down the Rathole? Public Support for US Foreign Aid},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL STUDIES QUARTERLY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {61},
Number = {2},
Pages = {442-454},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Americans think the US foreign aid budget is far too generous. Can
   information change those views? We identified ten prominent arguments
   about aid in public discussion, five positive and five negative. In a
   survey experiment, we exposed respondents to one of those arguments with
   five associated facts. Most of the arguments in favor of aid made
   respondents more supportive, while most of the arguments against aid
   made them less supportive. Arguments that focused either positively or
   negatively on economic development in recipient countries or advancing
   US interests made little difference. In contrast, arguments about the
   domestic costs of foreign aid or those that invoked moral considerations
   like recipient need or corruption had fairly large effects on attitudes.
   The most successful argument, on the low cost of aid, reduced aid
   opposition from 67 to 28 percent. When respondents saw both pro and con
   arguments together, however, arguments generally lost their efficacy.
   The only exception was the argument about the low cost of aid, which
   altered opinions in some ways-even when countered with anti-aid
   arguments. Our results are somewhat surprising given the conventional
   wisdom that people are motivated reasoners who reject new information
   that does not conform to their worldview.},

Abstract = {Villa Portales is an icon of modern architecture and urban planning of
   the 1950s and 1960s in Santiago de Chile. It embodies the political and
   institutional project of the time, which sought to respond to the need
   to establish a balance-although tenuous-in a fragile and strained
   economic and political system. This fact is crucial to understanding its
   sociospatial objective, the administrative model it employed, and
   especially the crisis it has endured. The testimony of current Villa
   Portales dwellers points to a deterioration of its residents' quality of
   life beginning in the 1980s with the changes in the role of the state
   introduced by the military dictatorship, the privatization of public
   services, and the termination of the Caja de Prevision de Empleados
   Particulares (Private Employees' Pension Fund). Despite all this, the
   community was able to make this space a place of resistance and new
   meaning based on the sense of belonging arising from its architecture
   and its history.},

Abstract = {The home states of multinational enterprises have in recent years sought
   to use public regulation to fill the gaps left by the absence of a
   binding labour standards framework in international law. This article
   examines recent home state initiatives to address forced labour, human
   trafficking, and slavery in global supply chains, and their interactions
   with private governance initiatives. Focusing on a case study of the
   2015 UK Modern Slavery Act and 2010 UK Bribery Act, we analyse two
   distinct legislative approaches that policy makers have used to promote
   corporate accountability within global supply chains and explore the
   varied impacts that these approaches have on corporate behaviour.
   Empirically, we analyse codes of conduct, annual CSR reports, and
   supplier terms and conditions for 25 FTSE 100 companies to shed light
   into the impact of the legislation on corporate behaviour. We find that
   legislation that creates criminal corporate liability appears to spur
   deeper changes to corporate strategy, and argue that in the case of the
   Modern Slavery Act, the triumph of voluntary reporting over more
   stringent public labour standards seems to have undermined the
   effectiveness of recent governance initiatives to address forced labour
   in global supply chains.},

Abstract = {Are certain ethnic cleavages more conflict-prone than others? While only
   few scholars focus on the contents of ethnicity, most of those who do
   argue that political violence is more likely to occur along religious
   divisions than linguistic ones. We challenge this claim by analyzing the
   path from linguistic differences to ethnic civil war along three
   theoretical steps: (1) the perception of grievances by group members,
   (2) rebel mobilization, and (3) government accommodation of rebel
   demands. Our argument is tested with a new data set of ethnic cleavages
   that records multiple linguistic and religious segments for ethnic
   groups from 1946 to 2009. Adopting a relational perspective, we assess
   ethnic differences between potential challengers and the politically
   dominant group in each country. Our findings indicate that intrastate
   conflict is more likely within linguistic dyads than among religious
   ones. Moreover, we find no support for the thesis that Muslim groups are
   particularly conflict-prone.},

Abstract = {We study the factors that influence citizen support for defense spending
   in fourteen democracies over the period 2004-2013. We pose two research
   questions. First, what factors influence citizen support for war and
   military force? We refer to this as the acceptability of war. Second, in
   addition to the acceptability of war, what other factors affect support
   for defense spending? Our principal finding is that citizen acceptance
   of war and support for defense spending are most influenced by basic
   beliefs and values. Gender also has a strong negative influence on
   attitudes toward war and thus indirectly lowers support for defense
   spending among women. Attitudes toward war and defense spending are also
   sometimes influenced by short-term threats and by alliance
   considerations, but the effects are not as substantively meaningful. We
   conclude with a summary of the results and a discussion of the
   implications for theory and policy.},

Abstract = {Bridging existing streams of fiscal and social policy research, this
   article lays the foundations for a fiscal-centred perspective on welfare
   state development and restructuring. This perspective is grounded in two
   interlocking claims. The first is that social insurance systems financed
   by contributions can be used by state and non-state actors to advance
   their fiscal goals, beyond the financing of social benefits and
   services. The second is that, through different mechanisms such as
   legitimacy production, institutional design, and coalition building, the
   design and management of social insurance contribution policies for such
   fiscal purposes can have a direct impact on social programmes.},

Abstract = {The current process of devolving powers within England constitutes a
   significant change of governance arrangements. This process of
   devolution has been widely criticised for including insufficient
   consultation. This paper assesses whether that criticism is fair.
   Modifying Archon Fung's framework for the analysis of public
   participation mechanisms, we begin by considering whether the depth of
   public engagement has been limited. Then, by comparing these
   consultation practices with other examples (including one we have
   ourselves trialled in pilot experiments), we find that deeper forms of
   public engagement would have been both possible (though at some
   financial cost) and productive.},

Abstract = {We examine the degree to which party leaders dominate their parties over
   time and across countries and analyse how leadership domination relates
   to formal aspects of party organisation. Moreover, we analyse whether
   antidotes against leadership domination - widening the selectorate and
   increasing the membership - explain change in leadership domination. For
   this purpose, we use a new dataset that brings together different
   sources of party data over time and between countries. We find that
   leadership domination indeed has increased over time, but still a lot of
   variation exists between parties. We also demonstrate that widening the
   selectorate - for example, letting members elect the party leader - and
   increasing membership boosts leadership domination. In other words, the
   antidotes against leadership domination do not work.},

Abstract = {Can we talk about transatlantic democracy promotion? By addressing this
   issue from the perspective of transatlantic security communities, this
   article accepts that there are areas of convergence between the EU and
   the USA which might over time lead to a meaningful transatlantic
   partnership. But joint transatlantic democracy promotion is still only
   embryonic and only operates when both parties are faced with a crisis.
   Thus, while we can still speak of a transatlantic security community, a
   transatlantic democracy promotion community has yet to come into being
   and there is little indication that it will do so in the future.},

Abstract = {This article describes and explains a significant tightening in bank
   capital regulation in the United Kingdom since the 2008 financial
   crisis. The banks fiercely resisted the new capital regulations but in a
   novel theoretical contribution we argue that the structural power of
   business was reduced due to the changing ideas of state leaders, by
   changing institutional arrangements within the state and by wider open
   politicisation of banking reform.},

Abstract = {Voluntary regulatory programmes embody the complex interactions that
   exist between public organizations and nongovernmental entities in
   contemporary public administration. This article draws attention to
   regulatee choice' in certification programmes, in which programme
   participants choose from among certifier alternatives. In the context of
   US organic regulation, regulatee choice is examined through the factors
   that farmers weigh when selecting from among public, nonprofit, and
   private certifier options. Drawing on a nation-wide survey of organic
   farmers, regulatee choice between public, nonprofit, and private
   certifiers is found to be differentiated by the importance that
   regulatees ascribe to certifier reputations and service offerings, as
   well as regulatee desires to support the organic movement through
   certification. Regulatee choice between public and nonprofit certifiers
   is further differentiated by the importance regulatees place on
   certifiers' perceived regulatory expertise. The article discusses
   explanations for the findings and the contribution of regulatee choice
   research.},

Volume = {19},

Abstract = {This article examines bank lobbying in the Basel Committee on Banking
   Supervision (BCBS). While excessive bank lobbying is routinely linked to
   weakened banking regulations, we still know little about bank
   mobilization patterns. In particular, when and why do some banks lobby
   the BCBS while others do not? I argue that the decision to lobby is a
   function of two factors: banks' organizational characteristics and
   domestic banking regulations. I test my argument using a unique dataset
   of over 33,000 banks worldwide during the period in which Basel III was
   negotiated. My findings confirm a pronounced bias in bank mobilization
   patterns toward wealthy, internationally active banks. I also find that
   banks facing more stringent banking regulations at home tend to lobby
   the BCBS in an effort to level the playing field with international
   competitors. This effect is particularly salient for stringent
   regulations on banking activities as well as higher capital adequacy
   requirements.},

Abstract = {This article shows how state politics of (re)allocation of rights and
   resources to social groups within a society (recognition) are
   constructive of distinct abilities to shape the fate of the political
   economy of natural resources (citizenship) and of specific images of
   self (identities). It departs from the politics of recognition applied
   by the Forest Service to private merchants and forest villagers in
   Eastern Senegal. Herein, I theorise citizenship and identity as effects
   of the politics of recognition and redistribution, emphasising that
   identities are culturally bounded categories, but are also products
   (through reclassification) of public institutions' discourses, legal
   ordinances and practices.},

Abstract = {Since the emergence of the international human rights regime, after the
   Second World War, governments appear to have moved toward accepting
   increasingly broad rights. The present study seeks to explain this
   important shift. It draws upon a theoretical framework focusing on
   actors' strategic responses to normative pressures. We argue that
   government officials involved in normative bargaining over new human
   rights are more likely to adopt strategies of broadening norms than
   simply yielding, challenging or narrowing them. We seek to assess the
   plausibility of this argument by focusing on the history of the right to
   development and the right to democracy. We contrast the debates
   surrounding these rights in academic circles to those among
   practitioners, in the UN. We show how broadening strategies in the
   latter circles have led to the empowerment of these two rights and even
   to strong associations between them.},

Title = {Altering Capabilities or Imposing Costs? Intervention Strategy and Civil
   War Outcomes},

Abstract = {How do military interventions affect the outcome of civil wars? The
   diversity of military interventions makes it difficult to answer this
   question; their variation means that they do not affect civil wars in a
   straightforward way. In particular, strategy and timing play a pivotal
   role in determining the effect of an intervention. Thus, I isolate three
   intervention strategies: indirect (bolstering the capabilities of the
   supported side), direct-conventional (degrading the capabilities of the
   opposition), and direct-unconventional (imposing costs on the
   opposition). I evaluate the impact of these strategies on the outcome of
   civil wars using a dataset of all civil wars from 1944 to 2007. My
   analysis reveals that the efficacy of intervention strategies varies
   over time. Third-party support for rebel organizations is most effective
   during a critical window early in a civil war. In contrast, direct
   military assistance for the government increases the odds of a
   government victory only once a civil war becomes protracted. It also
   reduces the odds of a negotiated outcome to the conflict, whereas
   indirect support for the government proves most effective early in the
   war. This work demonstrates that pooling all interventions together
   risks overlooking important differences in their effects on civil wars.
   It also carries with it important implications for states considering
   interventions in civil wars.},

Abstract = {Transitional justice measures are frequently expected to help promote
   peace in conflict-affected countries, through measures that rely heavily
   upon legal or legalized processes such as trials and commissions of
   inquiry. They are also often expected to influence or promote reform in
   legal processes and institutions, including the judiciary, the
   constitution, and legislation, in ways that are expected to help promote
   peace in future post-conflict states. However, not only is the evidence
   of the role of law in promoting peace through transitional justice a
   mixed one, but more importantly, the emphasis on transitional justice
   often overlooks the ways in which law is expected to play a role in
   promoting peace more broadly and in ways intertwined with transitional
   justice, through rule of law promotion, often by international actors,
   and through peace agreements that include specific institutional and
   governance measures, including power-sharing arrangements. These rule of
   law and governance measures similarly have a mixed record with regard to
   their effects for either short-or long-term peace. Closer analysis of
   the role of law and legalized mechanisms in producing or supporting
   peace is needed, including analysis of the types of law and mechanisms
   deployed. Drawing on fieldwork in Sierra Leone, Uganda, Colombia, Kenya,
   Sri Lanka, and Sudan, among others, this paper will elaborate on the
   challenges of using law for peace via governance and rule of law
   measures, as well as through transitional justice.},

Abstract = {While nonprofit organizations are frequently understood as influencing
   policy through advocacy, the policy influence of nonprofit service
   provision has not been widely acknowledged within the context of the
   policy process. In spite of this oversight, nonprofit organizations have
   significant discretion over the publicly funded services they provide,
   and public policy is continuously shaped through nonprofit service
   delivery. Furthermore, nonprofit organizations frequently embody the
   roles of interest group and policy implementer simultaneously. The
   advocate-provider framework presented here situates these concurrent
   nonprofit functions within the policy process context. This framework
   connects research and theory across policy process, public management,
   and nonprofit management scholarship. The advocate-provider perspective
   challenges assumptions from existing scholarship while highlighting the
   need for future research that jointly investigates nonprofit advocacy,
   public service provision, and policy processes.},

Abstract = {Despite the International Criminal Court's increased prominence in
   international politics, there remains marked variation in states'
   cooperation with the ICC. This article asks why do states cooperate with
   the ICC following an indictment, arrest warrant or request for
   information, and how do these patterns of cooperation affect the Court's
   ability to constrain state behavior? Using comparative case studies from
   Kenya, Cote d'Ivoire, and Libya, we suggest that states' cooperation
   with the ICC is a function of domestic political calculations, tempered
   by states' international partners and ambitions and the ICC's own
   learning process.},

Abstract = {Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, and Queer (LGBTQ) people have
   achieved victories in obtaining equal rights in some countries, but most
   states deny these rights and actively discriminate against LGBTQ people.
   This research presents one of the first attempts to assess
   cross-nationally discrimination against LGBTQ people through a
   discrimination index comprised of three components: criminalization and
   punishment of homosexuality, rights denied to LGBTQ people, and the

Abstract = {Policy design and public management should be tightly connected, so
   implemented public policies achieve intended outcomes. Yet policy
   designers often pursue their activities with limited awareness of how
   citizens and service managers experience current public programs. A
   focus on creating public value offers a way to tighten the connection
   between policy design and public management. Recent discussions of
   public value have emphasized three aspects of public management:
   delivering services, achieving social outcomes, and maintaining trust
   and legitimacy. Within those discussions, the efforts of policy
   designers have been underplayed. We explore the implications of the
   public value approach for policy design. Pursuit of public value calls
   for policy designers to listen closely to stakeholders, engage them in
   creative conversations, and draw on their situated expertise to guide
   policy development. We consider how explicit treatment of public value
   creation as a policy goal can improve the fit between original policy
   intentions and the delivery of public services. Our augmented model of
   public value creation offers both a new direction for empirical studies
   of the nexus between public policy and public management and a new
   perspective on what it means to be an effective policy designer.},

Abstract = {This work tries to demonstrate that it is possible to apply a
   quantifiable evaluation criterion to citizen participation initiatives
   using the information available on municipal web portal. We begin with a
   literature review in order to define the concept of Citizen
   Participation and its role in local administration, along with
   determining the appropriate contents that should be available on
   municipal websites. Then we go on to design an indicator to measure
   level of citizen participation on the websites and the subsequent
   testing of the websites of various cities in the world in order to
   verify their validity.
   The results obtained show comparable quantitative values in spite of the
   cultural, geographic and legislative differences of the cities chosen.},

Abstract = {Our contribution deals with the emotional and cognitive foundations of
   resistance to persuasive information. We rely on an original
   quasi-experimental protocol that simulates the flow of information and
   the respondents' reactions to persuasive arguments on global climate
   change. Respondents in a representative sample (N = 604) were asked if
   they supported reduction of economic activity to reduce climate warming
   and were then provided, based on their support or disapproval for this
   first argument, with counterattitudinal arguments to test their
   resistance to persuasion. This article highlights that sophistication
   strengthens resistance to persuasion, whereas anxiety has a double
   effect: directly, it decreases resistance; indirectly, it interacts with
   political sophistication and makes sophisticates less likely to resist
   persuasion when facing arguments inconsistent with their previous
   beliefs. Nonanxious citizens, in turn, are more likely to resist
   persuasion when their political sophistication increases. We also
   provide evidence that the joint effect of anxiety and sophistication is
   moderated by the ideological identification of respondents.},

Abstract = {In anarchic settings, potential rivals can be dragged into arms races
   degenerating in open wars out of mutual suspicion. We propose a novel
   commitment device for contestants to avoid both arming and fighting. We
   assume that the military decides the armament levels of a country, while
   the civilian decides whether to attack a rival country. When these
   decision-making bodies perfectly communicate, the decision makers are
   unable to credibly communicate to their foe their willingness not to arm
   and not to attack, thus implying that war ensues. With imperfect
   information, however, peace may ensue as countries credibly signal to
   their rival a more peaceful stance since contestants are more reluctant
   to enter in an armed confrontation with a potentially understaffed army.
   Using data on the 1975 to 2001 period, we provide supportive evidence
   that in countries where the head of the state or the defense minister
   are military officers, and are therefore better informed of their
   armies' fighting preparedness, the likelihood of observing an
   international conflict is higher.},

Journal = {SOUTH EUROPEAN SOCIETY AND POLITICS},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {22},
Number = {4},
Pages = {405-426},
Abstract = {It has been abundantly argued that the Spanish transition was based on
   an implicit `pact of silence' by which the main political forces
   accepted to leave the thorniest aspects of past behind as the only way
   to peacefully construct a democratic future. And it has been widely
   accepted that Spanish society subscribed to this. This article defends a
   more nuanced version of this state-level agreement by focusing on
   memory-related initiatives at the local level. By doing so, it poses
   some challenges to existing literature on the politics of memory in
   general and the Spanish transition in particular.},

Abstract = {We used survey data and collected data from the online social network
   Twitter between October 5, 2015 to November 9, 2015 to provide an
   overview related to political participation in Mexico. With the former
   we provided a qualitative assessment of participation by examining
   electoral participation, participation between regions, interest in
   politics and sources of political information. With Twitter data, we
   described the intensity of participation, we identified locations of
   high activity and identified movements including agencies behind them.
   We compare and contrast participation in Mexico to its counterpart in
   Twitter. We show that participation seems to be decreasing. However,
   participation through Twitter seems to be increasing. Our research
   points towards the emergence of Twitter as a significant platform in
   terms of political participation in Mexico. Our study analyses the
   impact of how different agencies related to social movements can enhance
   participation through Twitter. We show that emergent topics are
   important because they could help to explore how politics becomes of
   public interest.},

Volume = {33},

Pages = {184-209},
Abstract = {This article examines the fall of Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych
   as a failure of authoritarian learning. When confronted by the
   Euromaidan protests in November 2013, Yanukovych responded in a manner
   similar to that seen during the Arab Uprisings of 2011, attempting to
   adopt a series of counter-protest strategies (promise, repress, bribe,
   mobilise, divide) which preserved most Arab governments against mass
   protests. However, the strategies which worked in 2011 in the Middle
   East were not applicable in Ukraine in 2013-2014, as structural and
   political constraints within Ukrainian society made these strategies
   ineffective, at best, and counterproductive, at worse.},

Abstract = {In this article, I argue that hybridization is a contingent result of
   the dynamics of some conflicts but not others. In particular, faced with
   opponents with great power, weaker powers seek a situation of asymmetry
   to gain victory. Drawing on within-case analysis of the conduct of war
   during the past thirty years in Afghanistan, I demonstrate that what we
   now consider to be ``hybrid{''} represents an important continuity and
   strategic option in Afghan warfare. Still, the analysis also
   demonstrates that choosing ``hybrid{''} has not been a strategy that has
   worked. Hezb-i-Islami's rather limited attempt for conventionalization
   of the war against the forces of Dostum and Massoud in 1992 failed and
   the Taliban's more far-reaching attempt for conventionalization has so
   far also failed to reap strategic success. This suggests that the threat
   of hybrid war is inflated.},

Abstract = {Does European identity increase politicians' support for compliance with
   European Union (EU) law? Adopting a political psychology approach, this
   study for the first time examines the effect of European identity on
   politicians' attitudes toward compliance with EU law. I offer a
   cognitive-interactionist theory and argue that European identity,
   compliance costs and the interaction between identity and costs shape
   actors' support for compliance. Using an original survey of German
   parliamentarians, I show that European identity and the level of
   compliance costs are both important predictors of compliance attitudes,
   and European identity moderates the effect of costs on support for
   compliance. This study facilitates a new research agenda by bringing the
   individual politician to the study of compliance with EU law, and builds
   a bridge between instrumental and normative models of compliance.},

Abstract = {In June 2016, the United Kingdom voted to leave the European Union,
   creating massive political turmoil and controversy. Our aim in this
   paper is to contribute to a discussion about how to analyze such
   critical moments in policy and politics. Rather than searching for one
   `real' cause (whether the micro-politics of the Conservative Party or
   popular disaffection from neo-liberalism), we offer a form of
   conjunctural analysis that highlights issues of multiplicity and
   heterogeneity. We sketch this approach and then explore two puzzles that
   have particular pertinence for Critical Policy Studies. One is the
   puzzle of populism: how new imaginings and representations of the
   `British people' were constructed. The second is the puzzle of
   expertise; how antipathy to `expert' knowledge was shaped to challenge
   British and European `elites'. Conjunctural analysis, we argue, offers a
   vital means of engaging with such puzzles, and of grasping the
   heterogeneous and contradictory forces, tendencies, and pressures that
   enabled Brexit.},

   policy formulation for the financial sector (2003-2015)},
Journal = {REVISTA BRASILEIRA DE POLITICA INTERNACIONAL},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {60},
Number = {1},
Abstract = {At the start of the 21st century, there was a reconfiguration of the
   Brazilian domestic political dynamic, as its actors gradually became
   more interested in the formulation of foreign policy and tried to
   safeguard their interests. When analysing the country's foreign policy
   for the financial sector, it becomes quite clear that to consider
   foreign policy simply as one type of public policy is insufficient to
   assess its decision-making process. This paper seeks to contribute to
   the debate by arguing that the analysis of foreign policy should be
   carried out by taking into consideration specific issue-areas. This
   paper explores the movement to rearrange domestic decision power,
   seeking to gain leverage in international negotiations.},

Abstract = {Twenty-five years ago, as preferential trade agreements started to
   proliferate, Jagdish Bhagwati sounded the `spaghetti bowl' alarm,
   arguing that the ensuing complexity would create inefficiencies in the
   international system and challenges for firms navigating overlapping
   rules. This article seeks to update and complement Bhagwati's thesis by
   asking if proliferating `deep' trade agreements add a new dimension of
   complexity to this picture. This article shows that the early answer to
   this question is `not yet', as governments have discovered that
   prospective conflicts with existing or simultaneous commitments limit
   just how deep the provisions of an agreement can be. Governments
   managing multiple deep agreements play a variation on Putnam's two-level
   game. As Putnam theorized, these governments reconcile domestic
   interests with international opportunities in formulating their
   strategies. However, ensuring compatibility across various, sometimes
   competing international opportunities is also a key consideration.
   Canada's concurrent participation in the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP)
   and the Canada-European Union Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement
   (CETA) provides a crucial exploratory case study.},

Abstract = {Cities have come to play an important role in the global governance of
   climate change, and are increasingly recognized as a crucial component
   of the post-Paris climate regime. Based in part on their jurisdictional
   authority, shared commitment to action and disdain for negotiations,
   there is considerable optimism that cities can meaningfully contribute
   to the creation of an effective bottom-up global response. Focusing on
   the processes through which cities themselves are being steered towards
   particular actions and objectives, attention is directed towards the
   recent explosion of efforts to engender coordinated efforts and
   activities between cities through the conceptual lens of orchestration.
   The practice of orchestration is unpacked, and the importance of
   identifying who orchestrates, how, and in the service of which/whose
   objectives is highlighted. Thus, analysis is oriented towards the
   politics and power dynamics of orchestration, and a step is taken
   towards critically assessing the promise and potential of ongoing
   activities in the realm of global urban climate governance.},

Title = {Cooperation, information, and keeping the peace: Civilian engagement
   with peacekeepers in Haiti},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF PEACE RESEARCH},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {54},
Number = {1},
Pages = {64-79},

Abstract = {Cultivating cooperation with local populations is necessary for
   peacekeeping operations to effectively prevent and reduce violence. To
   accomplish their missions in complex foreign theaters of operation,
   peacekeepers must solicit information about local political actors,
   social networks, and violence. Under what conditions do local
   populations cooperate with United Nations peacekeepers? How does
   exposure to peacekeeping security activities, relief activities, or
   abuse - three of the primary ways that local communities experience
   peacekeepers - affect the likelihood that individuals cooperate with
   peacekeepers by providing information to them? Using an original survey
   of a random sample of residents of metropolitan Port-au-Prince, Haiti,
   we show that people who are exposed to security and relief activities by
   the United Nations peacekeeping operation, MINUSTAH, have more positive
   opinions of how effective they are, and are more willing to cooperate
   with peacekeepers by providing them with information. On the other hand,
   exposure to abuse dramatically undermines civilian opinions of how
   effective, benevolent, and abusive peacekeepers are but has a smaller

   environment: Evidence from a Swedish survey experiment},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL POLITICS},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {26},
Number = {2},
Pages = {278-300},
Abstract = {Years of research show that left-leaning individuals are more supportive
   of environmental policies than right-leaning individuals. The
   explanation for the lower level of support among right-leaning
   individuals is their stronger preference for economic growth and lower
   acceptance of intervention in markets. However, recent cross-national
   studies have questioned whether the effect of ideology on environmental
   support is universal. A Swedish survey experiment shows that the effect
   of ideology varies greatly depending on how individuals think about the
   environment. Specifically, it demonstrates that if environmental support
   is contrasted with economic growth, then the effect of ideology is
   stronger as opposed to when environmental support is not juxtaposed with
   economic growth. Furthermore, among people who strongly perceive the
   environment as a left-right issue, there is a larger divide between left
   and right.},

Abstract = {An unprecedented expansion of global anti-terrorist policing took place
   after 1900, although the security forces projected outside their borders
   by Russia, Italy, Germany, Austria-Hungary, Spain, and Argentina
   displayed an enormous diversity in size and effectiveness. Crucial to
   successful policing was how these countries improved their intelligence
   through recruiting and handling informers, maintained secrecy and good
   relations with local police, and handled the media. The British approach
   to anarchist control was arguably the most successful. Italian
   international policing was the most far-reaching, while the United
   States long remained the world's most under-policed large country. On
   examination, the view that anti-anarchist policing was a case of
   conservative imperial regimes versus the Western democracies loses
   validity. During this period, a general trend saw the transfer of
   anarchist surveillance from the hands of diplomats into those of
   interior ministry officials and the police, all in the name of greater
   centralization, professionalization, and efficiency.},

Abstract = {A growing global trend of judicializing environmental policy has been
   received with optimism, and in the context of democracies in transition,
   many have found in an active Supreme Court a potential solution to
   political impasses. However, as the judiciary is the least democratic of
   the three branches of government, what impact does judicialization have
   on democratic accountability? We claim that judicialization generates
   accountability losses in two ways. First, theoretically, when the Court
   takes on managerial functions that extend beyond its adjudicative role,
   it distorts its horizontal accountability functions. Second,
   empirically, when the Court becomes involved in policy formulation,
   effectiveness is not guaranteed yet there are no vertical accountability
   sanctions the polity can impose on judges. We illustrate this argument
   with an emblematic and instructive case of judicialization of
   environmental policy in Argentina. We conclude that judicialization to
   remedy policy failures undermines democratic accountability.},

Abstract = {Ghana has conducted several successful elections since 1992, but the
   country continues to face many threats of widespread violence due to the
   recurrent nature of micro-level electoral violence and the existence of
   vulnerabilities such as political patronage, politics of exclusion,
   winner-takes-all electoral system and ethnic cleavages. While these
   factors have been used to explain the causes of electoral violence,
   issue framing by political elites and its connection to electoral
   violence have not been adequately examined. To better understand this
   phenomenon, this article draws on the concept of framing to underscore
   the argument that issue framing and reframing by political elites tend
   to shape micro-level electoral violence in Ghana.},

Title = {A software implementation and case study application of Lempp's
   propositional model of conflict resolution},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONFLICT MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {28},
Number = {5},
Pages = {563-591},
Abstract = {Purpose - The starting point of this paper is the propositional model of
   conflict resolution which was presented and critically discussed in
   Lempp (2016). Based on this model, a software implementation, called
   ProCON, is introduced and applied to three scenarios. The purpose of the
   paper is to demonstrate how ProCON can be used by negotiators and to
   evaluate ProCON's practical usefulness as an automated negotiation
   support system.
   Design/methodology/approach - The propositional model is implemented as
   a computer program. The implementation consists of an input module to
   enter data about a negotiation situation, an output module to generate
   outputs (e.g. a list of all incompatible goal pairs or a graph
   displaying the compatibility relations between goals) and a queries
   module to run queries on particular aspects of a negotiation situation.
   Findings - The author demonstrates how ProCON can be used to capture a
   simple two-party, non-iterative prisoner's dilemma, applies ProCON to a
   contract negotiation between a supplier and a purchaser of goods, and
   uses it to model the negotiations between the Iranian and six Western
   governments over Iran's nuclear enrichment and stockpiling capacities.
   Research limitations/implications - A limitation of the current version
   of ProCON arises from the fact that the computational complexity of the
   underlying algorithm is EXPTIME (i.e. the computing time required to
   process information in ProCON grows exponentially with respect to the
   number of issues fed into the program). This means that computing time
   can be quite long for even relatively small negotiation scenarios.
   Practical implications - The three case studies demonstrate how ProCON
   can provide support for negotiators in a wide range of multi-party,
   multi-issue negotiations. In particular, ProCON can be used to visualise
   the compatibility relations between parties' goals, generate possible
   outcomes and solutions and evaluate solutions regarding the extent to
   which they satisfy the parties' goals.
   Originality/value - In contrast to standard game-theoretic models of
   negotiation, ProCON does not require users to provide data about their
   preferences across their goals. Consequently, it can operate in
   situations where no information about the parties' goal preferences is
   available. Compared to game-theoretical models, ProCON represents a more
   general approach of looking at possible outcomes in the context of
   negotiations.},

Pages = {12-20},
Abstract = {Research has shown that competition over resources, overlapping identity
   cleavages, and weak state institutions constitute important causal
   determinants of ethnic violence. Critical in identifying those factors
   have been research innovations that treat ethnic identities as political
   tools rather than primordial divisions. Thus, theoretical developments
   that consider ethnicity to be fluid and constructed, data sets that
   account for the actual political importance of group identities, and new
   methods that add geographic and psychological information to ethnic
   labels all constitute important breakthroughs. Yet, the study of ethnic
   conflict remains constrained by a tendency to treat as constant the
   political interests of actors in very different identity contexts.},

Journal = {POLICY STUDIES},

Abstract = {Implementing policies to return water to the environment is challenging.
   We developed an approach to integrate ecological responses with river
   management models to provide a link between flow and ecology. This paper
   aims to summarize the findings of a multifaceted project bringing
   together multiple lines of evidence to achieve a proof-of-concept
   approach for optimizing water use to support water policy and management
   decisions. We developed an eco-hydrology model that represents rivers,
   water storages, operational constraints, flow management, an ecological
   response and consumptive irrigation demands, which is linked to climate.
   To demonstrate the proof of concept, we describe a case study where
   modelling optimization seeks solutions to minimize terrestrial
   vegetation encroachment (an ecological response) and maximize irrigation
   net value through flow management. The solutions provide a range of
   alternative optimal' management options to consider. Ultimately,
   hydrological modelling that integrates both consumptive use and
   ecological response simultaneously is important to enhance stakeholder
   understanding of the complexities and trade-offs involved in
   implementing different decisions. Although proof of concept at this
   stage, the approaches offer potential for integration of river
   management models and quantitative ecological response models (derived
   by considering available evidence from many sources) to support water
   policy and management decisions.},

Title = {Terrorist Learning: A Look at the Adoption of Political Kidnappings in
   Six Countries, 1968-1990},
Journal = {STUDIES IN CONFLICT \& TERRORISM},

Volume = {40},
Number = {7, SI},
Pages = {539-556},
Abstract = {This article studies the epidemic of kidnappings across six countries
   between 1968 and 1990. The goal is to identify those factors that
   determine the operational decisions made by terrorists. Why and how do
   terrorists decide to engage in certain types of actions but not others?
   The article discusses a number of scholarly approaches, and the
   variables these studies have put forward to explain the decision-making
   processes within terrorist organizations. The argument made here is that
   the groups' ideological preferences, strategic analysis, and need to
   attract media attention did not appear to exert much influence in the
   terrorists' decision to kidnap. Organizational resources and the nature
   of the security environment in which the terrorists operated had some
   bearing. However, kidnappings became attractive when terrorists made a
   pragmatic evaluation of the reaction by governments and the public and
   consequently of the costs or benefits of a particular course of action.
   The decision to carry out a campaign of kidnappings, or to abstain from
   kidnapping, should be interpreted as clear evidence of terrorist
   learning. Two types of learning appear to have influenced the adoption
   of kidnappings: learning by observing others and learning by doing.},

Abstract = {The EU has become increasingly involved in enforcing European Union (EU)
   law, including directly vis-a-vis private actors. (Multilevel
   implementation) research has so far neglected the question of what role
   it is necessary for the EU to play in this direct enforcement of EU law
   in order to promote the implementation of EU policies. Given the purpose
   of this collection of works to discuss innovative approaches in
   multilevel implementation, this contribution unravels three of the EU's
   direct enforcement strategies. It provides original data in relation to
   proliferating EU entities with direct enforcement powers and to EU
   enforcement networks, as well as discussing the EU's growing influence
   over national direct enforcement via EU hard, soft and case law. It
   outlines the problem-solving potential of such enforcement strategies
   and signals the challenges that they bring along. The aim is to urge and
   facilitate further research on the EU's (direct) enforcement strategies,
   their legitimacy, effectiveness and operation.},

Abstract = {Antiretroviral treatment (ART) has become a ubiquitous feature of South
   African life. By early 2015, three million people had begun ART in South
   Africa. In the light of widespread positive responses to the
   availability of treatment, early ethnographies that stressed suspicion,
   fear, and resentment need to be revisited. In this article, I re-examine
   my own data on an early encounter between the technologies of ART and
   the population of a rural district in the Eastern Cape province. I also
   return to Didier Fassin's ethnography in which he placed ordinary
   people's responses to AIDS in a history of suspicion and resentment. The
   article focuses in particular on the support groups that ART users
   formed and argues that they were the sites of creative responses to ART
   in which ordinary people, primarily women, bent the new technologies and
   esoteric languages they encountered to an array of endogenous purposes.
   The article concludes that ART was incorporated into a politics of
   hopeful expectation rather than a politics of resentment.},

Abstract = {The final chapter on public decision-making extends our empirical
   inquiry into China's consultative decision-making process by addressing
   selection biases and mapping causal mechanisms. By comparing three
   provinces, each with varying capacity and resources for dealing with
   policy challenges, we clarify the conditions under which Chinese
   policymakers rely on public consultation as well as the conditions under
   which consultation contributes to more effective policy choices. Looking
   closely at Sichuan, Jiangsu, and Chongqing we find that public
   participation is tool of necessity, not convenience. That is,
   policymakers turn to consultation when faced with the sort of policy
   challenges for which traditional top-down authority is ill-equipped to
   deal with. For example, policymakers in both Sichuan and Jiangsu
   experimented with consultation to resolve labor and environmental policy
   challenges resulting from mass privatization and disasters, both natural
   and man-made. By contrast, Chongqing's municipal authorities relied on
   large public expenditures and propaganda to win over public opinion.},

Abstract = {Unlike the European Union's (EU) negotiations with the US and Canada,
   the Japan-EU Economic Partnership Agreement (EPA) negotiations have
   encountered few critics from civil society organisations (CSO) and
   therefore became an exceptional' case for the EU. There are four
   reasons. The first is that the main focus of the EPA is still on old'
   issues such as tariff reduction of motorcars, electronics and
   agricultural products. The second is the relative lack of innovative
   proposals compared to the American and Canadian case. The third is
   Japan's lack of ability and competitiveness to export its regulations,
   making Japan's attitude relatively defensive. Finally, the modest scale
   of Japan-EU trade compared to transatlantic trade. These four reasons
   made the level of contestation relatively low, but this has not led to
   an acceleration of concluding the EPA. Uncertainty caused by Trump and
   the Brexit referendum have made Japan's trade policy complicated and
   unpredictable.},

Pages = {89-102},
Abstract = {Our main objective in this paper is to evaluate the possible association
   between interpersonal mistrust and unhappiness among Japanese people.
   Based on cross-sectional data for the Japanese general population from
   the Asia Barometer Survey (2003-2006), we analyzed the relationship
   between interpersonal mistrust and unhappiness using a logistic
   regression, adjusted for age, gender, marital status, income, education,
   occupation, reli- gious belief, and self-rated health. In a total of
   2685 participants (mean age, 42.7 years; 47.5\% men), 204 (7.6\%) were
   classified as unhappy. For the questionnaire items involving mistrust,
   1490 (55.5\%) participants reported that they ``can't be too careful in
   dealing with people{''}, and 1642 (61.2\%) participants reported that
   ``people mostly look out for them- selves{''}. In a
   multivariable-adjusted model using the average score based on these two
   questions, interpersonal mistrust was associated significantly with
   unhappiness, with an odds-ratio of 2.06 (95\% CI, 1.25-3.38). Other
   features associated with unhappiness included: age 50-59 years, marital
   status of single, divorced, separated, or widowed, low income,
   mid-education, and poor self-rated health. Gender, occupation, and
   religious belief were not associated with unhappiness. In conclusion,
   interpersonal mistrust is associated significantly with unhappiness
   among Japanese people. Public policies restoring inter- personal trust
   are needed to promote happiness among the Japanese.},

Abstract = {Data from 117 countries over the period 2006 to 2011 are used to
   estimate a macroeconomic cross-country system of equations that examines
   the association between terrorism, self-reported life satisfaction, and
   national income. Results indicate that terrorism is negatively
   associated with life satisfaction, whereas no such association is found
   between terrorism and real GDP per worker. Stark contrasts are found,
   however, between OECD and non-OECD members. In all, our results suggest
   that the social costs of terrorism are potentially much higher than the
   economic costs, and measuring only the conventional economic costs of
   terrorism significantly underestimates the true costs.},

Abstract = {The existing research on international democracy promotion is
   characterised by a peculiar tension. On the one hand, many scholars
   agree that, since 1990, democracy promotion has indeed become a
   significant aim guiding the foreign and development policies of
   North-Western democracies. On the other hand, there is a far-reaching
   consensus that this normative goal is regularly ignored once it collides
   with economic and/or security interests. This article challenges the
   notion that we can understand the motives and drivers behind democracy
   promotion by assuming that interests and norms represent two neatly
   separated and clearly ranked types of factors. It argues that democracy
   promotion policies are the result of a complex interaction of interests
   and norms. After first developing this argument theoretically, the
   article presents results from a comparative research project on the US
   and German democracy promotion that support this claim.},

Volume = {45},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Germany is widely seen as a ``dualized{''} economy driven by a powerful
   and stable ``insider{''} coalition in the manufacturing sectors. In this
   article, that picture is challenged. An examination of the political
   economy of the outsider-friendly 2014 Minimum Wage Act, using public
   opinion data, document analysis, and qualitative interviews, shows how
   earlier dualizing reforms led to unintended negative feedback effects:
   First, public opinion reacted negatively to increasing inequality in the
   years preceding the introduction of the minimum wage. Second, a
   remarkable shift is found among trade unions toward support of a minimum
   wage, even in manufacturing. Although the threat of low-wage competition
   and flexibilization did play a role, trade union solidarity was at least
   as important. Those endogenous dynamics came together in a
   self-undermining process unfolding over a relatively short period of
   time. Potential alternative explanations are explored, including
   classical partisan politics, party competition, and employer
   preferences.},

Abstract = {The EU has consistently struggled to forge a foreign policy narrative
   which promotes internal cohesion and supports the EU's efforts to exert
   international influence. The 2016 EU Global Strategy is the latest
   iteration of collective efforts to tie strategy and purpose to the EU's
   coherent identity in the world. This study compares the EU's strategic
   partners of peace and security with narratives about the EU held in the
   EU's strategic partners in Asia. Whilst we find reasonable coherence in
   the EU's projection of the international system and its role in it, its
   identity as an actor, and its response to policy issues on the ground,
   views from Asia largely contest these claims. This article employs a
   strategic narrative approach to conceptualize and empirically trace how
   the formation, projection and reception of EU narratives are part of
   broader circuits of communication through which EU might be recognized,
   legitimized and achieve influence.},

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF TRANSITIONAL JUSTICE},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {11},
Number = {3},
Pages = {484-504},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Despite a rich body of literature on ex-combatants in transitional
   contexts, the reasons why former armed actors may be reluctant to engage
   with formal mechanisms of truth recovery have been less well explored.
   This article argues that ex-combatants' antipathy towards truth recovery
   cannot be properly understood without critically interrogating the
   emotions vested in the combatant/ ex-combatant experience and the
   intersection between emotions, politics and ideology. In particular, the
   article focuses on the emotion of loyalty and its influence on pro-state
   armed actors. It uses the case of loyalist ex-combatants in Northern
   Ireland as a prism through which to explore this tension. Four
   overlapping notions of loyalty are identified: `loyalty as betrayal,'
   `loyalty, blame and managing shame,' `loyalty as silence' and `loyalty
   as protection.' The article concludes by suggesting the need for greater
   recognition of the role of loyalty in mediating relationships with, and
   willingness to investigate, the past.},

Abstract = {This article introduces a new approach to the study of EU mediation and
   conflict resolution. It argues that researchers have not fully accounted
   for the changes underway in the Union's take on mediation. By
   elucidating the differences between this approach and the already
   existing literature on EU mediation, the article advocates a practice
   turn and develops a framework for studying EU mediation as an assemblage
   of practices. It builds on Latourian assemblage thinking and complements
   it with the Foucauldian notion of political rationality and techne. This
   approach is then explored through examining the practices of EU
   mediation support in Myanmar, which draws attention to the
   contradictions and a specific set of knowledge claims on peace and
   conflict, and traces dissident voices and how they inform the use of
   mediation instruments. In so doing, it demonstrates how a
   practice-oriented approach allows us to provide new insights into EU
   external action.},

Abstract = {Observers across the ideological spectrum have criticized benefit-cost
   analysis for as long as it has been part of the rulemaking process.
   Still, proponents and detractors agree that analysis has morphed into a
   mechanism often used by agencies to justify regulatory decisions already
   made. We argue that a simpler analysis of more alternatives conducted
   earlier in the regulatory process can resuscitate it as a tool to inform
   policy. Recognizing that requiring a procedure does not ensure that
   regulators will follow it, we offer possible remedies, including
   strengthening or relaxing subsequent review of proposed rules, which
   raise the cost of circumventing the reform or lower the cost of
   following it.},

Abstract = {This research examines the work of international experts who promote and
   support democratization projects funded by Western governments and
   nongovernmental organizations. Based on interviews and participant
   observation research with professionals working in democracy assistance
   organizations, this study investigates the ``back stage{''} practices
   that shape democratization projects in organizational head offices.
   Drawing on the recent scholarship on international practices and the
   culture of organizations, this article examines the ways democracy
   assistance organizations carve a particular niche within the broader
   field of international development aid by structuring their projects
   according to a practical theory of democratization. The article fits in
   the recent critical tradition that examines the practices of
   international aid organizations and poses questions about the type of
   democracy that North American aid organizations are promoting.},

Abstract = {Proportional electoral systems tend to be more beneficial for women's
   descriptive representation than majority systems. However, within
   proportional systems the gender equality of election outcomes differs,
   highlighting the importance of studying the actual use of electoral
   provisions in proportional representation (PR) systems. Therefore, we
   investigate the determinants of voting for female candidates in
   Belgium's local elections. This case is particularly interesting given
   the equal number of men and women on the candidate lists due to quota
   regulations, the possibility to cast multiple preference votes (lowering
   competition), and the high visibility of these local elections and its
   candidates. At the individual level, we find that women are more likely
   than men to vote for several women, yet same-sex voting is more common
   among men. Politically sophisticated respondents vote more often for
   candidates of both sexes. Against our expectations, a left-wing
   orientation does not increase the likelihood of voting for women. At the
   electoral district level, a larger supply of women at the top list
   position increases the chance to vote for this top woman, but there is
   no spillover effect to women lower on the list. District magnitude
   affects the number of preference votes but, against expectations, not
   the likelihood of voting for women.},

Abstract = {Many students are averse to taking out loans to pay for educationa
   phenomenon that is commonly discussed but rarely systematically
   analyzed. This study explores the relationship between student loan
   aversion and individual financial characteristics. In this analysis, we
   rely on a unique dataset of survey responses from more than 5,000 high
   school seniors, community college students who did and did not borrow
   for higher education, and adults without a college degree. Regression
   analyses, using a robust set of controls and institutional fixed
   effects, show that higher financial literacy and higher knowledge of
   federal student loans are related to lower loan aversion for education.
   The magnitude of these effects is large, as much as a 30 to 50 percent
   reduction in loan aversion in some samples. There is also evidence that
   prior experience with payday lending is related to increased loan
   aversion for community college students who did not borrow for college.},

Abstract = {Over the past decade, the federal government has made substantial
   efforts to simplify the college-going process and help students to
   evaluate college choices. These low-cost strategies aimed at improving
   college access and success by helping students to make informed
   decisions about college warrant assessment. This study examines the
   impact of a recent effort aimed at simplifying information that colleges
   provide to students about college costs, loan options, and college
   outcomes. Results from a quasi-experimental analysis indicate that the
   informational intervention in this study had limited influence on
   community college students' enrollment and borrowing decisions. I
   discuss the limitations of this particular intervention and the
   potential impact that other related policy efforts designed to help
   students at various points in the college-going process may have.},

Abstract = {This article develops a feminist critique of debate on hybrid forms of
   governance in global politics by demonstrating the gendered implications
   (and limitations) of hybridized approaches to security provision. The
   conceptual approach that frames my enquiry puts arguments advancing the
   benefits of multilayered and hybridized security into dialogue with
   ethnographic enquiry on vernacular security and feminist study of
   conjugal order. I contend that this conceptual approach is particularly
   productive for examining the gendered policing outcomes that can be
   produced in environments where vernacular influences - customary and
   religious - inflect prevailing idioms of security and order. To further
   defend this claim, I apply this conceptual approach to a case study of
   gender and policing in Fiji. Although there has been a strong state
   rhetoric of progressive reform on gender policy in this context, efforts
   to reform policing have been hamstrung by longstanding customary and
   religious discourses that emphasize the defense of conjugal norms as
   foundational to the achievement of order and safety. I show how this
   scenario has encouraged a practical policing of gender and sexuality
   that is restrictive for women generally and may expose particular groups
   of women to direct forms of insecurity and violence.},

Abstract = {Feminist activism is only at an early stage in Romania, yet feminist
   activists have been able to mobilise mass street protests over the past
   few years. By looking at the 2012 mobilisations in Romania, this essay
   aims to understand how feminist movement participation affected the
   dynamics of these protest events. It is argued that feminist activists
   have drawn attention to some of the current difficulties faced by women
   in bringing to the fore alternative voices and messages and resisting
   patriarchal modes of mobilisation.},

Abstract = {This article investigates drivers and mechanisms of policy legitimation
   in authoritarian states. In highly interconnected and digitalised
   environments, non-democratic states need to legitimise their policies in
   order to maintain and cultivate the support of their populations. While
   democracies are more likely to pursue legitimation through enhanced
   policy performance, authoritarian states are likely to legitimise their
   actions through repression and control mechanisms: information control,
   enhancement of popular sentiments, and narrative shaping. The article
   elucidates these arguments by focusing on Russia's actions in three
   specific contexts, namely Crimea's annexation, the destruction of
   sanctioned food products, and military involvement in the Syrian crisis.},

Abstract = {This essay follows an interest in socio-legal studies in taking on the
   legal technicalities (e.g., legal instrumentalism, managerialism,
   procedures) as a subject of inquiry (Riles A, Buffalo Law Rev
   53:392-405, 2005, Collateral knowledge. Legal reasoning in global
   financial markets. University of Chicago Press, Chicago, 2011; Valverde
   M, PoLAR 26(2):86-108, 2003, Soc Leg Stud 18(2):139-158, 2009).
   Accordingly, it focuses on the means to end relationship embedded in
   legal techniques to elaborate on the ``pragmatic knowledge practices{''}
   (Valverde M, PoLAR 26(2):86-108, 2003) they further. The study draws on
   a concrete case of sovereign debt litigation in US courts: NML Capital,
   Ltd. v. Republic of Argentina that came out of this country's foreign
   debt default in 2001 (following a larger economic crisis) and debt
   restructurings in 2005 and 2010. Rather than focusing on the effects of
   the court's rulings on the parties in the case, third interested parties
   (namely payment and clearing institutions), or even on the alleged
   impacts upon the sovereign debt world (Gelpern A, Houston Law Rev 50
   1095-1127, 2013, 2014), the case becomes in this essay a venue to engage
   in a context-based analysis of the use of some legal formulas or terms
   which became routinized knowledge practices in foreign debt agreements.
   Consequently, the study moves beyond the question of judicial
   interpretation of contractual terms to look at the function that those
   legal devices are thought to perform in the contexts in which they are
   placed, represented, appropriated, negotiated, and even anticipated by
   the agents. In this vein, the piece seeks to assess the political spin
   of legal technicalities by looking into their constitution as mere
   vehicles of pragmatism while serving a disputable ideological agenda;
   and thus, they are means to multiple ends.},

Title = {Financial Deregulation and the Role of Statecraft: Lessons from
   Britain's 1971 Competition and Credit Control Measures},
Journal = {NEW POLITICAL ECONOMY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {22},

Pages = {692-708},
Abstract = {Within the financialisation literature, a number of approaches identify
   the coexistence of financial expansion and productive stagnation. Yet
   there is no consensus on which direction causality operates between
   these two phenomena. This impasse has been widened by the lack of
   attention paid to the role of statecraft strategies in mediating
   possible causal mechanisms. This article contributes to rectifying this
   shortcoming by focusing on the governance advantages granted to states
   through financial deregulation. By presenting archival evidence on
   Britain's 1971 Competition and Credit Control deregulation, this article
   lends support to financialisation accounts that argue that weaknesses in
   the productive economy spurred financial expansion, yet it also
   indicates that the state's desire for depoliticised forms of governance
   played a crucial role in mediating this relationship. This further
   suggests that International Political Economy should focus on the
   strategic manner in which states relate to markets.},

Abstract = {The investor-state regime secures the protection of foreign investment
   through a network of investment arbitral institutions and rules that are
   foundational to the global political economy. This regime has emerged as
   a vivid expression of private transnational governance by contract
   involving a complex mixture of private and public authorities that link
   local and global politico-legal orders within dense contractual
   networks. This chapter reviews the historical emergence of the
   investor-state regime, theoretical accounts of its nature and operation,
   and significant sources of opposition to the regime. It concludes with a
   discussion of ways in which the legitimacy of the investor-state regime
   might be enhanced.},

Pages = {34-48},
Abstract = {This article investigates what effect pressure from owners - via loyal
   editors - had on journalistic output at the popular Russian online
   newspapers Lenta and Gazeta. Using novel methods to analyze a data-set
   of nearly 1 million articles from the period 2010-2015, this article
   separates the effect of a changing news agenda from new editorial
   priorities. Statistical tests show that changes in output coincide
   temporally with editorial change, and that the direction of change sees
   new editors move away from publication patterns associated with other
   independent outlets. In both Gazeta and Lenta, editorial changes were
   accompanied by a move away from core news areas such as domestic and
   international politics, toward lifestyle and human interest subjects.
   The loyal editor effect resulted in a 50\% reduction in coverage of
   controversial legal proceedings, together with the business dealings of
   Russian elites.},

   for Putin while allowing respondents to maintain ambiguity about whether
   they personally do so. Our estimates suggest support for Putin of
   approximately 80\%, which is within 10 percentage points of that implied
   by direct questioning. We find little evidence that these estimates are
   positively biased due to the presence of floor effects. In contrast, our
   analysis of placebo experiments suggests that there may be a small
   negative bias due to artificial deflation. We conclude that Putin's
   approval ratings largely reflect the attitudes of Russian citizens.},

Abstract = {Feminist international relations theory argues that male consolidation
   of power in the aftermath of armed conflict often occurs as men gain the
   status of heroes in the postwar appraisals. Explorations of republican
   commemoration in the North of Ireland have uncovered the dominance of
   the male protagonist with a notable relative absence of militant
   republican women. Militarized masculine narratives and patriarchal
   understandings of what is deemed a combatant role, and therefore deemed
   worthy of commemorating, consistently fail to value or recognize women's
   multiple and vital wartime contributions. This article argues that
   conventional definitions of military contributions and combatant roles
   are imprecise, highly gendered and ultimately function as a mechanism to
   denigrate and exclude women's wartime labor. Based on in-depth
   interviews with former combatants, the article critically explores the
   ways in which republican women themselves conceptualize their
   contributions to armed struggle. Emerging from this is a theoretically
   rich narrative of women's multiple and diverse military roles which
   firmly challenge the limited definition of ``a person with a weapon.{''}
   It is suggested that by paying careful attention to the lives of
   combatant women, feminist scholars can use their experiences, narratives
   and meanings to challenge existing frameworks and discourses, and
   redefine combatant roles and wartime contributions.},

Abstract = {The feminist analysis presented in this article interrogates the
   fundamental assumptions that informed the first document produced by the
   Canadian government about alcohol consumption during pregnancy. Our
   analysis shows that constructions of risk and responsibility are rooted
   in neoliberal principles. We argue that such ideas can reinforce a
   problematic notion of individualization that is at the core of the
   neoliberal stateone that devalues a sense of social responsibility for
   the public good and contributes to a highly moralized pregnancy
   discourse that encourages the widespread surveillance of women's
   reproductive bodies and behaviors.},

Abstract = {The article analyzes three factors constraining EU power: its
   unwillingness to view Ukraine as a candidate for membership, a
   miscalculation of Ukrainian leaders and the ignoring of growing
   nationalism and xenophobia in Russia. These three factors constrained
   the EU in its ability to respond to the Russia-Ukraine crisis by
   ignoring past Russian support for separatist movements and invasion of
   Georgia and recognition of the independence of two separatist enclaves.
   The EU did not appreciate that Russia also viewed the EU (not just NATO)
   as a hostile actor intervening in what it views as its `zone of
   privileged interests'.},

Abstract = {This paper proposes to critically situate how social developmentalism
   reshaped social policy in Brazil in the 2000s, to stimulate access to
   credit and to financial markets, thereby fostering a transition towards
   a mass-consumption society. This structural move is radically distinct
   from the very framework which inspired the tenets of early Latin
   American structuralist thought in the post-war period. Whereas seminal
   structuralism neglected the role of social policy, Brazilian social
   developmentalism reframed it to broaden access to consumer credit and
   other financial services, such as insurances. In this new financialised
   framework, social policy has been used to underwrite a financial
   inclusion model that overturned classic tenets of social policy. As a
   result, not only household debt has abruptly escalated, but also social
   insurance and welfare benefits have been partially absorbed as financial
   rents, deepening economic insecurity and social vulnerability.},

Abstract = {This article discusses policymaking from a gender+ equality perspective.
   It connects the knowledge from various subfields ranging from
   development planning, to feminist policy studies, to works on gender
   mainstreaming. By connecting different but convergent feminist
   subdisciplines, it draws a picture of the field of gender+ and
   policymaking. Central in this analysis are the questioning of gender+
   bias in the policy process and the development of strategies to
   mainstream gender into policymaking. By delineating the boundaries of
   research on gender and policymaking, the article addresses existing
   challenges and reflects on gaps and promising terrains of study that
   could further develop and establish the field of feminist policy
   studies.},

Abstract = {This chapter aims to explore the debate on ``development theory{''}
   especially embodied in the dichotomy between ``civilization{''} and
   ``barbarism{''} in the literary production of the 19th, 20th, and 21st
   centuries, by reading the ideological and political messages hidden in
   the most relevant works by classical authors in Latin American and
   postcolonial Anglophone literature. The chapter is structured into three
   main sections. Firstly, the author will draw an itinerary across the
   historical debate on ``development{''}, showing approaches and
   conceptualizations. Secondly, the author will explore the relationship
   between the political messages and ideological positions of significant
   authors and their works in the literary production of the selected
   period. To conclude, the author will set out the most relevant elements
   that reveal the link between the ideological debate on ``development{''}
   and the literary production, suggesting new ways of interpretation for
   future researches.},

Pages = {200-216},
Abstract = {This article examines how spiritual-moral values (SMV) became
   securitized, or defined as a matter of national security in Russia. I
   analyze speech acts to show how moves to securitize SMV spread from the
   political fringe to the center of power, and from individual sectors to
   the strategic level. This moral turn in Russian politics is not merely a
   superficial attempt of the elite to distract the masses and rally the
   conservative electorate. The securitization of SMV has wider
   implications: It is, in the most direct way, the regime's way of
   preventing a color revolution. By introducing a state of siege to the
   sphere of fundamental moral values, this securitization aids the
   construction of a national identity that is incompatible with basic
   human rights. An existential threat is constructed in order to justify
   extraordinary measures and establish a new social contract in which
   modernization is sacrificed at the altar of security.},

Title = {Labour market flexibility, employment and inequality: lessons from Chile},
Journal = {NEW POLITICAL ECONOMY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {22},
Number = {2},
Pages = {237-256},
Abstract = {Flexibility proponents assert that rigid Latin American labour markets
   impede economic expansion and job growth; they advocate reforming labour
   codes through increased flexibility. Critics argue that heightened
   labour flexibility exacerbates inequality without expanding employment.
   From this perspective, precarious employment and inequality are remedied
   by strengthening labour's bargaining power. Chile's maintenance of
   flexible labour reforms adopted during the dictatorship make it
   appropriate for evaluating these competing perspectives. Based on
   flexibility proponents' predictions, we should expect increased formal
   sector employment over time, particularly among the least skilled
   Chilean workers, as well as reduced wage inequality. Yet, the rate of
   unemployment among least skilled workers in Chile remains essentially
   unchanged since the democratic transition as does income inequality.
   These conditions persist despite a high degree of labour market
   flexibility. Thus, Chile's continued adherence to a flexibilised labour
   market should be understood not in terms of its capacity to reduce
   inequality or generate employment. Rather, it should be understood as
   the product of several interrelated factors: (1) the business sector's
   ability to protect its interests; (2) the Concertacion's conscious
   limitation of threats to the business sector's interests and (3) the
   weakness of organised labour, resulting from the perpetuation of the
   Pinochet-era labour regime.},

Abstract = {This article examines a series of political changes that recently
   affected the levels of religiosity in Azerbaijan. Since 2009 the
   Azerbaijani leadership has adopted a set of laws and policy regulations
   designed to restrain Islamism and Islamic activism. In spite of
   heavy-handed state control and legal restrictions, there has been a
   visible increase of religiosity within Azerbaijani society, particularly
   amongst religious organisations and parties. The article aims to decode
   the underlying reasons behind the persistent upsurge of religiosity in
   Azerbaijan and further our understanding of the social-political
   implications of this trend. The article also argues that, since
   restrictions were imposed on religious expression in 2009, the revival
   of Islam in Azerbaijan has become much more visible while serving as an
   alternative avenue for the emergence of social movements within the
   country.},

Abstract = {History is something far from storytelling about the past; it has its
   own methods, discipline, techniques, and value. The same can be said
   about intelligence analysis, which is a comparative newcomer to the
   professions. Like historians, analysts seek to gather information,
   evaluate their sources, create meaning from disparate bits of evidence,
   and impart significant findings. These considerations make it important
   for analysts to learn their history and how the discipline of history
   functions. A greater `historical sense' can make analysts more rigorous
   in their work, and less likely to be frustrated by the situations they
   see around them.},

Abstract = {While the West woke up to the threat to the liberal international order
   when Donald Trump was elected U.S. president, its decline was apparent
   even at the height of the Obama-Clinton era. What follows the end of the
   U.S.-dominated world order is not a return to multipolarity as many
   pundits assume. The twenty-first-century worldpolitically and culturally
   diverse but economically and institutionally interlinkedis vastly
   different from the multipolar world that existed prior to World War II.
   China and India are major powers now; and globalization will not end,
   but will take on a new form, driven more by the East than the West and
   more by South-South linkages than North-North ones. The system of global
   governance will fragment, with new actors and institutions chipping away
   at the old UN-based system. Liberal values and institutions will not
   disappear, but will have to coexist and enmesh with the ideas and
   institutions of others, especially those initiated by China. This
   multiplex world carries both risks and opportunities for managing
   international stability. Instead of bemoaning the passing of the old
   liberal order, the West should accept the new realities and search for
   new ways to ensure peace and stability in partnership with the rising
   powers.},

Abstract = {This article analyzes the causes of the disorder and indiscipline in
   high schools situated in working-class and immigrant districts in
   France, taking into account both adolescent street culture and social
   control in schools. Based on three long-term ethnographic research
   projects in three locations and social contexts, this article highlights
   the evolution of order and discipline in high schools, showing
   differences between France and Brazil. Breaking away from the classic
   themes of failure, inequalities, and exclusion in schools, I focus on
   the specific characteristics of adolescent relationships on one hand,
   and the institutional aspects of social control on the other, focusing
   particularly on the daily work of supervisory staff in high schools.},

Abstract = {This article discusses the processing of social dissent and its media
   relevance in East German society in the 1970s and 1980s. The
   Gegenwartskriminalfilm (contemporary crime movie) Polizeiruf 110 and the
   courtroom television show Der Staatsanwalt hat das Wort are fruitful
   film sources for analyzing the specific ways in which social reality and
   social inequality were constructed and negotiated in the Communist
   state. Social images as mirror and manifestation of effective public
   attention to and the perception of social problems shed light on the
   social symbolic order: They reveal the opposition of good and bad
   behavior, with a contrast in their symbolic representations.},

Abstract = {This review article, with a clear political science and public
   administration bias, takes stock of the existing literature on EU
   agencies and suggests a future research agenda. The article reviews
   studies on EU agencies' organization, tasks, proliferation and location
   in the political-administrative space. Whether the advent of EU agencies
   tends to underpin a basically intergovernmental, transnational or
   supranational order has potentially huge consequences for the
   distribution of power across levels of government, for the degree of
   policy uniformity and pooling of administrative resources across
   countries, for the role of genuinely European perspectives in the policy
   process, and for accountability relations. Although the jury is still
   partly out on most topics, we see the contours of a more direct
   multilevel administration in which EU agencies not only constitute nodes
   within transnational agency networks, but in addition, in governance
   terms, relate more closely to the European Commission than to any other
   institution.},

Title = {Do Reparations Repair Relationships? Setting the Stage for
   Reconciliation in Colombia},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF TRANSITIONAL JUSTICE},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {11},

Pages = {315-338},

Abstract = {Colombia is groundbreaking in its approach of prioritizing victim
   involvement and participation in its peace process and including victims
   in peace agreement discussions in Havana. Colombia started this process
   with an ambitious reparations law, which aims to individually and
   collectively compensate almost 8.3 million victims in order to begin a
   reconciliation process. Yet the link between reparations and
   reconciliation is inconclusive. This study looks at the impact of
   reparations on reconciliation through a comparative matched-case
   research study of two Colombian communities that are demographically
   similar and have similar histories of violence, but starkly different
   levels of reparations. The study employs a participatory methodological
   approach using inductive indicators of peace and reconciliation created
   by the communities themselves in order to create surveys that measure
   the impact of reparations on reconciliation. The study finds that both
   communities display low levels of reconciliation according to
   community-defined indicators, and that there is little variance between
   the two villages in the way the community members define peace and

Abstract = {The inclusion of customary justice mechanisms is increasingly being
   invoked as an answer to the top-down, externally driven approach to
   transitional justice. But the practice of engaging with customary
   justice systems (CJS) proves complicated. The approach of governments
   and the international community has been criticized as `ethnojustice,'
   where a male-elderly version of customary justice is invented and
   imposed, based on a myth of community consensus. In Somalia, the
   government and international community are currently considering a role
   for CJS in the reintegration of low-risk disengaged Al-Shabaab (AS)
   combatants. This article combines unique data on local perceptions
   regarding the return of ex-combatants in Somalia with insights from the
   literature, to critically examine the prospects of engaging customary
   justice mechanisms in South-Central Somalia in the reintegration of
   disengaged AS combatants and of a supporting role for the international
   donor community and the government.},

Abstract = {Labor inspection is a central response to the tremendous gap between
   formal regulations and outcomes for workers throughout the world.
   Scholarly and policy debates on labor regulation have focused on
   improving the targeting of enforcement, changing strategies of
   street-level agents, and creating private alternatives to state
   regulation. This paper argues that these proposals, while important,
   fail to systematically incorporate the potential contributions of worker
   organizations and, as a result, overlook opportunities for co-enforcing
   labor standards, a key element of labor inspection. By contrast, we
   develop a framework to analyze the relationships between worker
   organizations and state regulators that underpin co-enforcement. We
   ground this framework empirically in comparative cases, set in Argentina
   and the United States, presenting two cases of co-enforcement in highly
   different institutional contexts. In so doing, we seek to illuminate key
   attributes of labor inspection and guide attempts to enhance enforcement
   by forging partnerships between regulators and worker organizations.},

Abstract = {Ngai-Ling Sum and Bob Jessop present Cultural Political Economy (CPE) as
   a project that seeks to deepen Critical Political Economy (C{*}PE)
   through an engagement with the cultural turn. This article critically
   assesses their success in such an enterprise. It begins by framing CPE
   within Jessop and Sum's previous work on the Regulation Approach, in
   order to show why the former can only be understood as the result of a
   critical dialogue with the latter. Next, my reconstruction of the main
   elements of Sum and Jessop's CPE is presented. After having carefully
   examined its main assumptions and concepts, I criticise CPE's main novel
   element, an ontological cultural turn, due to the culturalist risks it
   engenders. In order to substantiate and exemplify that theoretical
   criticism, I review CPE's application to the analysis of the North
   Atlantic Financial Crisis. This article concludes by showing the main
   difficulties that CPE faces as an alternative for deepening C{*}PE and
   proposes the Amsterdam School of Transnational Historical Materialism as
   a more suitable direction in which that initiative could be advanced.},

Abstract = {With the help of the Immigrant Inclusion Index (IMIX), a quantitative
   tool for measuring the electoral inclusion of immigrants, we demonstrate
   that European democracies are much more exclusive than they should be.
   All normative theories of democracy share the conviction that it is
   imperative that democracies include long-term immigrant residents into
   the demos - either by granting citizenship or by introducing alien
   voting rights. But even the 20 most established and stable democracies
   within the EU are far from fully realizing the ideal of universal
   suffrage'. This is true independently of whether we count in- and
   excluded people in numerical terms, or whether we evaluate the relevant
   laws and regulations. Therefore, we diagnose a substantial democratic
   deficit on the level of European nation-states. By requiring its member
   states to enfranchise non-national EU citizens on the local level, the
   EU, for once, plays a positive role in reducing one of the most
   fundamental democratic deficits in times of migration.},

Abstract = {How are policy competences allocated between different actors? This
   article contributes to the literature on institutional development
   through an in-depth case-study of the conditions under which the
   competence over the negotiation of agreements on foreign direct
   investment (FDI) was transferred from the national level to the European
   Union (EU) in the 2009 Lisbon Treaty. Most analysts assume that this
   competence shift was a rationally designed delegation, intended to
   maximize European bargaining power in international investment
   negotiations and conceived as an important element of a teleological
   drive to make the EU a meaningful external actor. This article tells a
   different story - one where the competence shift happened by stealth as
   a result of a combination of neo-functionalist Commission
   entrepreneurship and historical accident, against the preferences of the
   Member States. The article also assesses whether the conditions under
   which the competence was transferred have implications for the
   implementation of the new policy.},

Abstract = {In the 1960s and early 1970s, U.S. policymakers maintained a complex
   effort to limit the dissemination of gas centrifuge technology for
   enriching uranium, which they saw as an inherent nuclear proliferation
   risk. Recognizing that controls could not stop scientific research and
   development, U.S. officials nevertheless believed the overseas
   development of gas centrifuge technology could be slowed. To prevent
   further dissemination overseas, the United States supported cooperation
   with European allies that were already developing the technology.
   Cooperation involved implementation of secrecy and export controls,
   although a U.S. initiative to include Japan failed because nuclear
   secrecy was incompatible with Japanese law. The United States tried to
   deflect Japan's interest in the gas centrifuge by offering to share an
   alternative technology, gaseous diffusion, for enrichening uranium. That
   initiative failed, but the U.S. government remained committed to keeping
   enrichment technologies under secrecy controls.},

Abstract = {Transitional justice (TJ) measures in post-Second World War Europe
   illustrate how they consolidate political regimes in both autocratic and
   democratic ways. TJ measures can work as catalysts during transition
   (regime change) and transformation (regime consolidation) periods to
   help build either exclusive autocratic societies or inclusive democratic
   ones. In this article I look at how policy makers use TJ measures such
   as trials, reparations, vetting procedures and even amnesty laws and
   memorials to, on the one hand, establish an exclusive and thus selective
   bias and often arbitrary political regimes and, on the other hand,
   establish an inclusive, diverse and pluralistic political regime. I test
   how TJ measures as independent variables correlate with institution
   building after the end of dictatorships or conflict and thus impact on
   political regime consolidation as the dependent variable in the cases of
   postwar Germany, postdictatorial Spain and Turkey in the second half of
   the 20th century.},

Abstract = {This article examines Taiwan's new president's 2016 proposal for a truth
   and reconciliation commission (TRC), and addresses the ways in which
   this TRC serves domestic, regional and international policy goals. For
   Taiwan as a contested state, the TRC is part of a legitimation strategy
   that includes consolidation of a collective memory about earlier
   authoritarian state violence, cultural and political distinction from
   the irredentism and authoritarianism of China, and demonstration of
   adherence to international norms of democracy and human rights. We argue
   that the Taiwan case reveals the instrumentality of a TRC as a
   geopolitical strategy, particularly for relatively stable democracies
   facing external existential threats from an authoritarian country. We
   further demonstrate the need for ongoing research on transitional
   justice in Asia, and emphasize that political transitions are not only
   situated within nation states, but also in regions where TRCs may have
   profound geopolitical effects.},

Abstract = {This article reexamines gender differences in electoral outcomes. We
   consider whether electoral competition has a differential impact on the
   electoral fortunes of male and female quality candidates. This study
   uses an original data set containing detailed candidate information for
   US House open seat primary and general elections between 1994 and 2004.
   The results indicate that when multiple quality candidates enter the
   race, female quality candidates are at a greater disadvantage than their
   male counterparts. The results suggest that null findings from previous
   work are a product of the way the relationship between gender and
   electoral outcomes is typically modeled.},

Abstract = {Demographic change has been a key consequence of transition, but few
   studies trace fertility trends across countries over time. We describe
   fertility trends immediately before and after the fall of state
   socialism across 19 Central and Eastern European and Central Asian
   countries. We found a few common patterns that may reflect economic and
   political developments. The countries that experienced the most
   successful transitions and integration into the EU experienced marked
   postponement of parenthood and a moderate decline in second and third
   births. Little economic change in the poorest transition countries was
   accompanied by less dramatic changes in childbearing behavior. In
   western post-Soviet contexts, and somewhat in Bulgaria and Romania,
   women became more likely to only have one child but parenthood was not
   substantially postponed. This unique demographic pattern seems to
   reflect an unwavering commitment to parenthood but economic conditions
   and opportunities that did not support having more than one child. In
   addition, we identify countries that would provide fruitful case studies
   because they do not fit general patterns.},

Title = {The domestic drivers of state finance institutions: evidence from
   sovereign wealth funds},
Journal = {REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL ECONOMY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {24},
Number = {6},
Pages = {980-1003},
Abstract = {Sovereign wealth funds - large state-owned investment funds - are key
   players in international finance, but little is known about their
   underlying political drivers. Why do some states with surpluses choose
   to create sovereign wealth funds, while others advocate private finance
   institutions instead? This article speaks directly to this question by
   investigating the variation in sovereign wealth fund choices across
   nations with excess reserves. Thereby it contributes to an emerging
   stream of social network analysis within the international political
   economy literature. It develops an argument in least likely cases (i.e.
   Hong Kong and Singapore) about how the structure of domestic
   state-society relations - in form of policy networks - explains
   variation in sovereign wealth fund choices, which benefits some actors
   over others. By analysing primary archival material and through
   interviews with former policy-makers, this article opens the black box
   of policy-making behind the choices of state finance institutions.},
