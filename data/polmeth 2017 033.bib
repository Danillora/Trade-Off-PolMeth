Title = {Regional Integration and Welfare: Framing and Advocating Pro-Poor Norms
   through Southern Regionalisms},
Journal = {NEW POLITICAL ECONOMY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {22},
Number = {6},
Pages = {661-675},
Abstract = {Regional organisations are moving away from traditional market-based
   goals to embrace issues of welfare, yet the role they play in social
   policy formation, and their contribution to the embedding of alternative
   approaches to development, is poorly understood. This article explores
   whether and how the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR) and the
   Southern African Development Community (SADC) advance pro-poor norms and
   policies in national and global governance. Whilst not coherent
   citizenship-centred projects of regionalism, SADC and UNASUR have
   developed institutional competences to address the health-poverty nexus,
   though their policy development practices and methods take quite
   different forms. Theoretically, the paper develops a framework
   addressing three key claims: (i) poverty and welfare need to be brought
   in to the study of regional governance; (ii) the agency of Southern
   regional organisations in the generation and diffusion of norms needs to
   be taken more seriously in the literature and in practice; and (iii)
   context matters for whether and how regional organisations provide
   normative leadership; act as brokers in a (re)distributive way; or as
   advocacy actors in a political way, enabling claims at different levels
   of governance.},

Abstract = {This chapter examines two perspectives on the meaning of political
   laicism (laicidad). According to the traditional view, which the author
   calls ``exclusive,{''} laicism requires the exclusion of all religious
   content from state institutions as well as from formal politics. The
   second, ``inclusive{''} view emerged as a reaction against the
   traditional view and in response to both the growth of religious
   pluralism and the more public role assumed by some religious
   organizations in recent decades, placing no restrictions on the
   expression of religious content in society at large and therefore
   allowing it in both public institutions and formal politics. The author
   considers traditional laicism from a historical perspective in the case
   of Mexico in order to bring to light the fact that Mexican traditional
   laicism initially constituted a liberal response to the political
   challenges posed by the dominant Catholic Church. The author then
   presents the central features of an acceptable version of exclusive
   laicism that we should think of as an institutional arrangement that can
   develop within different political ideologies, such as republicanism or
   liberalism. The liberal (exclusive) conception of laicism constitutes an
   adequate response to the growing religious pluralism in Latin America
   today. A plausible version must be fully compatible with the protection
   of basic liberal values and freedoms, such as freedom of conscience and
   freedom of expression (which includes the expression of religious
   convictions in the public sphere).},

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL FEMINIST JOURNAL OF POLITICS},

Pages = {441-455},
Abstract = {This article analyzes how the category of ``Afghan women{''} and
   discourses of precarity intersect within the women's empowerment regime
   in Afghanistan. By examining an NGO that seeks to empower women through
   writing, I argue that staff members draw upon precarity as a go-to logic
   to describe the state of Afghan women writers' successes under
   conditions of insecurity and limited communication. Specifically, it is
   writers' desires to subvert their social orders and to carve out their
   own futures that staff members and writing coordinators frame as subject
   to potential destruction. While recent work has highlighted the
   importance of recognizing the precarious lifeworlds of vulnerable
   populations, this article points to the potential implications of a
   hyper-recognition of precarity - namely, the obscuring of the
   complexities of individual women's past and present realities. Through
   analyzing the pedagogies of one empowerment NGO working with women in a
   post-9/11 Afghanistan, I show how the logic of precarity is concerned
   with the vulnerability of women's desires and sentiments, rather than
   their material and political vulnerabilities. It is thus deeply
   inflected by a historically situated ``common sense{''} about which
   potentialities and aspirations are inherent to Afghan women.},

Abstract = {Proliferation of major conventional weapons (MCW) in larger numbers, at
   greater levels of sophistication, and to more actors is at best a waste
   of valuable resources and at worst fuel for more and bloodier conflicts.
   Given a track record of violence, repression, and corruption, norms
   against exporting weapons to active conflicts and human rights abusers,
   as well as norms in favor of transparency in weapons transfers, have
   grown more salient in recent years. Yet international efforts such as
   the UN Conventional Arms Trade Treaty show little promise for mitigating
   these ills. This article finds an alternate route toward moderating
   global arms transfers. It shows, with supporting data, how the United
   States, pursuing its own political interests, leverages its massive
   market power to slow the proliferation of dangerous technology, reduce
   resources spent in the developing world on weapons, stymie the
   deadweight losses of corruption in the arms industry, and lower the
   rewards for human rights abusers.},

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL SOCIOLOGY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {11},
Number = {4},
Pages = {380-397},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Work on affect has made significant contributions to how international
   relations (IR) scholars understand the high politics of international
   affairs, capturing political reactions to the horrific, the spectacular,
   and the exceptional. However, the turn to affect has been less inclined
   to offer comprehensive insight into the importance of emotion in banal
   or everyday international politics. The theory of ontological security
   can offer such insight as it attends to experiences of the everyday,
   particularly through the discursive production of identity. Identity
   might be disrupted at moments of spectacular or exceptional events that
   call it into question but is equally made and remade in the discursive
   production of everyday life. This research focuses on the latter,
   analyzing the reproduction of the international in the everyday through
   the vehicle of British soap operas Coronation Street and Emmerdale, both
   of which introduced storylines about migrant workers in the late 2000s.
   British soaps are designed to be culturally proximate and incorporate
   didactic messages. Analysis of soaps offers a layered and intersectional
   view of emotional reactions to international migration at the level of
   an abstracted individual and the level of the nation-as-viewer.},

Abstract = {Testimonies of refugees and other forced migrants have helped stimulate
   and shape social change, and have on occasion been an effective tool for
   policy change and social transformation. But while advocacy on behalf of
   forcibly displaced people often demonstrates the best of intentions,
   many human rights advocates grapple unsuccessfully with the power
   differentials at all stages of the process. Using techniques derived
   from drama and experiential learning, the authors of this note learned
   to recognize narrative strategies and ethical dilemmas inherent in
   sharing, choosing, and representing the difficult subject matter
   produced by many refugees and forced migrants. By developing an embodied
   understanding of power relations, advocates struggling with the ethics
   of representation of refugee and forced migrant narratives can identify
   strategies for producing alternative narrative frames. Drawing from the
   results of a series of workshops provided to a mixed group of refugee
   service professionals, community leaders, journalists, artists, and
   academics, this note reflects upon our use of these practices as a way
   to encourage empathetic listening and develop strategies of narrative
   disruption for refugee advocacy.},

Journal = {JCMS-JOURNAL OF COMMON MARKET STUDIES},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {55},
Number = {5},
Pages = {1009-1025},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {The mainstream scholarship assessing EU external action frames the
   subject in terms of success or failure to achieve the intended effects,
   the latter generally defined against the EU's own stated objectives.
   Resting on a tacit assumption that EU engagement in third states is a
   good thing, these analyses are framed as positive impact or no impact'
   and tend to neglect the wider effects of EU policies. This article
   maintains that EU external action may and often does have unintended
   consequences, thus expanding the study of EU impact beyond the sheer
   study of EU effectiveness. Drawing on broader literature on unintended
   consequences, the article proposes a framework for analyzing unintended
   consequences of EU external action. It synthesizes and adapts to the EU
   context a classification of unintended consequences and, in order to
   illustrate its utility, applies the proposed framework to three
   empirical examples derived from EU neighbourhood, migration and trade
   policies.},

Abstract = {A common explanation of why urban students fail to succeed in the
   classroom is that they are coming from a ``culture of poverty.{''} This
   article argues that urban students, particularly those who are African
   American, face a series of structural and institutional barriers that
   impede their pathways to success. Lack of access to quality healthcare,
   affordable housing, and quality schools means that the nation's most
   disadvantaged children remain disadvantaged. Yet classrooms with highly
   qualified teachers who believe in the efficacy of their practice and the
   ability of all students to learn can make a difference in these
   children's lives.},

Abstract = {The massacre, torture, persecution, and imprisonment of real and
   imagined communists and sympathizers in mid-1960s Indonesia was among
   the greatest state-sponsored atrocities of the twentieth century and yet
   remains little known and even less understood outside Indonesia. An
   elaborate mythology about the supposed communist coup attempt of
   September 1965 was foundational to the military government's legitimacy
   discourses. The dead, the tortured, and the imprisoned remained an
   existential threat to Indonesia's survival according to these
   discourses, and yet they could not be spoken of, or acknowledged without
   fear of retribution from the state. This article explores one attempt to
   break the silence surrounding the massacres and to make visible the
   suffering of millions of Indonesians; it does so through an analysis of
   the documentary film, The Act of Killing, in which a number of those
   involved in mass murder re-enact their killings. It explores the
   contribution of the film to understanding the politics of mass murder
   through an interrogation of the history it purports to address and
   through the methods employed by filmmaker Joshua Oppenheimer. It
   concludes that while the film is a singular achievement, it fails as a
   political intervention aimed at deepening understanding of the mass
   killings.},

Abstract = {Design-Build-Finance-Maintain-Operate (DBFMO) contracts are a particular
   type of public-private partnership whereby governments transfer the
   responsibility for the design, construction, financing, maintenance, and
   operation of a public infrastructure or utility service building to a
   multi-headed private consortium through a long-term performance
   contract. These arrangements present a typical principal-agent problem
   because they incorporate a carrot and stick approach in which the agent
   (consortium) has to fulfill the expectations of the principal
   (procurer). This article deals with a neglected aspect in the literature
   related to the actual use of the sticks or sanctions in DBFMOs and
   assesses to what extent and under which conditions contract managers
   adopt a deterrence-based enforcement approach or switch to a
   persuasion-based approach, specifically when the contract clauses
   require the use of (automatic) deterrence. An empirical analysis of four
   DBFMOs in the Netherlands shows that the continuation of service
   delivery, the need to build trust, and the lack of agreement on output
   specifications play a role in the willingness of the procurer to apply a
   more responsive behavior that uses persuasion, even when deterrence
   should be automatically applied. (c) 2016 John Wiley \& Sons Australia,

Abstract = {In the 1970s and 1980s the Guatemalan government's counterinsurgency
   tactics prompted nearly 2 million people to abandon their homes. Drawing
   on heretofore unexamined documentation produced by North American
   solidarity groups, this article examines how Canadian, Mexican, and U.S.
   grassroots organizations represented the approximately 200,000
   Guatemalans who crossed the border into Mexico. It traces the gendered
   and racialized victim portrayals that celebrated refugee men's voices
   and agency while reducing refugee women to silent symbols of trauma. A
   close reading of new sources reveals a paradox of solidarity work in the
   1980s: North American activists promoted a new social order of justice
   and equality, but they did so from positions both privileged and
   hindered by Cold War geopolitics. As a result, even as northern
   solidarists provided very real succor to southern people, their actions
   continued to be based on uneven (colonial/imperial) power relations and
   assumptions about an exotic Other.},

Volume = {672},

Abstract = {Poverty has a strong relationship to geography in the United States.
   Previous research has found that rural areas have higher average poverty
   rates than urban areas, but the new supplemental poverty measure (SPM)
   has shown in recent years that urban areas have higher average poverty.
   In this article, we analyze poverty trends from 1967 to 2014 in rural
   and urban America, using the improved SPM metrics. We find a dramatic
   decline in poverty in rural areas, and also show that the geographic
   adjustment of the poverty threshold in the SPM (which lowers poverty
   thresholds in less expensive areas and raises them in more expensive
   areas) is an important explanatory factor. We also find that changes in
   the demographic and economic characteristics of rural and urban
   residents help to explain the decline. Last, we investigate whether
   migration of the poor between rural and urban areas helps to account for
   differential poverty trends, but we find little evidence in support of
   that hypothesis.},

Abstract = {Who is held publicly responsible for the policies of international
   institutions? Are member states or supranational bodies held responsible
   or are public responsibility attributions (PRA) untargeted? We argue
   that in complex policy-making systems responsibility tends to be
   attributed to implementing actors. When, however, a policy does not
   require active implementation, we expect responsibility attributions to
   be untargeted. To test these expectations, we analyze PRA in the
   European public for three EU migration policies: (1) border control
   policies, (2) the distribution of refugees according to the
   Dublin'-system, and (3) so-called welfare migration facilitated by the
   freedom of movement' principle. Our analysis corroborates that PRA
   reflect the structure of policy implementation: (1) PRA for EU border
   controls target the EU; (2) PRA for the distribution of refugees target
   member states; (3) PRA for welfare migration are untargeted. The paper
   thus highlights an accountability gap for policies that do not require
   implementation.},

Abstract = {Despite the popularity of electoral gender quotas, the substantive
   impact of quotas on the plenary behavior of members of parliament (MPs)
   has yet to be thoroughly empirically explored, and in particular, there
   is a dearth of evidence from non-Western cases. Here we create a unique
   content analysis dataset from 14 years (1998-2011) of plenary debates,
   including the contents of more than 150,000 unique MP speeches recorded
   in some 40,000 pages of the Ugandan parliamentary Hansard to test how MP
   characteristics affect patterns of gender-related legislative speech. We
   find that female MPs speak about issues related to women's interests
   significantly more than male MPs. Further, we find no evidence of
   significant differences between female MPs elected with and without
   quotas, suggesting that, in the Ugandan case, gender is a more salient
   predictor of the tendency to speak for women than electoral pathway. To
   our knowledge, this is the first study that examines the effectiveness
   of quotas in promoting women's substantive representation in
   parliamentary debates across all policy domains over a significant time
   period. We discuss the implications of these findings in the Ugandan
   context, as well as how our evidence speaks to substantive
   representation through reserved seat quotas in semi-authoritarian
   regimes more broadly.},

Abstract = {This article explores the complex interactions between diplomacy and
   human migration as a fundamental component of U.S.-Cuban relations in
   the late 1970s. It assesses U.S. and Cuban leaders' intentions in
   pursuing bilateral normalization, as well as their responses to the
   competing opinions of the Cuban-American community in Miami. The article
   also examines the opening of the secret U.S.-Cuban talks, the growing
   mistrust and suspicion among Washington and Havana, and the breakdown of
   communications prior to the Mariel boatlift of 1980. Drawing on U.S.,
   Cuban, and Cuban-American resources, the article shows that the complex
   triangular relationship linking Washington, Havana, and Miami was
   crucial in the short-lived U.S.-Cuban dialogue. The article demonstrates
   that miscommunication and disagreements over Cuban migration were just
   as important as the U.S.-Cuban clash over the Cold War in Africa in
   undermining the spirit of that dialogue.},

Abstract = {Over the past two decades, earmarked funding to international
   development organizations through special-purpose trust funds has
   increased greatly. This paper studies the incentives for trust funds
   from the perspective of multilateral agencies, notably the World Bank. A
   theoretically intriguing type of funds are so-called ``pass-on
   funds,{''} in which one unit hosts the fund, then passes on its
   resources to another type of unit for implementation. Each unit has
   different preferences for the specific types of activities to be
   supported by the fund. Interviews with World Bank staff and
   complementary documents demonstrate the rationale for pass-on funds and
   the associated division of labor between fundraising network units and
   implementing regional units. While pass-on funds reflect an efficient
   division of labor between functionally specialized units, they increase
   the misalignment between sector-specific global priorities and
   country-specific needs. Organizational reform drove the sudden explosion
   of pass-on funds around the millennium turn, facilitated by growing
   availability of donor monies for specific sectors and by lenient
   internal regulation. Organizational reform undermined budget autonomy of
   sector units, causing those units to seek new funds in their areas of
   expertise. A number of reform features also reduced administrative
   budgets of country units, increasing their demand for pass-on funding
   grants. The results contribute to the emerging literature on earmarked
   funding and highlight the need to consider international organizations
   as heterogeneous actors.},

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL SOCIOLOGY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {11},
Number = {2},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {This paper focuses on a particular instance of migrant resistance: the
   hunger strike of three hundred irregular migrants in 2011 in Greece. It
   does not conceptualize the politics of migrant resistance as an isolated
   incidence of mobilization of irregular migrants against the government
   in support for their rights in existing institutions. By drawing on a
   set of fifty-two face-to-face semi-structured interviews with migrant
   protesters and organizers of the hunger strike, this paper rather argues
   that the politics of migrant resistance is performed in the daily lives
   and day-to-day activities of irregular migrants. It is performed by
   irregular migrants and those who stand in solidarity with them through
   the mundane production of information, tricks for survival, mutual care,
   social relations, services exchange, solidarity, and sociability, which
   challenge security policies and controls and establish an alternative
   form of life. The differential inclusion of irregular migrants in
   various social fields, and the leeway that this inclusion potentially
   creates in their daily lives and social relationships, enables irregular
   migrants to create ties with other agents/actors in dominated positions
   in their social fields, who possess and control the essential capital
   for the creation of these alternative modes of life.},

Abstract = {A growing body of survey research shows that the European Union (EU) has
   a relatively benign image around the world, except among Arab
   populations. What informs Arab citizens' sceptical attitudes toward the
   European Union (EU)? Combining literature on Arab public opinion and
   perceptions of the EU, we argue that Arab citizens' feelings about the
   EU are influenced most prominently by their desire for sovereignty.
   Moreover, traditional utilitarian and cue-taking mechanisms should also
   impact Arab EU attitudes. We empirically test our argument using data
   from the third wave of the Arab Barometer (AB). Our findings confirm
   that Arab citizens' EU views seem to be informed by their desire for
   sovereignty, as well as economic considerations and trust in domestic
   elites. Having provided evidence on Arab opinions about the EU, we
   discuss relevant theoretical and methodological directions for future
   research.},

Abstract = {Regulation should be theorized as a three-party relationship (RIT), with

   regulatory relationships over time, chains of regulatory actors, and
   networks. We also draw lessons for regulatory policy from the volume as
   a whole, emphasizing the diverse goals that intermediaries pursue; the
   importance of how, and by whom, intermediaries are selected; the
   pathologies, such as regulatory capture, that may result from
   intermediaries' character, goals, and origins; and opportunities to
   mitigate these pathologies through regulatory design.},

Title = {Human rights shaming through INGOs and foreign aid delivery},
Journal = {REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {12},
Number = {1},
Pages = {95-120},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Does the ``shaming{''} of human rights violations influence foreign aid
   delivery decisions across OECD donor countries? We examine the effect of
   shaming, defined as targeted negative attention by human rights
   international nongovernmental organizations (INGOs), on donor decisions
   about how to deliver bilateral aid. We argue that INGO shaming of
   recipient countries leads donor governments, on average, to ``bypass{''}
   the recipient government in favor of non-state aid delivery channels,
   including international and local NGOs and international organizations
   (IOs). However, we expect this relationship to be conditional on a donor
   country's position in the international system. Minor power countries
   have limited influence in global affairs and are therefore more able to
   centrally promote human rights in their foreign policy. Major power
   countries, on the other hand, shape world politics and often confront
   ``realpolitik{''} concerns that may require government-to-government aid
   relations in the presence of INGO shaming. We thus expect aid officials
   of minor donor countries to be more likely to condition aid delivery
   decisions on human rights shaming than their counterparts of major donor
   countries. Using compositional data analysis, we test our argument using
   originally collected data on human rights shaming events and an
   originally constructed measure of bilateral aid delivery in a
   time-series cross-sectional framework from 2004 to 2010. We find support
   for our hypotheses: On average, OECD donor governments increase the
   proportion of bypass when INGOs shame the recipient government. When
   differentiating between donor types we find that this finding holds for
   minor but not for major powers. These results add to both our
   understanding of the influences of aid allocation decision-making and
   our understanding of the role of INGOs on foreign-policy.},

Abstract = {Treating popular geopolitics as an interdisciplinary environment, this
   essay interrogates the viability of employing popular geopolitics as a
   tool for understanding the relationship between the popular and the
   political on the international stage as it relates to the Russian
   Federation. Using several representative artefacts of pop-culture and
   their reception, we attempt to demonstrate that a powerful
   trans-regional feedback loop has been established, wherein Russian and
   Western' currents feed into and off of each other. These flows sustain
   older geopolitical codes and frames, while steadily developing new
   patterns and dimensions of exchange that explain' variations triggered
   by the vagaries of globalisation.},

Abstract = {The essay inquires into the cultural production of Novorossiya' as a
   politically-coloured territorial brand', promoted by pro-Kremlin
   intellectuals, activists of the Donbas rebellion, and internet users. It
   argues that Novorossiya' is not only constructed from the building
   blocks of historical traditions, but also framed by geographical
   metaphors in popular imagination. Drawing on studies in critical
   geopolitics and fan fiction, this research interprets Novorossiya's'
   constituency in the Russian-language internet as a sort of political
   fandom'. Relative to the annexation of Crimea, however, this brand' has
   been less successful on the market' of geopolitical projects.},

Abstract = {This article examines the financial security issues raised by the rapid
   development of high-frequency trading (HFT). HFT involves automated
   algorithmic trading of financial instruments where the objective is to
   reduce the time scale between the initiation and execution of trades to
   microseconds (or even nanoseconds) so as to reap competitive advantage.
   After outlining the contours of a HFT world, the presentation goes on to
   discuss some of its important consequences and implications. Several
   matters are discussed in this context: market manipulation, hacking,
   index construction and violence. Of particular significance for the
   notion of financial security is the issue of time as embodied in
   algorithmic trading. In turn this raises concerns over the regulation
   and management of this new field of financial innovation and trading
   activity.},

Abstract = {The First World War came at a crucial time when British women's suffrage
   campaigns were gathering momentum throughout the country. The
   culmination of the movement during these years, in spite of various
   social and political differences, enhanced female solidarity and
   political consciousness to a considerable degree. Hectic political
   activism also witnessed a phenomenal rise and propagation of an
   exclusive and extraordinary women's culture. The onset of the Great War
   however, struck a fatal blow to such an unprecedented female camaraderie
   and political conviction. My proposed chapter traces and gathers
   evidences in women's verse written during this time period extending
   from the pre-war years of the suffrage movement to the early years of
   the post-war demobilisation correlating them with some of the major
   developments in women's socio-political history of the period.},

Abstract = {The essay addresses the current trends in the criminalisation of free
   speech in Russia. It critically discusses the amendments to the Russian
   Criminal Code, criminalising various forms of public expression of
   opinions, adopted in the years following the presidential elections in
   March 2012, and questions their compliance with international human
   rights law. Seeking to identify the motives behind the new provisions,
   the article argues that the amendments are intended to cause a chilling
   effect', to control public dissent by selective or random criminal
   prosecution. Two of the new criminal law provisionsPublic Calls for
   Separatism' and Rehabilitation of Nazism'are considered in detail to
   illustrate the author's conclusions.},

Abstract = {Using data from three cycles of regional elections (2003-2006;
   2007-2010; 2011-2014), this article examines membership turnover in the
   legislative assemblies of Russia's federal units. The analysis
   demonstrates that the mode of executive-legislative relations is highly
   consequential for legislative turnover. The change of chief regional
   political executive usually led to increased rates of change in
   legislative personnel. This influence is conditioned by the effective
   political capacity of the incumbent governor. Other factors of
   persistent importance for legislative turnover in Russia's regions
   include change in the party composition of the assembly and generational
   change.},

Abstract = {This chapter looks at the contribution of transnational Catholic
   networks to the recovery and reconstruction of citizenship within the
   dictatorial context of Franco's Spain. The scarcely-studied contribution
   of nonconformist Catholics to the revival of citizenship under Franco
   was fomented above all by a transnational phenomenon: the Second Vatican
   Council of 1962-1965. This chapter explores how Catholic activists
   redefined their religious leadership in terms of social and political
   activism. They used the cultural, economic and symbolic resources
   emanating from their position in order to empower their communities and
   diffuse models of participative democracy not only in their churches,
   but in much wider circles as among students and workers.},

Abstract = {This article analyses an episode in the development of intelligence
   official history in Britain. While an official history of intelligence
   in the Second World War was not approved until the 1970s, the idea had
   been pursued seriously in 1945 by Brigadier Dudley Clarke. Clarke had
   been the chief of deception operations in the Mediterranean theatre, and
   wanted to develop an official history and film recounting some of the
   exploits of his unit. This article argues that Clarke's proposals, which
   were ultimately rejected by the Joint Intelligence Committee and the
   Chiefs of Staff, showed a prescient understanding of the power of
   official history, recognized that complete secrecy would be
   counter-productive, and are thus an important early milestone in the
   evolution of intelligence official history.},

Title = {``Adaptive accumulation' and US political economy},
Journal = {NEW POLITICAL ECONOMY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {22},
Number = {5},
Pages = {541-556},
Abstract = {According to popular and academic understandings of political economy,
   the United States is characterised by the most open forms of free market
   production. From Marxist to institutionalist to liberal analyses, the US
   is said to exhibits a governance model in which state structures are
   minimally intrusive to capitalist civil society. There is a need for
   political economy that re-positions the US state as more than just a
   willing facilitator, lender-of-last-resort or minimal regulator of
   capitalist dynamics. This paper argues that adaptive accumulation' has
   normalised in the US context, wherein capital actively allies itself
   with public state objectives (and mechanisms) to seek new or enhanced
   profit streams, by transforming or rerouting public revenues, such that
   they afford private accumulation. The robust entry of capital in areas
   such as health, education and incarceration are highly notable, inasmuch
   as they harness public objectives for private but not-so-competitive
   ends. By shedding light on such domains, the paper contributes to our
   understanding of capital and its ongoing efforts to stay ahead of
   investment crises by actively shaping its operative environment - in
   this case, maintaining both the credibility and regularity of publicly
   inspired (and often financed) revenue streams while, ultimately,
   transforming their utilisation and purpose.},

Volume = {32},

Pages = {725-742},
Abstract = {Why does strategic intelligence analysis have limited influence on
   American foreign policy? Intelligence analysis is frequently
   disregarded, this paper contends, because it is a duplicated step in the
   decision-making process and supplements but does not supplant policy
   assessment. Many intelligence analyses will confirm policy assessments
   and be redundant or - if the assessments are different - policy-makers
   will choose their own interpretations over those of intelligence
   analysts. The findings of this paper provide scholars with important
   insights into the limits of intelligence analysis in the foreign policy
   process as well as recommendations for increasing its positive impact on
   policy.},

Abstract = {International development evaluation, which prioritizes values linked to
   poverty eradication, can help policy respond to poor people and
   marginalized people's concerns. Power imbalances, however, mean that
   although evaluation that applies the standards of international
   development has mechanisms to contribute to the improved responsiveness
   of government, the interests of poor people are often excluded from the
   process (House \& Howe, 1999). In this chapter, a framework that
   utilizes principal-agent concepts is applied, drawing on five case
   studies, and some potential entry-points for evaluation to support
   policy processes to respond to poor and marginalized people are
   highlighted. The discussion provides initial evidence of the
   applicability of the principal agent concepts to the implementation of
   international development evaluation practice so that it can better
   enable responsive policy decisions.},

Abstract = {The Federal Bureau of Investigation has experienced a number of
   high-profile failures - across nearly four decades - in developing its
   Information Technology (IT) infrastructure. Repeated missteps are
   indications of problems with the Bureau's broader culture that degrade
   its effectiveness across missions. A significant factor contributing to
   this dysfunctional culture is the diversification of the FBI's
   responsibilities, to the point of losing a corporate identity. Reform
   will require an assessment of the Bureau's purpose, the elements which
   it should retain in furtherance of this vision, and the steps to align
   its workforce with the competencies necessary to pursue this mission.},

Abstract = {National Human Rights Institutions (NHRIs) have become hallmarks of good
   governance and democracy. Although many countries have an NHRI, it
   remains unclear how they operate on the regional level in political
   systems where democracy malfunctions and human rights are under
   pressure. Drawing on interviews, this essay examines how Russian
   nongovernmental organisations (NGOs) established a shadow Ombudsmanthe
   Human Rights Council (HRC)to protest against the appointment of an
   Ombudsman in St Petersburg and put pressure on authorities to inaugurate
   a new and independent Ombudsman. Although we would expect relations
   between the Ombudsman and NGOs to deteriorate when civil society is
   under pressure, this essay finds that political repression and the
   persona of the current Ombudsman, Alexander Shishlov, have brought civil
   society and the Ombudsman closer together.},

Pages = {548-562},
Abstract = {This article explores whether qualitative research methodologies can
   help improve strategic analytical processes and products. Currently, in
   many intelligence agencies, cultural and organizational barriers
   restrain the development of better strategic intelligence. An emphasis
   on current intelligence is rewarded over longer-term strategic
   assessments. However, the demands of an increasingly number of complex
   emerging threats can only be partially met by current intelligence.
   Decision-makers also need a revitalized strategic analytical capability
   to help with policy planning. This article investigates whether further
   consideration should be given to improving strategic analytical skill
   sets by a greater adoption of qualitative social research methodologies
   by the intelligence enterprise.},

Abstract = {Recent studies suggest a major shift in the Mexico-U.S. migratory
   circuit: that more Mexican nationals are returning to Mexico than are
   migrating to the U.S. With a focus on undocumented returnees, who face
   unique challenges to future re-migration to the U.S. given the current
   border restrictions, this chapter considers why they return to Mexico
   from the U.S. when they do. To answer this question, the discussion in
   the chapter draws on data collected via 18 months of ethnographic
   fieldwork in 10 hometowns of returnees in Jalisco and Oaxaca, Mexico,
   including 50 interviews with deportees and voluntary returnees. These
   data illuminate a multiplicity of circumstances under which undocumented
   migrants go back to Mexico. In particular, the circumstances that
   primarily drive these migrants to return fall under three broad
   categories: their participation in the market economy in the U.S.; their
   participation in a gift economy with family and community members in
   Mexico; and their encounters with the U.S. state's system of immigration
   enforcement. These findings problematize the voluntary/involuntary
   binary, complicating our understanding of what it means to return to
   Mexico ``voluntarily{''} or ``involuntarily{''}, as well as what
   comprises ``home{''} for Mexican migrants.},

Abstract = {Do United Nations Security Council (UNSC) members represent states in
   their geographic regions? Drawing on literature in legislative politics
   and regional similarities, this manuscript links classic notions of
   representation - descriptive and substantive - to geographic
   representation of UN members in the UNSC. However, we argue that the
   process of getting elected to the UNSC leads to the election of states
   that are not likely to represent their regions. Using UN General
   Assembly voting patterns as a proxy for preferences, two sets of
   analyses test 1) whether, in general, states within the same region have
   higher levels of General Assembly voting similarity, and 2) if UNSC
   members possess similar voting patterns with states in their region. The
   results show that while regional groupings do tend to have higher
   patterns of vote similarity, this effect is not present when comparing
   the states voted onto the UNSC with states in their region.},

Abstract = {This research note responds to recent debates about new
   intergovernmentalism and argues that the hypotheses of Bickerton, Hodson
   and Puetter overlook the roles non-state actors play in the integration
   process. It intends to open up a debate about private power and the new
   intergovernmentalism, demonstrating that the concentration of powers of
   national governments has proceeded alongside the concentration of powers
   of transnational business interests in Europe. The note draws on the
   example of the civil security industry and Justice and Home Affairs
   policies in order to modify the six hypotheses of new

Title = {Development Aid Architecture and the Conditions for Peacebuilding and

Journal = {JOURNAL OF HUMAN RIGHTS PRACTICE},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {9},
Number = {3, SI},
Pages = {457-468},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {The number of aid-receiving countries that are conflict-affected is
   significant; however, results of international efforts to promote both
   development and peacebuilding are mixed. While international aid policy
   recognizes that conflict-affected areas present unique characteristics
   and that a different approach to development programming is needed in
   such contexts, donors and their in-country partners are hard pressed to
   reconcile institutional and programmatic requirements with what is
   needed to create conducive conditions for peacebuilding and human rights
   initiatives at local level. This policy note considers this gap in
   development thinking and practice by discussing challenges and
   opportunities in supporting peace and human rights in conflict-affected
   countries. In doing so, it elucidates pertinent aspects of the
   institutional architecture of aid bureaucracies, the behavioural
   responses of their functionaries, and the mode of engagement needed in
   addressing the unique needs of conflict-affected areas. We suggest that
   a radical rethinking of the framework for supporting collaboration and
   programming on peacebuilding and human rights is needed. The policy note
   argues that the emphasis of the liberal peace critique on the normative
   and ideational framework as the main challenge to creating a conducive
   space for peacebuilding does not match practical reality. Instead, we
   need to look to the institutional framework and practices embedded in
   development aid architecture to identify and understand the challenges
   in support of and collaboration on peacebuilding and human rights. In
   addition, we suggest that inspiration for transforming the current
   framework and practices can be drawn from thinking in the fields of
   human rights and peacebuilding on indignity, inequality, power
   imbalance, and polarization.},

Abstract = {This article demonstrates how various forms of surveillance can lead to
   coping strategies that are corrosive of trust and legitimacy between
   black neighborhood residents and law enforcement. This article
   introduces the coping strategy of submissive civility as a method of
   self-preservation enacted in social situations where power relations are
   asymmetrical and the dominant party can administer sanctions. Reporting
   on an ethnographic study of residents' interactions with police and
   other agents of surveillance, this article surveys a range of problems
   that residents face as they try to meet conflicting demands while
   avoiding sanctions. The analysis shows that issues of trust, legitimacy,
   and the discretionary authority of police and other outsiders in the
   neighborhood pervade these interactions. Further, the analysis
   highlights the complex ways in which family dynamics, unemployment,
   debt, and drug dealing intersect with the activities of law enforcement
   and the threat of imprisonment that is woven into the fabric of
   residents' lives.},

Abstract = {Drawing on over two years of ethnographic fieldwork, this article
   demonstrates how violence shapes relations between black and Latino
   youth in the poorest neighborhoods of South Los Angeles. Most academic
   work views interracial relations as a cause of conflict and violence. My
   work reverses the causal arrow and looks at violence as a central force
   in creating and shaping interracial relations. My findings build on
   Roger Gould's theory of group solidarity by demonstrating how violence
   is a central precondition in shaping group identity. I revisit the
   concept of interracial avoidance between blacks and Latinos, and its
   connections to violence, group identity, and interracial relations and
   explain its role within what I call alternative governance, which
   consists of avoidance, protection, and negotiation.},

Abstract = {This article explores the reputations of transnational non-governmental
   organizations (NGOs) and their determinants. Although the concept of
   reputation has received extensive treatment in international relations,
   NGO reputation has received less attention. Yet reputations are critical
   to the construction of NGO authority and to patterns of collaboration.
   We develop a framework for studying NGO reputation. We then provide
   empirical evidence on the construction of a particular dimension of NGO
   reputation, that of organizational effectiveness from the perspective of
   NGO peers. Based on a mixed-method, in-depth interview study of
   transnational NGO leaders, we identify specific factors associated with
   NGOs' effectiveness reputations among their peers. Larger, older, more
   highly visible organizations, organizations adopting hybrid strategies,
   and organizations headquartered outside of Washington, DC enjoy higher
   reputations for organizational effectiveness. Our analysis provides
   context for understanding the influence of transnational NGOs in world
   affairs and offers insight into the role of reputation in global
   politics more generally.},

Abstract = {After the Maidan uprising and the fall of President Viktor Yanukovych,
   the Ukrainian parliament passed a number of transitional justice
   measures, including criminal trials and vetting of public employees,
   members of the law enforcement agencies and the judiciary. Despite
   strong public demand for retribution, only a limited number of suspects
   have so far been punished under the new laws. This article examines
   whether the way transitional justice in post-Maidan Ukraine has been
   carried out corroborates the assumption that can be derived from the
   transitional justice literature about the scope of retribution after
   negotiated transitions. It argues that transitional justice in Ukraine
   is generally better explained by `the politics of the present' than by
   the `politics of the past,' but that additional and so far
   underresearched factors shaping transitional justice outcomes should be
   included: administrative capacities and traditions and the nexus between
   a transitional government's international commitments and the role of
   the judiciary, especially with regard to large-scale vetting policies.},

Abstract = {`Video for Change' refers to the practice of using video as a means to
   activate progressive social change. Ongoing work in this field seeks to
   define and establish ethical considerations that can inform and direct
   Video for Change as an emerging practice. This article reports on a
   research project carried out with a network of Video for Change
   organizations. The purpose of this project was to inform the development
   of an impact framework that could be used to support Video for Change
   practitioners to design for-and evaluate-their social impact in a way
   that is considered ethically appropriate. The project began by
   investigating what makes Video for Change a unique media practice and by
   considering its genealogy. This was followed by an examination of the
   ethics and ethical practices that are most valued by Video for Change
   practitioners. This article reports on research key findings, and
   proposes an Impact Pathways framework, while also highlighting key
   challenges associated with designing-and assessing-the social impact of
   video initiatives across diverse contexts.},

Abstract = {This article sets out to analyze experiences related to refugeeness, or
   ``becoming refugee.{''} It does so not as a technology of
   governmentality, but rather as the condition of possibility to political
   agency based on the capacities of asylum seekers to become attentive
   toward the figure of the refugee, to raise awareness of shared
   grievances and injustices and, ultimately, to mobilize individually and
   collectively. The study is based on an analysis of interviews carried
   out with asylum seekers in January 2015 in Cairo, a city that hosts one
   of the biggest UNHCR operations in North Africa and the Middle East.
   Approaching refugee subjectivities through the lens of performativity,
   we suggest that becoming refugee is one significant instance where
   people employ their mundane political agencies, both challenging and
   reproducing the complex socio-political and socio-material relations
   that constitute the refugee regime. We conclude that a focus on the
   subjective dynamism involved in performing refugeeness may be helpful in
   understanding political mobilization in demanding and oppressive
   situations in Cairo and beyond.},

   the end of a particular era and the beginning of a new one. In the case
   of Romania, Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej's unexpected demise in March 1965
   resulted in Nicolae Ceausescu's spectacular rise to power and the
   beginning of a short lived de-Stalinization. Weeks after the former
   dictator's death, dramatic changes occurred within the top elite and in
   the interpretation of the Romanian Communist Party's history.
   Gheorghiu-Dej's name swiftly vanished from the official propaganda, and
   the new leader's cult of personality was born.},

Abstract = {Do women really improve conditions for gender equality after becoming
   heads of states? This study investigates if having a woman at the helm
   of country's decision making processes leads to better indicators on
   women's conditions. Using time-series observations for the period
   2000-11, we test the hypothesis with the Liberian experience. We analyse
   six main gender indicators: gender equality, equality of representation
   in rural areas (basic community), economic rights of women,
   participation of women in active life, political rights of women and
   legislations for the protection of women against violence. Our findings
   do not show substantially significant changes between the first mandate
   of Ellen Johnson Sirleaf and the period before. In essence, we only
   notice positive and statistical ruptures for equality of representation
   in rural areas and the economic rights of women. Policy implications are
   discussed.},

Abstract = {Bolivia, Ecuador, and Venezuela are cases in which, despite of the
   collapse of party systems, the fragmentation of popular sectors, and the
   dismantling of corporatism that resulted from neoliberal reforms, a new
   mode of incorporation nonetheless emerged. This article argues that left
   government responses to the demands of heterogeneous, mobilized, popular
   sectors shaped a new incorporation in the political arena. In it
   governments deal differentially with the proliferation of politically
   significant popular sectors and subaltern social groups. This segmented
   popular interest intermediation is explained by the interaction of three
   broad conditions: the configuration of popular sector forces and their
   linkages to left parties when they took office after the crisis of
   neoliberalism, the ideational frames of said parties' leadership, and
   the dynamics of opposition and support for the regime's project. The new
   incorporation establishes a new normal in the relationship of popular
   sectors to politics in democratic regimes.},

Abstract = {Parliamentarians are often allowed to pursue other work in addition to
   their mandate. Using data on the 7th European Parliament (2009-14), we
   analyze the relationship between the outside earnings of its Members
   (MEPs) and their parliamentary activities. The supranational nature of
   the European Parliament thereby allows a novel analysis of `
   moonlighting' free of countryspecific bias. We find outside earnings to
   be negatively correlated with the particularly workintensive production
   of draft reports and opinions. Utilizing the considerable freedom of
   Member States in organizing elections, we find this relationship to be
   dependent on the electoral system under which MEPs are elected. While
   the effect of the trade-off between outside and parliamentary work is
   predominantly negative in all other systems, outside earnings of MEPs
   from centralized but candidate-focused systems correlate positively with
   their productivity, indicating a possible benefit from selection
   effects.},

Abstract = {This paper investigates the motivations that led policy-makers to
   delegate macroprudential authorities to newly created independent
   systemic regulatory authorities (SRAs). Three case studies are examined:
   the US Financial Stability Oversight Council, the European Systemic Risk
   Board and the UK's Financial Policy Committee. Policy-makers'
   motivations are captured by examining the specific institutional
   features of the newly created SRAs and by tracing the legislative
   debates that surrounded their creation. The findings of this empirical
   analysis call into question several of the conventional claims that are
   used to justify delegation to technocratic agencies from the
   functionalist and ideational scholarship. Given the limitations of the
   explanations based on efficiency considerations and socialisation of
   welfare losses, this paper suggests that the delegation of powers to
   SRAs was ultimately motivated by what is referred to as the logic of
   symbolic politics.' It is argued that the main motivation that emerges
   from the legislative debates for delegating this important task is that
   the SRAs provided a quick institutional fix' to signal to the public
   that in the wake of the international crisis of 2007-2009, policy-makers
   were redressing regulatory mistakes made prior to and during the crisis
   that had caused a severe deterioration of public's wealth.},

Abstract = {This chapter argues that in countries transitioning to democracy the
   embedding of democratic principles takes time. A key factor in
   consolidating democracy is the instrumental role played by a capable
   state administration applying the instruments of development to
   effectively redistribute wealth, meet basic needs, protect human rights
   and exercise democratic forms of governance. In this context evaluation
   contributes to strengthening democracy by developing a reflective and
   learning state. An illustrative case is presented: the government led
   evaluation of the Urban Settlements Development Grant (USDG). The
   authors describe the government's evaluation process and show how it
   promoted constructive dialogue across spheres of government, ultimately
   leading to a redesign of the program and a reform in human settlements
   policy. Both the program overhaul and the policy reforms enhance the
   rights-based delivery of services to poor communities, increase their
   access to economic opportunities, and in so doing, contribute to
   consolidating democracy beyond the introduction of universal suffrage.},

   and the Roman Catholic Church compared},
Journal = {POST-SOVIET AFFAIRS},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {33},
Number = {3},
Pages = {177-199},
Abstract = {The Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Roman Catholic Church
   (RCC) are both conceptualized as sacred institutions, with many features
   of ideology/theology, hierocratic structure, and policy process in
   common. After periods of exclusion, they both also faced strong
   pressures to adapt to changes in the modern world, both internal and
   external, and to reduce status differentiation within the hierarchy and
   between the clergy/apparatchiki hierarchy and the laity/population. The
   present article compares and contrasts de-Stalinization under Khrushchev
   (1956-1964) with the results of Vatican II (1959-1965), and Gorbachev's
   reforms (1985-1991) with the efforts of Pope Francis to reform the RCC
   (2013-present). The comparisons validate the explanatory power of the
   noted similarities between these sacred institutions, while also
   highlighting significant differences in structure, mission, and process,
   which explain why Pope Francis has adopted an incremental strategy for
   reform of the RCC, in contrast to Gorbachev's revolutionary strategy for
   reforming the CPSU.},

   rights-based development and best practices of the 1990s, they ignore
   the critical roles of political capacity and participation that the past
   forty years and feminist analysis of development achievements and
   failures have taught us are essential to taking on gender and economic
   inequality. Certain trends in foreign aid accountability share this
   silence on the importance of political capacity. In contrast, the
   rights-based approach to gender equality and development (RBA) is a
   political approach to development. We reconcile the need for aid
   accountability with the need for a focus on politics by outlining key
   political processes of the rights-based approach. The RBA is a way of
   doing development that is attentive to process and power. We can use the
   RBA not just as a guide for how to do development, but also as a way to
   think about processes as outcome measures. The processes that the RBA
   requires are processes that build capacity for marginalized women and
   people.},

Abstract = {This article uses Marxist theories of agrarian capitalism to explore the
   political economy of genetically modified organisms (GMO) agriculture.
   It argues that the successes and failures of GMO agriculture have been
   partly circumscribed by the structural requirements of the capitalist
   system, as well as by the materiality of GMO crops themselves.
   Successful innovations have been able to mitigate the material barriers
   to accumulation found in agricultural production, and thus appeal
   directly to farmers as comparatively profitable capital inputs. In this
   way, they cohere with David Goodman's notion of appropriationism, where
   manufactured capital inputs (such as pesticides, machinery and
   fertilisers) replace `natural' inputs (such as manure or draft animals),
   reducing labour time and biological contingency, and thus creating a
   competitive advantage for those farmers who adopt the new technology (at
   least temporarily). Conversely, innovations that are geared at consumers
   rather than farmers have largely failed due to their status as
   value-added products (whose value is subjective and market-driven)
   rather than capital goods. The article uses contrasting case studies of
   herbicide-tolerant soybeans, beta-keratin-enhanced rice and
   slow-ripening tomatoes to demonstrate how and why the structural
   imperatives of global capitalism have enabled the success of some, and
   the failure of other innovations.},

Abstract = {This article investigates the Thatcher government's attempts to suppress
   or censor reporting on secret intelligence issues in the early 1980s. It
   examines official reactions to a BBC intrusion into the secret world, as
   the long-running Panorama documentary strand analysed the role and
   accountability of Britain's clandestine services. It also assesses the
   extent of collusion between the government and the BBC's senior
   management. The Panorama affair was an important waypoint on the journey
   towards the dramatic Spycatcher episode of the mid-1980s. The key
   players on the government side - Thatcher and Cabinet Secretary Robert
   Armstrong - failed to learn the lessons of the 1980-81 affair, that it
   was often more dangerous to attempt suppression than to simply let
   events run their course.},

Abstract = {The majority of research on intersectionality and social movements has
   focused on agenda-setting or internal identity processes. However,
   little research has focused on the ways in which social movements
   present themselves as intersectional, particularly in recruitment, which
   is important for building inclusive movements. In this chapter, we begin
   to outline a theory of movement recruitment based around intersectional
   identities that draws on work on coalitional recruitment and concepts
   from framing. In particular, we argue that ``identity bridging,{''}
   which occurs when two or more identities are linked during recruitment
   attempts, is a potential tool for inclusive and intersectional
   recruitment. We evaluate the extent to which movements engage in this
   style of recruitment using data on intersectional youth identities
   acknowledged on web-addressable advocacy spaces. Youth are at a critical
   moment in their identity development, and so it is especially important
   to engage them in ways that respect their developing intersectional
   identities. We find that, overall, most movement sites do not engage in
   identity bridging, and those that do rarely move beyond bridging the
   youth identities with one other aspect of identity. Based on our theory,
   this would help to explain why so many movements struggle with issues of
   inclusivity.},

Abstract = {The Commonwealth assaults against German forces on the western front
   during 1917 include several famous disasters and successes. Perhaps the
   least known of these successes is the battle of Hill 70 of August 1917,
   in which the Canadian Corps seized a powerful German position, inflicted
   disproportionate and heavy losses on the defenders, and achieved their
   strategic objective of pinning German forces away from the campaign in
   Flanders. This success occurred because the Canadian Corps developed a
   sophisticated and powerful system for set piece battles, in which
   intelligence played a key role. This article assesses how intelligence
   affected all aspects of this battle - from national and theatre level
   decision- making, down to the dissemination of information to individual
   soldiers. It demonstrates how intelligence worked in tactical and
   operational terms on the western front in 1917, and shaped battles.},

Abstract = {Revisionist historians of the Western Front have demonstrated that
   Britain had no alternative but to wage a war of attrition to defeat
   Germany. However, the effort to assess this process has been neglected
   in the historiography. This article explores British attempts to gauge
   the success of their strategy of wearing down German manpower. Efforts
   in London proved unable to supply a convincing answer. Using General
   Headquarters' dubious estimates from the front, Field Marshal Sir
   Douglas Haig argued that his strategy was working. Prime Minister David
   Lloyd George's inability to confound these estimates shaped his decision
   to permit the Passchendaele offensive.},

Abstract = {In his `Fishy business', Mark Sainsbury (Analysis 74:3-5, 2014) presents
   a puzzle: in order to have a substantive disagreement, one has to first
   agree on the meaning of a proposition that is the object of this
   disagreement. Now, since before Linnaeus' classification the criteria
   for counting as `fish' were such that they allowed for the inclusion of
   whales, while the new classification (1758) excludes them, a substantive
   disagreement ought not to arise across these two. And yet, in a court
   case from 1818 he refers to, the judges did not dismiss the disagreement
   on semantic grounds. They proclaimed whales to count as fish, and,
   according to Sainsbury, we, the readers, are equally able to reach a
   verdict in that we would proclaim the jury to be wrong. The question I
   address in this paper is a metasemantic one, namely what should count as
   meaning of expressions for the purpose of theoretical inquiry. I point
   out that truth-conditional analysis of meaning increasingly makes use of
   pragmatically derived interpretations in radical versions of
   contextualism and that this pragmatization of meaning is supported by
   the increasingly common philosophical stance on reference according to
   which reference is to be pursued on the level of cognitive mechanisms
   rather than types of noun phrases. It is in this milieu that I analyse
   the cognitive construct of the primary meaning of an utterance that
   corresponds to the intended and recovered meaning in a model situation,
   derived here by employing the sources of information and processes
   identified in Default Semantics. I demonstrate through selected examples
   that any attempts to regiment meaning by using the explicit/implicit
   distinction, directly-referential/contextually-referential, or
   indexical/nonindexical distinction do not yield the primary meaning
   intended and recovered in linguistic interaction. As a result, the
   question of accountability arises: if the primary meaning can be
   implicit, context-driven and multidimensional, then is it this meaning
   that the speaker should be accountable for? If so, we need a normative
   theory that would predict such meanings. If not, then we would have to
   make the speaker accountable for some content that is not intended. I
   propose that a normative, radical contextualist account that places
   meaning on the level of a conceptual structure, while at the same time
   preserving the truth-conditional method of analysis, acts in favour of
   this accountability on the grounds of primary, intended meaning,
   irrespective of its explicit or implicit status. I tentatively conclude
   by pointing out one obvious corollary, namely that this pragmatization
   of meaning affects both sides of language in the courtroom but not to
   the same degree: the relevant law cannot have a communicative rather
   than textual content beyond certain limitations imposed on the
   generalizations over admissible contexts, while the primary content of
   the plaintiff's and the defendant's contributions, firmly situated in
   the co-constructed context, can easily cross the explicit/implicit
   boundary.},

Title = {Cause for optimism? Financial sanctions and the rise of the Sino-North
   Korean border economy},
Journal = {REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL ECONOMY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {24},
Number = {3},
Pages = {424-453},
Abstract = {This article critically engages with recent arguments that financial
   sanctions are capable of overcoming the shortcomings of traditional
   trade sanctions as well as more targeted smart sanctions.' Much of the
   existing analysis of financial sanctions cites as evidence of their
   success the case of the US Treasury's 2005 accusations against Macao's
   Banco Delta Asia of facilitating North Korean money laundering. We
   argue, however, that analysis of the broader impact of financial
   sanctions on North Korea's principle bilateral economic relationship,
   namely the Sino-North Korean border economy, reveals that such measures
   have merely served to increase the scope of evasive economic activity.
   In particular, financial sanctions have meant that methods of trade
   settlement in the border economy are based primarily on cash and barter,
   with minimal recourse to the official banking system. This raises
   questions not only regarding the effectiveness of financial sanctions
   but also the degree to which they serve to provoke counter-responses
   that actively undermine the broader objectives pursued by sender states.
   Through examining the case of Sino-North Korean border economy, this
   article contributes to a more comprehensive understanding of the
   shortcomings of financial sanctions as a tool of foreign policy.},

Year = {2017},

Abstract = {In race theories of education, there has been a resurgent interest in
   the works of W.E.B. Du Bois, as they apply to the racial politics of
   schooling. This makes sense within a US context because of Du Bois'
   public status as an intellectual. By comparison, there has been less
   attention paid to Frantz Fanon, whose work on decolonization was
   formative in the 1960s and 1970s. This chapter introduces the opening
   that Fanon provided for intellectuals in critically understanding the
   colonial interaction as part of the broader architecture of race
   relations. Although colonial administration has changed and adapted over
   time, the fact of coloniality continues, tucked away effectively within
   the discourse of neoliberalism. Focusing mainly on Black Skin White
   Masks and The Wretched of the Earth, we introduce critical Fanonian
   concepts, like the mask, anti-blackness and violence as a way to explain
   contemporary US race relations and education. By doing so, the chapter
   assesses the continuing relevance of Fanon's lifework against
   colonialism even after the official fall of colonialism, survived by a
   new condition of coloniality that is necessary to take into account if
   Fanon is to remain useful for education scholars.},

Abstract = {The different agreements on oil and natural gas signed by Russian and
   Chinese companies testify to the profound changes in the oil and gas
   policies of both Russia and China. We stress the importance of the
   contractual norms which structure the energy interdependency of the
   countries involved. As there is no international multilateral framework
   able to manage energy supply security, the way the countries involved
   construct their energy interdependence to an extent defines models of
   sectoral governance.},

Journal = {NEW POLITICAL ECONOMY},

Volume = {22},
Number = {4, SI},
Pages = {410-422},
Abstract = {This paper analyses the promotion of financial education by many
   national and international organisations around the world. Drawing on
   the material culture of financialisation, financial education policy is
   perceived as part of a broader neoliberal project to extend
   commodification and (re)construct social and economic reproduction in
   ways favourable to the financial sector. It argues that, while numerous
   contradictions inherent in financial education programmes jeopardise the
   goal of improving individual financial decisions through education, the
   ideological goal of these initiatives is not compromised. It is the
   neoliberal cultural project of cultivating self-reliance and individual
   responsibility at the expense of collective forms of provision across
   new areas of economic and social life.},

Journal = {REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL ECONOMY},

Pages = {144-175},
Abstract = {This paper is the first to investigate the changes in criteria for
   market access under China's Qualified Foreign Institutional Investor
   (QFII) Programmes. By combining insights on institutional change and
   Chinese elite politics, it demonstrates that the evolution of access
   criteria can be explained by interdependent bargaining between Chinese
   party leaders, administrative authorities and corporate interests. The
   2008 global financial crisis triggered fundamental shifts in resource
   interdependencies that altered the bargaining dynamics between these
   agents. The changes in internal and external conditions are decisive for
   understanding how the QFII programmes evolved. The analysis draws on an
   original data-set coupling 91 multi-stakeholder interviews, database
   analysis and internal government records. The findings show that
   institutional change in China's cross-border investment programmes is a
   negotiated economic outcome bridging interdependent state and market
   agents. These results have important implications for the study of
   globalisation and institutional change in non-Western contexts. They
   challenge existing narratives of an all-pervasive Chinese party-state
   that is resistant to change.},

Abstract = {In the rapidly expanding literature on the ethics of climate
   engineering, a lot has been made of the fact that stratospheric aerosol
   injection would for the first time create a world whose climate had been
   intentionally shaped by deliberate human decisions. Intention has always
   mattered in ethics. Due to the importance of intention in assigning
   culpability for harms, one might expect that the moral responsibility
   for any harms created during an attempt to reconstruct the global
   climate using stratospheric aerosols would be considerable. This article
   investigates such an expectation by making a comparison between the
   culpability for any unintended harms resulting from stratospheric
   aerosol injection and culpability for the unintended harms already
   taking place due to carbon emissions. To make this comparison, both
   types of unintended harms are viewed through the lens of the doctrine of
   double effect. The conclusion reached goes against what many might
   expect. The article closes by suggesting that a good way to read this
   surprising conclusion is that it points toward the continuing moral
   importance of prioritizing emission reductions.},

Abstract = {Trade between Europe and developing countries should be shaped such that
   market shares are just and trade flows foster human rights and
   sustainable development both in the global South and in the global
   North. But this is not always the case. While developing countries have
   much to gain from trade, they can also suffer serious losses. This is
   apparent for instance with regard to food security, which in poorer
   countries often depends largely on smallholders and informal markets.
   Rapidly or indiscriminately liberalized (or protected) trade can destroy
   smallholder livelihoods and threaten a country's ability to feed its
   most vulnerable groups-a clear violation of human rights. Similar harm
   may occur if markets in the North remain closed to products from the
   South. This article sketches the link between trade and human rights,
   and describes how integration of human rights impact assessments into
   European Union (EU) trade policy can help ensure sustainable trade
   regimes that do not cause undue harm. It does so by comparing the
   Sustainability Impact Assessment practice and methodology used by the EU
   in the past to the UN Guiding Principles on Human Rights Impact
   Assessments of Trade and Investment Agreements, and by discussing the
   most recent developments in the EU.},

Abstract = {In 2016, over 25 years after the fall of the communist regime, the
   Romanian Supreme Court of Justice convicted for the first time two
   former military officials for political crimes perpetrated in the 1950s,
   the harshest repressive period of the previous dictatorship. The
   verdicts marked a radical break with the prior legal approaches to
   prosecuting communist crimes in this country inasmuch as international
   criminal law (ICL) was now employed in order to overcome impunity. This
   article shows how the current shifts in Romanian jurisprudence have been
   built upon, and have drawn inspiration from, a recent global convergence
   towards the use of ICL for addressing the crimes of dictatorial regimes
   and the obstacles to their prosecution, such as amnesties or statutory
   limitations. It emphasizes the importance of noncoercive exogenous
   influences in enabling changes in the Romanian process of dealing with
   the past.},

Abstract = {Fifty years after the Coleman Report delineated deep inequities across
   race and ethnicity in school contexts and outcomes, American families
   still navigate largely inequitable educational systems. The Coleman
   Reportwith only slightly veiled surprisealso revealed the deep value
   African Americans place on education, their strong motivation to
   succeed, and the high expectations that they have for academic success.
   This article provides a critical analysis of the policies designed to
   increase equity in and access to high-quality education. With a special
   focus on adolescents, we show how these policies are experienced
   differently by families in ways that sustain inequities across
   ethnicity, race, and socioeconomic background. We also review research
   on the experiences of students in schools, arguing that policy attempts
   to mitigate disparities in educational experiences across race and
   socioeconomic condition have had little if any effect.},

Abstract = {Why does sub-Saharan Africa exhibit the highest rates of gender
   inequality in the world? This article evaluates the contributions of
   Christian missionary societies in German East Africa to current
   socioeconomic gender inequalities in Tanzania. Previous studies ascribe
   a comparatively benign long-term effect of missionary societies, in
   particular of the Protestant denomination, on economic, developmental,
   and political outcomes. This article contrasts that perception by
   focusing on the wider cultural impact of the civilizing mission in
   colonial Africa. The analysis rests on a novel georeferenced dataset on
   German East Africabased on digitized colonial maps and extensive
   historical records available in the German colonial archivesand the most
   recently available DHS-surveys. The results highlight the formative role
   of Catholic missionary societies in German East Africa in shaping gender
   inequalities currently witnessed in Tanzania.},

Abstract = {This article responds to Michael Blauberger and Berthold Rittberger's
   article Conceptualizing and theorizing EU regulatory networks, published
   in Regulation \& Governance in 2015. Blauberger and Rittberger
   challenged our previous work on the politics of Eurocracy, disputing our
   argument that political considerations, not functional ones, explain the
   choice of bureaucratic structure in the European Union (EU). Blauberger
   and Rittberger suggest that functional considerations do indeed explain
   why policymakers sometimes prefer governance through European Regulatory
   Networks rather than through more centralized EU agencies, and argue
   that we have misunderstood the preferences of EU legislative principals.
   In this article, we argue that there are significant flaws in Blauberger
   and Rittberger's analysis on both theoretical and empirical grounds. We
   show that a proper interpretation of developments in both telecoms and
   competition lends support to our theoretical claims and not those
   offered by Blauberger and Rittberger.},

Abstract = {EU social policy has generally been limited to the definition of
   non-binding social outcome targets, a governance model known as `second
   order output governance'. However, many EU Member States have failed to
   make progress in fighting poverty. This begs the question of whether a
   more performant EU-level involvement in the field of social policy is
   conceivable. In this paper, we argue that European minimum standards are
   the place to start, including principles for minimum social security and
   minimum wages, as i) the European social objectives cannot be attained
   without guaranteeing adequate incomes to those in and out of work, and
   ii) social co-ordination should thus go beyond broad outcome goals such
   as the reduction of the number of households at risk of poverty or
   social exclusion. We propose to include policy indicators regarding
   minimum income protection in the recently revised EU monitoring process
   of the European Semester.},

Abstract = {With a view to EU democracy, Jurgen Habermas introduced the idea that
   the relationship between the roles of state citizens and European
   citizens should be understood as a form of `divided sovereignty'. This
   notion is a constructive solution to theoretical problems resulting from
   the goal of realizing national and European democracy at the same time,
   but one might suspect that one of the suggested roles comes more
   naturally to most citizens. While state citizenship can draw on national
   identities, EU citizenship appears artificial and constructed, and hence
   not very attractive. I argue that the contraposition of `natural' vs.
   `artificial' sovereigns is inadequate. Both parts of divided sovereignty
   need to be understood in a constructivist sense as they are attributed
   to legal associations. Much in the same way as the idea of national
   sovereignty had to be appropriated in learning processes, citizens could
   grow into the role of EU sovereigns.},

Abstract = {Constitutional lawyers and political scientists have described the
   European Union as a federation of states (federation, Bund). They deny
   that federations generate a new union-wide constituent authority besides
   the pouvoirs constituants of the member states. Habermas argues that
   federative constituent power lies with individuals in their dual roles
   as citizens of the several states and as citizens of the Union. I argue
   that from the perspective of democratic theory, this view is
   methodologically superior to other `dualist' views of federative
   constituent power (J. Cohen), but go on to criticize it in two respects.
   It gives insufficient justification for the persistence of domestic
   pouvoirs constituants, and it reifies their defensive function.},

Abstract = {This article addresses two specific puzzles in the area of regulation.
   The first is the engagement of regulatory intermediaries by the targets
   of regulation. The second is a tendency for regulatory intermediaries,
   once added to the regulatory landscape, to expand their roles
   independently and for reasons of self-interest. The article offers
   important insights into the roles, opportunities, and constraints of
   regulatory intermediaries, particularly because it moves beyond the
   unidirectional understanding of the regulatory process that is at the
   base of the RIT model. After exploring both puzzles, the article
   discusses how (target-oriented or self-interested) intermediation may
   increase the complexity and impact of regulatory capture. It concludes,
   however, that while the model of intermediation is sometimes flawed,
   regulators and targets are generally better off with the involvement of
   regulatory intermediaries than without it.},

Abstract = {Research on informal aspects of the post-communist economy and political
   institutions has developed rapidly since the collapse of the Soviet
   Union. While there is no lack in research on informal practices in
   Russia and other Eastern European countries, comprehensive empirical
   investigations of informality in peripheral regions of the former Soviet
   Unionsuch as the Caucasus and Central Asiaare still rare. This article
   aims to fill this gap by providing an evidence-based empirical account
   of informal practices in post-Soviet Azerbaijan. Drawing its empirical
   data from a two-decade-long ethnographic participant observation carried
   out in various locales of Azerbaijan's capital, Baku, this study offers
   nuanced insights into the hitherto unexplored informal practice of
   tapsh.},

Title = {Contextualising compliance: hybrid governance in global value chains},
Journal = {NEW POLITICAL ECONOMY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {22},
Number = {2},
Pages = {169-185},
Abstract = {Widespread disappointment with compliance auditing in supply chains has
   led to a search for new governance solutions in global industries.
   Recent scholarship on labour standards in supply chains emphasises the
   need for complementarity between public and private forms of governance,
   and the importance of local contexts in shaping compliance outcomes.
   This paper, in contrast, argues that the distinction between public and
   private governance belies the complex interaction of regulatory forms
   and industry dynamics in global production networks. It develops this
   argument via an analysis of the International Labour Organisation Better
   Work programme, which, over the last decade, has metamorphosed from a
   country-specific monitoring programme into a unique model of hybrid
   governance that has been implemented in a half dozen countries in Asia,
   Africa and Latin America. Drawing from field research conducted on
   Nicaragua's Better Work programme, it examines the achievements and
   limitations of hybrid governance, and proposes that these can best be
   understood when the global value chain for apparel is seen as a
   transnational field within which relational struggles between different
   stakeholders at the global and national levels shape the political
   contexts within which particular governance solutions are pursued.},

Title = {Material cultures of water financialisation in England and Wales},
Journal = {NEW POLITICAL ECONOMY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {22},
Number = {4, SI},
Pages = {383-397},
Abstract = {The ownership structure of the water and sewerage sector has changed
   substantially in England and Wales (EW) since the 10 companies were
   listed on the London Stock Exchange in 1989. The majority of firms are
   now delisted and a number of companies are now owned by financial
   investors via special purpose vehicles. In some cases, revenue streams
   from customer water bills have become securitised for decades into the
   future not only to raise funds for investment, but also for finance
   distributions to shareholders. The high financing costs associated with
   these highly leveraged corporate structures are passed on to customers.
   The regulator, Ofwat, tasked with protecting the interests of consumers,
   operates largely within a system of price controls intended to mimic a
   competitive market in the absence of financial speculation. This means
   that regulation steers away from intervening in the financialised
   corporate structures that have emerged around some of the water
   utilities. These manifestations of financialisation are considered to be
   market outcomes'. This paper explores the discourses and narratives that
   have developed in the provision of water in EW to create a situation
   where such rentier transfers are normalised. Using the systems of
   provision approach, the paper shows that the material culture of water
   finance has been constructed along narrow lines with superficial
   consumer consultation, while extensive financial engineering to increase
   shareholder returns continues unimpeded.},

Title = {Subverting the status quo? Climate debt, vulnerability and
   counter-hegemonic frame integration in United Nations climate politics -
   a framework for analysis},
Journal = {REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL ECONOMY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {24},
Number = {6},
Pages = {1052-1075},
Abstract = {This article analyzes distinct articulations and forms of political
   integration of the frame `climate debt' in United Nations climate
   politics from 2000 to 2015. In analysis of this case study, the
   framework of `counter-hegemonic frame integration' is developed by which
   political incorporation of disruptive frames into multilateral regimes
   can be assessed. This enables analysis of frame integration across two
   dimensions: strength of recognition and strength of distributive
   justice. Five outcomes are differentiated: non-integration, disruptive
   integration, covert integration, impotent integration, and dominant
   integration. In doing so, it provides a foundation to more precisely
   assess counter-hegemonic gains, and with it, theorize counter-hegemonic
   network influence in multilateralism. Despite various discursive and
   strategic innovations by advocacy networks, the frame of climate debt as
   it relates to climate vulnerability has been integrated to be largely
   compatible with structures of hegemony and stripped of subversive
   meaning and impact. However, this has not been a linear process: at each
   stage, there have been areas of progress and setbacks in terms of frame
   recognition and distributive justice. The analysis contributes to a
   broader research program to uncover the mechanisms and conditions of
   transformation of unequal power relations within the world system and
   identifies critical areas of future research.},

Abstract = {This paper examines the growing importance of digital-based financial
   inclusion as a form of organising development interventions through
   networks of state institutions, international development organisations,
   philanthropic investment and fintech companies. The
   fintech-philanthropy-development complex generates digital ecosystems
   that map, expand and monetise digital footprints. Its know thy
   (irrational) customer' vision combines behavioural economics with
   predictive algorithms to accelerate access to, and monitor engagement
   with, finance. The digital revolution adds new layers to the material
   cultures of financial(ised) inclusion, offering the state new ways of
   expanding the inclusion of the legible', and global finance new forms of
   profiling' poor households into generators of financial assets.},

Abstract = {Activism is typically associated with work within charities/NGOs or
   participation in social movements. This essay highlights activism
   different from these forms in that it happens without funding or mass
   mobilisation. Instead, it is powered by the longer-term perspective and
   day-to-day efforts of activist citizens'. Based on interviews and
   participant observation in bookshop-cafes and other donor-independent
   initiatives in Novi Sad, Serbia, the essay argues that such everyday
   activism' is significant not only because it supports the development of
   other, more visible, forms of activism, but also in its own right, as a
   counter-space contributing to social change.},

Abstract = {Feminist scholars the world over are increasingly aware of the
   importance of analyzing popular discourse, especially regarding women's
   involvement in proscribed violence. Yet few have looked at Middle
   Eastern organizations, and fewer still at the Mojahedin-e Khalq Iran
   (MEK), a longstanding resistance group whose all-female leadership and
   sizeable female membership present a compelling challenge to prevailing
   gender norms. How do popular media portray female MEK resistors and what
   might these representations signify for our gendered conceptions of
   violence? In examining the MEK's female leadership, this article
   undertakes a close reading of western and Iranian news coverage in an
   attempt to analyze the degree to which these women are painted as
   willful political agents or, as is often assumed, irrational actors
   incapable of autonomous political participation. Following Sjoberg and
   Gentry, I develop four cognitive frames to describe female resistors,
   while also challenging the media's victimizing and sexualizing gaze. I
   thus problematize these women's portrayals as ``maniacal slaves,{''} and
   explain how such gendered rhetoric operates to preclude the notion that
   members of the MEK might practice legitimate political resistance worthy
   of analysis or understanding.},

Abstract = {The article presents conclusions of this Special Issue. It first
   summarizes the empirical findings of the individual contributions to
   this Special Issue in terms of whether EU power was enabled or
   constrained in response to the crisis. Second, the article synthesizes
   these findings to advance some overarching arguments about the EU as an
   actor in this crisis, and the types of power that were evident in this
   case. Third, it examines the significance of the study overall, and
   highlights some key policy implications. Finally, the article takes a
   broader perspective, and suggests that this framework is valuable more
   generally for understanding how various crises might impact the EU as a
   foreign policy actor.},

Abstract = {The private `ethical audit' regime occupies significant, yet
   under-investigated power within global value chain (GVC) governance. We
   argue that while governments and civil society groups accept audits as a
   useful and legitimate extra-contractual tool of GVC governance, audits
   are not politically neutral. Rather, transnational corporations and
   audit firms have vested interests in the formal rules, norms, and
   expectations of the audit regime, and leverage strategic power over
   audit design, implementation, and enforcement. We conclude that the
   audit regime as a global governance mechanism disproportionately
   benefits corporations. Fundamentally, it guards the status quo of global
   production by deflecting attention away from challenging the underlying
   contractual conditions that generate and perpetuate the most egregious
   GVC environmental and social abuses.},

Abstract = {The privileged place that the Catholic Church has held in Latin America
   since colonial times continues to permeate the region's countries today.
   This chapter examines the complex problem of the political presence of
   the Catholic Church in Latin American democracies. It locates this
   presence in the formation of nation states in the nineteenth century and
   in the many processes of democratization in the twentieth century. The
   author then engages with modes of disestablishment in Latin American
   countries, and the intimate link between the constitutional rights of
   freedom of religion and the relationship between the state and the
   Catholic Church. The chapter concludes by framing the church's presence
   in the Latin American public square as a problem of the institutional
   power of the church, linked to contentious histories rather than to
   universal formulations of the right of freedom of religion.},

Abstract = {In this chapter, I focus on the interaction between the rule of law and
   contract: the norm of the rule of law offers contract support for its
   legal form as an agreement between equals, while contract offers the
   rule of law a mechanism by which its normative generality can be
   established beyond the limits of formalized public law. To understand
   the power of the norms of the rule of law beyond the realm of formalized
   law, we need to understand how the mechanisms of contract both respond
   to the rule of law's normative agenda, but also carry this agenda past
   the limits of formalized legality.},

   internationalization of the RMB},
Journal = {REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL ECONOMY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {24},
Number = {4},
Pages = {599-628},
Abstract = {In this article, we investigate the dynamics of contestation and
   adaptation that are unfolding within global financial markets as China
   seeks to internationalize its currency, the renminbi (RMB) or yuan. We
   develop a conceptual framework that stresses the potential malleability
   of the global monetary system. Economic actors and international
   institutions are not static but dynamic and respond to events.
   Accordingly, we highlight two underexplored features of RMB
   internationalization: first, the variegated and politicized nature of
   capital account and currency management controls that China is
   implementing; and second, the manner in which these unique currency
   management systems are interacting with the ideational and institutional
   underpinnings of how transnational financial markets are generated and
   stabilized. Our analytical framework is then applied to examine the
   interface of China's onshore/offshore RMB markets. We argue that China
   is adopting a unique mode of monetary governance that reflects a
   different relationship between the state and market from that which we
   see in the West at present. Whilst the prospects of China `muddling
   through' this internationalization process are uncertain, it remains
   possible that RMB internationalization will transform the global
   financial landscape in deeply qualitative as well as purely quantitative
   ways, ushering in an era of more illiberal state-managed monetary
   relations.},

Title = {Shadow money and the public money supply: the impact of the 2007-2009
   financial crisis on the monetary system},
Journal = {REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL ECONOMY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {24},
Number = {5},
Pages = {802-838},
Abstract = {This article explores the effects of the political reactions to the
   2007-2009 financial crisis on the monetary system. It chimes in with the
   view that shadow banks create `shadow money', i.e. private substitutes
   for bank deposits. The article analyses how the three main forms of
   shadow money - money market fund shares, overnight repurchase agreements
   and asset-backed commercial papers - were affected by the short-term
   government intervention and medium-term regulation during and after the
   2007-2009 financial crisis in the United States. The analysis reveals
   that the measures taken between 2007 and 2014 integrated some shadow
   money forms in the public money supply. In the year after the Lehman
   collapse, the initially private shadow money supply was either publicly
   backstopped or de-monetised as it had broken par to bank deposits. The
   public backstops took on the form of emergency facilities established by
   the Federal Reserve and guarantees proclaimed by the Treasury. Those
   backstops imply that the public institutional framework to protect bank
   deposits was extended to some forms of shadow money during the crisis.
   This tendency has continued in post-crisis regulation. Accordingly, the
   2007-2009 financial crisis has triggered a paradigmatic change in the
   monetary system, attributable to the political decisions of US
   authorities.},

Journal = {POST-SOVIET AFFAIRS},

Volume = {33},

Pages = {16-33},
Abstract = {The Russian Internet remained relatively unregulated compared to the
   media sector as a whole until about 2012. One of the levers for
   increased control over the Internet was ownership, direct or indirect,
   of the most important infrastructure and websites. Control through
   ownership over the Russian Internet companies has increased, but in a
   finely calibrated fashion in order not to spark discontent and risk the
   formation of a social movement. The Internet's global nature, however,
   has made it impossible to use the same methods against international
   companies. The Russian government has had to exert other forms of
   pressure, change legislation, or block entire social networks.
   Furthermore, increasing and more systematic control through ownership
   carries with it considerable long-term consequences and costs, both when
   it comes to the modernization of Russia and in terms of possible rising
   discontent if Internet users no longer accept that the repressive
   measures taken are in their interest.},

Abstract = {In this article I draw on a feminist approach to hybridity to explore
   interview data and observations from my field research in Afghanistan. I
   argue that there is a logic of masculinist protection influencing the
   affective environment of the peacebuilding project there. The
   combination of a perceived patriarchal context in Afghanistan and
   security routines protecting civilian internationals (and Afghan
   elites), which rely on hypermasculine signifiers, help to create and
   perpetuate the conditions in which the female (for both internationals
   and Afghans) is marked with insecurity. I point to hybridity between the
   foreign and female experience, as well as resistance and reflexivity
   within my research. Throughout I explore fragments of power hierarchies
   that cut through the meaning of gender, rendering the female state a
   disempowering one, always referenced in some uncertain, hybrid way as
   protected or in need of protection.},

Journal = {EUROPE-ASIA STUDIES},

Volume = {69},

Pages = {1257-1279},
Abstract = {The article develops a typology of political strategies of coming to
   terms with the past as a theoretical frame of reference against which it
   assesses the transitional politics of memory pursued in Romanian
   post-communist society. It argues that after an initial elusive'
   strategy based on a politics of amnesia gave way to a confrontationist
   stance promoting a politics of anamnesis, the communist past was both
   politically criminalised and symbolically demonised. The article
   concludes by arguing that the failure of the mastering the past'
   paradigm epitomised by the 2006 Tismneanu Report needs to give way to a
   normalising' paradigm of remembering Romanian communism.},

Abstract = {This essay analyses the politics of horizontalitya key characteristic of
   recent forms of protest and activist citizenshipthrough the case of the
   2012-2013 protests in Slovenia. The Slovenian case is illustrative
   because we can trace the emergence of the Initiative for Democratic
   Socialism and, subsequently, the United Left from protest through
   movement to party. Since we believe that horizontality and verticality
   are present in both movements and parties, we argue against a simple
   opposition between movements and parties. In particular, we focus on the
   reasons for the move from horizontalist ways of political organising to
   vertical structures.},

Abstract = {This article investigates the impact of the eurozone crisis on the
   foreign policy of an EU Member State, Cyprus. Drawing on the literature
   on Europeanization of national foreign policies, it is argued that
   Cypriot foreign policy, despite the general frustration caused by the
   financial crisis within broader society, has actually undergone further
   Europeanization. We show that leadership is a critical intervening
   variable in this enhanced Europeanization, as well as pointing to the
   salience of the explanatory mechanisms of social and instrumental
   learning. The contribution of the article is twofold. It offers an
   empirical account of contemporary Cypriot foreign policy and contributes
   to the discussion of the impact of the Eurozone crisis on national
   foreign policy. Both, we contend, remain relatively neglected topics in
   the literature.},

Volume = {674},

Abstract = {Over the half century since the Coleman Report was issued, there has
   been an extensive debate among scholars, policy-makers, and the courts
   about the extent to which money matters in education. This article
   briefly reviews the relevant academic literature and then analyzes the
   forty state court education funding litigations that have considered
   whether there is a correlation between educational expenditures and
   improved student outcomes. I find that that there is now an overwhelming
   consensus that, of course, money matterswhen it is used well. This
   result indicates that policy-makers and judges should shift from
   continuing a fruitless abstract discussion of whether money matters and
   concentrate instead on the significant accountability questions of what
   resources are needed to provide all students a meaningful educational
   opportunity and how these resources can best be used to maximize student
   success, especially for students from poverty backgrounds and students
   of color.},

Abstract = {National licensing examinations are typically large-scale examinations
   taken early in a career or near the point of graduation, and,
   importantly, success is required to subsequently be able to practice.
   They are becoming increasingly popular as a method of quality assurance
   in the medical workforce, but debate about their contribution to patient
   safety and the improvement of healthcare outcomes continues. A
   systematic review of the national licensing examination literature
   demonstrates that there is disagreement between assessment experts about
   the strengths and challenges of licensing examinations. This is
   characterized by a trans-Atlantic divide between the dominance of
   psychometric reliability assurance in North America and the wider
   interpretations of validity, to include consequences, in Europe. We
   conclude that the debate might benefit from refocusing to what a
   national licensing examination should assess: to achieve a balance
   between assessing a breadth of skills and the capacity for such skills
   in practice, and focusing less on reproducibility.},

Abstract = {Understanding gangs and schools requires us to go beyond
   neighborhood-level analysis because spatial analyses tend to downplay or
   ignore social movements as key to fundamental change. This article
   supplements a traditional ecological approach with an institutional
   analysis of both schools and gangs. A history of Chicago gangs reveals
   that gangs are not one thing; at times they have played positive roles
   within schools and taken part in social movements. The author's personal
   experiences with gangs and schools in Milwaukee and Chicago are
   presented as evidence documenting the mutability of gangs, the damaging
   consequences of some educational policies, and the importance of
   including gang members in social movements. The current Black Lives
   Matter movement presents opportunities for nonincremental, disruptive
   change and the potential inclusion of gangs and gang members in a
   broader strategy to create a better society.},

Volume = {672},

Abstract = {Schools often mirror the communities in which they are located. Research
   on rural-urban school inequality tends to focus on the contrast among
   urban, suburban, and rural schools, glossing over the variation and
   similarities within these areas. We provide a richer description of the
   spatial distribution of educational inequality by examining school
   composition, achievement, and resources in all U.S. public elementary
   schools in 2010-2011. We take the traditional census categories derived
   from residential and commuting patterns, and apply them to schools
   across the country in analyses that reveal gradual transitions and
   blurry boundaries among the traditional zones. The results show high
   levels of variation within the suburbs and substantial commonality
   between rural and urban areas and suggest that census-defined
   metropolitan areas are not ideal when considering the geography of
   educational opportunity.},

Abstract = {Increasing backlogs are preventing individual refugee status
   determination systems from functioning, even in some of the most well
   developed asylum systems. This means that asylum seekers must spend the
   first, most vulnerable, years in their countries of refuge without
   having been individually adjudicated to meet the international refugee
   definition. Decline in individual refugee status determination hastens
   an overall decline in refugee rights. It is essential to find means of
   maintaining viable individual refugee status determination systems, even
   as large refugee movements seem to make this impractical.},

   Netherlands},
Journal = {REGULATION \& GOVERNANCE},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {11},
Number = {1},
Pages = {81-94},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Discretion used to be considered a feature of individuals, but growing
   literature shows that it has collective features as well. To develop an
   understanding of the individual and cooperative work of inspectors in
   using discretion and the discretionary room granted to them, we compared
   two inspectorates: the Care Quality Commission (CQC) in England and the
   Joint Inspectorate for Youth (JIY) in the Netherlands. Our analysis
   reveals that inspectors engage with colleagues, managers, and
   stakeholders to include other perspectives, gain mandate, and broaden
   their repertoire. At the CQC, inspectors use their discretion
   collectively; on their own initiative, they involve others in balancing
   and interpreting rules to reach judgments. At the JIY, teamwork is
   central and regulatory teams are granted collective discretionary room.
   We argue that collective work permits both responsiveness and
   consistency. In studying the judgments of inspectors and other
   street-level bureaucrats, it is vital to look at collective work and how
   it combines consistency and responsiveness.},

Abstract = {The nationalistic, xenophobic, misogynistic, and explicitly anti-human
   rights agenda of many populist political leaders requires human rights
   proponents to rethink many longstanding assumptions. There is a need to
   re-evaluate strategies and broaden outreach, while reaffirming the basic
   principles on which the human rights movement is founded. Amongst the
   challenges are the need to achieve more effective synergies between
   international and local human rights movements and to embrace and assert
   economic and social rights as human rights rather than as welfare or
   development objectives. It will be crucial to engage with issues of
   resources and redistribution, including budgets, tax policy, and fiscal
   policies. There is a need for collaboration with a broader range of
   actors, to be more persuasive and less didactic, and to be prepared to
   break with some of the old certainties. Academics should pay attention
   to the unintended consequences of their scholarship, and everyone in the
   human rights movement needs to reflect on the contributions each can
   make.},

Abstract = {This article explores whether the contemporary press adequately holds
   political-intelligence elites accountable when facing Strategic
   Political Communication (SPC) during those long periods when
   whistle-blowers are absent ('journalism-as-usual'). It develops an
   original benchmark of public accountability demands of
   political-intelligence elites that the press should be capable of
   making, thereby providing concrete discursive strategies to facilitate
   this difficult task. Demonstrating its utility, this benchmark is used
   to evaluate press oversight during journalism-as-usual and facing Obama
   administration political-intelligence elite SPC on the Central
   Intelligence Agency's Detention and Interrogation Program. This shows
   that manipulation of the contemporary press occurs through subtle, but
   effective, SPC techniques involving a certain style of information
   provision that influences national, international, mainstream and
   alternative press outlets' accountability demands.},

Abstract = {The Japanese decision to surrender on 15 August 1945 created an
   extraordinary and unique situation in the Chinese province of Manchuria.
   Within hours of the Japanese surrender, a number of special American
   intelligence teams parachuted into Manchuria to gain information on the
   POW's and Soviet intentions for postwar Asia. This paper will examine on
   what occurred when Soviet and American military personnel met in
   Manchuria. Both sides had very different goals and aims for the end of
   war. For the small American force assigned to locate and identify Allied
   POW's, their mission exemplified the already strained relations between
   the United States and the Soviet Union. For nearly every instance of
   cordial and joyous meetings between the two sides there were equally
   difficult confrontations and misunderstandings. These encounters offered
   a preview into the coming Cold War in Asia.},

Abstract = {We explore whether differential access to family-planning services and
   the quality of those services explain variability in uptake of
   contraception among young women in Malawi. We accomplish this by linking
   the Malawi Schooling and Adolescent Study, a longitudinal survey of
   young people, with the Malawi Service Provision Assessment collected in
   2013-14. We also identify factors that determine choice of facility
   among those who use contraception. We find that the presence and
   characteristics of nearby facilities with contraception available did
   not appear to affect use. Rather, characteristics such as facility type
   and whether contraception was provided free of charge determined where
   women deciding to use contraception obtained their contraception. We
   argue that in a context where almost all respondents resided within 10
   kilometers of a health facility, improving access to and quality of
   family-planning services may not markedly increase contraceptive use
   among young women without broader shifts in norms regarding childbearing
   in the early years of marriage.},

Abstract = {The social and political participation of evangelical communities and
   actors in Argentina has been reflected in their increasing involvement
   in debates about public policies on sexual and reproductive health. This
   chapter has two objectives. First, it aims to identify and describe the
   major evangelical actors who have participated in recent discussions on
   sexual and reproductive rights in Argentina, as well as their argument
   strategies. Second, it seeks to explain how these interventions impact
   on the relations between politics and religion in contemporary
   Argentina. Our analysis focuses on the debate surrounding the legal
   recognition of same-sex couples between 2003 and 2010.},

Abstract = {In the global context of increasing inequalities between advantaged and
   disadvantaged social groups, the role of education in achieving social
   justice has taken on new importance. In this chapter we consider two
   widely acclaimed books on social inequality, namely: Thomas Piketty's
   Capital in the Twenty-first Century (2014) and Daniel Dorling's
   Injustice: Why Inequality Persists (2010). We specifically focus on how
   the authors relate problems of social inequality with educational
   disadvantage, naming the relation in terms of meritocracy and elitism.
   We suggest that in the main, Piketty and Dorling hold to distributive
   accounts of educational disadvantage and to an income/wealth-based
   evaluation of social inequality. We also argue that the informational
   basis of Piketty's and Dorling's evaluation excludes an appreciation of
   social justice as `recognition' and thus excludes the importance of
   `epistemological equity' and of `agency freedom' in pursuing social
   justice in educational contexts, particularly in higher education. It is
   through these two foci on recognitive justice that we augment Piketty's
   and Dorling's distributive account.},

Abstract = {In this essay, I describe a puzzle concerning Hart's theory of internal
   legal statements and the internal point of view from which such
   statements are made. The puzzle is tied to a commonly assumed
   requirement for an adequate theory of law (the Requirement, for short).
   According to the Requirement, a theory of law must explain why
   participants in legal practices should justify their decisions by appeal
   to legal norms, rather than pointing solely to how practice-independent
   norms, such as morality and prudence, are triggered by social facts
   about legal practices. Theories of law that are dissimilar in other
   respects-such as Scott Shapiro's planning theory, Ronald Dworkin's
   interpretive theory, and Hans Kelsen's pure theory-all satisfy the
   Requirement. The American legal realists' prediction theory of law does
   not.
   Hart argues that law cannot exist unless officials justify their
   decisions through internal legal statements (ILSs). In an ILS the
   existence of legal practices and moral or prudential judgments about the
   appropriateness of following the standards used in those practices are
   presupposed. An official justifying his decisions solely by examining
   legal practices in the light of moral or prudential norms is not making
   an ILS. This is an important reason that Hart rejects prediction
   theories of law.
   But Hart's theory of law fails to satisfy the Requirement. Hart provides
   no account of why officials should justify their decisions through ILSs
   rather than solely on moral and prudential grounds. As a result, Hart
   fails to explain why law vanishes when officials stop making ILSs and
   begin justifying their decisions solely by reference to morality and
   prudence. I end with a brief discussion of a different, albeit
   speculative, reading of ILSs, under which Hart's theory of law satisfies
   the Requirement.},

   European Financial Transaction Tax},
Journal = {NEW POLITICAL ECONOMY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {22},
Number = {6},
Pages = {709-726},
Abstract = {Since the global financial crisis, a variety of explanations have been
   advanced to account for the weak response by policy-makers to the issue
   of financial regulation. This paper focuses upon the strategic political
   mobilisation of financial actors in order to provide a better
   understanding of their influence within regulatory battles in the post
   crisis era. It does so through a case study investigation of the
   European Union Financial Transaction Tax. Despite garnering support from
   leading member states, the European Commission and Parliament, and a
   majority of the European population, the policy has failed to
   materialise as a result of several postponements and unresolved
   negotiations at the Council of the European Union. Policy-makers have
   also gradually backed away from the aggressive proposal designed by the
   Commission, committing to a range of exemptions that threaten to render
   the policy ineffective at raising significant revenue and at preventing
   industry avoidance of the charge. The case provides evidence of a
   cohesive political strategy conducted primarily by transnational
   financial associations and demonstrates the unique capacity of financial
   actors to secure favourable regulatory outcomes. Specifically, this
   influence is exercised through the recruitment of non-financial sector
   allies and by exploiting the structural dependency fears of
   policy-makers.},

   Equality in Politics: Evidence from 290 Swedish Local Councils},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF WOMEN POLITICS \& POLICY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {38},
Number = {2},
Pages = {199-220},
Abstract = {This article provides the first comprehensive empirical test of how
   women's presence in politics affects male politicians' attitudes toward
   gender equality as an abstract ideal and their personal willingness to
   strive for women's interests. Using a unique survey of all 13,000
   locally elected politicians in Sweden (response rate 63 percent), we
   find a negative association between a greater presence of women and male
   politicians' personal willingness to strive for women's interests.
   However, there is no such effect on male politicians' support for gender
   equality as an abstract ideal. We argue that the found pattern can
   likely be explained by the fact that it may be costly for male
   politicians to personally strive for women's interests, whereas it does
   not cost them anything to commit to gender equality as an abstract
   ideal.},

Abstract = {In this article, I focus on the management of postcolonial difference
   and the production of belonging in a white settler nation-state in order
   to rethink the notion of co-optation. I first develop a theoretical
   framework for understanding co-optation by separating the who and the
   what of co-optation: actors who embody diversity in public, political
   debate become the who of co-optation, as their agency is shaped by
   gendered and racialized processes of subject making. The what of
   co-optation revolves around particular conceptualizations of practices,
   rights and freedoms, associated in this case with gender equality, which
   is rendered an empty signifier in the process. I then illustrate this
   framework by drawing from research on the Sharia-based arbitration
   debate that took place in Ontario, Canada, between late 2003 and early
   2006. I focus on the claims of two Canadian Muslim women activists to
   show that co-optation occurs as attempts to further liberation instead
   advance illiberal practices.},

Abstract = {In the aftermath of the global economic crisis, we have seen uneven
   development in the leading advanced and emerging economies, new models
   of economic growth that vary from country to country, uncertain
   prospects for globalization and challenges of regional globalization,
   looming currency re-configurations, as well as shifting energy price
   dynamics and their influence on political and economic prospects of
   particular states. This paper discusses current challenges for social
   and economic policy in the context of the history of the past 30years.
   With reference to Russia, it focuses on a new growth model, structural
   transformation (including import-substitution issues), economic
   dynamics, fiscal and monetary concerns, and social issues. It concludes
   by addressing the priorities of economic policy.},

Abstract = {The aim of this paper is to shed light on the way the European
   Parliament's diplomacy affects EU power, particularly during times of
   crisis. The analysis is focused on the Cox-Kwasniewski mission that the
   Parliament sent to Ukraine in 2012-13. Based on interviews and existing
   literature, we discuss the genesis and the development of the mission
   and then evaluate its impact. We argue that the mission with time became
   a key diplomatic instrument and enabled EU power projection by giving
   momentum to the promotion of the EU's approach towards Ukraine, which
   was already wavering due to the deadlock over the Association Agreement
   between Kyiv and Brussels and then due to President Yanukovych's refusal
   to sign the agreement.},

Abstract = {Linkage of federal, state, and local administrative records to survey
   data holds great promise for research on families, in particular
   research on low-income families. Researchers can use administrative
   records in conjunction with survey data to better measure family
   relationships and to capture the experiences of individuals and family
   members across multiple points in time and social and economic domains.
   Administrative data can be used to evaluate program participation in
   government social welfare programs, as well as to evaluate the accuracy
   of reporting on receipt of such benefits. Administrative records can
   also be used to enhance collection and accuracy of survey and census
   data and to improve coverage of hard-to-reach populations. This article
   discusses potential uses of linked administrative and survey data, gives
   an overview of the linking methodology and infrastructure (including
   limitations), and reviews social science literature that has used this
   method to date.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF WOMEN POLITICS \& POLICY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {38},
Number = {4},
Pages = {481-497},
Abstract = {This study uses survey data collected from members of the International
   Economic Development Council (IEDC) to assess gender differences in the
   perceptions of female economic developers involved in the policy
   process. The analysis reveals women are more likely than their male
   counterparts to believe access to capital serves as a barrier to
   economic development in the communities they serve. This finding is
   important because bureaucratic perceptions are anticipated to have a
   gendered dimension, because there is ample evidence that women-owned
   businesses less frequently obtain external financing than do those owned
   by men. This obstacle to growing a business may therefore resonate more
   strongly with female economic developers if their perceptions reflect
   experiences and socialization processes shared with the women they
   represent. Results of an ordinal logistic regression model support this
   contention and contribute to the study of economic development and the
   role of women in the policy process.},

   impact of diplomatic cryptanalysis during World War I},

Abstract = {During World War I, Germany sought to provoke numerous insurrections
   throughout the British and French Empires. Examining the influence of
   signals intelligence within one of these colonial settings provides an
   opportunity to measure the operational importance of wartime
   cryptanalysis. Through a careful analysis of the original intercepts,
   this article reconstructs the responses of Room 40, the Admiralty's
   cryptology department, to Germany's Moroccan intrigues and highlights
   the development of intelligence practices. It argues that strategies to
   deploy diplomatic intelligence emerged gradually, but that Germany's
   enduring support for Moroccan dissidents suggests diplomatic
   cryptanalysis only secured modest results within an operational context.},

Abstract = {In the comparative capitalism literature, the European Central Bank's
   (ECB's) `one-size-fits-none' monetary policy played a key role in the
   widening of trade imbalances in the euro area (EA) by being overly
   restrictive for the region's coordinated market economies (CMEs) and
   overly expansionary for the region's mixed market economies (MMEs).
   According to this literature, wage setting institutions mediated how the
   ECB's monetary policy re-distributed resources between the traded and
   non-traded sectors in these varieties of capitalism. By examining three
   separate transmission channels of the ECB's monetary policies (wage and
   price setting in labor and product markets; nominal exchange rate of the
   euro; funding costs and bank credit), this paper goes beyond the
   traditional emphasis on wage setting institutions and draws attention to
   those institutions that underpin the non-price competitiveness of traded
   sectors. Overall, the paper explains how the institutional
   infrastructure of the CMEs bolstered the adaptability of their traded
   sectors to the ECB's single monetary policy and its three transmission
   mechanisms - both during the pre-crisis era of widening imbalances and
   the period of asymmetrical trade rebalancing since the outbreak of the
   euro crisis.},

Pages = {296-310},
Abstract = {The nexus of Islam, gender, race and violence has been keenly revisited
   in some post-9/11 scholarship. The concern over the racialized Muslim
   male body is justifiable in cases of rendition, torture and the kind of
   battlefields that mark the War on Terror. However, the sympathetic
   analysis of the tortured Muslim male body as a permanent and universally
   vulnerable imaginary has necessarily challenged the framing of sexual
   politics for Muslim contexts. This bid to shield the vulnerable Muslim
   male body from Islamophobia and imperialist violence forecloses the
   notion that Islamist patriarchy and politics can themselves be
   fundamentally violent in the post-9/11 moment and within the Muslim
   community. This obscures the range of routine, domestic and normative
   violent expressions observed by men in Muslim societies. This essay
   discusses two cases that illustrate the means and methods by which
   female bodies have been sexed by the narrative of the War on Terror in
   Pakistan. These cases highlight how the academic efforts that seek to
   rescue the racialized Muslim male body complicate the struggle of
   resisting (lay) female bodies.},

Volume = {11},

Pages = {353-367},

Abstract = {The complexity of decentralized regulatory contexts can threaten program
   fidelity, particularly if it results in divergence between program goals
   and the intents of regulatory inspectors. This paper investigates how
   inspectors negotiate the conflicting demands of a decentralized program
   by examining how they perceive their regulatory roles - the primary
   responsibilities that inspectors ascribe to their functions and the
   entities to which they feel responsible - and how these role
   orientations are related to inspectors' attitudes toward the use of
   discretion. The study findings indicate that in the decentralized
   administration of United States organic food regulations, inspectors
   experience multiple, and sometimes conflicting, role orientations. The
   presence of multiple role orientations, however, does not seem to affect
   how inspectors approach their responsibilities. The combined strengths
   of quantitative and qualitative data are leveraged to offer explanations
   for the study findings and identify avenues for future research.},

Volume = {11},

Abstract = {West African states like Senegal are increasingly turning to biometric
   technologies for border security. In this article I argue that this
   trend results from the construction and circulation of knowledge about
   biometrics by a transnational field of security professionals, assembled
   through official publications as much as through professional practices
   such as workshops. I argue that this biometric ideal rests on the
   promise to states in the global south that these technologies enable
   ``smarter{''} and more efficient borders, enhance piestige, and
   facilitate states' integration into global security arrangements. I go
   on to argue that, although the biometric ideal is often shared by
   security professionals in the North and South alike, the implementation
   of biometrics themselves is riddled with failure. These failures are
   revelatory and stem as much from the technical limitations of
   biometrics' border security applications as they do from relations of
   competition and disaggregation between local security professionals.
   Drawing on fieldwork in Senegal, I use the country's entry-exit system
   and biometric documents to give a view of the everyday practices behind
   the deployment of security technologies in the country. In doing so, I
   contribute to research on biometrics in West Africa by adding a focus on
   these technologies security implications.},

Abstract = {In the view of some Deleuzian scholars, societal steering evolved from
   analogue disciplining of static enclosures into network-centric,
   privatized, digital, and global control. This article re-engages the
   control thesis from a decidedly empirical security studies perspective.
   In the age of globalization and urbanization, technological innovation
   and liberal policy ideals, how are security apparatuses reorganized, and
   in what relations do they stand to local societal and political orders?
   The article argues that the Deleuzian framework indeed proposes an
   impressively rich, integrative, and topical research agenda-but also
   that its security studies applications can benefit from further
   development. With a view to vindicating its analytical potential, the
   article first systematizes the control thesis. It then employs a spatial
   and empirical heuristic to inquire into the securing of three distinct
   urban spaces-a site of mobility, a public square, and a place of mass
   commerce-and to illustrate the actual (re-) configuration of
   contemporary security management. Forgoing articulation of universalisms
   about societal steering, the article makes the case for more nuanced
   engagements with security ensembles, their technological evolution, and
   their relations with democratic ideals, globalization, and
   de-territorialization, both in and beyond Western polities.},

Abstract = {Analyzing Soviet films and film criticism from the late Stalin period,
   this article shows how Soviet cinematographers exploited gender
   discourse to produce Otherness. Cinematic representations of U.S.
   femininity, masculinity, love, sexuality, and marriage played an
   important role in constructing external and internal Enemies.
   Cinematography depicted the U.S. gender order as resulting from the
   unnatural social system in the United States and as contrary to both the
   Soviet order and human nature. In line with the notion of two different
   Americas, the films also created images of good Americans who aspired to
   satisfy gender norms of the Soviet way of life. The image of the
   American Other helped shape Soviet gender and political orders. Internal
   enemies' groveling before the West on political matters was depicted as
   causing gender deviancy, and the breaking of Soviet gender norms was
   shown to lead to political crimes.},

Abstract = {EU sanctions on Russia created concerns among its members. It is well
   known that sanctions impose a cost on their targets as well as on the
   senders, as lamented by European governments, but the costs of EU
   sanctions on its members have not been fully explored. This article
   intends to fill this gap by looking at the cost of EU sanctions on
   Russia. Who is bearing the cost among EU countries? This article argues
   that sanctions had a redistributive impact across the EU. Whereas
   exports fell for all countries, with Germany, Italy and Finland in the
   leading positions, the article shows that there are economic sectors
   that increased their exports to Russia after the imposition of
   sanctions, which occurred particularly in countries as Greece, Sweden,
   Luxembourg and Bulgaria. This conclusion is reached by looking at the
   export flows from individual EU member states divided by SITC sectors to
   Russia.},

Abstract = {This article re-examines the role of the media in the UK debate on EU
   membership. It argues that the embedding of euroscepticism in the UK
   stems neither from a single phase in the UK-EU relationship, nor from
   the agency of the UK press or its proprietors. Rather, it resulted from
   the long-standing absence of any pro-European faction within the British
   polity was able to argue for, or defend, the European Union within the
   UK national debate. In explaining this, we expand on the concept of
   issue capture' understood as the ability of a vocal minority to dominate
   the UK's political debate about the EU in the absence of genuine
   opposition to counteract negative claims and arguments. The findings are
   drawn from analysis of a dataset that codes more than 16,400 UK
   newspaper articles published between 1974-2013.},

Abstract = {In this article, I examine the naturalized politics of language in
   international criminal justice in Africa, based on research conducted
   during three visits to the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda
   (ICTR) between 2005 and 2008. Though existing research has demonstrated
   the role of interpretation as meaningful, not technical, in domestic
   bilingual courts and other non-African international criminal tribunals,
   it remains underexamined in courts affecting Africa. I argue that ideas
   that the law and court actors had about language and about Rwandans'
   language practices are important sites for understanding the
   constitution of justice and injustice. I use case proceedings to
   demonstrate how legal and linguistic interpretations are deeply
   imbricated at the ICTR, and show how problems of translation emerged for
   the parties themselves. More analysis is needed of interpretation within
   contemporary international criminal tribunals related to Africa to more
   fully examine complex dynamics of international legal regimes and
   justice affecting Africa.},

Abstract = {U.S. young adults coming of age in the early twenty-first century are
   the first cohort to grow up during the obesity epidemic; justifiably,
   there is much concern about their cardiovascular health. To date,
   however, no research has examined the extent to which there are
   disparities in young adult cardiovascular health across the urban-rural
   continuum. We examine this topic using data from the National
   Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health (Add Health). We find
   that young adults who live in metropolitan core areas exhibit more
   favorable cardiovascular health than individuals who live in smaller
   communities and that population density largely accounts for this
   association. Further, individuals living in more densely populated areas
   in young adulthood relative to during adolescence have better
   cardiovascular health than those who live in areas similar or less dense
   than their adolescent residence. Our results strongly suggest that the
   physical and social features of communities represent important contexts
   for young adult cardiovascular health.},

Title = {The Impact of Committee Composition and Agendas on Women's
   Participation: Evidence from a Legislature with Near Numerical Equality},
Journal = {POLITICS \& GENDER},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {13},
Number = {2},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Previous studies of women's participation in legislative debates could
   not disentangle the possible effect of institutionalized gender
   discrimination from the effect of gendered patterns because of women
   lacking seniority and leadership posts. Costa Rica's Legislative
   Assembly offers an opportunity to control for seniority and leadership.
   The prohibition on immediate reelection means that no legislators have
   seniority. The country's successful gender quota, presence of an equal
   number of men and women committee presidents, and election of the first
   woman president in 2010 all point to women having relatively equal
   access to formal positions of power. In this context, unequal debate
   participation between men and women legislators would indicate that it
   is very difficult to change the gendered nature of an institution. We
   use multilevel modeling to analyze repeated observations of
   individual-level participation in three of six standing committees
   during the 2010-14 term (Agriculture, Economics, and Social Issues) to
   explore differences in patterns of participation under various
   conditions (sex ratios, discussion topics, sex of committee leaders).
   Findings indicate that women are active participants in committees with
   both stereotypically feminine and masculine policy jurisdictions, but
   also that women are more active when the gender composition of the
   committee is less skewed.},

Abstract = {After war broke out between Arab countries and Israel in October 1973,
   the U.S. government asked its allies in the North Atlantic Treaty
   Organization (NATO) to do the unthinkable: establish an agreed position
   on an ongoing out-of-area crisis. Then, on 25 October, the United States
   unilaterally raised the alert level of its armed forces to DEFCON III,
   affecting the NATO area without consulting any allies. These actions
   constituted a radical departure from established NATO practice and
   angered the Europeans. U.S. officials, for their part, were upset at
   what they saw as a dismal European failure to support U.S. objectives in
   the Middle East crisis. In subsequent months, NATO frantically searched
   for ways to improve consultation, especially on out-of-area issues. The
   outcome in 1974 was the promulgation of the Atlantic Declaration, along
   with a series of functional reforms in alliance consultation procedures.
   The crisis forced NATO to adjust to the new trends of globalization that
   were rapidly becoming evident.},

Abstract = {This article reflects on the major themes that emerge in the studies
   presented in this volume, concentrating on implications for federal
   policy and future research. We emphasize that for future federal policy
   to be successful, it will need to be revamped in ways that are
   relatively nuanced, encouraging (among other things) enrollment and
   persistence to degree completion among students who might not otherwise
   take loans or go to college, protecting taxpayers and students against
   investments in low-performing colleges, making federal loan programs
   more understandable to students who need them, and reducing the risks of
   student loan nonrepayment. For future research we make numerous
   recommendations, including calls for attention to debt aversion,
   income-based loan repayment, and the effects of borrowing on a broad
   range of student outcomes.},

Abstract = {The trial of former Lord's Resistance Army (LRA) commander Dominic
   Ongwen at the International Criminal Court (ICC) comes at a critical
   moment for the Court. Its almost exclusive focus on Africa has made the
   ICC a de facto regional transitional justice body, but this approach is
   now facing a backlash from African states, threatening the Court's very
   viability. The Ongwen trial throws into relief the dilemmas of the ICC's
   Africa strategy and shows how difficult it is for the ICC to contribute
   to justice and peace on the continent. Specifically, there are four
   narratives concerning Ongwen's capture, his individual agency, the LRA's
   politics and the Ugandan government's responsibility that the ICC relies
   upon to justify its prosecution of Ongwen and its alignment with the
   Ugandan government. All these narratives face rupture during the trial.
   However, there seems little chance that coherent counternarratives that
   could anchor alternative visions of justice might emerge from the trial
   either.},

Title = {Origins of Informal Coercion in China},
Journal = {POLITICS \& SOCIETY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {45},
Number = {1},
Pages = {67-89},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Informal coercive tactics play an important role in maintaining
   political and social order in authoritarian regimes today, a fact
   variously attributed to the state's incapacity to monopolize coercive
   force and to the strategic concealment of repression from international
   society. Studying the coercive tactics used by the Chinese government,
   this article directs attention to how state institutions and strategies
   create incentives for state agents to delegate coercion to third
   parties. In particular, this article recognizes the importance of
   Chinese leaders' traditional preference to rely on third parties rather
   than formal state force for social control, and also the impressive
   improvements in the institutionalization of state coercion after the
   start of extensive legal reforms in the late 1970s. More important,
   however, is the multilayered and decentralized state structure that
   creates tight constraints on local officials and therefore motivates
   them to use informal coercion. The state structure in China is conducive
   to informal coercion in two ways. First, when local officials pursue
   local or private interests that diverge from central interests, informal
   coercion helps them overcome procedural barriers and avoid scrutiny from
   above. Second, although central and other upper authorities tend to
   restrict local officials' use of force, they often exert considerable
   pressure on local authorities to fulfill various tasks that require
   strong coercion. Such conflicting or unfunded mandates have frequently
   prompted the use of informal coercive tactics. This study highlights the
   difficulty of holding local government officials accountable with formal
   institutions in China.},

Abstract = {This article reconstructs the CIA's exploitation of the Natsional'no
   Trudovoi Soyuz, a right-wing Russian nationalist organization, as a part
   of `rollback' and `stay-behind' covert operations against the Soviet
   Union during the 1950s. Operations such as these relied on the notion
   that far-right nationalism presented a potent counter to international
   communism. The article explores postwar ties between American
   intelligence and the NTS in a shared effort to `roll back' the borders
   of communism. It likewise discusses the ability of Soviet
   counterintelligence to intercept, penetrate, and sabotage nationalist
   networks and their operations backed by Western governments.},

Abstract = {On 26 July 1962, the New York Times published a front-page story by
   reporter Hanson Baldwin which, among many things, showed the
   vulnerability of Soviet land-based missiles, in the event of a first
   strike by the US. Drawing at least indirectly from a National
   Intelligence Estimate, it also showed how US intelligence had obtained
   that information. The story infuriated President John F. Kennedy, who
   believed it harmed the security of the United States. This article
   details an aggressive FBI investigation of who had leaked to Baldwin, as
   well as an initiative at the Central Intelligence Agency to conduct its
   own future leak investigations inside the US, both authorized by
   President Kennedy.},

Abstract = {Although the part played by the British War Office's cryptanalytic
   bureau in diplomatic cryptanalysis during the First World War is better
   understood than formerly, its contribution to military Communications
   Intelligence (Comint) has remained largely unknown. This article
   describes the origins of what eventually became M.I.1(b), its wartime
   development as a military cryptanalytic (and eventually cryptologic)
   bureau, and its post-war demise; it also seeks to identify the factors
   that contributed to its subsequent obscurity. It concludes that M.I.1(b)
   played a key role in British army Comint during the First World War,
   both through its own cryptanalytic work and in supporting and
   coordinating the efforts of widely dispersed field cryptanalytic
   activities, and that its subsequent obscurity has served to distort
   understanding of the development of British Comint.},

Abstract = {Feminist scholars have challenged the neutrality of policymaking
   processes and the outputs resulting from these processes. However, some
   elements of policymaking have not been studied as well as others. In
   this article I explore the concept of evaluation from a gender+
   perspective as an essential step for a complete gender mainstreaming
   strategy, which can help to identify gender issues that should be
   integrated into the content of evaluated policies and to ensure gender
   does not get lost in the policymaking process. This exploration is
   carried out by relying on feminist policy and evaluation studies.},

Title = {Smoke screen? The globalization of production, transnational lobbying
   and the international political economy of plain tobacco packaging},
Journal = {REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL ECONOMY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {24},
Number = {1},
Pages = {87-118},
Abstract = {In 2012, Australia became the first country in the world to introduce
   plain tobacco packaging in an effort to reduce tobacco consumption. This
   move was vehemently opposed by the tobacco industry, which challenged it
   on several levels: nationally, bilaterally and multilaterally at the
   World Trade Organization (WTO). The political behaviour of the tobacco
   companies in this case is puzzling both in terms of scale, operating at
   multiple levels at the same time, and in terms of the countries
   mobilized in their defence. WTO litigation is typically the result of
   multinational enterprises (MNEs) lobbying their own government, but here
   third countries were mobilized. Lobbying in third country contexts, with
   the objective of accessing multilateral dispute settlement systems, has
   been little studied. We thus know very little about the driving factors
   behind such activities, how target governments are selected and what
   lobbying strategies are used. This article draws on emerging research on
   transnational lobbying and a case study of the plain packaging case to
   explore these issues in detail and, by doing so, aims to further our
   theoretical understanding of the political economy of international
   trade in the context of increasing regime complexity and globalization
   of production. In addition, the article sheds new light on advocacy in
   the context of disputes about cross-border challenges to domestic
   regulation.},

Abstract = {Computational Social Science (CSS) is an emerging, interdisciplinary
   approach to the study of social systems. This chapter provides readers
   with an introduction to CSS, and discusses why examining the behavior of
   individuals and groups in social systems from an algorithmic perspective
   provides new and exciting analytic opportunities for the Intelligence
   Community and analytic tradecraft. Through the use of artificial
   societies, commonly referred to as Agent-Based Models (ABMs),
   intelligence analysts can improve strategic intelligence assessments by
   capitalizing on the scientific and tradecraft merits of computational
   simulation.},

Abstract = {The article addresses post-communist transformations in Central and
   Eastern Europe through the conceptual apparatus of Luhmann's social
   systems theory, which sees increasing functional differentiation in
   terms of subsystems' autonomous autopoietic self-organisation as the key
   aspect of these transformations. By applying fuzzy-set analysis, it is
   demonstrated that a radical break with the former communist regime is
   sufficient for the self-organisation of the political subsystem, and
   necessary for the market reforms that are sufficient for the
   self-organisation of the economic subsystem. Moreover, the
   self-organisation of both functional subsystems has clearly contributed
   to development in terms of an increase in the Human Development Index
   after 1990.},

Abstract = {The chapter characterizes Tijuana, Mexico, as a deportation city partly
   due to the large numbers of Mexican migrants deported to the city by the
   U.S. government. Adjacent to Southern California, Tijuana has long been
   a major destination for Mexican migrants headed north to the United
   States. The chapter uses data from the Encuesta de Migracion en la
   Frontera Norte de Mexico (Survey on Migration on the Northern Border of
   Mexico), as well as data from ethnographic observations, semi-structured
   interviews, focus groups, and meetings with deported migrants, including
   deported U.S. war veterans and other deported migrants who have become
   members of a Christian church in Tijuana. Using these data sources, the
   chapter gives a demographic profile of the deportees in Tijuana. From a
   gender perspective, the chapter analyzes institutional and family
   conditions that facilitate the settlement of deportees in the city, or
   that lead to difficulties that drive deported migrants into situations
   of precariousness or exclusion. The analysis also focuses on the
   different strategies that deported parents undertake to cope with their
   forced return to Mexico and their separation from family remaining in
   the United States, as well as strategies to re-establish family
   relations along the divisive border.},

   Political Unity: A Research Note},
Journal = {EUROPE-ASIA STUDIES},

Volume = {69},
Number = {8},
Pages = {1153-1162},
Abstract = {Vladimir Putin's long period in power has so far raised scant discussion
   about the political concepts that underpin real state and societal
   unity, and especially about the domestic political implications of these
   concepts. Despite this, key concepts of his political regime, such as
   sovereignty' and sovereign democracy', have frequently been used in
   Russian political discourse. This essay examines the way the current
   Russian administration has used concepts that stress strong societal
   unity, and the creation of a stable state and societal unity to support
   the development of real functioning dynamics in the society. It charts
   the shift from sovereign democracy' to sovereignty' around 2011-2012 as
   a key discursive concept in moving towards a more isolationist
   international stand and consolidating Putin's power by emphasising
   Russia's unique political tradition, which requires a strong leader as
   the basis of national unity and to ensure Russian sovereignty.},

Abstract = {This article examines the lack of policy response to the 1990 U.S.
   National Intelligence Estimate (NIE) that predicted the collapse of
   Yugoslavia. Contrary to common criticisms of estimative intelligence,
   the NIE was accurate and unambiguous. Why was good intelligence
   unheeded? For some policymakers, the analysis was not closely tied to
   their interests and competed with other priorities for attention; for
   those who were substantive experts, the NIE's grim message was hard to
   accept. Moreover, policymakers read intelligence reports in the context
   of popular concepts - a lingering Cold War lens distorted more than it
   clarified. Finally, while the NIE made hard-hitting judgments, it did
   not include any analysis of opportunities to influence the outcome.
   Rather than pushing an already difficult estimate to the breaking point,
   including opportunities would likely have increased the odds of
   policymakers taking action. These lessons have broader implications for
   analytical tradecraft and the often-challenging relationship between
   intelligence and policy.},

Abstract = {International political economy identifies declining nominal interest
   rates, securitization, and financial liberalization as drivers of rising
   housing prices. Despite witnessing these common credit shocks, however,
   developed economies experienced divergent trends in housing inflation
   since the 1980s. We offer a comparative political economy explanation of
   variation in house prices, arguing that by restraining household
   incomes, wage-setting institutions can blunt financial liberalization's
   inflationary impact on housing markets. Employing quantitative analysis
   and a comparative study of Ireland and the Netherlands, we uncover two
   findings. First, countries where political coalitions in the export
   sector held veto powers over those in the nontraded sector in national
   wage setting realized lower housing inflation. Second, the impact of
   sectoral coalitions on housing prices in OECD countries is similar to
   that of financial variables. Our results suggest that the organization
   of labor politics continues to play an important role in mitigating the
   destabilizing effects of global finance on developed economies.},

Abstract = {What are the disciplinary practices in which inner-city schools engage?
   How is order maintained or restored? Drawing on a three-year
   ethnographic study of a public charter school in Philadelphia, this
   study demonstrates the significance of understanding school discipline
   through a cultural lens. Beginning with a case study of a fight in the
   cafeteria, I describe how teachers, administrators, and students made
   sense of the school's disciplinary ethos and how the disciplinary gaze
   that pervaded the school put invisible pressure on staff and students.
   Teachers and administrators in charge of discipline, who were
   overwhelmingly white, made implicit racial appeals regarding what
   practices were the most effective and fair to students who were
   overwhelmingly black and from single-parent, economically precarious
   households in urban neighborhoods.},

Abstract = {This article investigates unofficial commemoration practices,
   interaction with sites of memory and the fate of the materiality of
   memory - mass gravesites and their remains - in the context of Burundi's
   stalled transitional justice (TJ) process. The focus lies on postwar
   spaces where material remnants of a violent past struggle against new
   layers of developmental, infrastructural build-up and political
   disincentive. The article explores three concrete sites of violence in
   Burundi as these confront different forms of erasure and displacement of
   memory, ranging from physical removal and misplacement of remains to
   symbolic delinkage. In the process, the notions of the public secret,
   the labor of the negative and truth as revelation are revisited. The
   article closes with reflections on the latest developments in TJ in
   Burundi and whether the establishment in 2014 of a Truth and
   Reconciliation Commission spells a decisive break with the past.},

   Micropolitan areas help to define the blurred boundaries of the new
   rural-urban interface, and play a unique and potentially powerful role
   in supporting the upward mobility of low-income youth. In some
   geographic areas, micropolitan counties serve as cores of
   nonmetropolitan America, supporting upward mobility in ways that take
   advantage of their density and scale. In other domains, they are
   relatively low-density transition zones between remote noncore rural
   counties and metropolitan America, supporting upward mobility of
   low-income youth in ways that exploit the opportunities and reveal
   weaknesses associated with nonmetropolitan small size, lack of density,
   and limited technological capacity.},

   Transnationalist Critique of Jurgen Habermas' Reconstruction of

Year = {2017},
Volume = {55},

Abstract = {Arguing from a transnationalist perspective, this contribution contests
   Jurgen Habermas' reconstruction of degressive proportionality according
   to which the principle is justified as a mechanism empowering national
   interest. The critique is developed on legal, empirical and normative
   grounds. In the first step, the article demonstrates that the European
   Parliament (EP) is legally designed to serve as a medium of
   transnational political alignments. Based on empirical studies, it then
   shows that the members of the EP exercise their representative role as
   advocates of political platforms of a cross-border nature. Normatively,
   the contribution argues that it is possible to reconstruct degressive
   proportionality from a transnationalist, European perspective: The
   purpose of this complex legal construction is to establish the
   conditions of an open, fair and pluralistic transnational discourse in
   the EP. Degressive proportionality allows for heterogeneity and
   diversity within the Union citizenry, which remains - for the time being
   - divided in national constituencies, to be articulated politically.},

Abstract = {Drawing on Jacques Ranciere and Engin F. Isin, this essay discusses the
   success of a citizen-led mobilisation in rural Montenegro that eschewed
   the country's predominant ethnopolitical identity cleavages by using
   innovative repertoires of contention. As a result, this grassroots
   movement unintentionally brought into being a transcendent political
   subjectivity that was based on civic principles rather than ethnic
   values. The essay explores how the Beranselo movement embodied a
   democratic practice radically different from already available
   institutional practice of politics, in the process transforming the
   local ethnos into a demos and creating a dynamic of cross-ethnic,
   civic-minded mobilisation, organisation, and solidarity.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF WOMEN POLITICS \& POLICY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {38},
Number = {1, SI},
Pages = {20-41},
Abstract = {For some time feminist scholars have been concerned with rethinking the
   constraints imposed on feminists' strategies by categorical
   distinctions, such as the distinction between women and men. This issue
   has become more pressing due to a political commitment to recognize
   diversity among women and among men (consider here discussions of
   masculinities and intersectionality). This article offers the
   conceptualization of policies as gendering practices as a way to rethink
   categorical distinctions and to direct attention to how inequality is
   done. In this approach the focus shifts from considering how policies
   impact on women and men to asking how they constitute or make them come
   to be. More broadly, this contribution recommends the need to examine
   policies for their interacting, constitutive effects, asking how they
   are potentially gendering, racializing, heteronorming, classing,
   disabling, third-worldizing, etc.},

Title = {Introduction to special issue on the material cultures of
   financialisation},
Journal = {NEW POLITICAL ECONOMY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {22},
Number = {4, SI},
Pages = {355-370},
Abstract = {This paper offers a wide-ranging introduction to the symposium on the
   material culture of financialisation. It begins by addressing the nature
   of financialisation itself, drawing on a tight definition in order to
   distinguish the phenomenon of financialisation from its effects and from
   the looser associations prevalent within much of the literature such as
   the presence of credit or even simply (more extensive) monetary
   relations. In order to locate financialisation within economic and
   social reproduction, of which material culture is a part, close
   attention is paid to the distinctive forms of financialisation arising
   from commodification, commodity form and commodity calculation. The
   differences in the extent to which, and how, these prevail are addressed
   through the system of provision approach and its framing of material
   culture through its use of 10 distinctive attributes of such cultures,
   known as the 10Cs (Constructed, Construed, Conforming, Commodified,
   Contextual, Contradictory, Closed, Contested, Collective and Chaotic).
   The analysis is then illustrated by reference to the papers that follow
   in this volume which demonstrate the diverse ways in which shifting
   cultures have served to embed financialisation in our daily lives. The
   first is on the material culture of financialisation itself and this is
   followed by a number of case studies that include the promotion of
   financial literacy and financial inclusion, well-being, the media and
   finally two sector examples are provided on housing and water.},

Abstract = {My aim in this paper is arguing for interpretive scepticism from a
   pragmatics point of view. The argument will develop in four steps. In
   the first step, I will lay down the conceptual framework I am going to
   use. In the second step, I will make clear what I consider scepticism
   and formalism to be. Here, I will contrast scepticism (non-cognitivism)
   with two varieties of formalism (integral and restricted cognitivism,
   respectively), and set forth a few criticisms of them. In the third
   step, I will consider a sophisticated version of restricted cognitivism:
   the one defended by Andrei Marmor in a series of valuable essays. Marmor
   makes his case by resorting to philosophy of language. I will argue,
   however, that philosophy of language, and pragmatics as a substantive
   part thereof, far from providing support for the restricted form of
   cognitivism Marmor advocates, suggest contrariwise that it should be
   abandoned. In the fourth, and last, step, I will lay down the outline of
   a pragmatic interpretivist theory of judicial interpretation.},

Abstract = {The importance of problem structuring - the activity of making sense of
   problems - has been grasped by many scholars of policy analysis, a
   profession that shares much in common in form and function with
   intelligence analysis. This article imports some of the lessons,
   frameworks and methodologies of problem structuring to intelligence
   analysis from policy analysis. The concept of a Type III error is
   introduced, the analytical mistake of misunderstanding a problem, along
   with several methodologies designed to help analysts structure problems.
   One such methodology from policy analysis, called boundary analysis, is
   demonstrated on a national security case, the 2014 Syrian chemical
   weapons destruction process.},

Abstract = {This article examines the tax on bachelors, singles, and small families
   of the USSR'. The tax was introduced in 1941 to boost the birth rate and
   expanded in 1944 to finance the state's benefits offered to mothers and
   children. The Ministry of Finance eventually moved away from its support
   for the regressive and inefficient bachelor tax and explored other
   tax-based strategies to boost the birth rate and support families.
   However, it was constrained in its reform efforts, both by Khrushchev
   and by ideas about the appropriate role of taxes as the Soviet Union
   progressed away from crisis and towards communism.},
