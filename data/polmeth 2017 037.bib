Journal = {EUROPEAN SECURITY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {26},
Number = {3},
Pages = {454-459},
Abstract = {The re-launch of the EU's security and defence project in the wake of
   Brexit and the election of Donald Trump has focused the spotlight on the
   relationship between NATO and the EU. This article reviews the detailed
   aspects of that relationship as studied in the various contributions to
   this special issue. It argues that, over and above cooperation on the
   ground, the key issue to be addressed, which is usually skated over in
   the ``big picture{''} literature on this question, is: where is all this
   heading? Is there a move towards a clear EU-NATO division of labour (if
   so, will it be geographic or functional?); or are the allies seeking a
   radical new balance of responsibilities and commitment as between the US
   and the Europeans for the stabilisation of the European neighbourhood?
   The paper argues that EU ``strategic autonomy{''}, as called for in the
   Global Strategy document of 2016, can only be achieved through the
   Europeanisation of NATO itself.},

Title = {Resilience as the new EU foreign policy paradigm: a pragmatist turn?},
Journal = {EUROPEAN SECURITY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {26},
Number = {1},
Pages = {1-18},
Abstract = {This article examines the rise of resilience discourses in EU foreign
   policy. The European Union Global Strategy (EUGS) refers to building
   state and societal resilience in its neighbourhood as one of the key
   strategic priorities of the EU. This article argues that the discourse
   of resilience that permeates the EUGS chimes well with a pragmatist turn
   in social sciences and global governance. The EUGS introduces
   resilience-building alongside an emphasis on flexibility, tailor-made
   approaches and the need for local ownership, capacity-building and
   comprehensiveness. More importantly, the new EUGS proposes ``principled
   pragmatism{''} as a new operating principle in its foreign policy. While
   this might suggest a more pragmatic EU foreign policy, a closer
   examination of the EUGS discourse reveals significant tensions between a
   pragmatic and a principled foreign policy, which undermine the added
   value of resilience-building as a new foreign policy paradigm.},

Abstract = {Digitalization refers to the adoption or increase in use of digital or
   computer technology by an organization, industry, country, etc. Several
   sources of information exist that allow the determination of the state
   of play as regards digitalization in Greece; Greece performs poorly in
   all these measurement frameworks. Greece's strengths in relation to its
   ability to progress substantially with digitalization lie in its human
   capital; the broadband penetration and usage; and the research and
   development output. In contrast, its most important weaknesses are the
   lack of importance of ICT in the political vision and government agenda;
   the success of the government in pushing forward the use of ICT; the
   effectiveness of the judicial system in resolving business conflicts and
   in resolving regulation disputes; and the ineffectiveness of the public
   administration. In this chapter, we identify the reasons for this poor
   performance and attribute them to intrinsic characteristics of the
   political landscape in Greece, with a view toward formulating proposals
   for solving inherent, long-lasting problems.},

Abstract = {The main purpose of this paper is to analyse question if, and if yes,
   then what potential have information technologies to solve the
   traditional problems of bureaucracy-tendency to inertness, to depart
   from the mission to serve public good and to transform into one more
   interests group or structure susceptible to cronyism, conflicts of
   interest, corruption and other irregularities. The text is also a
   reflection on how new forms of control over public administration,
   driven by ICT may change it and push it towards participatory governance
   based on the principles of dialogue and civic engagement.
   Before we discuss the main topic of this paper, namely the arguments for
   the proposition that information technologies can limit the risk of
   administrative corruption, it is worth to cite classic authors in
   sociological theory and briefly describe the history of public
   administration in the very context of struggles to limit its
   dysfunctions. The paper will deal mainly with new technologies, but to
   better understand why today we believe it is the information
   technologies that can bring an answer to the question how to control
   administrative corruption, the deficiencies of the traditional methods
   to prevent and fight the problem should be highlighted. In that context,
   it will be easier to realise what is the contribution of new
   technologies in this field. And most importantly, it should also be
   reminded why at all the control over public administration is so
   important, in particular in democratic systems.},

Abstract = {Our archival research dating from the time the doctoral thesis was
   written (2004-2010) have allowed us to outline, along with the
   Romanian-Portuguese diplomatic relationships of the interbellum era the
   controversial personality of the Portuguese diplomat Martinho Teixeria
   Homem de Brederode, count of Cunha. Investigating his diplomatic reports
   and correspondence has created the favorable setting for deducing
   important elements of his biography, which then helped us understand the
   complex personality of the career diplomat and his political thinking in
   an international, but also national, Romanian context. The present paper
   aims at putting together a short biography in order to know his
   character, personality, family, intellectual background and the social
   medium where he has developed to be a political man and a High secretary
   of the interbellum Portuguese state.},

Abstract = {Research shows that violent and organized crime reduces foreign direct
   investment and that armed conflict lowers sovereign credit ratings.
   Building on these insights, I argue that violent crime reduces financial
   institutions' confidence in the capacity of governments to repay loans,
   raising the costs attached to loans, and reducing government debt
   through a ``supply-side{''} logic. Yet, this logic is difficult to test.
   Governments can render lenders indifferent to violent crime by accepting
   higher borrowing costs, resulting in no observed relationship between
   them. It is for this reason that analysis of the effect of violent crime
   on government credit ratings alone cannot tell us much about its effect
   on actual government debt. In this study, I explain how analysis of
   subnational debt from welfare-minded public banks and profit-minded
   private lenders can distinguish the supply-side logic from the null
   hypothesis. Cross-sectional time-series analysis of homicide rates and
   municipal debt in Mexico demonstrates support for the supply-side logic.
   Evidence of the supply-side logic reveals that those governments most in
   need of cost-efficient financing are most likely to be charged higher
   prices for it or priced out of capital markets altogether, signaling the
   need for market intervention in these cases.},

Abstract = {This paper addresses the question of legitimacy in REDD+ governance in
   Indonesia. It develops a legitimacy framework that builds on elements of
   Scharpf (J Eur Pub Policy 4(1):18-36, 1997) input and output legitimacy
   concept and the political economy lens described by Brockhaus and
   Angelsen (Analysing REDD+: Challenges and choices, CIFOR, Bogor, 2012).
   Using data collected through key informant interviews and focus groups,
   we identify and explore stakeholder perceptions of legitimacy. The
   analysis reveals a complex interplay between input and output
   legitimacy, finding that state, non-state and hybrid actors perceive
   output legitimacy (i.e. project outcomes) as highly dependent on the
   level of input legitimacy achieved during the governance process.
   Non-state actors perceive proxies for input legitimacy, such as
   participation and inclusion of local people, as goals in themselves. In
   the main, they perceive inclusion to be integral to the empowerment of
   local people. They perceive output legitimacy as less important because
   of the intangibility of REDD+ outcomes at this stage in the process. The
   findings also highlight the challenges associated with measuring the
   legitimacy of REDD+ governance in Indonesia.},

Abstract = {Countries in the Global Southwhich are contributing an increasing share
   of global greenhouse gas emissionsare actively developing carbon market
   mechanisms, including emissions trading systems and (voluntary) offset
   mechanisms. This article analyzes past and emerging experiments with
   carbon market mechanisms in Thailand and Vietnam, in the context of
   their domestic political economies and the shifting dynamics of the
   global climate governance regime. Drawing from thirty-three in-depth
   interviews and document analysis, I show the changing roles of
   government, the private sector, civil society, and donor and
   multilateral actors in these countries. Moreover, the article identifies
   key factors that may play roles in the furtherand more
   synergisticdevelopment of carbon market mechanisms: the generation of
   domestic demand for carbon credits; building and keeping human capacity
   and adequate data; creating space for civil society; ensuring
   coordination within the government and between sectors, notably the
   energy sector; and establishing further linkages with regional (Asian)
   and global carbon market mechanisms, such as those in China, Japan, and
   South Korea. These findings suggest that market-based mechanisms with
   high social and environmental integrity are one of the options that
   countries in the Global South have to achieve low-carbon development in
   the post-Paris climate change regime.},

   Iron Fertilization},

Volume = {17},

Abstract = {States, transnational networks of scientists, corporate actors, and
   institutions in the climate change regime have known for decades that
   iron ore, when dumped in the ocean, can stimulate the growth of
   plankton. Over the past twenty years, normative disagreements about
   appropriate behavior have shaped international governance of the
   phenomenon. Prior to 2007, firms lobbied governments to treat the oceans
   as a carbon sink and to allow corporations that dumped iron to sell
   carbon credits on the international market. However, after 2007 a
   transnational coalition of oceanographers and advocates opposed this
   agenda by linking it to an emergent antigeoengineering discourse.
   Crucial to their efforts was their interpretation of uncertainty: for
   opponents, scientific uncertainty implied possibly devastating
   consequences of iron dumping, which was thus best addressed with extreme
   caution. This normative approach ultimately shaped governance, since
   advocates successfully used it to lobby institutions in ocean governance
   to prevent carbon credits from being issued for ocean fertilization.
   Since these subjective understandings of certainty influenced global
   ocean governance, this article explains international behavior as a
   consequence of changing norms.},

Abstract = {Since its inception, the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change has
   been inclined to natural scientific and technocratic perceptions of
   climate change challenges and policy solutions. Furthermore, states have
   traditionally been depicted as the main subjects of international
   climate politics. Only in 2010, concrete references to human rights were
   incorporated into UN climate agreements. This has a double binding
   force: First, states thereby re-emphasize the principal validity of
   those standards that they have acknowledged-qua signature and/or
   ratification-as guiding their actions: the social and political rights
   that are captured in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the
   two binding human rights covenants. Second, the incorporation of human
   rights norms into UN climate agreements officially and formally broadens
   the normative scope of negotiating and implementing these policies.
   However, after 2010, states have neither substantiated this engagement
   nor further built on it argumentatively. In contrast, human rights
   references are-again-mostly absent from states' positioning in UNFCCC
   politics. In this article, we aim at explaining this empirical puzzle.
   In the first part, we elaborate our theoretical approach and carve out
   the functional, political and legal linkages between human rights and
   climate politics. Building upon participatory observation, expert
   interviews and analysis of primary and secondary documents, this will
   then be followed by explaining parties' anew reluctance to further apply
   a human rights-based approach in climate politics.},

Abstract = {Observers have long noted Brazil's distinctive racial politics: the
   coexistence of relatively integrated race relations and a national
   ideology of ``racial democracy{''} with deep social inequalities along
   color lines. Those defending a vision of a nonracist Brazil attribute
   such inequalities to mechanisms perpetuating class distinctions. This
   article examines how members of disadvantaged groups perceive their
   disadvantage and what determines self-reports of discriminatory
   experiences, using 2010 AmericasBarometer data. About a third of
   respondents reported experiencing discrimination. Consistent with
   Brazilian national myths, respondents were much more likely to report
   discrimination due to their class than to their race. Nonetheless, the
   respondent's skin color, as coded by the interviewer, was a strong
   determinant of reporting class as well as race and gender
   discrimination. Race is more strongly associated with perceived
   ``class{''} discrimination than is household wealth, education, or
   region of residence; female gender intensifies the association between
   color and discrimination.},

Abstract = {Over the last two decades, business actors have received growing
   attention in global environmental politics. In the context of climate
   change, scholars have demonstrated the capacity of business actors to
   directly shape outcomes at the national, international, and
   transnational levels. However, very little work has focused exclusively
   on business actors in the coal and utility industries. This is
   surprising, given that resistance from these industries could delay or
   even derail government attempts to address climate change. Accordingly,
   this article focuses directly on the preferences of business actors in
   the coal and utility industries. Drawing on interviews with executives
   across the US energy sector, it considers business preferences on two of
   the most important attempts by the Obama administration to limit
   emissions from coal: the Waxman-Markey bill and the Clean Power Plan. In
   doing so, it provides new insights about the preferences of these actors
   and the divisions within these industries that could be exploited by
   policy-makers and activists seeking to enact climate change regulations.},

Title = {What is adaptation to climate change? Epistemic ambiguity in the climate
   finance system},

Abstract = {Over the past decade developed states have committed significant public
   financing for climate change adaptation. Much of this public financing
   flows through international development organizations. States have
   delegated the implementation and monitoring of adaptation to existing
   international organizations such as the World Bank, the United Nations
   Development Programme, and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation
   and Development. Scholars have noted that states delegate discretion to
   specialized organizations to perform a task on their behalf, but have
   not explored how uncertainties about the nature of the task affect
   delegation. This article addresses this gap by distinguishing the
   concept of epistemic ambiguity (when states are uncertain about the
   exact nature of a task) from strategic ambiguity (when states do not
   reach consensus over a task due to political differences) in order to
   address the question: how have states and international organizations
   defined and implemented adaptation activities? The question is answered
   through case studies of: (1) adaptation projects administered by the
   United Nations Development Programme and the International Organization
   for Migration in Kenya; and (2) states' and international organizations'
   attempts to develop methodologies for reporting adaptation financing.
   The case studies are based on: primary documents published by states and
   international organizations, secondary literature on climate finance,
   and interviews with adaptation experts. This article argues that states
   have not precisely defined adaptation, and that this is substantially
   due to epistemic ambiguity. It then identifies two consequences of
   epistemic ambiguity: a proliferation of activities labelled as
   adaptation, and difficulties tracking and monitoring adaptation
   assistance.},

Title = {The reconstructed City Palace and Humboldt Forum in Berlin:
   restoring architectural identity or distorting the memory of historic
   spaces?},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CONTEMPORARY EUROPEAN STUDIES},

Abstract = {Since German unification in 1990, Berlin has undergone drastic
   reconstruction. Remnants of the past were unearthed and vestiges of the
   German Democratic Republic (GDR) dismantled, as the city struggled to
   redefine itself in the historic city centre. This essay focuses on the
   Schlossplatz, a site of contentious debate about its appropriate use and
   aesthetic and architectural construct. The approved design is the facade
   of the Berlin City Palace, which will house the Humboldt Forum. The
   Palace suffered significant damage during allied air raids on Berlin and
   in 1950 the GDR demolished the remains of the structure. By 1976, the
   GDR had constructed the Palast der Republik {[}Palace of the Republic]
   there. In 2003, the German Government decided to raze that structure.
   Intended to restore a missing architectural link to the historic centre,
   the reconstruction of the Palace facade has been fraught with
   controversy. I situate the reconstruction plan within the context of
   architectural debates during the last 25 years. I analyse the political,
   social and cultural values that sparked the debates, and pose the
   questions: How does this reconstruction confront Berlin's historical
   legacies? What does a Palace symbolize? What influence will the
   reconstruction have on other remembrance projects in the city centre?},

Abstract = {The paper attempts to look at the British Union of Fascists' (BUF)
   propaganda in the light of the partial agreement or `new consensus' that
   has emerged in fascist studies in recent years. Based on the official
   BUF party press, publications, pamphlets, propaganda posters, speeches
   and the public appearances of the movement's leading figures and other
   forms of propaganda, this article analyses the propaganda of the BUF as
   not just in terms of such crude `brainwashing' or `social control', but
   also as a form of social engineering - in other words, as a serious
   attempt to realise the ideas of an alternative modernity and of a
   political, economic, social and cultural revolution which enlists the
   enthusiasm, commitment and creativity of the fascist cause.},

Series = {Europe in Crisis},
Year = {2017},
Pages = {1-12},
Abstract = {Analyses of the Great Recession following the 2008 financial crash have
   neglected its effects on migrants and their integration into Western
   societies. This section disentangles the relevant theoretical debates
   and sets up the subsequent empirical analysis. Global cities scholars
   expect serious economic crises to widen socio-spatial polarization,
   sharpening inequalities and leaving neighborhoods with greater
   concentrations of residents with similar ethnic and social class
   backgrounds. Cities must resist the negative effects on migrants'
   structural and residential integration to secure long-term stability and
   prosperity. At the same time, cultural diversity, particularly its
   manifestation in ethnic neighborhoods, is a valuable asset for a
   ``creative{''} city in the competition with other urban centers. This
   celebration of ethnicity runs counter to worries about the
   disintegrative effects of spreading socio-spatial divisions.},

Abstract = {Considering the current process of horizontal Europeanisation which has
   resulted from the new opportunity structure created by the EU, this
   article discusses to what extent the European Member States are
   economically and socially intertwined. The proposition of this paper is
   that social interactions go hand in hand with economical interactions
   between the European Member States. In order to validate this
   assumption, a horizontal Europeanisation index that measures
   Europeanisation in contrast to globalisation was developed. The
   underlying variables of our index cover 25 European countries and were
   mainly collected from OECD and EUROSTAT. Almost all European countries
   are economically more Europeanised than globalised. We observed a medium
   correlation between the economic and social dimension, indicating a
   rather low systematic pattern between the two dimensions of horizontal
   Europeanisation in 2011. However, this assumption cannot be upheld when
   considering the time perspective. When comparing 2007-2011, social
   cross-border transactions are relatively disconnected from economical
   cross-border transaction.},

Pages = {143-162},
Abstract = {Viktor Yanukovych's ouster from power in 2014 was widely celebrated in
   Europe as a step forward for democracy in Ukraine. What is now somewhat
   forgotten, however, is that the European Union (EU) was closely engaged
   with the Yanukovych regime, offering it a favorable Association
   Agreement even as the country regressed with respect to democracy. This
   article examines the EU's policy toward Ukraine during Yanukovych's
   presidency (2010-2014), highlighting the disconnection between the EU's
   rhetorical commitment to democracy and events in Ukraine. It explores
   the attempt by the EU to impose conditionality, arguing that EU
   frustration with Ukraine eventually led it to water down its demands in
   the hopes of claiming success in furthering EU-Ukraine ties.},

Abstract = {The latest wave of European integration process, cultural Europeani
   zation, includes complex processes, such as the attempts to create a
   shared European memory that would transcend national interpreta tions of
   the past. The cultural Europeanization can be perceived as a narrative
   operation: in it the EU, Europe, and Europeanness are given meanings and
   made sense of through narrativization. The article investigates the EU's
   attempts to create a shared European memory by analyzing the exhibition
   narrative of the Parlamentarium, the visitors' center of the European
   Parliament. The analysis indicates how the construction of an official
   shared European memory is operationalized through textual and narrative
   devices such as intertextuality and the pending narrative structure. I
   argue that the EU's memory texts are performative narratives which do
   not only describe a shared European memory in a particular way but also
   position the receivers as active agents in the story of the EU-Europe
   and invite them to produce it on their own initiative.},

Journal = {MEDITERRANEAN POLITICS},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {22},

Pages = {464-483},
Abstract = {Techniques of governance in the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan do not
   follow a single or unifying logic. Despite a more than decade-long shift
   towards a neoliberal orientation, market-disciplinary policies coincide
   with important exceptions. This article employs a modified variegated
   neoliberalization approach to explore one such exception. Specifically,
   it analyses the recent debate over the country's bread subsidy to
   elucidate key elements of Jordan's socio-economic transformation. The
   persistence of this long-standing welfare programme is linked to the
   uneven pathways of Jordanian neoliberalization and two potent political
   rationalities imbricated in this process.},

Abstract = {This paper has three sections. Starts tracing the emergence and
   consolidation of regional political autonomy at the European level, in
   particular following the First World War and the recognition of Aland
   autonomy. Turning to our country, the second section identifies the
   Portuguese adoption of regional autonomy for the Azores and Madeira in
   the second half of the XX century, inserting it in the context of
   overall European experience. Finally, assuming a prospective character,
   the last section presents a few proposals aiming at the consolidation
   and modernization of the regional political autonomies of the Azores and
   Madeira as well as the respective adequacy to the requirements of
   contemporary life.},

Volume = {17},

Abstract = {This article examines regional environmental governance (REG) through
   the lens of human geography theory on scale. Drawing on a case study of
   the Micronesia Challenge, a regional conservation commitment among five
   Pacific islands, I advance a critical theory of REG as a scaling process
   and tool of politics through which regions are (re)made and mobilized in
   support of diverse agendas. Results highlight understudied dimensions of
   REG, including: motivations for scaling environmental governance to
   regions; the co-production of regional and global environmental
   governance; the mutable expression of regionality within REG; and the
   ways in which REG is leveraged for resource mobilization, global
   visibility and influence, and conservation. The potential for REG to
   empower subaltern groups while advancing conservation is promising, and
   an important area for future research. The overall contribution of this
   article is a more complex, politicized understanding of REG that
   complicates a scholarly search for its inherent characteristics.},

Title = {Narratives of the nation in the Olympic opening ceremonies: comparative

Journal = {NATIONS AND NATIONALISM},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {23},

Abstract = {This paper examines the ways in which nationalism and the narratives of
   the nation were constructed in the Olympic opening ceremonies in Beijing
   2008 and London 2012. The ritual of the opening ceremony represents a
   concentration of features, qualities and messages that combine the local
   and global, the culturally specific and universal, in a complex
   production. Using textual analysis of the telecast of the above two
   opening ceremonies, the study found that the Beijing 2008 opening
   ceremony used a grand narrative of progress, emphasising the unified
   identity of Chineseness, while privileging the official narrative of the
   nation and one collective identity. In contrast, the London 2012 opening
   ceremony highlighted the fragmented but diversified identity of
   Britishness, transpiring social inclusivity, cultural hybridity and
   multiculturalism. This may be related to the rise of different type of
   nationalism in the context of increasing globalisation. The Beijing
   opening ceremony represented the Sinocentric Chinese new nationalism,
   whereas the London 2012 counterpart, up to a point, highlighted
   civic-based multicultural nationalism.},

Abstract = {Informed consent can assist in mitigating investment risks associated
   with forestry carbon trading in North Korea by supporting corporate
   responsibility. Scientific developments for collecting information
   necessary to informed consent far outpace the development of
   inter-Korean regulatory frameworks. This paper seeks to identify how the
   intersection of legal and technological disciplines can foster informed
   consent, through the responsible application of satellite data. The
   permanent record of standard satellite remote-sensing systems
   demonstrates its capability of presenting area-wide visual evidence of
   forest conditions. Such data are essential to initiating informed
   consent, establishing a carbon stock baseline, detecting and quantifying
   rates of land-cover change, and quantifying above-ground biomass stocks
   as specified in the Kyoto Protocol. This research could be a valuable
   reference for utilizing the capabilities of satellites with informed
   consent obligations in North Korea by suggesting the provision of
   realistic informed consent mechanisms.},

Abstract = {Briefly reviewing the evolution of the field of women development, the
   author argues that the field has lost the dynamism characteristic of
   earlier periods of constructive tension between theory and practice that
   led to the adoption of the gender and development framework and the
   incorporation of issues of multiculturalism, human rights, and political
   participation into a field that had largely been defined in economic
   terms. Today, however, critical theory is caught in an
   ``anti-neoliberal{''} position that is increasingly outdated and that
   has interpreted women's work, individual agency, and the role of the
   state in ways that hinder rather than facilitate new thinking and better
   outcomes for women participants in WID/GAD projects and programs.},

Abstract = {The foreign policy of Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen, who was elected
   in 2016, will be closely watched by Beijing and countries in Southeast
   Asia. Before her inauguration, Tsai stated that her administration would
   pursue a so-called ``New Go South Policy{''} (xin nanxiang zhengce),
   i.e. a foreign policy focused on building up ties with countries in
   Southeast Asia as well as in South Asia. A similar policy was initiated
   by two former presidents of Taiwan, Lee Teng-hui and Chen Shui-bian.
   This article provides a framework to analyze the determinants,
   objectives, policy dimensions and scope of President Tsai's New Go South
   Policy. It examines and compares the Go South Policies of previous
   administrations, together with former President Ma Ying-jeou's policy
   towards Southeast Asia. Based on these discussions, a prospective policy
   analysis of President Tsai's Go South Policy is provided. It is argued
   that Tsai's Go South Policy will help enhance Taiwan's soft power,
   increase the island's presence in Southeast Asia but will not be used to
   counterbalance China Taiwan economic integration.},

Abstract = {This paper examines how hockey is used to construct and demarcate the
   Canadian national community from external others, namely, the USA,
   Europe and Russia/USSR. The paper suggests popular nationalist
   narratives around the sport of hockey construct difference from external
   others in ways that place them in tension with state and corporate
   interests. Drawing on the concept of everyday nationalism, this article
   explores how the interplay between international competition, national
   identity and commercial sport has made hockey an ambiguous and contested
   national symbol in Canada.},

Abstract = {Poland has become one of the more decentralized states in Europe. Local
   governments now control a third of all public expenditures. They have
   also delivered the goods modernizing the country's infrastructure and
   restructuring its schools. This success cannot be attributed to
   widespread civic engagement because decentralization in Poland was
   clearly a ``revolution from above.{''} Nor can it be attributed to the
   implementation of rules typically thought to enhance accountability in
   decentralized polities because Polish local governments do not finance
   themselves, and many of their responsibilities remain poorly defined.
   Instead, Poland's success is due to an array of institutions designed to
   train, professionalize, discipline, and empower newly elected local
   elites. These institutions suggest that creating effective local
   governments may lie less in ``getting the rules right{''} or in
   empowering citizens to participate in their own governance, than in
   institutions that encourage local governments to monitor themselves
   while embedding them in the regulatory structure of the state.},

Abstract = {Survey participants are increasingly responding to Web surveys on their
   smartphones as opposed to their personal computers (PCs), and this
   change brings with it some potential data-quality issues. This study
   reports on a randomized crossover experiment to compare the effect of
   two different devices, smartphones and PCs, on response quality in a Web
   survey conducted in a probability-based panel. Participants (n = 1,390)
   were invited to complete an online questionnaire on both a smartphone
   (mobile Web) and PC (PC Web) in sequence. We hypothesized that
   smartphone use would result in lower-quality responses because people
   are more likely to use smartphones while multitasking or while around
   other people and because they could have difficulty recording their
   answers using a small touchscreen. While we found that respondents who
   participated in this study were more likely to multitask and more likely
   to be around other people when using smartphones, these factors had
   little impact on data quality. Respondents were at least as likely to
   provide conscientious and thoughtful answers and to disclose sensitive
   information on smartphones as on PCs. When using smartphones, however,
   respondents seemed to have trouble accurately moving a small-sized
   slider handle and a date-picker wheel to the intended values. Overall,
   we find that people using smartphones can provide high-quality
   responses, even when their context is more distracting, as long as they
   are presented with question formats that are easy to use on small
   touchscreens.},

Abstract = {In this article, it is argued that several changes are underway in the
   city of Rio de Janeiro related to what has been called neoliberal
   entrepreneurial governance, involving a process of creative destruction
   of urban structures, institutional arrangements for the management, and
   regulation of urban space. In particular, one must consider the context
   of the city's preparation to receive two sports mega-events, the 2014
   FIFA World Cup and the 2016 Summer Olympic Games. Supported by a
   coalition of economic, political, and social interests, this project
   seems to hit specifically the urban configuration of certain areas,
   notably Barra da Tijuca, the Port Area and the South Zone, pointing
   toward the deepening of socio-spatial inequalities in the city of Rio de
   Janeiro. In this sense, one can say that the current changes go toward
   something that might be called neoliberal modernization.},

Title = {``Here is your mission, now own it!{''} The rhetoric and practice of
   local ownership in EU interventions},
Journal = {EUROPEAN SECURITY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {26},
Number = {4},
Pages = {461-484},
Abstract = {One of the core principles of EU interventions under the Common Security
   and Defence Policy (CSDP) has been local ownership. While the EU takes
   pride in fully respecting this principle, the existing research suggests
   that the implementation has been far from smooth. However, we still know
   very little how this principle is conceptualised and operationalised,
   let alone why its implementation has been so difficult. Drawing on
   document analysis and 27 in-depth interviews, the article makes 3
   arguments. First, ownership is increasingly construed in the EU policy
   rhetoric as a middle ground between imposition and restraint. Second, in
   practice, ownership is operationalised as an externally driven, top-down
   endeavour, resulting in the low degree of local participation. Third, in
   addition to the obstacles normally faced by other peace-builders, the
   EU's efforts to implement ownership are constrained by the politics and
   policy-making of CSDP. The arguments are illustrated in a case study of
   the European Union Mission on Regional Maritime Capacity Building in the
   Horn of Africa (EUCAP Nestor).},

   policies of radical left parties in western Europe before and after 1989},

Abstract = {The fall of the communist regimes in central and eastern Europe was a
   shattering event for the western European radical left, causing many
   parties to change their names and strategies. Despite prophesies
   pointing to the death of radical anti-capitalist politics, radical left
   parties (RLPs) still exist in all parts of Europe, and in many countries
   they have even been able to increase their influence. This paper seeks
   to provide a comparative mapping of the policies and policy positions of
   western European RLPs before and after the fall of communism. The
   results of the examination indicate that although leftward trends can be
   observed in many RLPs in the early 2010s, the general, long-time, trend
   shows that the radical left family - and especially democratic socialist
   parties - has become less radical with regards to the core left-right
   dimension. Moreover, the study also shows that many RLPs and, again,
   especially democratic socialist parties - have become more interested in
   other, non-socioeconomic, issues. Despite the rise of new left issues,
   the radical left is, however, still distinguishable from other parties
   mainly through their comparatively strong emphasis on old, traditional,
   left issues.},

Abstract = {The shock of refugee crisis from the fall of 2015 and terrorism in
   European Union space has called again into question the topic of
   European borders. In the present paper we intend to show that the
   process of the European integration has been marked by the division
   within the EU especially after the last enlargement eastward (2004/2007)
   take forms of fragmentation. Initally, the financial and economic crisis
   has produced new forms of division which have fragmentation aspect
   designed to create new European borders in the area of EU, but related
   to the internal process harmonization. Secondly, the Ukranian crisis,
   due the implications on external security of European Union, will
   multiply the fragmentation, but in this case being disputed the national
   security of the states located on the eastern borders of the EU.
   Finally, the refugee crisis has led to a real psychosis of security not
   only at the external borders of the European Union but also to the
   internal borders reaching national security sensitivities of member
   states, hence there is danger that the EU not only to close between hard
   borders but to bring the European project decades ago.},

Abstract = {This article is intended to contribute to the understanding of the
   socio-territorial processes in school results, based on the following
   questions: (a) Is the center-periphery model sufficient for
   understanding of more complex processes, such as the Rio (Carioca) model
   of residential segregation?; (b) Is the school performance of the 4th
   and 8th grades (respectively 10 and 14 year old) students in the public
   education system associated with the socio-spatial organization of the
   city of Rio de Janeiro?; (c) Which mechanisms can be proposed as
   hypotheses or seem more plausible in explaining the relation between
   territory and school results in this urban context? In order to handle
   these questions, this chapter points out the importance of taking the
   social organization of the territory into consideration as a sphere that
   is also capable of limiting the overall increase in school effectiveness
   and of its role in the democratization of access to educational
   opportunities.},

Title = {Re-writing complexity through fragments: mapping Milan in the
   twenty-first century},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CONTEMPORARY EUROPEAN STUDIES},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {25},
Number = {4},
Pages = {495-509},
Abstract = {This article engages with the powerful nature of individual fragments in
   challenging the stereotypical images of the city, in particular those
   images that tie Milan almost exclusively to fashion, design, or events
   like Expo 2015. Using a series of diverse fictional and semi-fictional
   texts published during the last five years, this article argues that in
   order to understand Milan in the twenty-first century one needs to start
   at grassroots level. Despite an attention to fragments, to the
   individual life, all the aforementioned publications stress the need to
   abandon excessively individualistic positions to rediscover a way of
   connecting, a sense of community, and the importance of promoting
   tolerance and multiculturalism. In this context, graffiti are
   particularly important as `writing' engages with the local space of the
   street but at the same time is a global phenomenon, thus raising
   interesting questions about identity and place-making in a globalised
   world. Milan is an ideal case study for this kind of reflection as in
   the late 1980s and 1990s graffiti were frequently associated with social
   centres and thus their subversive nature was inevitably emphasised.},

Abstract = {This article examines clientelistic politics during a local election in
   a fishing community in South Sulawesi, Indonesia. Numerous studies have
   identified Indonesia's fishing communities as locations of hierarchical
   social relations characterized by patron-client relations connecting
   boat owners and other traders with fishers, in which the latter are
   frequently deeply indebted to the former. Through a study of the 2017
   local election in Takalar district, this article demonstrates that these
   social patterns are readily transferred to the political sphere, giving
   rise to a form of traditional brokerage in which coastal patrons act on
   behalf of candidates to direct their clients' voting behaviour. At the
   same time, coastal villages also saw significant patrimonial brokerage,
   in which the key actors were state officials, and political brokerage in
   which candidates formed campaign teams involving miscellaneous political
   and social networks and local community leaders. Distribution of
   patronage, in the form of money, goods and favours, was widespread. This
   article thus illustrates the complexity and competitiveness of
   contemporary clientelistic politics in Indonesia, including in a
   community in which traditional forms of clientelism are deeply
   entrenched.},

Abstract = {UNESCO's World Heritage Convention provides for the protection of
   natural and cultural heritage deemed to be of Outstanding Universal
   Value. The 1031 sites inscribed on World Heritage List are a source of
   prestige for the countries where they occur. However, conflicts between
   protection of Outstanding Universal Value and resource extraction can
   arise within large-scale natural landscapes. The tall-eucalypt forests
   of the Australian island of Tasmania have been at the heart of such a
   conflict for over 30 years. The aim of this paper is to analyse how the
   processes of the Convention respond to contrasting approaches by a State
   Party. The paper traces the history of the dispute over Tasmania's
   tall-eucalypt forests through the Convention's processes of evaluation,
   inscription and boundary modification. In particular, it considers the
   processes and outcomes pertaining to two diametrically opposed proposals
   for minor modification to the boundaries of the Tasmanian Wilderness
   made by consecutive Australian governments in 2013 and 2014: the first
   was for the purpose of protecting the forests, and the second for
   opening them to logging in order to fulfil a domestic election promise.
   In each case, criteria weighted in favour of long-term heritage
   protection played a critical role. The application of these criteria,
   combined with strong domestic concern and the ability of UNESCO's World
   Heritage Committee to prioritize heritage protection, has resulted in
   the protection of these forests and the enhancement of the ecological
   resilience of the Tasmanian Wilderness World Heritage Area. The paper
   concludes that the power of an international treaty can transcend the
   vicissitudes of domestic politics and provide enduring protection of
   Outstanding Universal Value, particularly when backed by strong domestic
   scrutiny and community support.},

Abstract = {This article examines the circumstances under which civilians, using
   protests as a mechanism, alter the strategic use of violence by armed
   actors (rebels and state forces). By examining the civil war in Colombia
   between 1988 and 2005, this study finds that combatants decrease their
   attacks against the population when civilians protest against the enemy.
   Combatants interpret such demonstrations as costly signals of loyalty.
   Furthermore, when insurgents are the target of the protests, insurgents
   increase repression against civilians as rebels get stronger. In
   contrast, state forces (and paramilitaries) compensate for their
   weakness in the area by multiplying civilian victims. Both state forces
   and rebels, however, are likely to decrease violence against civilians
   when civilians protest against both parties in contested zones. In such
   contexts, armed actors are likely to refrain from retaliation because
   any violence might drive noncombatants toward the enemy.},

Abstract = {After the 1980 coup that shook Turkey and almost twenty years after the
   bilateral guest worker' treaty shifted Germany's demographic make-up,
   West German policy makers proposed increasingly restrictive regulations
   on the guest workers' who had heavily contributed to West Germany's
   economy. In this crucial historical moment, Turkish-language newspapers,
   published in West Germany, created a politically motivated extranational
   public sphere in which they launched claims against both the West German
   and Turkish states. These claims shaped immigration and integration
   policy between the two countries, fostered diasporic activism and
   cross-national religious and political organisations and gave rise to a
   variety of unexpected organisational outcomes that continue to impact
   both Germany and the Turkish Republic.},

Abstract = {Targets are widely employed in environmental governance. In this paper,
   we investigate the construction of the 2 A degrees C climate target, one
   of the best known targets in global environmental governance. Our paper
   examines this target through a historical reconstruction that identifies
   four different phases: framing, consolidation and diffusion, adoption,
   and disembeddedness. Our analysis shows that, initially, the target was
   science-driven and predominantly EU-based; it then became progressively
   accepted at the international level, despite a lack of broader debate
   among governments on the policy implications and required measures for
   implementation. Once the 2 A degrees C target was endorsed at the level
   of the United Nations, the nature of the target changed from being
   policy-prescriptive to being largely symbolic. In this phase, the target
   became a disembedded object in global governance not linked to a shared
   agenda nor to coordinated and mutually binding mitigation efforts. The
   2015 Paris Agreement marks the last stage in this development and may
   have further solidified the target as a disembedded object. In the final
   part of the paper, we suggest ways to overcome the current situation and
   to develop the 2 A degrees C target into a fully fledged global
   environmental governance target.},

Abstract = {In the context of the UNFCCC negotiation process on a global climate
   agreement, policy makers are looking for approaches on how to
   significantly raise the mitigation ambition of all relevant sectors,
   including the land use sector. Aside of the formal negotiations some
   Parties to the UNFCCC have started an informal dialogue and discuss how
   to merge the fragmented accounting rules for mitigation relevant land
   use activities, in particular those concerning forest-sector emissions.
   Stressing that `history matters', we use a historical institutionalist
   perspective to assess the institutional pathways of the different
   accounting rules for developed and developing countries, their mutual
   relationship, and in how far they are supportive or counterproductive
   for this endeavour. Our empirical analysis shows that Parties tend to
   use any modification phase in the negotiation process to water down
   already achieved agreements, and that negotiating modalities after
   targets have been agreed is not conducive either. In the efforts of
   specifying the Paris agreement, merging existing rules into a common
   accounting framework is likely to further compromise the exisiting weak
   rules and modalities, and potentially what negotiators consider as
   `environmental integrity'. With this, a formal negotiation of common
   rules for the accounting of the land use sector may yield an outcome
   below what has been achieved since the negotiations on a post-2020
   agreement started in 2005. We conclude that politically acceptable
   approaches for the land use sector that also contribute to the overall
   objective of raising ambition should avoid reopening already agreed
   decisions on rules and modalities.},

Abstract = {Poverty is a persistent problem in the United States, affecting millions
   of people and many areas of public policy. Nevertheless, public
   officials have said relatively little about poverty in recent years.
   What do ordinary Americans think about poverty and government's role in
   fighting it? This article summarizes two decades of survey data-drawing
   on ANES, Gallup, NORC/ GSS, Pew, and other national polls-to help answer
   these questions. Americans generally feel positively toward the poor,
   believe that fighting poverty should be a high priority for government,
   and favor spending more on the poor. But many people remain skeptical of
   `` welfare,{''} worry about dependence on government aid, and are
   dissatisfied with past efforts to reduce poverty. Thus, officials could
   interpret existing polls as a sign to increase or decrease government's
   role.},

Abstract = {Preelection polls for the 2015 UK General Election missed the final
   result by a considerable margin: underestimating the Conservative Party
   and overestimating Labour. Analyzing evidence for five theories of why
   the polls missed using British Election Study (BES) data, we find
   limited evidence for systematic vote intention misreporting, late swing,
   systematically different preferences among ``don't knows,{''} or
   differential turnout of parties' supporters. By comparing the BES
   face-to-face probability sample and BES Internet panel, we show that the
   online survey's polling error is primarily caused by undersampling
   nonvoters, then weighting respondents to represent the general
   population. Consequently, demographic groups with a low probability of
   voting are overweighted within the voter subsample. Finally, we show
   that this mechanism is likely partially responsible for the polls
   overestimating the Liberal Democrats in 2010, illustrating that this is
   a longstanding problem.},

Volume = {17},

Pages = {357-370},

Abstract = {Analyses from international and nongovernmental organizations have
   pointed to the negative environmental, economic and social implications
   of the sizable subsidies handed out by governments for the production
   and consumption of fossil fuels. Given their relevance for achieving
   climate policy objectives, it is perhaps surprising that the climate
   regime established by the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate
   Change (UNFCCC) does not address fossil fuel subsidies. This article
   discusses the possible role of the UNFCCC in tackling fossil fuel
   subsidies. It suggests that the UNFCCC could enhance the transparency
   around fossil fuel subsidies and put in place incentives for countries
   to undertake subsidy reform. However, the possibilites under the UNFCCC
   will be limited by political barriers to subsidy reform at the national
   level and will need to be carried out in coordination with other
   international institutions active in the field.},

Abstract = {This paper investigates the process of coalition formation for
   issue-specific coalitions. I use the Alliance of Small Island States and
   the Coalition for Rainforest Nations as case studies to inductively
   create a framework on coalition formation. This framework is tested
   against two coalitions, both advocating for mountain issues in the UN
   climate negotiations. These two coalitions differ in the type of
   coalition sought, the strategies deployed thus far, and the type of
   support they have received, including the role of non-state actors. The
   framework helps identify significant gaps in the efforts of the two
   coalitions, including capturing the most salient link between climate
   change and mountains, translating technical input into negotiating
   positions, and identifying the most appropriate form of the coalition
   and forum to pursue these interests. In doing so, this paper provides
   insights into the limits of linking issues to the climate change agenda
   ({''}climate bandwagoning''), issue proliferation and its implications
   for coalition management for actors like the Group of 77 and China, and
   the nature of multi-scalar interactions in regime complexes.},

Volume = {17},

Abstract = {Multilateral development banks (MDBs) are increasingly supporting
   climate change mitigation efforts. However, little is known about how
   and why this role in climate finance has evolved, and how MDBs are
   managing this change internally. This paper addresses these questions
   through an analysis of energy support provided by the Asian Development
   Bank (ADB). The paper maps trends in the number and monetary value of
   ADB energy projects and technical assistance activities, presenting
   descriptive statistics on five categories of energy between 2000 and
   2014. The results indicate that ADB while decreased its support for
   fossil fuel interventions, this sector continues to enjoy substantial
   funding support. At the same time, support for sustainable energy
   projects has also increased, reflecting the Bank's evolving priorities
   and providing a rough proxy for its entry into the climate finance
   system. These new insights enhance understanding of the changing
   dynamics of multilateral climate finance and its complex relationship
   with development finance institutions. Given their financial resources
   and policy influence, it is essential for MDBs to support the goals of
   the new global climate finance architecture. But to be considered a
   serious actor in the climate finance system, ADB has to revisit its
   policy architecture, strengthen its accounting procedures, and
   coordinate its efforts with those of other actors across this fragmented
   system.},

Abstract = {A growing number of expert organizations aim to provide knowledge for
   global environmental policy-making. Recently, there have also been
   explicit calls for stakeholder engagement at the global level to make
   scientific knowledge relevant and usable on the ground. The newly
   established Intergovernmental Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem
   Services (IPBES) is one of the first international expert organizations
   to have systematically developed a strategy for stakeholder engagement
   in its own right. In this article, we analyze the emergence of this
   strategy. Employing the concept politics of legitimation, we examine how
   and for what reasons stakeholder engagement was introduced, justified,
   and finally endorsed, as well as its effects. The article explores the
   process of institutionalizing stakeholder engagement, as well as
   reconstructing the contestation of the operative norms (membership,
   tasks, and accountability) regulating the rules for this engagement. We
   conclude by discussing the broader importance of the findings for IPBES,
   as well as for international expert organizations in general.},

Abstract = {One aspect of Foucault's concept of biopolitics concerns how society
   manages or governs certain groups of people, in particular when that
   sort of governance requires scientific knowledge about the group or kind
   of people in question. Left-handers are one example of a kind of people
   that has to be studied and managed. In the early twentieth century,
   left-handedness among school children was perceived as a growing
   problem. Not only parents, but teachers and school principals had to
   deal with this problem and they called upon scientists to give them more
   knowledge about these problematic children. Since then there has been no
   end to research on left-handers, in particular in psychology and health
   sciences. The paper discusses one such case, a series of studies aimed
   at answering the question whether left-handers die on average younger
   than right-handers. Discussion of these studies reveals how problematic
   the scientific definition of left-handedness is and also what effects
   (what Foucault termed power-effects) this sort of research has on its
   subjects. Although there is nowadays less pressure in the school system
   to manage left-handed children, the production of knowledge about
   left-handers continues. The paper focuses on how this knowledge is
   diffused through scientific literature, popular science literature and
   mass media; and how these studies have given rise to confrontation and
   conflict.},

Abstract = {The favela as a social question presupposes a discursive field and
   action open to passion and reason, centered around a set of aporias
   sustained by arguments with which they simultaneously intend to become
   acquainted, judge, and propose, or, to be coherent with what has been
   enunciated above, propose, judge, and become acquainted. Thus, the main
   goal of this chapter is to understand the various conjunctures in which
   the favela enters the public debate must seek to elucidate the relations
   inherent between the explanation/assessment of its existence and its
   problems with the propositions of action.},

Abstract = {For decades, sample surveys have provided information of value to
   sponsors in government, academia, business, and the public. That value
   proposition is threatened now by declining survey participation and the
   advent of competition from alternative data sources. In this
   environment, some developments in survey practice include new thinking
   about how to recruit respondents, new methods for applying communication
   technology, and new approaches to blending survey and non-survey data.
   Going forward, survey data may increasingly be one component of
   information products, formed from various sources, including
   administrative records and unstructured ({''}big{''}) data. The papers
   in this special issue of Public Opinion Quarterly will contribute to
   discussions on how future surveys should be conducted and their place in
   a new information order.},

Abstract = {Focusing on natural gas and pipeline infrastructures, and adopting the
   concept of ``forms of state{''}, the article examines the transformation
   of energy security politics in Europe. Three state models, with their
   related pattern of energy diplomacy, are sketched: the partner state,
   which describes the original politics of the European gas market; and
   the provider state and catalytic state, which describe two alternative
   possibilities of the emerging politics in the new institutional and
   ideational context promoted with the establishment of the internal
   energy market and the development of the EU's external energy policy. By
   analysing the politics of pipeline in Southeastern Europe, the article
   argues that the catalytic state model with its related pattern of
   network energy diplomacy is more appropriate than the provider state
   model, supported by the market approach and its related pattern of
   multilateral diplomacy, to conceptualise the equilibrium emerging from
   the transformation of the previous system.},

Abstract = {While Disney is often characterized as the embodiment of American
   culture, other narratives intersect and thrive within the Disney
   universe. This is particularly true when it comes to Europe, a place
   from which many of the Disney legends were originally derived. This work
   explores the physical interactions between Disney and Europe to be found
   at Orlando's Walt Disney World. I propose that Disney challenges our
   idea of Europe by extracting traditional European tropes and resituating
   them in highly unorthodox contexts. Simultaneously, Disney has embedded
   itself within European space in a way that brings into question numerous
   facets of Europe's authenticity via both pathways, the verisimilitude
   between the real and imagined Europe bears the potential of
   fundamentally altering our understanding of Europe itself. This work
   seeks to problematize Disney/Europe and interrogate how perceptions of
   Europe from beyond its borders inform Europe's identity and might even
   have a bearing on its cultural evolution in our era of globalization.},

Abstract = {Illegal trade in chemicals and waste has brought severe negative impacts
   to human health and the environment. Fragmentation of multilateral
   environmental agreements (MEAs) has challenged implementation due to
   disconnects and inconsistencies between regimes that causes
   inefficiencies, overlapping norms, and duplication. Since the late
   1990s, there have been proposals to cluster MEAs organizationally and
   functionally to create synergies between them. This paper evaluates
   whether the proposition on clustering of MEAs has worked in practice
   through an empirical case study of the ``MEA Regional Enforcement
   Network (REN){''}. MEA REN sought to cluster at the organizational and
   functional elements of the Basel Convention, the Rotterdam Convention,
   the Stockholm Convention, and the Montreal Protocol in South and
   Southeast Asia. Regarding organizational clustering, through
   co-organizing regional network meetings cross-MEA learning was enhanced
   and costs were saved, but co-locating regional offices proved more
   challenging. For the clustering of functional elements, MEA enforcement
   was ultimately strengthened through several joint initiatives across
   MEAs. However, not all functions could be clustered as anticipated,
   including data reporting due to incompatibility between the conventions
   and overall workloads. The paper concludes with recommendations for
   future environmental enforcement.},

Abstract = {With respondents increasingly completing web surveys on tablet computers
   and smartphones, several studies have examined the potential effects of
   the switch from PCs to mobile devices. The studies have looked at a
   range of outcomes, including completion rates, breakoffs, and item
   nonresponse. We carried out a field experiment that compared responses
   obtained by smartphones, tablets, and laptop computers, focusing on the
   potential effects of the different devices on measurement errors. We
   examined whether the differences across devices in screen size (and the
   related need to scroll to see the entire question or the full set of
   response options) might moderate the effects of response order, affect
   the strategy respondents used to decide which of two options was
   preferable, change the effect of question context, or influence the use
   of definitions. Our experiments were based on the principle of visual
   prominence-the idea that respondents are more likely to notice and
   consider information that is easy to see. The experiments were
   deliberately designed to maximize the impact of screen size on the
   results, since the screen size would affect the visual prominence of key
   information. However, like many of the prior studies examining mobile
   devices, although response order, context, and evaluation strategy
   affected the answers respondents gave, few device effects emerged.},

Abstract = {Nominal democratic institutions under non-democratic regimes vary across
   countries. This study intends to advance our understanding of such
   institutions by exploring the relevance of one aspect of the
   authoritarian regimes, government hierarchy. Focusing on village-level
   democratization in China, we investigate the intermediary role of the
   provincial level governments in shaping the variant outcomes of
   grassroots democracy across the country. Through an analysis of a
   national sample, we find that divergent provincial legislative
   interpretation of central policies is a key determinant of public access
   to power and democratic governance of village-level governments. Our
   finding suggests that authoritarian states can employ various
   institutions to gather information, accommodate local variations, and
   thus contain potential intra-government disagreement.},

Abstract = {This research note considers how to track long-term trajectories of
   political discontent in Britain. Many accounts are confined to using
   either survey data drawn from recent decades or imperfect behavioral
   measures such as voting or party membership as indicators of political
   disengagement. We instead develop an approach that provides the long
   view on political disaffection. We first consider time-series data
   available from repeated survey measures. We next replicate historic
   survey questions to observe change in public opinion relative to earlier
   points in time. Finally, we use Stimson's (1991) dyad-ratios algorithm
   to construct an over-time index of political discontent that combines
   data from multiple poll series. This reveals rising levels of political
   discontent for both specific and diffuse measures of mass opinion. Our
   method and findings offer insights into the rising tide of
   disillusionment afflicting many contemporary democracies.},

Abstract = {Literature on the Guatemalan Civil War has debated whether or not state
   violence was triggered by rebel activities. Did the government respond
   to each insurrection caused by the rebels, or did it blindly target
   regions where antigovernment antipathy and movements had historically
   prevailed? Because state violence was extensive during the civil war
   period, the dynamism of the war could have been the reason for its
   occurrence. Relying on the threat-response model of state violence, this
   article argues that human rights violations occurred when the government
   perceived a rebel threat that would have seriously degraded its
   capability in future counterinsurgencies. The article employs propensity
   score matching to address the problem of confounding in empirical
   analysis, and reveals that rebel attacks, particularly those targeting
   security apparatus and resulting in human injury, increased the
   likelihood of state violence in the Guatemalan Civil War.},

Abstract = {To better understand how desires to avenge the September 11 terror
   attacks affected US public support for the 2003 Iraq War, we integrate
   data from two uncoordinated surveys-one measuring revenge motivations
   and the other beliefs about Iraqi complicity-completed by overlapping
   samples drawn from the same online panel. Citizens who mistakenly blamed
   Iraq for 9/11 were more likely to say that going to war would satisfy
   their desires for revenge, which in turn predicted greater war support,
   controlling for political orientations and the perceived security
   incentives and costs of war. But a substantial proportion of those who
   said Iraq was not involved in 9/11 also expected war to satisfy desires
   for revenge, suggesting that a revenge ``spillover{''} effect also
   contributed to war support. These findings help explain how President
   George W. Bush was able to bring the nation to war against Iraq, testify
   to the importance of emotion and moral motivation in public opinion, and
   demonstrate the utility of integrating data from independent online
   panel surveys.},

Abstract = {Randomly selecting a single adult within a household is one of the
   biggest challenges facing mail surveys. Yet obtaining a probability
   sample of adults within households is critical to having a probability
   sample of the US adult population. In this paper, we experimentally test
   three alternative placements of the within-household selection
   instructions in the National Health, Wellbeing, and Perspectives study
   (sample n = 6,000; respondent n = 998): (1) a standard cover letter
   informing the household to ask the person with the next birthday to
   complete the survey (control); (2) the control cover letter plus an
   instruction on the front cover of the questionnaire itself to have the
   adult with the next birthday complete the survey; and (3) the control
   cover letter plus an explicit yes/ no question asking whether the
   individual is the adult in the household who will have the next
   birthday. Although the version with an explicit question had a two-point
   decrease in response rates relative to not having any instruction, the
   explicit question significantly improves selection accuracy relative to
   the other two designs, yields a sample composition closer to national
   benchmarks, and does not affect item nonresponse rates. Accurately
   selected respondents also differ from inaccurately selected respondents
   on questions related to household tasks. Survey practitioners are
   encouraged to use active tasks such as explicit questions rather than
   passive tasks such as embedded instructions as part of the
   within-household selection process.},

Volume = {17},

Pages = {573-588},

Abstract = {Under what conditions can international environmental institutions
   survive changing power alignments? This article argues that relatively
   declining powers and private domestic actors play an important role in
   preserving the status quo because they are eager to retain advantages
   that existing institutions afford them. This effort to block change
   affects fisheries negotiations, in particular, by allowing powerful
   actors to avoid new rules once an institution is in place. I
   hypothesize, first, that relatively declining fishing powers attempt to
   retain past institutional successes, while emerging fishing powers seek
   to alter the status quo. Second, negotiating positions reflect not only
   a country's position in the world, but also the access provided to
   domestic stakeholders who wish to gain, or fear losses, from new
   agreements. Therefore, I hypothesize that powerful beneficiaries in
   domestic politics push relatively declining powers to support the status
   quo when those private actors benefit from highly legalized past
   agreements and participate in foreign policy decisions. I test these
   hypotheses by exploring US and EU approaches to fisheries treaty
   negotiations through archival research and interviews with fisheries
   negotiators. The evidence supports hypotheses that status quo powers
   seek to protect earlier deals more intensely when they negotiate with
   rising fishing powers, and when private parties are most influential. As
   hypothesized, both governments are particularly protective of the most
   complex earlier agreements under these conditions.},

Abstract = {This article analyzes the contested politics of including (and
   accounting for) land-based mitigation in a post-2020 climate agreement.
   Emissions from land have been only partially included to date within the
   United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and its Kyoto
   Protocol. The Paris Agreement, adopted in December 2015 and ``applicable
   to all{''} for the post-2020 period, raises the possibility of
   unprecedented reliance on land-based mitigation. This has significant
   consequences for furthering both ambition and equity in global climate
   mitigation efforts. Yet, what are these consequences, and how have they
   manifested themselves in the existing (pre-2020) multilateral climate
   regime? What role do accounting rules for land-based mitigation play
   herein? In addressing these questions, we identify key dimensions of
   what we term the ``governance by expertise{''} approach taken to
   land-based mitigation to date, which has served to reduce the
   environmental integrity of existing (developed country) mitigation
   efforts. Specifically, we analyze land-use accounting rules as a site of
   politics and highlight the ``technicalization of politics{''} underway
   in this realm, which obscures the political implications of how land has
   been included to date. We conclude by considering whether the Paris
   Agreement institutionalizes similar dynamics, and the environmental
   integrity and equity implications of doing so.},

Abstract = {This article presents a conceptual clarification of asymmetric
   hypotheses and a discussion of methodologies available to test them.
   Despite the existence of a litany of theories that posit asymmetric
   hypotheses, most empirical studies fail to capture their core insight:
   boundaries separating zones of data from areas that lack data are
   substantively interesting. We discuss existing set-theoretic and large-N
   approaches to the study of asymmetric hypotheses, introduce new ones
   from the literatures on stochastic frontier and data envelopment
   analysis, evaluate their relative merits, and give three examples of how
   asymmetric hypotheses can be studied with this suite of tools.},

Abstract = {Cross-national data production in social science research has increased
   dramatically in recent decades. Assessing the comparability of data is
   necessary before drawing substantive conclusions that are based on
   cross-national data. Researchers assessing data comparability typically
   use either quantitative methods such as multigroup confirmatory factor
   analysis or qualitative methods such as online probing. Because both
   methods have complementary strengths and weaknesses, this study applies
   both multigroup confirmatory factor analysis and online probing in a
   mixed-methods approach to assess the comparability of constructive
   patriotism and nationalism, two important concepts in the study of
   national identity. Previous measurement invariance tests failed to
   achieve scalar measurement invariance, which prohibits a cross-national
   comparison of latent means (Davidov 2009). The arrival of the 2013 ISSP
   Module on National Identity has encouraged a reassessment of both
   constructs and a push to understand why scalar invariance cannot be
   achieved. Using the example of constructive patriotism and nationalism,
   this study demonstrates how the combination of multigroup confirmatory
   factor analysis and online probing can uncover and explain issues
   related to cross-national comparability.},

Abstract = {Fossil fuel subsidy reform has in recent years been addressed by
   international economic organizations including the International
   Monetary Fund (IMF) and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
   Development (OECD). The two organizations have differed significantly in
   how they define fossil fuel subsidies. The IMF's definition constitutes
   a radical break with previous definitions by including environmental
   externalities, while the OECD's is more conventional. The article
   explores the factors that explain why these international economic
   organizations have approached fossil fuel subsidies so differently. The
   exact definition of fossil fuel subsidies is contested. Furthermore,
   fossil fuels subsidies can be framed in ways that emphasize,
   respectively, their macroeconomic, fiscal, environmental, and
   distributive consequences. The article finds that institutional
   interaction lifted OECD involvement in fossil fuel subsidies to a new
   level, whereas the impetus to address fossil fuel subsidies within the
   IMF came largely from the IMF staff. In both cases, the organization's
   bureaucracy constituted the most important factor shaping how the
   organizations addressed such subsidies and hence the main reason why
   they differ in how they approach fossil fuel subsidies.},

Abstract = {The European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) has so far issued six major
   judgments on Cyprus concerning the ongoing consequences of Turkey's
   military intervention of 1974. Starting with the Loizidou case (1995,
   1996), the rulings of the court on Cyprus v. Turkey (2001), Demades v.
   Turkey (2003), Eugenia Michaelidou v. Turkey (2003), Xenides-Arestis v.
   Turkey (2005), and Demopulos and others v. Turkey (2011) have mostly
   been criticized for their politicized' legal content, including by some
   of the judges of the ECtHR itself, through their dissenting opinions.
   This article attempts to demonstrate the - not always negative impact of
   specific political developments on the court's rulings as well as on the
   attitudes of the states parties before the court, as a result of this
   interaction.},

Abstract = {Using a historical institutionalist approach, this article addresses the
   future of Southeast Asia's naval forces. Much analysis on this subject
   employs a linear Realist model in which Southeast Asia's navies are
   expected to be the beneficiaries of declining internal security
   challenges and a deteriorating external threat environment. However, to
   date neither of these factors, including increasing Chinese
   assertiveness in the maritime domain, appear to have significantly
   accelerated naval force development in Southeast Asia. While there have
   been some capability increases in areas such as submarines, growth has
   mainly been in patrol boat and fast attack craft classes. Numbers of
   larger offshore surface combatants like frigates have fallen. This
   article argues that in countries where army dominance has become
   institutionalized, and civil control of the military is weak,
   governments may be unwilling or unable to reallocate funding away from
   armies to maritime forces. In a funding environment in which national
   economic growth is moderate, and spending on defence is a lower
   priority, naval modernization and expansion can be blocked. This article
   examines the cases of Thailand, Indonesia and Myanmar to demonstrate how
   their armies became dominant and how this may have diminished the growth
   prospects of their navies.},

Abstract = {While the Internet is often touted as a revolutionary technology, it
   might be noted that democratic institutions have witnessed no digital
   revolution through the Internet. This observation leads this chapter to
   argue that the field of e-democracy has generally failed to live up to
   its own reformist rhetoric. It argues that instead of reforming
   government processes through technology, e-democracy projects have
   tended to focus either on lowering the costs and increasing the
   efficiency of existing political processes or on analysing the civic
   participation that occurs outside of purpose-built e-democracy
   platforms. The chapter suggests that this lack of attention to the
   Internet's potential for systemic change in formal political
   institutions has little normative impact on the democratization of
   society and may even re-enforce, rather than challenge, the
   sociopolitical status quo. Further, it suggests that the current
   approach of e-democracy risks normalizing the Internet to the norms and
   expectations of the offline world. To elucidate this argument, this
   chapter overviews both the general trend of e-democracy projects and
   criticisms of those projects. Finally, the chapter proposes a more
   radical vision of e-democracy that, it suggests, would usher a larger
   potential for democratization. This more radical vision of e-democracy
   consists of recognizing the attributes of the Internet that transcend
   the limits of the analogue world and applying these to democracy. Such
   an approach would open the path for envisaging new political processes
   and systems, allowing the field of e-democracy to live up to its own
   rhetoric, and affording society the means to address multiple of the
   centuries-old problems faced by democracy.},

Title = {APPLES TO ORANGES OR GALA VERSUS GOLDEN DELICIOUS? COMPARING DATA
   QUALITY OF NONPROBABILITY INTERNET SAMPLES TO LOW RESPONSE RATE
   PROBABILITY SAMPLES},
Journal = {PUBLIC OPINION QUARTERLY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {81},
Number = {SI},
Pages = {213-239},
Abstract = {Nonprobability samples have gained mass popularity and use in many
   research circles, including market research and some political research.
   One justification for the use of nonprobability samples is that low
   response rate probability surveys have nothing significant to offer over
   and above a ``well built{''} nonprobability sample. Utilizing an
   elemental approach, we compare a range of samples, weighting, and
   modeling procedures in an analysis that evaluates the estimated bias of
   various cross-tabulations of core demographics. Specifically, we compare
   a battery of bias related metrics for nonprobability panels, dual-frame
   telephone samples, and a high-quality in-person sample. Results indicate
   that there is roughly a linear trend, with nonprobability samples
   attaining the greatest estimated bias, and the in-person sample, the
   lowest. Results also indicate that the bias estimates vary widely for
   the nonprobability samples compared to either the telephone or in-person
   samples, which themselves tend to have consistently smaller amounts of
   estimated bias. Specifically, both weighted and unweighted dual-frame
   telephone samples were found to have about half the estimated bias
   compared to analogous nonprobability samples. Advanced techniques such
   as propensity weighting and sample matching did not improve these
   measures, and in some cases made matters worse. Implications for ``fit
   for purpose{''} in survey research are discussed given these findings.},

Abstract = {Despite the radical upheavals during the revolution of 2011 whereby the
   Egyptian public rejected neoliberalism and authoritarianism, Egypt has
   reverted back to the neoliberal model of economic development. This
   paper discusses the reasons behind the resilience of neoliberalism
   focusing on the role of dominant economic ideas, the influence of
   international financial institutions in policy making and the
   challenging domestic political environment, which has so far precluded a
   break from the neoliberal model. The paper ends with a critical
   assessment of current policies and their broader social implications for
   different classes and groups in Egypt.},

   Hypotheses in Process Tracing},
Journal = {POLITICAL ANALYSIS},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {25},
Number = {3},
Pages = {344-362},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Methodologists and substantive scholars alike agree that one of process
   tracing's foremost contributions to qualitative research is its capacity
   to adjudicate among competing explanations of a phenomenon. Existing
   approaches, however, only provide explicit guidance on dealing with
   mutually exclusive explanations, which are exceedingly rare in social
   science research. I develop a tripartite solution to this problem. The
   Relationships among Rivals (RAR) framework (1) introduces a typology of
   relationships between alternative hypotheses, (2) develops specific
   guidelines for identifying which relationship is present between two
   hypotheses, and (3) maps out the varied implications for evidence
   collection and inference. I then integrate the RAR framework into each
   of the main process-tracing approaches and demonstrate how it affects
   the inferential process. Finally, I illustrate the purchase of the RAR
   framework by reanalyzing a seminal example of process-tracing research:
   Schultz's (2001) analysis of the Fashoda Crisis. I show that the same
   evidence can yield new and sometimes contradictory inferences once
   scholars approach comparative hypothesis testing with this more nuanced
   framework.},

Abstract = {While biomeasures are increasingly collected along with survey responses
   in household surveys, more research is needed to determine respondents'
   willingness to provide these measures, what factors influence
   participation, and what barriers impede successful collection. In this
   paper, we examine factors associated with compliance to a request to
   provide a salivary DNA sample as part of a separate data-collection
   effort of the Wisconsin Longitudinal Study, in which respondents have
   been periodically surveyed since they were high school seniors in 1957.
   Respondents were contacted in 2007, and over 50 percent provided a
   saliva sample, which was self-administered and returned through the
   mail. We examine factors associated with returning the saliva sample in
   this panel survey, including respondents' socio-demographic
   characteristics, cognitive ability, health, religiosity, and survey
   process variables such as amount of prior participation in the WLS.
   Bivariate results indicate that the odds of participation are lower
   among females, those with less education, those who are more socially
   isolated, those with lower cognitive ability, those in poorer health and
   with less contact with the healthcare system, those who are more
   religious, and those whose past behavior indicated resistance to
   participation. Many of these effects, however, are attenuated when
   controlling for all the variables simultaneously. Our analysis adds to
   the small but growing body of research on factors influencing the
   collection of biological measures in household surveys, particularly
   household panel surveys. Our conclusions include recommendations for
   maximizing participation rates and reducing costs.},

Abstract = {This article compares the strategies devised by two Salafi-oriented
   Islamic associations, the Senegal's Jamaatou Ibadou Rahmane (JIR) and
   the Burkina Faso's Mouvement Sunnite (MS). Drawing on extensive field
   research conducted between 2002 and 2013, it shows that both
   organizations have been engaged since the 1970s in a similar
   legitimacy-building process, using contrasting strategies. The JIR
   intends to build a more constructive relationship with the State and the
   brotherhoods, while still continuing to cast a critical eye on these two
   groups. In Burkina Faso, recurring leadership crises and violent
   incidents has sapped a great deal of the MS's energy. It therefore has
   to regain visibility and legitimacy by maintaining a certain distance
   from political debates. The comparison shows that political Islam has
   entered in both countries a transitional phase that took into account
   the emergence and perhaps even the consolidation of a cultural and
   religious form of citizenship.},

Volume = {25},

Abstract = {Almost from the moment the term was first coined, bureaucracy has been
   the subject of strong criticism and, if anything, such criticism has
   become more trenchant in recent decades. Numerous scholars,
   practitioners and politicians have talked about or envisaged systems of
   government/public administration which move beyond bureaucracy. These
   range from the tried to the theoretical. Others have forecast the end of
   bureaucracy-increasingly invoking information technology as a tool which
   can be used to achieve this end. In this chapter, a counter argument
   will be presented, i.e. that when it comes to protecting and vindicating
   public values in a complex modern state, bureaucracy can play a vital,
   and hard to displace, role.},

Abstract = {While many have noted that EU member states have different preferences
   over the prospect of an integrated EU defence, analyses that
   specifically explore state-industry relations in the definition of EU
   defence-industrial issues, and in the evolution of the Common Security
   and Defence Policy in general, are lacking. This is surprising, given
   that different configurations of government-industry relations have
   represented a persistent impediment to European defence-industrial
   cross-border collaboration. This article investigates how state-defence
   industry relations impact on member states' preferences towards the EU
   defence-industrial framework. Based on the case studies of the
   interaction of France and the UK with the European Defence Agency, this
   analysis focuses on the difference between public and private defence
   firms' governance settings as the crucial explanatory variable
   accounting for diverging member states' preferences in this domain.},

Abstract = {This section analyzes Hamburg, Barcelona, Chicago, Toronto, and Montreal
   in turn. They were chosen in part because their migrant populations
   include members of five national groups: Poles, Romanians, Serbs,
   Pakistanis, and Ghanaians. The same topics are covered for each city,
   namely, the concentrations of those migrants and their residential
   movements between 2000 and 2015; their dissimilarity, isolation, and
   exposure indices of segregation; and key indicators of their structural
   integration (in terms of employment, poverty, and social assistance
   rates) over the same period. The author also considers local policy
   responses in each case, highlighting trends in migrant integration
   strategies, housing, transportation, and neighborhood development and
   their effect on the shared lived experience and multicultural public
   spaces.},

Abstract = {Turkey is rapidly transforming into a country of immigration in addition
   to its roles as a country of emigration and of transit. Bearing in mind
   that existing arrangements in this policy area are increasingly replaced
   by new legal, administrative and institutional mechanisms, this paper
   aims to map out these recent changes in Turkish refugee and asylum
   policy. In this context, the mass influx of Syrian refugees has become
   an issue of particular concern due to the complex interplay between its
   security, humanitarian and socio-economic dimensions and the
   multifaceted relationship between the growing number of state and
   non-state institutions. The numerous reports, policy briefs and analysis
   generated so far, however, lack a clear analytical framework that would
   explain both the domestic contestation and the role of various actors in
   Turkish asylum debate about the Syrian refugees. This paper thus
   examines different perspectives and approaches of the Turkish state,
   local and national NGOs and international organizations regarding the
   policies addressing Syrian refugees in Turkey.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF CONTEMPORARY EUROPEAN STUDIES},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {25},

Abstract = {After the First World War, Parisian officials debated the city's border
   ground: Did the zone define the edge of Paris? The founders of the new
   Cite Universitaire de Paris joined the discussion. The effort to create
   the Cite and fit it into its new neighbourhood, emphasises the continued
   debate about the margins of Paris and who and what they represented to
   the urban officials and elites invested in them. The Cite fits with
   other urban renovation projects of the era; the goal of independent
   advocates and government representatives to create a social
   transformation - both on a cultural ideological level and on a practical
   housing level - focused on social hygiene. Entrepreneurs who funded the
   organisation viewed the future Cite as a utopia for international
   students to learn from one another and live in modern quarters
   reflecting a modernised, sanitised, healthy France. The zone became a
   logical locale for the new enterprise because it represented a border
   ground: a middle space between the city proper and the perceived `fresh
   air' of the countryside. The future of the zone opened up a debate about
   public space, the nature of a modern city, and the role of the state as
   an agent of social transformation.},

Abstract = {Today, small European states regularly need to go out of area and out of
   tried and tested institutional settings to defend their security
   interests. How do small European states meet this challenge most
   effectively? This analysis suggests that small states can influence
   multilateral decisions on international security by combining norm
   entrepreneurship with lobbying and taking on the role as an ``honest
   broker{''}. However, economic capacity, an effective state
   administration, and interests compatible with the agendas of the great
   powers are key to success. Based on a comprehensive empirical material
   including 19 elite interviews as well as official documents and other
   written material, we process trace how one small European state,
   Denmark, influenced the development of international counter-piracy
   cooperation and the development of an international counter-piracy
   strategy for the Gulf of Aden and off the Horn of Africa and discuss
   which lessons the Danish case may hold for other small states.},

Journal = {PUBLIC OPINION QUARTERLY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {81},
Number = {SI},
Pages = {338-356},
Abstract = {The rising costs and declining response rates of traditional survey
   modes have spurred many organizations to conduct surveys online. Less
   expensive broadband connections and the popularity of smartphones have
   also made it easier for many to access the Internet. The General Social
   Survey (GSS) shows that the percentage of American adults who use the
   Internet increased from 69 percent in 2006 to 86 percent in 2014. The
   increased access has reduced some concerns about the representativeness
   of Internet surveys. However, there remains little research into
   coverage bias, which occurs if those not in the sampling frame differ
   from the target population on variables of interest. This raises a
   question: With the increase in Internet access, has there been any
   change in the coverage bias of web surveys? To assess coverage bias, we
   analyze the GSS to determine whether those with Internet access and
   those without it became more or less similar between 2006 and 2014. We
   calculate the potential coverage bias of web-only surveys over these
   years for sex, age, education, income, race, political ideology,
   urbanicity, and life satisfaction. We also compare the bias observed in
   the United States to that in Europe. Our results illustrate that
   relative coverage bias associated with education, income, race, and age
   declined between 2006 and 2014, but bias still exists.},

Abstract = {The nation is a relatively abstract imagined community that is
   visualised through a variety of symbols as well as communicative and
   performative practices. In this paper, we explore how the national
   territory, one of the foundations of the nation-state, is performed on
   national-day celebrations and brings the nation into being. Drawing on
   ethnographic research on national days in Burkina Faso, Cote d'Ivoire
   and Ghana, we show how the state's internal administrative divisions and
   ethnic differences are at once made explicit but also subordinated to
   the nation. Moreover, we show how in such celebrations, potentially
   disruptive or competing affiliations such as ethnicity and regional
   loyalties are re-imagined. Both the rotation of the central celebration
   and its replication all over the national territory carry the nation
   into the regions and integrate the regions into the nation-state. The
   co-memoration' turns participants and spectators from locals into
   national compatriots and thus not only performs nationality but also
   performs the relationship among nation, state and citizen, set within a
   particular territory.},

Journal = {GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL POLITICS},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {17},
Number = {2},
Pages = {65-83},

Abstract = {In the 1990s, civil society organizations partnered with business to
   green global supply chains by setting up formal sustainability
   standard-setting organizations (SSOs) in sectors including organic food,
   fair trade, forestry, and fisheries. Although SSOs have withstood the
   long-standing allegations that they are unnecessary, costly,
   nondemocratic, and trade-distorting, they must now respond to a new
   challenge, arising from recent developments in technology. Conceived in
   the pre-Internet era, SSOs are discovering that verification systems
   that utilize annual, expert-led, low-tech field audits are under
   pressure from new information and communication technologies that
   collect, aggregate, interpret, and display open-source Big Data in
   almost real time. Drawing on the concept of governmentality and on
   interviews with experts in sustainability certification and natural
   capital accounting, we argue that while these technological developments
   offer many positive opportunities, they also enable competing
   alternatives to the prevailing truth or governing rationality about what
   is happening on the ground, which is of critical existential importance
   to SSOs as guarantors of trust in claims about sustainable production.
   While SSOs are not helpless in the face of this challenge, we conclude
   that they will need to do more than take incremental action: rather,
   they should respond actively to the disintermediation challenge from new
   virtual monitoring technologies if they are to remain relevant in the
   coming decade.},

Abstract = {The generation of consensual scientific knowledge significantly
   influences the development, evolution and outcome of international
   environmental negotiations. The impact of consensual science on global
   environmental policy-making is determined, inter alia, by a number of
   multidimensional factors. Some of these factors are closely associated
   with the nature and content of the usable scientific knowledge base.
   This article introduces the concept of gradated scientific validity and
   demonstrates how different types and aspects of consensual scientific
   information affect variously the negotiation process of international
   environmental agreements. Drawing on the negotiation of the Protocol for
   the Protection of the Mediterranean against Pollution from Land-Based
   Sources (1980), it shows that the thorough examination and in-depth
   analysis of the content and basic characteristics of the available
   scientific knowledge play a pivotal role in the elaboration and
   formulation of effective implementing measures of an environmental
   agreement. It is argued that the prominence of consensual science and
   subsequently its influence on environmental negotiations are
   substantially determined by the dynamic role of two interrelated
   variables of gradated scientific validity: the high or low degree of
   consensus in relation to the significance and value of the provided
   scientific information (degree of consensus), and the expanding or
   narrow scientific consensus on distinct underlying aspects of a
   negotiating problem, including its causes, extent and consequences
   (content of consensus). This article indicates that the extensive
   analysis of the nature, content and distinct characteristics of a
   consensual knowledge base lays the groundwork for comprehensively
   understanding the role of consensual science in the negotiation and
   implementation of an international environmental agreement.},

Abstract = {The population dynamics in the metropolitan space is related to the
   social organization of the territory, in which the various elements of
   the urban structure-such as access to housing, the labor market,
   services, and mobility system, among others-influence the conditions of
   reproduction, movement and location of different social groups in space.
   The objectives of this work are to analyze some recent aspects of
   population movements in the Metropolitan Region of Rio de Janeiro and
   assess how this population dynamics helps to explain the changes in the
   social organization of its territory. Moreover, given the population
   aging that currently affects all areas of the metropolis, spatial
   mobility is considered an important element to understand the present
   metropolitan dynamics.},

Pages = {47-58},
Abstract = {The purpose of this chapter is to develop a biopolitical response to
   certain ethical questions posed by chronic disorders of consciousness
   (CDoC). This response will draw on Giogio Agamben's account of homo
   sacer (Agamben G, Home Sacer: Sovereign Power and Bare Life (trans:
   Heller-Roazen D). Stanford University Press, Stanford, 1998). `Homo
   sacer' is a somewhat obscure term, found in Roman law, designating
   someone who has been expelled from the protection of the law. By
   addressing Agamben's own analysis of the `overcoma' and the case of
   Karen Quinlan, it will be argued that a distinctive normative status can
   be ascribed to the CDoC patient: the CDoC patient exemplifies the
   condition of homo sacer, and as such of what Agamben calls `bare life'.
   This argument poses a radical challenge to traditional approaches to
   bioethics and law. Precisely because homo sacer is placed outside the
   law, traditional legal or moral conceptions of rights are rendered
   inapplicable. However, it will also be argued that the Catholic
   tradition (defending the sanctity of life) or more utilitarian
   traditions (articulated in terms of quality of life) are rendered
   equally irrelevant. It will be concluded that the CDoC patient has moral
   status as a radical experience of bare life -and thus of what it is to
   be human albeit one that cannot be expressed or articulated by the
   patient. The biopolitical challenge posed by CDoC thereby becomes that
   of facilitating the creative and poetic role of those who bear witness
   to the patient's experience. The biopolitics of CDoC thereby rests in
   the articulation for the patient of a radically different ethical
   status. The chapter will proceed by firstly offering an overview of the
   group of conditions classified as chronic disorders of consciousness,
   before outlining Agamben's biopolitics, his key terms, zoe, bios and
   `bare life', and thereby explicating the idea of homo sacer. A series of
   Agamben's examples of homo sacer will be rehearsed, including that of
   the `over-comatose' patient. This will provide the core material
   necessary for articulating a biopolitics of CDoC, and in particular to
   explicate the relationship between the patient and their `witness'.},

   heritage and territory, based on a set of elements and distinctive
   expressions of a community that has been a victim of forced internal
   displacement in Colombia. The article is structured in three sections:
   Ruptures with the territory, which poses some considerations about
   Colombia's armed conflict and proposes abandonment as a concept to
   understand dispossession, through the case of the population of the
   township of Mampujan. Links with the territory, which intends to
   understand Mampujan's textiles as a testimony of this community's
   expression and sentiment towards forced displacement in Colombia.
   Transformations of the territory, which analyzes cultural heritage as a
   place to recognize a community's memory, identity and sense of
   belonging, in the midst of violence and uprooting processes.},

Journal = {EUROPEAN SECURITY},

Volume = {26},
Number = {3},
Pages = {435-453},
Abstract = {Focusing on fragile Georgia since the early 2000s, the article takes a
   country-centred perspective on EU-NATO inter-organisationalism. It
   outlines the regional strategies of these core Western security
   institutions and assesses their complementarity and overlap across three
   sets of tasks: defence and empowerment, crisis management, and security
   sector reform. While there is hardly functional overlap in the first and
   second sets, in the third the EU and NATO intersect to a considerable
   degree. Also, there is no significant inter-organisational cooperation
   over Georgia. One key conclusion is that while field-level overlap
   clearly jeopardises institutional effectiveness, overlapping toolboxes -
   as in crisis management - allow for institutional flexibility when one
   international organisation setting offers reputational or practical
   advantages. Against this backdrop, a case can be made contra
   propositions of merging the Common Security and Defence Policy and NATO.},

Abstract = {The metropolis of Rio de Janeiro has always been one of the first areas
   of Brazil to show trends of demographic change, such as decreased
   fertility, new family structures, and population aging. The purpose of
   this paper is to describe the past and recent interactions in urban
   configuration and demographic dynamics of the metropolis of Rio de
   Janeiro, as well as analyze the prospects of urban and demographic
   transition in Brazil, highlighting the behavior of this metropolis
   compared to the national context. Various indicators on urban and
   demographic dynamics were used to address the relationship between
   urbanization processes and demographic transition.},

Abstract = {Decades of research have shown that education reduces individuals'
   prejudices toward people who belong to different groups, but this
   research has focused predominantly on prejudice toward ethnic/racial
   groups, immigrant groups, and general nonconformists. However, it is not
   clear whether education reduces other prejudices against groups along
   different dimensions, including ideological identification. An analysis
   of American National Election Studies data from 1964 to 2012 shows that
   education is related to decreases in interethnic/interracial prejudice,
   but also to increases in ideological (liberal vs. conservative)
   prejudice. This finding could not be explained simply by the greater
   polarization of the American electorate in the past twenty years. The
   results require rethinking how and why education is associated with
   reduced prejudice for certain groups but not others.},

Title = {TESTING CONTACT THEORY AND ATTITUDES ON TRANSGENDER RIGHTS},
Journal = {PUBLIC OPINION QUARTERLY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {81},
Number = {4},
Pages = {956-972},
Month = {WIN},
Abstract = {Most of the public opinion research about sexual and gender minorities
   has focused on attitudes about lesbians and gay men, support for gay
   rights policies, and the factors that affect these attitudes. In
   particular, interpersonal contact with gay and lesbian individuals
   consistently is shown to positively affect attitudes toward these
   groups. Comparable studies about transgender people and transgender
   rights are few in number, and these studies find inconsistent effects of
   interpersonal contact on attitudes toward transgender people. Through
   the use of two unique national surveys, we explore the influence of
   contact with transgender people on attitudes about transgender people
   and about transgender rights. Results show that contact has a positive
   effect on attitudes, and that this effect is consistent across the two
   surveys and across different specifications of interpersonal contact. We
   discuss the implications for interpersonal contact with transgender
   people.
   Interpersonal contact is a key factor shaping attitudes toward gay and
   lesbian individuals and their rights (Lewis 2011), but evidence
   regarding the effect of contact with transgender individuals(1) is
   unsettled. For instance, while interpersonal contact with gay men and
   lesbians has a positive secondary transfer effect to opinions about
   transgender rights (Norton and Herek 2013), no such effect exists for
   contact with transgender people (Flores 2015). Given recent
   controversies related to public restroom usage, as demonstrated by
   debates surrounding North Carolina's contentious Public Facilities
   Privacy and Security Act, we empirically examine whether and under what
   conditions contact with transgender individuals influences attitudes
   about transgender people and rights. We find that interpersonal contact
   has a positive effect on attitudes that is consistent across both
   surveys and multiple specifications of contact.},

Abstract = {Commemorations of shared national history are important to the process
   of nation-building. Support for such national commemorations is not,
   however, evenly distributed in societies. Because this could endanger
   the possible integrative function of commemorative ceremonies, it is
   important to understand the sources of structural differences in
   support. In this article, age differences in support for national
   commemorations in the Netherlands are examined. It is argued that
   because age cohorts grow up with different ideas on what should be
   commemorated they also differ in value attached to such commemorations.
   Data from the National Freedom Enquiry 2012 show that older persons more
   often associate national commemorations with the Second World War than
   younger persons do, and that this is the reason why they are more
   supportive of the annual celebration of Liberation Day. In the
   concluding section, it is argued that more (quantitative) studies should
   be conducted in order to truly understand the mechanisms behind support
   of national commemorations as this may help us to better comprehend the
   processes construing feelings of national belonging.},

Abstract = {This paper investigates how Croats view the minority Serb population in
   Croatia. It is based on focus groups, dyads and interviews conducted in
   Croatia in 2014 and 2015. Serbs constitute the other' to Croatian
   identity, which is defined primarily through language and religion. The
   analysis finds that the predominant war narrative related to the
   1991-1995 conflict, one of defence against a larger Serbian aggressor,
   influences both of these notions of identity, as well as perceptions of
   the Serb minority in the state. Participants displayed contradictory
   attitudes in a discourse that featured many key facets of the war
   narrative. Most respondents agreed that Serbs should be equal members of
   Croatian society, but they also did not believe Cyrillic signs should be
   put up in Vukovar. The introduction of bilingual signs both reduced
   trust in government institutions and was interpreted as a continued
   threat against the Croatian people and state.},

Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Due to the crucial role of political knowledge in democratic
   participation, the measurement of political knowledge has been a major
   concern in the discipline of political science. Common formats used for
   political knowledge questions include multiple-choice items and
   open-ended identification questions. The conventional wisdom holds that
   multiple-choice items induce guessing behavior, which leads to
   underestimated item-difficulty parameters and biased estimates of
   political knowledge. This article examines guessing behavior in
   multiple-choice items and argues that a successful guess requires
   certain levels of knowledge conditional on the difficulties of items. To
   deal with this issue, we propose a Bayesian IRT guessing model that
   accommodates the guessing components of item responses. The proposed
   model is applied to analyzing survey data in Taiwan, and the results
   show that the proposed model appropriately describes the guessing
   components based on respondents' levels of political knowledge and item
   characteristics. That is, in general, partially informed respondents are
   more likely to have a successful guess because well-informed respondents
   do not need to guess and barely informed ones are highly seducible by
   the attractive distractors. We also examine the gender gap in political
   knowledge and find that, even when the guessing effect is accounted for,
   men are more knowledgeable than women about political affairs, which is
   consistent with the literature.},

Abstract = {There have been many explanations for why countries ratify global
   environmental treaties. They range from neorealist theory, to hegemony
   theory, world society theory, and network embeddedness theory. Drawing
   on hegemonic transition theory, this paper provides evidence that prior
   to the fall of the Soviet Union, strong and weak countries ratified a
   treaty if the USA or the USSR ratified the treaty first. After the fall
   of the Soviet Union, countries' proximity to world society institutions
   increased the likelihood of ratifying a treaty, and only weaker
   countries emulated the ratifications of the USA and Russia. However,
   weaker countries also emulated economic, religious, and language peers,
   diplomatic ties, and neighbors as well. In contrast, more powerful
   countries ratified treaties more independently. We studied the
   ratifications of eight universal environmental treaties by 166 countries
   between 1981 and 2008 and showed that as the geopolitical context
   changed, the diffusion process changed. The paper argues that the
   hegemonic transition which took place in the late 1980s and early 1990s
   was an enabling event that helped to explain the new roles that major
   powers assumed in the 1990s and 2000s and opened the door to the
   ascendency of global institutions and broader participation in the
   environmental regime.},

Abstract = {In the last 20 years, two broadly defined theories have sought to
   explain the relationship between economic inequality and redistribution.
   The well-known hypothesis set forth by Meltzer and Richard (1981) states
   that larger income differences between the median voter and the average
   income earner should increase redistributive pressures in democratic
   regimes. Power Resource Theory (PRT), by contrast, argues that income
   inequality breeds power inequality and should dampen redistribution.
   Critical to both theories is the translation of redistributive interest
   into policy signals. This article considers protests as signals that
   increase the salience of inequality among voters. Results provide
   evidence that protests facilitate more progressive cash transfers in
   highly unequal environments but have modest effects in more egalitarian
   ones.},

Abstract = {The empirical record of dispute settlement cases under World Trade
   Organization (WTO) rules on energy subsidies consists only of cases
   against renewable energy (RE) subsidies, whereas WTO members have not
   challenged others' much larger and environmentally harmful fossil fuel
   subsidies. Yet, the WTO agreement on subsidies and countervailing
   measures would at first sight seem to create possibilities to forestall
   environmentally harmful subsidization. In this article, we assess
   possible explanations for the skewed distribution of energy subsidies
   dispute settlement complaints at the WTO. We argue that differences in
   legally relevant characteristics of fossil fuel subsidies, on the one
   hand, and RE subsidies, on the other hand, largely explain this
   observation. In the case of RE subsidies, in particular, the disputes
   filed to date have targeted a much narrower set of measures than the
   whole range of RE subsidies currently in place, namely those
   incorporating a local content requirement component. Although this
   finding is not new, we have probed into this question more
   systematically, both by widening the scope of the empirical analysis
   from actual to potential WTO disputes on energy-related policies the
   European Union and the USA might have initiated, and by systematically
   assessing the plausibility of alternative explanations.},

Abstract = {This article investigates how international organizations can support
   fuel subsidy reform. Departing from earlier studies, we focus on the
   ability of international organizations to assist national governments
   directly in the enactment and implementation of national reforms. While
   international organizations lack the capacity to directly enforce policy
   or force countries to abolish subsidies, they can increase the cost of
   reform reversal by governments that have a preference for reform but
   worry about the credibility and durability of their reforms. Moreover,
   international organizations can support learning from peers. In
   practice, governments interested in subsidy reform can announce a public
   commitment and submit progress reports to peer review by other countries
   under the auspices of an international organization. We characterize the
   institutional design of international organizations for success, discuss
   the role of the civil society in the process, and offer short
   illustrations from recent efforts by international organizations to
   promote fuel subsidy reform.},

Abstract = {Drawing from theories of regime interplay and social learning, this
   article investigates linkages between hybrid governance schemes and
   intergovernmental regimes. My analytic framework suggests that, by
   enhancing cooperation among stakeholders, transnational public-private
   partnerships will facilitate policy-makers' learning, and accordingly
   advance the formation of intergovernmental regimes. Here I use
   qualitative methods to examine the influence of the UNEP Global Mercury
   Partnership on negotiations over different components of the Minamata
   Convention on Mercury. Technical and scientific information provided by
   this partnership helped relevant policy-makers understand the problems
   to be addressed and some appropriate solutions, thereby accelerating the
   consensus-making process and shaping the features of certain provisions.
   I also compare the influences of different partnership areas, revealing
   that inclusive stakeholder engagement and boundary coordination between
   different governance schemes are two important conditions for
   transnational partnerships to promote cooperation in intergovernmental
   fora.},

Abstract = {Media-based event data-i.e., data comprised from reporting by media
   outlets-are widely used in political science research. However, events
   of interest (e.g., strikes, protests, conflict) are often
   underreportedby these primary and secondary sources, producing
   incomplete data that risks inconsistency and bias in subsequent
   analysis. While general strategies exist to help ameliorate this bias,
   these methods do not make full use of the information oft en available
   to researchers. Specifically, much of the event data used in the social
   sciences is drawn from multiple, overlapping news sources (e.g., Agence
   France-Presse, Reuters). Therefore, we propose a novel maximum
   likelihood estimator that corrects for misclassification in data arising
   from multiple sources. In the most general formulation of our estimator,
   researchers can specify separate sets of predictors for the true-event
   model and each of the misclassification models characterizing whether a
   source fails to report on an event. As such, researchers are able to
   accurately test theories on both the causes of and reporting on an event
   of interest. Simulations evidence that our technique regularly
   outperforms current strategies that either neglect misclassification,
   the unique features of the data-generating process, or both. We also
   illustrate the utility of this method with a model of repression using
   the Social Conflict in Africa Database.},

Title = {Combining Double Sampling and Bounds to Address Nonignorable Missing
   Outcomes in Randomized Experiments},

Abstract = {Missing outcome data plague many randomized experiments. Common
   solutions rely on ignorability assumptions that may not be credible in
   all applications. We propose a method for confronting missing outcome
   data that makes fairly weak assumptions but can still yield informative
   bounds on the average treatment effect. Our approach is based on a
   combination of the double sampling design and nonparametric worst-case
   bounds. We derive a worst-case bounds estimator under double sampling
   and provide analytic expressions for variance estimators and confidence
   intervals. We also propose a method for covariate adjustment using
   poststratification and a sensitivity analysis for nonignorable
   missingness. Finally, we illustrate the utility of our approach using
   Monte Carlo simulations and a placebo-controlled randomized field
   experiment on the effects of persuasion on social attitudes with
   survey-based outcome measures.},

Abstract = {The Berlin-Hohenschonhausen memorial is located on the site of the main
   remand prison for people detained by the Stasi, the GDR secret police.
   In this exploration of memory practices at the site, the concept of
   marginalisation will be used both in a geographical and in a
   metaphorical sense. I will first consider the significance of the
   prison's relatively peripheral location in the north-eastern district of
   Lichtenberg. Anchoring the analysis within theories of museology, in
   particular the museum as experiential site and as site of trauma, I will
   explore the manner in which the once-marginalised voices of former
   prisoners now find expression as they conduct guided tours, thus
   continuing to recall their experiences of imprisonment and isolation at
   the very site where the trauma occurred. Visitors to the memorial can
   also view a permanent exhibition documenting the history of political
   persecution at the prison; eyewitness testimony is inscribed very
   powerfully into this narrative also. I will explore how past trauma is
   narrated and performed both during those guided tours and throughout the
   permanent exhibition. This analysis contends that the
   Berlin-Hohenschonhausen memorial is an essential space of agency,
   allowing for the articulation of previously marginalised voices and for
   their inscription into the post-unification memorial landscape.},

Abstract = {Events in Ukraine have rekindled discussions about NATO's post-Cold War
   purpose and the way it relates to the EU. Through EU sanctions and a
   traditional military response from NATO, the West has manoeuvred itself
   into a paradoxical situation where every step it takes to reassure its
   Eastern allies increases rather than diffuses tensions with Russia. On
   the one hand, it seems that decades of carefully crafted strategic
   narratives of de-escalation are now in limbo. On the other, it might
   have indeed been the sustained attempt to create a liberal post-Cold War
   order that produced an ``integration dilemma{''}, and ultimately drove
   Russia to the defensive realist logic of a Waltzian ``security
   dilemma{''}. We argue that NATO's reaction might have been based on a
   stylised threat and historical resentments rather than on a carefully
   calculated risk. Looking beyond the EU and NATO's recent strategic
   choices, we argue that the situation can only be resolved by re-engaging
   Russia in a renewed de-escalatory dialogue that involves both the EU and
   NATO with a greater emphasis on the nuanced, but important, distinctions
   between the integration and security dilemmas.},

Abstract = {This article is the first comparative study on the historical
   development of trade unions in Cyprus. It assesses the impact of the
   historical trajectory and ethnic division on the contemporary condition
   of the trade unions, which substantially diverge from each other. It
   compares and contrasts the framework, conditions and forms of trade
   unionism across the dividing line, focusing on the current conjuncture
   and accounts for them using a historical institutionalist approach. It
   concludes that disparity is likely to persist although recent austerity
   policies have been posing similar challenges to the trade unions on both
   sides of the divide.},

Journal = {EUROPEAN SECURITY},

Volume = {26},
Number = {4},
Pages = {552-574},
Abstract = {This paper calls for a qualitative turn in discussing NATO
   burden-sharing. The paper takes issue with the numerical burden-sharing
   narrative in NATO and identifies its two main problems. Despite being
   simple, the 2\% defence spending pledge lacks other basic attributes of
   any contributory system: fairness and effectiveness. Drawing from
   concepts of distributive justice, the paper analyses NATO's first
   burden-sharing debates and demonstrates that due to their qualitatively
   different capabilities, the allies agreed on an egalitarian
   ability-to-pay distributive justice. Furthermore, it shows that the
   allies refrained from implementing fairness in terms of a
   one-size-fits-all formula, since this simple numerical approach could
   not produce fair and effective burden-sharing at the same time. Rather,
   they developed a dynamic framework for optimal sharing. These formative
   burden-sharing debates provide valuable lessons learned for the current
   build-up of NATO's posture: less focused on formal sharing, more
   concerned with strategic outputs.},

Abstract = {To cope with increasing air traffic congestion, the European Union
   launched the Single European Sky in the early 2000s, intending to reform
   the European airspace which, at that time, was still fragmented by
   national frontiers. However, this has not been a purely civilian task,
   as military air transport is likewise affected. In fact, NATO has been
   concerned by the challenges facing the European Air Traffic Management
   environment due to the growing commercial aviation since its early days.
   For this, the European Defence Agency has been tasked to coordinate
   military views, thus opening a window of opportunity for EU-NATO
   relations. Both organisations promoting close coordination between the
   users of civilian and military airspace have built direct contact with
   each other. While examining how NATO and the EU are shaping their
   informal cooperation in this sector, the article considers the airspace
   community of users as a configuration of relations where inevitable
   inter- and intra-institutional power play is involved to reform the
   European airspace.},

Title = {THEORY AND PRACTICE IN NONPROBABILITY SURVEYS PARALLELS BETWEEN CAUSAL
   INFERENCE AND SURVEY INFERENCE},
Journal = {PUBLIC OPINION QUARTERLY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {81},
Number = {SI},
Pages = {250-271},
Abstract = {Many in the survey research community have expressed concern at the
   growing popularity of nonprobability surveys. The absence of random
   selection prompts justified concerns about self-selection producing
   biased results and means that traditional, design-based estimation is
   inappropriate. This paper seeks to provide insight into the conditions
   under which nonprobability surveys can be expected to provide estimates
   free of selection bias. In fields such as epidemiology and economics
   that routinely work with observational data, researchers have identified
   the necessary conditions for unbiased estimation of causal effects when
   treatments are not assigned randomly. Similar conditions apply to survey
   estimates when respondents are not randomly selected. Drawing on this
   body of research, we propose a framework composed of three elements that
   determine the level of selection bias in survey estimates. In this
   paper, we first provide a general overview of these components and
   demonstrate the link between causal inference and survey inference in
   the probability-based setting. Second, we give simplified examples to
   demonstrate how each of the components can contribute to bias in survey
   estimates. Finally, we review current practices in the area of
   nonprobability data collection and estimation, and specify how these
   methods relate to the elements identified here.},

Abstract = {This article focuses on one of the dominant interpretations of European
   integration, namely the reconciliation narrative that defines European
   integration as a peacebuilding process. The study is divided into three
   main parts. The first clarifies the various conceptions of
   reconciliation as a political process. The second examines the
   reconciliation narrative as a discourse. The analysis of the references
   made by EU representatives shows that this narrative can be either
   backward-looking (an ex post rationalisation of `what Europe was') or
   future-oriented (a description of `what Europe should be'). The third
   part emphasises the reconciliation narrative as a guideline for action
   in regions as diverse as the Balkans, East Asia, the African Great Lakes
   and the Middle East. The aim of this article is to determine whether the
   EU experience, captured by the reconciliation narrative, can - and
   should - be replicated. Its main conclusion concerns the need for a
   polyphonic attitude within the EU, and the need for a modest attitude
   towards third parties, in terms of both timing and objectives.},

Abstract = {Despite international regulations that prohibit the trans-boundary
   movement of electronic and electric waste (e-waste), non-reusable
   e-waste is often illegally mixed with reusable e-waste and results in
   being sent to developing countries. As developing countries are not well
   prepared to properly manage e-waste, this illegal trade has important
   negative externalities and creates `environmental injustice'. The two
   main information problems on the e-waste market are imperfect monitoring
   and imperfect information on the so-called `degree of purity' of the
   e-waste. In this paper, we use a simple bilateral North-South trade
   model and show that there exists an alternative e-waste market that is
   better than the standard e-waste market for developing countries. This
   alternative e-waste market is a joint trade in reusable and non-reusable
   e-waste. In both cases, we consider demand and supply sides, plus the
   equilibrium of the e-waste market to show that the alternative market
   that we propose is better for developing countries.},

Abstract = {Conditional cash transfer programs may boost the electoral fortunes of
   incumbents among beneficiary groups, but do they also influence
   recipient attitudes toward state legitimacy? This article examines the
   relationship between Brazil's Bolsa Familia program and recipients'
   sense of the Brazilian state's political legitimacy, from 2007 to 2014.
   Using AmericasBarometer data and propensity score matching, this study
   provides evidence that targeted cash benefits correlate with citizens'
   views of the state, but that this relationship is limited to increasing
   trust in core state institutions, local government, and incumbent
   political actors. Diffuse dimensions of regime legitimacy, including
   recipients' sense of political community, support for regime principles,
   and retrospective perceptions of national economic performance, are
   largely unaffected by the receipt of targeted benefits. Over time, the
   evidence also suggests that the impact of program receipt on these
   measures of support remains largely unchanged.},

Abstract = {National day speeches play an explicit part in defining national
   identities. In this article, we examine how mayors in Norwegian
   municipalities reflect on Norway's increased diversity in their 17 May
   speeches. National day speeches in Norway are supposed to focus on
   unity, not conflict. Yet, what have they become in the context of
   diversity? In applying theoretical perspectives on nations, rituals and
   language to data consisting of a selection of speeches, our analysis
   identifies themes that structure a typical 17 May speech. We explore the
   use of plural pronouns in the speeches and how they make Norwegian
   national identity more or less accessible for people with minority
   backgrounds. By including ethnic minorities in national day rhetoric,
   the speakers negotiate who belongs in the Norwegian community in a less
   directly political way than in everyday life. Yet, whilst the genre is
   celebratory, the national day speeches also echo different political
   attitudes towards diversity and integration.},

Abstract = {There are few dozen areas in dispute around the world, where the borders
   have not been agreed by the involved parties or by the international
   community. The dispute over the Israeli border is particularly complex
   as it not only presents disagreement between the opposing sides in play
   but also in the international arena and within the Israeli political
   system and society. This paper examines one way in which the State of
   Israel is trying to define its borders through postage stamps. The
   argument raised is that Israel issues stamps that deal with disputed
   territorial areas in accordance with the ideology of the ruling party of
   a certain period, as well as the respective social consensus surrounding
   a particular area. Our findings support this argument and find three
   meta-messages incorporated into the stamps, including the historical
   connection between the State of Israel and the land of Israel, unified
   Jerusalem, and the Christian connection to Jerusalem.},

Abstract = {This study examines the effect of prepaid and large postpaid monetary
   incentives using data from an experimental version of the Survey of
   Consumer Finances. The survey was fielded in person to a random sample
   of adults in high-income areas of the United States. Monetary incentives
   were randomly assigned: \$ 5 prepaid incentive and notification
   postcard, or no prepaid incentive and no postcard. In addition, promised
   incentives were much greater in value than are typically offered by
   surveys: \$ 50, \$ 100, or \$ 150 upon completion of the survey. The
   study analyzes the effect of variation in these incentives on unit
   response, including respondent- initiated phone calls to complete the
   survey, to an interviewer-administered survey about household finances.
   We find that prepaid incentives increased respondent-initiated phone
   interviews and the overall response rate and that \$ 100 and \$ 150
   promised incentives both increased response rates relative to the \$ 50
   incentive, thereby reducing interviewer effort.},

Abstract = {This article investigates political opportunities and constraints
   associated with incorporating the concept of universal citizenship into
   migration debates. Analyzing the speeches of Ecuador's president Rafael
   Correa over eight years, the article argues that Correa strategically
   crafted a narrative of universal citizenship to undergird politically
   beneficial policies. Political constraints from constituents and rivals,
   and the populist nature of his governing style, hollowed out progressive
   migration policy innovations to the point that universal citizenship
   became a rhetorical device more than a substantive policy agenda.
   Through this empirical case, the article develops a more nuanced
   critical understanding of universal citizenship discourses as sites for
   negotiating the relationship between states and migrants.},

Abstract = {Using data from a new question in the 2011 UK census, national
   identities across minority ethno-religious groups in England, Wales and
   Scotland are compared. The findings not only substantiate earlier work
   showing high levels of British identification among minority groups but
   also demonstrate that this does not extend to sub-state national
   identities. The extent of sub-state national identification varies
   between different minorities, but the nature of this variation also
   depends on the specific (sub-state) national context. The findings may
   be understood in relation to key biographical markers' of national
   identity. These markers help explain variations in sub-state national
   identities to a much greater extent than British identity, but their
   effect also varies across the different nations. The analysis
   demonstrates the importance of examining sub-state as well as state
   (British) identities and heeding differences in the ways in which these
   identities might be conceived and asserted across national borders
   within the same state.},

Abstract = {Electoral opposition to long-established authoritarian regimes may be
   loyal or rejectionist. Loyal oppositionists vote to send a selective
   signal to rulers; rejectionist oppositionists vote blank or void the
   ballot in full disapproval. In Cuba, the number of candidates equals the
   number of seats, yet voters may vote blank, void, or selectively
   (choosing some but not all candidates on the ballot), although the
   Communist Party has campaigned for all candidates. This article uses a
   unique dataset for Cuba's 2013 National Assembly elections to study
   aggregate opposition outcomes. It shows the emergence of a loyal
   opposition, which sometimes votes for and sometimes against Communist
   Party candidates. The rejectionist opposition, stable over time, never
   votes for Communist Party candidates; it is found where the Communist
   Party behaves monopolistically. This combined opposition has better
   national-level political information; it comes from more educated or
   larger urban areas or areas closer to Havana.},

Title = {The genesis and end of institutional fragmentation in global governance

Abstract = {Global governance on climate change experienced institutional
   fragmentation by the generation of a competing institution, the
   Asia-Pacific Partnership on Clean Development and Climate (APP), in
   2005, outside the previously dominant institutions of the United Nations
   Framework Convention on Climate Change and the Kyoto Protocol. Why was a
   competing institution created beside the extant dominant institutions in
   a singular international issue area? This puzzling question on the
   genesis of institutional fragmentation has been theoretically explored
   through international relation theories. However, a full-fledged answer
   has not come yet. This paper explains the genesis of institutional
   fragmentation on the theoretical grounds of constructivism's normative
   contestation for strategic social construction. Results show that the
   APP was created by a norm entrepreneur as an organizational platform to
   embody normative contestation and diffuse the competing normative
   interpretations of climate change norms.},

Abstract = {This paper investigates the delegation of economic policy implementation
   in non-democratic settings. It draws on a dataset of statutory and
   administrative regulation created between 1991 and 2011 in Kazakhstan in
   order to investigate economic effects of bureaucratic discretion. The
   examination of regional and temporal variation in the number and detail
   of economic regulations shows that while regulatory intervention does
   not have a discernible effect on economic performance, statutory
   constraints on bureaucratic discretion have a positive effect. This
   finding supports the notion that in the absence of societal
   accountability, statutory constraint on the administrative apparatus
   leads to a more stable business climate and better economic performance.
   The paper explicates the ways in which theories of delegation apply to
   autocracies and broadens our understanding of political control over
   economic policy implementation.},

Title = {THE INFORMED CONSENT TO RECORD LINKAGE IN PANEL STUDIES OPTIMAL STARTING
   WAVE, CONSENT REFUSALS, AND SUBSEQUENT PANEL ATTRITION},
Journal = {PUBLIC OPINION QUARTERLY},

Abstract = {Social scientists increasingly link survey data with administrative
   records. However, data protection legislation often requires
   respondents' informed consent prior to record linkage. This has
   confronted research with nontrivial refusal rates in combination with
   selectivity of the consent decision. In longitudinal surveys, linkage
   requests may also increase attrition rates in subsequent waves, as many
   respondents perceive record linkages negatively. Hence, in panel
   surveys, both nonresponse forms potentially bias the resulting datasets.
   The present paper examines (a) whether we can minimize consent refusals
   in a longitudinal survey by varying which survey wave includes the
   linkage request and (b) whether such requests increase subsequent
   attrition. To test this, we implement a randomized survey experiment
   within a face-to-face household panel survey focusing on migrants in
   Germany. Respondents of the IAB-SOEP Migration Sample, conducted by the
   Institute for Employment Research (IAB) and the Socio-Economic Panel
   study (SOEP), were randomly allocated into three groups: first, a
   control group without record linkage; a second group that was asked in
   wave 1 (2013) to allow data linkage to administrative employment and
   benefits records held by the Federal Employment Agency; and a third
   group that was asked the same question in wave 2 (2014). We found
   neither significant differences in consent rates when introducing the
   request in wave 1 or 2 nor significant differences in panel attrition in
   subsequent waves. Therefore, results suggest that requesting consent to
   link records in wave 1 of a panel study provides the largest quantity of
   linked data without inflating panel attrition.},

Title = {Allocation of aid for adaptation to climate change: Do vulnerable
   countries receive more support?},

Abstract = {Wealthy countries spend increasing amounts of aid to support adaptation
   to climate change in developing countries and have committed under the
   UN Framework Convention on Climate Change to prioritize adaptation aid
   to those ``particularly vulnerable{''} to climate change. While research
   has started to track this aid, it has not yet examined its allocation
   across all donor and recipient countries. We thus do not know to what
   extent vulnerable countries indeed receive more support for adaptation.
   We address this research gap and ask: how does this commitment to
   prioritizing particularly vulnerable countries translate into actual
   adaptation aid allocation? To what extent do vulnerable countries
   receive more adaptation aid? We address these questions though a
   quantitative analysis of data from the Organization for Economic
   Cooperation and Development on bilateral adaptation aid from 2011
   through 2014. In contrast to other studies, we find that
   vulnerability-or more precisely, vulnerability indicators-matter for
   adaptation aid allocation. Countries that are more exposed to climate
   change risks, such as extreme weather events or sea level rise, receive
   more adaptation aid, both on a per capita basis and as a percentage of
   all adaptation aid. These results indicate that collectively (even if
   not at the level of each individual donor) donors align their bilateral
   adaptation aid allocation with global promises.},

Abstract = {This chapter analyzes the socio-territorial pattern of the metropolis of
   Rio de Janeiro as a result of the dispute between housing production
   modes, in which the capitalistic mode imposes itself. Such a dispute
   emerges when auto-constructed popular spaces-as well as the commoditized
   ones-join the corporate circuit of appreciation. It examined trends in
   housing production by these agents in the last decade, starting with a
   more general analysis of the metropolitan totality and then privileging
   four trends of socio-territorial dynamics, in the district scale:
   elitization of the upper districts of the capital; formation of new
   concentrations of middle sectors; proletarianization of the inner city;
   and increasing social distance between favelas and peripheries.},

Abstract = {This chapter describes Beyond Bureaucracy as an emerging research field
   concerned with radical innovation for governance of juropolitical
   systems. The grand objective of Beyond Bureaucracy is to act as an
   incubator for the development of new forms of organisation and new
   technological artefacts, which would enable transformation of public
   governance. In this role, Beyond Bureaucracy does not prescribe a
   concrete outcome, but rather calls for creative ideas, radical visions,
   and rigorous discussions on how twenty-century technology can serve as a
   basis for further transformation and radical development. This chapter
   explains how Beyond Bureaucracy differs from related fields like
   e-Government or e-Democracy, provides an overview over the state of
   research in Beyond Bureaucracy, provides links to follow-up literature,
   and aims to provide a seed vision on the transformation potentials that
   could be researched-towards in scope of Beyond Bureaucracy.},

Abstract = {I develop a novel method to detect election fraud from irregular
   patterns in the distribution of vote-shares. I build on a widely
   discussed observation that in some elections where fraud allegations
   abound, suspiciously many polling stations return coarse vote-shares
   (e.g., 0.50, 0.60, 0.75) for the ruling party, which seems highly
   implausible in large electorates. Using analytical results and
   simulations, I showthat sheer frequency of such coarse vote-shares is
   entirely plausible due to simple numeric laws and does not by itself
   constitute evidence of fraud. To avoid false positive errors in fraud
   detection, I propose a resampled kernel density method (RKD) to measure
   whether the coarse vote-shares occur too frequently to raise a
   statistically qualified suspicion of fraud. I illustrate the method on
   election data from Russia and Canada as well as simulated data. A
   software package is provided for an easy implementation of the method.},

Abstract = {News media outlets are crucial for the dissemination of information on
   climate change issues, but the nature of the coverage varies across the
   world, depending on local geopolitical and economic contexts. Despite
   extensive scholarship on media and climate change, less attention has
   been paid to comparing how climate change is reported by news media in
   developed and developing countries. This article undertakes a
   cross-national study of how elite newspapers in four major greenhouse
   gas emitting countriesthe United States, the United Kingdom, China and
   Indiaframe coverage of climate change negotiations. We show that framing
   is similar by these newspapers in developing countries, but there are
   clear differences in framing in the developed world, and between the
   developed and developing countries. While an overwhelming majority of
   these news stories and the frames they deploy are pegged to the stance
   of domestic institutions in the developing countries, news frames from
   developed countries are more varied.},

Abstract = {We discuss a statistical procedure to carry out empirical research that
   combines recent insights about preanalysis plans (PAPs) and replication.
   Researchers send their datasets to an independent third party who
   randomly generates training and testing samples. Researchers perform
   their analysis on the training sample and are able to incorporate
   feedback from both colleagues, editors, and referees. Once the paper is
   accepted for publication the method is applied to the testing sample and
   it is those results that are published. Simulations indicate that, under
   empirically relevant settings, the proposed method delivers more power
   than a PAP. The effect mostly operates through a lower likelihood that
   relevant hypotheses are left untested. The method appears better suited
   for exploratory analyses where there is significant uncertainty about
   the outcomes of interest. We do not recommend using the method in
   situations where the treatment are very costly and thus the available
   sample size is limited. An interpretation of the method is that it
   allows researchers to perform direct replication of their work. We also
   discuss a number of practical issues about the method's feasibility and
   implementation.},

Abstract = {Polycentric systems of governance may help address two key challenges in
   the transnational governance of socioecological systems, the problems of
   fragmentation and fit, but there is limited understanding of the
   processes through which polycentric governance systems emerge. This
   paper draws on institutional economics and accounts of international
   regime formation to develop an ideal-type model of the evolution of
   transnational polycentric governance. In particular, the model
   highlights systematically different transaction costs across different
   phases of polycentric governance evolution. These costs result in
   important trade-offs between building a broad coalition during agenda
   setting and addressing complexity in implementation. The plausibility of
   the model is probed using the case of Reducing Emissions from
   Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD+), drawing on global-level
   data on REDD+ collaboration, as well as fieldwork in Central Kalimantan,
   Indonesia. This case suggests that low transaction costs in the
   agenda-setting phase led to a confused vision for what REDD+ should be,
   ultimately hampering implementation.},

Abstract = {This article investigates the roles of policy diffusion and policy
   learning in shaping the design of California's cap-and-trade system. On
   the surface, it is very similar to other cap-and-trade programs, but in
   practice many detailed differences reflect active efforts by California
   policy-makers to avoid flaws that they saw in other systems, such as the
   EU ETS and the US East Coast's Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative. We
   assess how California's cap-and-trade system emerged, the significance
   of policy diffusion, and the lessons for other trading systems by
   applying two broad sets of theoretical framesthe role of policy
   diffusion and the role of organized local political concerns. We find
   that despite the signature status of the trading system, California
   mostly relies on much less transparent and more costly direct
   regulation. We also find that California's cap-and-trade system has
   developed mostly in its own, special political context, which hampers
   the feasibility of cross-border trading.},

Abstract = {What difference does it make if the state makes people vote? The
   question is central to normative debates about the rights and duties of
   citizens in a democracy, and to contemporary policy debates in a number
   of Latin American countries over what actions states should take to
   encourage electoral participation. Focusing on a rare case of abolishing
   compulsory voting in Venezuela, this article shows that not forcing
   people to vote yielded a more unequal distribution of income. The
   evidence supports Arend Lijphart's claim, advanced in his 1996
   presidential address to the American Political Science Association, that
   compulsory voting can offset class bias in turnout and, in turn,
   contribute to the equality of influence.},

Title = {BREAKING DOWN BIPARTISANSHIP WHEN AND WHY CITIZENS REACT TO COOPERATION
   ACROSS PARTY LINES},
Journal = {PUBLIC OPINION QUARTERLY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {81},
Number = {2},
Pages = {473-494},
Month = {SUM},
Abstract = {There are currently two competing accounts of how citizens react to
   bipartisanship. Some scholars claim that citizens desire greater
   bipartisanship in Congress and punish legislators who are too partisan,
   while others argue that citizens evaluate bipartisanship in an
   inconsistent fashion, even to the point of punishing same-party
   politicians for engaging in bipartisan cooperation. However, neither
   account actually clarifies when and why citizens value bipartisanship,
   because existing work has been unable to disentangle the mere fact of
   bipartisan cooperation from two associated phenomena (legislative
   accomplishment and civility) and has not identified citizens' reasons
   for valuing bipartisanship. To address this, I run a national survey
   experiment through YouGov's online panel varying four aspects of the
   legislative process: the bipartisanship of a bill's coalition, whether
   the bill passes or fails, the civility of the debate, and the party
   affiliation of the bill's sponsor. I find that bipartisanship increases
   confidence in Congress only when it is paired with legislative
   accomplishment, but citizens reward bipartisanship by individual
   legislators regardless of bill passage or failure. Moreover, citizens
   perceive opposite-party legislators who act in a bipartisan manner to be
   more public spirited, suggesting that bipartisan cooperation can break
   down negative stereotypes of the opposite party. My results indicate
   that legislators who engage in bipartisan cooperation may gain at least
   a few votes from opposite-party citizens without damaging their standing
   among same-party citizens, suggesting that the public as a whole should
   not be blamed for the lack of bipartisanship in Congress.},

Title = {Dreaming as a critical discourse of national belonging: China Dream,
   American Dream and world dream},
Journal = {NATIONS AND NATIONALISM},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {23},
Number = {2},
Pages = {248-270},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {This article explores the normative politics of national belonging
   through an analysis of the China Dream' and the American Dream'. It
   traces how politicians and public intellectuals employ such slogans to
   highlight how national dreams emerge in times of crisis and involve a
   combination of aspirations and anxieties. It compares parallel
   rhetorical strategies - patriotic worrying' in China and the American
   Jeremiad in the US - to examine how belonging to these two nations
   involves a nostalgic longing for the past as a model for the future.
   Debates about the meaning of these national dreams highlight the tension
   between freedom and equality in the US, between the individual and the
   collective in China, and between longing for the true nation, and
   belonging in the actual nation for both countries. It concludes that
   while this quest for redemption through past models limits opportunities
   for critical discourse in China, the American Dream still contains much
   promise'. The China Dream and the American Dream thus are, at the same
   time, 1) familiar expressions of nationalism and national belonging, and
   2) ongoing self/Other coherence-producing performances that help us to
   question received notions of nationalism and national belonging.},

Abstract = {This paper serves international water conflict resolution efforts by
   examining the ways that states contest hegemonic transboundary water
   arrangements. The conceptual framework of dynamic transboundary water
   interaction that it presents integrates theories about change and
   counter-hegemony to ascertain coercive, leverage, and liberating
   mechanisms through which contest and transformation of an arrangement
   occur. While the mechanisms can be active through sociopolitical
   processes either of compliance or of contest of the arrangement, most
   transboundary water interaction is found to contain elements of both.
   The role of power asymmetry is interpreted through classification of
   intervention strategies that seek to either influence or challenge the
   arrangements. Coexisting contest and compliance serve to explain in part
   the stasis on the Jordan and Ganges rivers (where the non-hegemons have
   in effect consented to the arrangement), as well as the changes on the
   Tigris and Mekong rivers, and even more rapid changes on the Amu Darya
   and Nile rivers (where the non-hegemons have confronted power asymmetry
   through influence and challenge). The framework also stresses how
   transboundary water events that may appear isolated are more accurately
   read within the many sociopolitical processes and arrangements they are
   shaped by. By clarifying the typically murky dynamics of interstate
   relations over transboundary waters, furthermore, the framework exposes
   a new suite of entry points for hydro-diplomatic initiatives.},

Abstract = {Marijuana and same-sex marriage are two of the fastest changing and most
   widely debated opinion and policy issues in the United States. Research
   has examined public opinion on marijuana legalization and same-sex
   marriage legalization individually, but has neglected to examine these
   two issues together. We use General Social Survey data from 1988 to 2014
   to compare four groups: (1) those who support neither; (2) those who
   support marijuana but not same-sex marriage legalization; (3) those who
   support marriage but not marijuana legalization; and (4) those who
   support both. This study provides four key findings: (1) marijuana and
   same-sex marriage attitudes have changed simultaneously; (2) most people
   hold these attitudes in tandem, and there has been a precipitous decline
   in the percentage of people who support legalizing neither and a
   remarkable increase in the percentage who support legalizing both; (3)
   attitudes toward both issues are liberalizing across all social and
   ideological groups, suggesting a society-wide redefinition of both
   behaviors as publicly accepted issues of individual autonomy; and (4)
   the support bases for marijuana and marriage legalization vary
   systematically by sociodemographic characteristics. We conclude that
   notions of individual autonomy may be increasingly important to the
   American public and their beliefs about what the government should
   regulate.},

Title = {A Modeling Approach for Administrative Record Enumeration in the
   Decennial Census},
Journal = {PUBLIC OPINION QUARTERLY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {81},
Number = {SI},
Pages = {357-384},
Abstract = {The use of administrative records-data collected by governmental
   agencies or commercial businesses in the course of administering a
   program or service-for household enumeration may be one way to
   significantly reduce Decennial Census costs, particularly in nonresponse
   follow-up (NRFU). Administrative records suffer the complications of big
   data in that they are collected for purposes not related to Census
   enumeration, yet contain a wealth of information relevant to Census
   enumeration. This paper describes a modeling approach to determine which
   administrative data are sufficiently reliable to proxy for a field
   response in a way that reduces costs and balances quality. Specifically,
   the approach is to (1) develop and assess models to determine
   characteristics of good-quality administrative records via a
   retrospective study of linked field and administrative data; and (2)
   choose a quality threshold, in a statistically defensible way, at which
   administrative records take the place of field responses. This paper
   presents empirical results illustrating the cost-quality trade-off of
   this approach applied to Census enumeration. We assess three
   classification techniques to further detail the cost-quality trade-off
   and allow flexibility in balancing predictive power and implementation
   complexity.},

Abstract = {The cells, cell lines, embryos, and gametes that are harvested,
   isolated, purified, fertilized, frozen, stored, and defrosted, tested,
   diagnosed, examined and even ``edited{''} in laboratories. As a
   consequence of this multiple form of intervention human cells and
   molecules have recently become the subject of vibrant political and
   ethical debates and targets of legal policymaking. In this scientific
   and political discourse a new phenomenon has emerged, which was coined
   as `molecularization' by Nikolas Rose in his book, The Politics of Life
   Itself. For Rose, molecularization is one of the most important
   characteristics of contemporary biopolitics. When Foucault elaborated
   his ideas about biopolitics and subjectivity, he still focused on the
   body as a whole, and the biopolitical control over it, and not on the
   parts or fragments of the body (Lemke T. Biopolitics: an advanced
   introduction, New York University Press, New York, 2011). Today,
   however, not only scientists, but also regulators view humans more and
   more on the molecular level by developing special scientific terminology
   and legal norms in the fields of genetic research and testing, stem cell
   research, and even assisted reproduction. This phenomenon has appeared
   in several domains of biotechnology, which I will discuss by
   highlighting the consequences of this new scientific gaze. In this
   chapter, therefore, I would like to discuss the practical implications
   of molecularization, and explore how the new biopolitical thinking
   determines legal structures and public discussion in the light of the
   current advances in biotechnology. My goal is to incite a legal dogmatic

Abstract = {This article makes a contribution to the little explored issue of
   evaluating the effectiveness of the EU Common Security and Defence
   Policy (CSDP). Drawing on the interviews with local beneficiaries of two
   missions in Ukraine, one CSDP proper (European Union Advisory Mission)
   and the other a ``hybrid{''} mission (EU Border Assistance Mission), the
   article analyses which factors shape the local beneficiaries' perception
   of a mission being effective or non-effective. It shows the reputational
   approach deriving from the organisational theory can offer a fruitful
   theoretical framework for understanding CSDP perceived effectiveness on
   the ground. The article contributes to the studies of CSDP and its
   engagement with the host state as well as to the nascent academic and
   policy literature on CSDP and Ukraine.},

Abstract = {In advanced industrial democracies, evidence suggests a positive
   relationship between inclusive public policy, collective behavior, and
   political participation. Yet Africa, which generally exhibits high
   levels of collective behavior, often has exclusionary policies and
   variable rates of political participation. Using Afrobarometer data and
   qualitative case analysis in Zambia, this paper argues that the links
   between collective behavior and political participation differ in
   African countries due to lower government capacity and weaker structures
   of accountability linking politicians to policy outcomes. Employing a
   policy feedback framework, it demonstrates that the policy context in
   which collective behavior emerges determines the extent to which it
   influences political participation. Specifically, low levels of service
   provision generate higher levels of collective behavior, indicating that
   communities organize in response to need. The extent to which this
   collective behavior results in political participation, however, depends
   in part on citizens' political efficacy.},

Abstract = {Given the abundance of literature on collective memory practices, there
   is relatively little empirical research on the socialization processes
   explaining the transmission of such practices. This article examines to
   what extent war-specific communication and parental exemplar behaviour
   function as a link between the collected memories of individuals and
   society's collective memory. Utilizing data from an online survey
   conducted in 2014, we focus on participation in the activities organized
   on Remembrance Day and Liberation Day in the Netherlands in remembrance
   of the Second World War. We distinguish between public and private
   practices. Our findings highlight that different forms of socialization
   substitute for one another. Whereas communication with non-relatives is
   particularly relevant for those communicating less frequently with
   parents about past war experiences, parental exemplar behaviour, such as
   participating in the two-minute silence on Remembrance Day, plays a
   bigger role amongst those with lower levels of communication with either
   relatives or non-relatives.},

Abstract = {Many recent papers in political science and economics use rainfall as a
   strategy to facilitate causal inference. Rainfall shocks are as-if
   randomly assigned, but the assignment of rainfall by county is highly
   correlated across space. Since clustered assignment does not occur
   within well-defined boundaries, it is challenging to estimate the
   variance of the effect of rainfall on political outcomes. I propose
   using randomization inference with historical weather patterns from 7 3
   years as potential randomizations. I replicate the influential work on
   rainfall and voter turnout in presidential elections in the United
   States by Gomez, Hansford, and Krause (2 0 0 7) and compare the
   estimated average treatment effect (ATE) to a sampling distribution of
   estimates under the sharp null hypothesis of no effect. The alternate
   randomizations are random draws from national rainfall patterns on
   election andwould-be election days, which preserve the clustering in
   treatment assignment and eliminate the need to simulate weather patterns
   or make assumptions about unit boundaries for clustering. I find that
   the effect of rainfall on turnout is subject to greater sampling
   variability than previously estimated using conventional standard
   errors.},

Abstract = {The interrelationship between renewable energy support policies and
   World Trade Organization (WTO) law is an important recent manifestation
   of the challenge to reconcile environmental and economic values in
   contemporary societies. This article strives to contribute to the
   discussion by using the intersection between policies to support
   renewable energy, in particular sustainable biofuels in the EU, and the
   WTO's Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures as a case
   study. The article discusses how efforts to promote renewable energy
   seem to have become contingent upon the core legal notion of `relevant
   markets'. The article further claims that this contingency is
   problematic: renewable energy markets are highly complex in practice,
   and combined with the WTO's convoluted interpretations of `relevant
   markets', the legal outcomes struggle to find the proper balance between
   appropriate support for sustainability and the prevention of
   protectionist market fragmentation.},

Abstract = {This article analyses the precarious alliances concluded between
   insurgent groups in the context of the conflict in Northern Mali that
   began in 2012. Building on the literature on civil wars and social
   movements, it develops a mechanism-based approach that intends to shed
   light on the processes of alliance formation and disintegration that are
   taking place at the meso- and micro-levels of analysis. It shows that
   the solidity and durability of alliances in a civil war context strongly
   depend on the interplay of three intra-organizational and
   inter-organizational mechanisms (brokerage, competition and shifting
   alliance), which contribute to the shaping of complex local power games.
   While ideological compatibility facilitates alignment and organizational
   collaboration, alliances are first and foremost cemented or fissured
   through the changing short- and mid-term personal interests of a variety
   of actors, who try to adapt to a volatile context.},

Abstract = {The Paris Agreement commits nations in Article 2(1) to ``Making finance
   flows consistent with a pathway towards low greenhouse gas emissions and
   climate-resilient development.{''} However there is an absence of
   internationally agreed accounting rules that would permit overall
   assessments of progress to this goal and any meaningful comparisons of
   performance between countries. This is true also for the quantitative
   Copenhagen/CancAn promise by developed nations to jointly mobilize
   US\$100 billion by 2020. Our goal is to provoke discussion about the
   depth of the problems this lack of a functional definition and
   accounting system have created and perpetuated. We do so by describing
   the fragmented system of national reporting of climate finance and how
   the OECD's Rio Marker system is serving neither contributors nor
   recipients. More than a trust issue between developed and developing
   countries, we argue that the lack of modalities to account for climate
   finance also considerably impedes the effective functioning of the
   bottom-up approach that now prevails under the UNFCCC. The deadline to
   propose ``modalities of accounting climate finance{''} by 2018 is a
   crucial window in which to address this chronic issue in international
   climate policy.},

   and political singularity the victims testimony to think a perspective
   of justice that tries to restore, as far as possible, the humiliated
   dignity of the victims. This requires a critical study on the political
   use of oblivion as a technique for legitimizing injustice. In a second
   moment it is studied the importance of the anamnetic memory to recover
   the past of the injustice. In the third and final point, it is studied
   the epistemological status of the testimony of the victims, as an
   ethical reference point for justice policies.},

Abstract = {The overall objective of this work is to capture some of the reflexes
   created by such processes in the relationship between the conditions of
   access to the labor market and the territorial dynamics of the
   metropolis of Rio de Janeiro. In other words, we intend to analyze the
   relationships between the processes of social division of the
   metropolitan territory and the conditions governing the access to
   opportunities in the labor market. We will seek to test to what extent
   the location of individuals and social groups in a socio-spatial
   structure characterized by tendencies to residential segregation and
   territorial segmentation impact on the quality of employment
   (occupational fragility) and on the possibilities of transforming the
   very job opportunity in resources from the labor market (income).},

   MED Operation Sophia},
Journal = {EUROPEAN SECURITY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {26},
Number = {4},
Pages = {507-526},
Abstract = {This article argues that the European Union's capacity to use an
   operational instrument for the purpose of an articulated objective
   constitutes an important, but conceptually neglected and empirically
   underexplored, element of its actorness. In order to fill this gap, the
   article introduces the concept of strategic capacity and develops an
   analytical framework for systematic empirical assessments thereof.
   Drawing on 22 qualitative expert interviews, the framework is applied to
   the EU's maritime operation against human smugglers in the Central
   Mediterranean (EUNAVFOR MED Operation Sophia). The article finds that
   the EU so far has displayed a fairly low degree of strategic capacity in
   its fight against human smugglers. The article argues that this fairly
   low degree of strategic capacity is not to be ascribed to an
   institutional apparatus that is unfit for strategic action, but a
   decision on the part of political decision-makers to give weight to
   symbolic, as opposed to strategic, action. As a result, the operation
   has contributed little to the formal objective of disrupting and
   dismantling human smuggling networks in the Central Mediterranean. In
   some areas, it has even had an adverse effect on this objective.},

Series = {Public Administration and Information Technology},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {25},
Pages = {97-114},
Abstract = {In 2012, the `European Multi-Stakeholder Platform on ICT
   Standardization' (MSP) was inaugurated as a new platform for dialogue on
   European ICT standardization. The MSP was comprised of a wide range of
   members, e.g., representatives of national authorities of EU
   member-states and European Free Trade Association countries; the
   European and international ICT standardization bodies and stakeholder
   organizations representing industry; small-and medium-sized enterprises,
   consumers, and other stakeholders. The MSP was set up by the European
   Commission as a new kind of collaborative forum in ICT standardization,
   partly in response to the otherwise consolidated and formalized European
   standardization system, which had a clear allocation of competences
   between exclusively selected public and private actors, yet also
   inefficiencies due to a rather bureaucratic governance system. This
   chapter outlines the creation of the MSP as a new ICT-enabled
   collaborative decision-making system in European ICT standardization.
   Not due to the application of new technologies, but due to the systemic
   consequences of the fast development of ICT for political,
   administrative and regulatory setups of collaboration in Europe. This
   chapter provides an analysis of the MSP as a new type of forum for
   deliberation and cooperation in European ICT standardization, and it
   outlines how the platform facilitates a regulatory dialogue on ICT
   standardization in Europe. Simultaneously, the MSP plays a significant
   role in public-private co-creation of regulation and ICT
   standardization, and it may prove to be a pathbreaker leading to a
   `paradigm shift' in the governance of European standardization. Finally,
   certain implications of the MSP are discussed.},

Abstract = {The continuous rise of the Serbian state in the nineteenth and early
   twentieth centuries is often described as a typical example of the
   Piedmont-style of national unification. The conventional historiography
   emphasises the role popular nationalism has played in this process,
   making little if any distinctions between the forms of Serbian
   nationalisms within and outside of the Serbian state. This article
   challenges such interpretations and argues that the formation and
   expansion of Serbia had less to do with society-wide national
   aspirations and much more with the internal elite politics within the
   Serbian state. Moreover, the paper makes a case that, rather than being
   a driving force of national unification, the expansionist nationalism
   was a by-product of the state development. This argument is articulated
   further through the comparison of the different nationalist trajectories
   in Serbia and among the ethnic Serbian populations in Bosnia and
   Herzegovina.},
