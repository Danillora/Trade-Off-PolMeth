Abstract = {This article presents an original research based on a set of interviews
   that includes both almost all the chiefs of staff of the office of the
   President of Government and one of the previous presidents of the
   Spanish Government. It tries to understand, from this double point of
   view, the two vertexes of the relationship between the prime minister
   and his main adviser. The study deals with the profile, the emergence
   and expansion of this political figure and its evolution, with
   unpublished documents from Moncloa archives. It also shows the double
   power of exclusion and connection the chief of office has accumulated
   and it develops a comparative analysis of the power exercised by the
   various occupants of the post since the transition to democracy.},

Title = {Electoral competition in Europe's new tripolar political space: Class
   voting for the left, centre-right and radical right},
Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL RESEARCH},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {57},

Abstract = {The rise of the radical right fundamentally changes the face of
   electoral competition in Western Europe. Bipolar competition is becoming
   tripolar, as the two dominant party poles of the twentieth century - the
   left and the centre-right - are challenged by a third pole of the
   radical right. Between 2000 and 2015, the radical right has secured more
   than 12 per cent of the vote in over ten Western European countries.
   This article shows how electoral competition between the three party
   poles plays out at the micro level of social classes. It presents a
   model of class voting that distinguishes between classes that are a
   party's preserve, classes that are contested strongholds of two parties
   and classes over which there is an open competition. Using seven rounds
   of the European Social Survey, it shows that sociocultural professionals
   form the party preserve of the left, and large employers and managers
   the preserve of the centre-right. However, the radical right competes
   with the centre-right for the votes of small business owners, and it
   challenges the left over its working-class stronghold. These two
   contested strongholds attest to the co-existence of old and new patterns
   of class voting. Old patterns are structured by an economic conflict:
   Production workers vote for the left and small business owners for the
   centre-right based on their economic attitudes. In contrast, new
   patterns are linked to the rise of the radical right and structured by a
   cultural conflict.},

Abstract = {How and why do networks of judges make a difference in judicial politics
   in patronage-based systems? Judicial networks provide important benefits
   to both patrons and judges by sharing information about the exchange of
   concrete rewards and sanctions, generating expectations about the
   staying power of the patrons and mobilizing judges when needed. These
   informational and mobilizing practices are at the heart of collective
   judicial autonomy. Yet judges exercise this autonomy in different ways
   depending on the presence of a dominant patronage network, the rigidity
   of the judicial hierarchy with the supreme court on top, and the
   intensity of intra-judicial conflict. I explore the informational and
   mobilizing practices of judicial associations - the most visible
   judicial networks - in post-Soviet Ukraine, a country with a large
   number of these associations, varying numbers of ruling patronage
   networks and two attempts at the abolition of the supreme court. Lessons
   from Ukraine's judicial clientelism may help explain why competitive
   politics with vibrant judicial associationalism fail to entrench
   judicial independence.},

Abstract = {Italy is one of the most representative new immigration countries.'
   Between the 1980s and the 1990s, it became a major country of
   destination for immigrants coming from Asia, Middle East, and North
   Africa. As a result, since the mid-90s, immigration has gained salience
   within the Italian political debate. Building on the existing literature
   on agenda-setting and framing studies, this article studies the
   evolution of the immigration issue in Italy over the last two decades.
   It focuses on the framing and, more specifically, the position political
   actors tend to adopt when debating on immigration. In particular, the
   main research questions are: to what extent is the framing of
   immigration associated with the traditional left vs. right spectrum? Do
   incumbent political parties tend to adopt a different position toward
   immigration than opposition parties? This article analyses party
   competition dynamics over the immigration issue in Italy from 1995 to
   2011. The author carried out a political-claim analysis of articles from
   two Italian national daily newspapers. Findings show that immigration is
   more a positional issue than a valence one. Political actors' positions
   towards migration appear to be anchored to the old left vs. right
   dimension of the political conflict. This demonstrates that parties'
   engagement within the political conflict goes beyond electoral
   campaigns. Finally, being in government seems to play a crucial role in
   softening' the way party actors frame immigration, in terms of both the
   arguments used and the pro- or anti-immigration positions adopted.},

Abstract = {This contribution assesses whether populism is inherently embedded in
   and combined with the ideology of sub-state nationalist parties, using
   Belgium as a case study. We argue that sub-state nationalist parties
   tend to emphasize the opposition between a territorial community ('us')
   versus a dominant center ('them'), a dichotomous view that could overlap
   with the populist ideology focusing on the opposition between the
   homogeneous people and the `corrupt' elite. We compare the policy
   positions of the three major sub-state nationalist parties that operate
   in Belgium: the Vlaams Belang, the New Flemish Alliance (N-VA) and
   Democrat Federalist Independent, using their manifestos and membership
   magazines between 2010 and 2015. We show that the manner in which
   sub-state nationalist parties combine their stances on territoriality to
   a populist rationale depends on their relationship to power (government
   vs. opposition). In doing so, this contribution uniquely relates
   populism to the territorial dimension of Belgian politics.},

Abstract = {This study examines the relationship between forms of government in U.S.
   cities and budgetary cuts that were soon implemented after the 2008
   financial crisis. This analysis focuses on mayor-council and
   council-manager cities to determine the effects that institutional
   arrangements had on municipal governments' ability to implement
   austerity measures in a timely fashion. Using data from the
   International City/County Management Association, this study finds that
   mayor-council cities implemented fewer austerity measures and were less
   likely to implement many of the cutback strategies, when compared to
   municipalities with the council-manager form government.},

Abstract = {In the paper the authors address three research topics. First, the
   authors show that inequality of the distribution of gross and net wages
   in Croatia has increased during the period examined in this paper, thus
   showing that the First stylized fact about the increase of inequality
   recognized in the literature is present in Croatia. Second, they show
   the same is true for the Second stylized fact that concerns changes in
   the top end of the distribution. Third, that the changes in the Atkinson
   index and the relationships of the top and bottom tails of the
   distribution also conform to the stylized facts. The analysis in the
   paper is limited to changes in the inequality of the distribution of net
   (take home) and gross wages in Croatia after 2000. Inequality is
   measured by standard measures of economic inequality. The analysis of
   the paper contributes to the relatively poor understanding of levels and
   changes in economic inequality in Croatia generally and wage inequality
   specifically.},

Abstract = {The pivot to the Asia-Pacific region is Russia's strategic response to
   existential challenges such as the threat of losing great power status,
   and the need to maintain territorial integrity and independence. This
   strategy should not be viewed as meant only to ameliorate the economic
   and demographic situation in the Russian Far East and Eastern Siberia.
   Instead, it should be interpreted as an opportunity for Russia to break
   out of the economic, security, and geographic traps she finds herself in
   within the Western-dominated international order. The emerging
   Asia-Pacific regional order may develop into a new international order
   that will be more competitive; it will not be dominated by a single
   power or ideology but will instead rest on multiple centers of power.
   This order will be more favorable to Russia than the unipolar Atlantic
   one, helping Russia utilize her comparative advantages in territory,
   resources, hard power, political organization, and ability to mobilize
   resources for strategic goals.},

Abstract = {This article discusses the methodological challenges of legislative
   surveys. Following an overview of different types of survey biases, the
   article argues that self-selection and misreporting are the most
   critical problems for legislative surveys. In order to identify the
   self-selection and misreporting biases, we compare the answers with a
   survey from Swiss members of parliament with their observed behavior in
   the parliament. The empirical analysis shows that the survey sample has
   a substantial misreporting bias. We conclude that the parliamentarian's
   attitude toward the survey object is strongly linked to their response.
   These issues should be addressed to improve the design and quality of
   legislative surveys.},

Abstract = {Relative distributionwhether one is favored or disfavored by
   governmentseems to matter to voters in many African countries. But why?
   I demonstrate theoretically that voters who do not have information
   about government revenues, and who cannot determine whether their
   allocation represents an absolutely high share, can compare their goods
   with others' to generate a rough prediction of whether they would be
   better off under a challenger. In this model, relative distribution is a
   heuristic, whose relevance is conditioned by available information. I
   test the model among a sample of Ugandan lab participants, who, when not
   told how much a leader had to distribute, were significantly more likely
   to reelect the leader when their payout was greater than another
   player's. Those given information about the size of the pot, however, no
   longer responded to relative distribution. I show external validity by
   demonstrating that the incumbent's ethnicity, which strongly predicts
   whom he favors, is less important to respondents on the cross-national
   Afrobarometer when they report easy access to information on government
   revenues; other types of information do not show a similar effect.
   Unfortunately, though rational under low information, voting on relative
   distribution is not optimal under all conditions: Those who are favored
   by a highly corrupt leader are most likely to reelect him when they are
   relying on relative distribution to make their choice.},

Abstract = {The UK voted by a narrow margin to leave the European Union in a
   referendum on 23 June 2016. This article examines why this was the
   result and brings out comparative implications. Building on previous
   findings that expectations about the impact of Brexit were central to
   voters' decisions, we seek to improve understanding of how these
   expectations mattered. On average across a range of issues, our analysis
   suggests that Leave would have won if voters had expected things to stay
   much the same following Brexit. A big exception is immigration, for
   which ``no change{''} is associated with Remain voting. But there was a
   clear expectation that immigration would fall after Brexit (as most
   voters wanted). That consideration strengthened the Leave vote, and did
   so sufficiently to overwhelm a more important but less widely and
   strongly held expectation that the economy would suffer. We also find
   that those who were uncertain about where Brexit might lead were more
   likely to back the status quo. This supports a posited tendency towards
   status quo bias in referendum voting, notwithstanding a widespread
   belief that this bias failed to materialize in the Brexit vote. Our
   methods and findings have valuable implications for comparative
   research.},

Abstract = {Britain, Bruce Ackerman argues, has `muddled its way into a curious
   arrangement' of asymmetric devolution, which has dis-united the Kingdom,
   disempowered a significant proportion of the populace, and disregarded
   the risks of what he describes as `mono-cultural rivalry'. However,
   whilst Ackerman's diagnosis is correct, his prescription of `fully
   symmetric' federalism is unlikely to remedy this democratic malaise. As
   this response shows, there is limited political consensus as to where
   regional boundaries should fall and there is little public appetite for
   an additional layer of regional governance. Therefore, rather than
   bolting another layer of governance onto a flawed substructure, we
   should instead focus on its repair by reforming Westminster's electoral
   system and revitalising local government. These two proposals may be
   more modest than Ackerman's bold vision, but if implemented they would
   provide solid foundations for the development of a more deliberative and
   consensual way of doing politics that UK so sorely lacks.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL THEORY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {14},
Number = {3},
Pages = {331-348},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {The article deals with the question of whether or under which
   circumstances it is reasonable to interpret some forms of illegal state
   action as civil disobedience and whether republican political theory can
   make a difference to the justification of those actions. It is argued
   that the theory of freedom as non-domination and the interpretation of
   the right to participation as the ``right of rights{''} in a legitimate
   state provide a better justificatory scheme for cases in which
   developing or emerging countries break international trade laws for the
   purpose of protecting constitutional rights than Rawls' theory of civil
   disobedience, because it takes the problem of power asymmetries in
   international relations and the status of social rights more seriously.
   However, these republican standards do not offer different practical
   solutions for a specific type of state disobedience, humanitarian
   intervention, because transferring the standards of non-domination and
   the fundamental right to participation to international relations would
   lead to a ``maximalist{''} interpretation of human rights, which would
   undermine the function of such interventions as an instrument of last
   resort against oppressive governments.},

Abstract = {Scholars have long attributed the income-participation gap-which is the
   observation that the rich participate in politics more than the poor-to
   income-based differences in the resources, recruitment, mobilization,
   and psychology underpinning political behavior. I argue that these
   explanations require a longer time horizon than the empirical evidence
   permits. Education, for example, typically ends in young adulthood and
   so cannot logically mediate the effect of income on participation in
   late adulthood. To resolve this temporal problem, I propose that there
   are two income-participation gaps: one based on current economic status
   and another on childhood economic history. I situate this argument in a
   developmental framework and present evidence for it using six studies.
   The results, while mixed at times, indicate that there are two gaps,
   that the size of each gap changes over the life course, and that their
   joint effect creates a larger income-participation gap than estimated by
   prior research.},

Title = {From Maggie to May: Forty Years of (De)industrial Strategy},
Journal = {POLITICAL QUARTERLY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {89},
Number = {4},
Pages = {631-639},
Month = {OCT-DEC},
Abstract = {Upon becoming Prime Minister, Theresa May installed industrial strategy
   as one of the principal planks of her economic policy. May's embrace of
   industrial strategy, with its tacit acceptance of a positive role for
   the state in steering and coordinating economic activity, initially
   appears to be a decisive break with an era dating back to Margaret
   Thatcher, in which government intervention was regarded as heresy.
   Whilst there are doubtless novel features, this article argues that
   continuity is the overriding theme of May's industrial strategy. First,
   despite the reluctance to confess it, like every UK government over the
   past forty years, May is proposing to intervene selectively to `pick
   winners'. Moreover, the strategy envisages extending assistance to
   industries which have been in receipt of substantial government
   resources since the 1970s. Likewise, the backing anticipated for
   industries identified in May's strategy is dwarfed by that given to
   those which are not, most notably the financial services sector. Far
   from radically rebalancing the structure of the UK economy, May's
   strategy seems destined to entrench the deindustrialisation with which
   its governments have grappled for almost a century.},

Year = {2018},

Abstract = {This study investigates the effect of military expenditure on the
   exploding external debt in five major South Asian economies, i.e.
   Pakistan, Bangladesh, India, Nepal and Sri Lanka from 1990 to 2015 using
   panel fixed effect regression model. The estimated result reveals that
   the external debt of selected South Asian countries is positively
   determined by their military expenditure, and negatively explained by
   their domestic investment activities. The study urges the efficient
   utilization of available capital resources into more productive
   investment activities to create employment for the labor force. The
   future prosperity of the region lies in the peaceful resolution of all
   outstanding disputes and a corresponding reduction in military spending
   that can make the region safe for domestic and international
   investments.},

Abstract = {This article analyzes the voting patterns in eastern Turkey for the June
   24, 2018 elections and examines the cross-sectional and longitudinal
   variation in 24 eastern cities where Kurdish votes tend to matter
   significantly. Based on the regional and district level electoral data,
   the article has four major conclusions. Firstly, the AK Party and the
   HDP are still the two dominant parties in Turkey's east. Secondly HDP
   votes took a down-ward direction in the November 2015 elections in
   eastern Turkey after the peak results in the June 2015 elections, a
   trend which continued in the June 24 elections. Thirdly, the
   pre-electoral coalitions of other parties in the June 24 elections cost
   the HDP seats in the region. Finally neither the Kurdish votes nor the
   eastern votes move in the form of a homogenous bloc but intra-Kurdish
   and intra-regional differences prevail.},

Abstract = {Despite the large body of literature on the emergence and success of new
   political parties in Western Europe, few, if any, attention has been
   paid to investigate new parties from a systemic perspective, therefore
   exploring their potential effects on party systems. This article focuses
   on party system innovation (PSInn), defined as the aggregate level of
   newness' recorded in a party system at a given election. After having
   reviewed the extant literature on the topic, the article discusses what
   a new party is and provides a new index to measure PSInn. The article
   analyses the evolution of PSInn across 324 elections held in 19 West
   European countries from 1945 to 2015 and its cumulative effects over
   time. Although in most countries the party landscape today is still very
   similar to the one appearing after World War II, data offer clear
   evidence of a sharp increase of innovation in the last few years.},

Abstract = {The Gerin-Lajoie doctrine, which has founded Quebec's international
   activity since the 1960s, is conventionally understood as the external
   extension of Quebec's provincial jurisdictions. How then can it be
   explained that Quebec's elected representatives regularly take a stand
   on international conflicts, which clearly falls within the authority of
   the federal government? This article provides a first glimpse at the
   motivations of Quebec officials for taking positions on military issues.
   Three hypotheses are put forward and compared to every public statement
   expressed by Quebec's elected representatives since September 11, 2001,
   with regard to military interventions. Firstly, Quebec's paradiplomacy
   may be marked by nationalism, acting as a tool for affirmation and
   national differentiation beyond provincial jurisdiction. Secondly,
   Quebec's assertion on issues of federal jurisdiction may be the
   manifestation of protodiplomacy, with the aim of strengthening the quest
   for full sovereignty. Thirdly, Quebec's elected officials may venture
   into military affairs for electoral gains. In short, the article seeks
   to assess whether Quebec's positions on international security issues
   are the result of identity, secessionist, or electoral motivations.},

Journal = {SOCIALIST STUDIES},

Abstract = {The Ghadar Party introduced a radical anticolonial praxis to Punjab,
   British India, in the early 1910s. Much of the literature on the Ghadar
   Party situates the birth of the movement among Punjabi peasants along
   the Pacific coast of North America who returned to their homeland intent
   on waging an anticolonial mutiny. One strand of argumentation locates
   the failure of the Ghadar Party in a problem of incompatibility between
   their migrant political consciousness and the conditions and experiences
   of their co-patriots in Punjab. I use Antonio Gramsci's concept of
   ``translation,{''} a semi-metaphorical means to describe political
   practices that transform existing political struggles, to demonstrate
   how the Ghadar Party's work of political education was not
   unidirectional, but rather consisted of learning from peasant
   experiences and histories of struggle, as well as transforming extant
   forms of peasant resistance - such as, banditry - for building a radical
   anticolonial movement. Translation is an anticolonial practice that
   works on subaltern experiences and struggles. The Ghadar Party's praxis
   of translating subaltern struggles into anticolonialism is demonstrative
   of how movements learn from and transform existing movements.},

Abstract = {Social norms are thought to motivate behaviors like political
   participation, but context should influence both the content and
   activation of these norms. I show that both race and neighborhood
   context moderate the social value of political participation in the
   United States. Using original survey data and a survey experiment, I
   find that Whites, Blacks, and Latinos not only conceptualize
   participation differently, but also asymmetrically reward those who are
   politically active, with minority Americans often providing more social
   incentives for participation than Whites. I combine this survey data
   with geographic demography from the American Community Survey and find
   that neighborhood characteristics outpace individual-level indicators in
   predicting the social value of political participation. The findings
   suggest that scholars of political behavior should consider race, place,
   and social norms when seeking to understand participation in an
   increasingly diverse America.},

Abstract = {To what extent does the Narrative Policy Framework (NPF) apply to local
   policy issues? The scholarship developing the NPF as a theoretical
   framework has focused on national, state, or regional policy problems
   with very little attention to local ones. This article contributes to
   the literature on policy narratives, finding that the use of narrative
   elements by coalitions is more nuanced in highly localized policy
   settings than the current theory suggests. In particular, the depiction
   of characters and assignment of blame differs more in local settings
   than the NPF would indicate. Hypotheses about key narrative elements of
   characters, causal mechanisms, narrative story type, and policy
   solutions are tested using data from a content analysis of 202 policy
   narratives about the residential water shutoffs in Detroit during 2014.
   Findings support the use of the NPF for local policy issues and the
   importance of depicting characters as beneficiaries rather than villains
   or victims.},

Abstract = {Does the state of the domestic economy change the size of the effect of
   audience costs? As public opinion research has shown, citizens assess
   the performance of their leaders based not only on foreign policy, but
   also on the domestic economy. Thus, if leaders are subject to audience
   costs, they should be even less able to afford failure in an
   international crisis when the economy is performing badly than when the
   economy is doing well. As a result, such leaders should be even more
   able to make their threats credible and, therefore, are more likely to
   be successful in coercive diplomacy. This novel prediction finds no
   empirical support in a replication study using Moon and Souva (2016). I
   discuss possible reasons for this result and avenues for further
   research.},

Abstract = {Recently, housing wealth has come to the fore as predictor of welfare
   attitudes. However, it is unclear whether people also change their vote
   based on their housing market position. This article shows, for three
   Dutch elections in 2006, 2010, and 2012, that housing wealth was a
   predictor of party choice during housing market downturns. In 2012,
   individuals in households in negative equity were more likely to vote
   pro welfare, while respondents most at risk of negative equity were more
   likely to vote pro-homeownership. This finding is corroborated in our
   analysis of party choice change. Voters are thus responsive to changing
   housing wealth positions. Our results are in line with economic voter
   theories and illustrate the emerging importance of housing wealth for
   this framework.},

Abstract = {In the nineties Colombia reformed its pension system and introduced the
   individual saving fund. The economic globalization argument quite didn't
   explain how different sources of power were organized. We can ask, it's
   necessary to know what are the sources of power and how are they
   organized? A case study design was done, reviewing 78 legal projects of
   Colombian Congress during 2000-2009. The results described a structural
   government, government coalition, economic network and inquired about
   fiscal sustainability and old age worthy of poverty. The State achieves
   the objectives in The Social Policy for the elderly through a structural
   power that articulates the economic-ideological network and penetrates
   the life of the population.},

Abstract = {The research presented aims to show that young people in the state of
   Guanajuato are influenced by social networks and marketing, this derived
   from the amount of information they access and that serves to promote
   brands and product consumption habits and / or services. The research
   was conducted to young people, mainly university students, between 15
   and 29 years old, who actively participate in social networks, an
   instrument and direct interview was applied to obtain information
   regarding their habits related to their use at times dedicated to food,
   nutrition and physical exercise. In the time they use social networks
   and their use by gender, there were no great differences in the groups
   that were interviewed. It is proposed the development of government
   programs that help to strengthen activities for the integral development
   of young people and to improve their physical development.},

Abstract = {We estimate audience costs and examine their substantive effects on the
   evolution of interstate disputes by using an infinitely repeated and
   dynamic game of crisis escalation. Unlike past efforts, our approach
   estimates country-specific audience cost parameters without relying on
   proxy variables, such as democracy measures. Contrary to intuition,
   increases in a country's audience costs encourage it to initiate
   disputes in equilibrium because the costs serve as a commitment device
   during the subsequent crisis, incentivizing the country to stand firm
   and coercing its opponent to back down. Nonetheless, the results
   demonstrate that larger audience costs would result in more peace
   worldwide, as they also discourage potential opponents from initiating
   disputes. Beyond regime type, we find that a free press, provisions for
   executive appointment or removal, and historical rivalries are also
   important determinants of audience costs.},

Abstract = {Survey and laboratory experiments are increasingly common in political
   science. Investment in experimental data collection comes with costs and
   benefits, particularly for graduate students and advisers. This article
   describes a set of institutionalized procedures we have adopted with the
   goal of capitalizing on the advantages that come with experimental
   research. This includes requiring planning documents, holding
   research-group meetings, and centralizing data collection. We conclude
   by discussing the limitations of our approach, ultimately highlighting
   the need for more disciplinary conversation about how to best structure
   research groups to produce quality research and advising.},

Abstract = {Although since the advent of modernity a speech has been proclaimed with
   a claim to universality around human dignity that advocates for a
   humanity in complete harmony with the values of freedom, equality and
   fraternity, the truth of the matter is that the status of citizen , in
   legal and political terms it has not yet been able to exceed the limits
   of national states. In this sense, this essay aims to discuss the real
   situation of the category's universal citizenship, human rights and
   globalization, in the heat of the geopolitical conflict that has
   generated in Latin America the harassment of socialism of the 21st
   century. In the methodological the investigation uses the documentary
   observation and dialectical hermeneutics. It is concluded that, if
   globalization is reduced to the internationalization of capitals and
   selective human and technological resources, for the benefit of
   corporate elites only and does not transcend a globalization of social
   welfare and the dignification of life, a process in which citizenship
   universal would be the logical consequence, so it is a partial
   globalization that very little can contribute to the open societies of
   the 21st century},

Journal = {ACTA POLITICA},

Abstract = {The ongoing rise of inequality and the outbreak of the economic crisis
   since 2008 have fueled the debate about the effects of macro-economic
   processes on democracy in general, and on political participation in
   particular. Whereas the effect of economic disparity is well documented
   in the literature, the implications of the economic downturn have not
   been sufficiently evaluated so far. The article addresses this gap by
   offering a comprehensive overview of the impact of these macro-economic
   factors on individual political participation in Europe. Using data from
   the first six rounds of the European Social Survey, it shows that income
   inequality reduces participation and enlarges the participatory gap
   between better-and worse-off. In contrast, economic contraction has no
   effect on the overall level of participation and makes the poor
   participate more and the rich less.},

Abstract = {This article analyzes the conceptualization and depiction of Thailand's
   public policy on education for the children of migrant workers in the
   country by examining a cluster of fairly recent literature on the
   subject. The studied texts broadly share the view that Thailand's policy
   of providing full education to these children is subject to gaps and
   patchy implementation. An analytical review of the literature on
   conceptualizing this policy shows, however, that this picture is
   misleading as it tends to reduce policy to an idealized intention.
   Rather, Thailand has a plurality of local policies ambiguously governed
   by a national policy, which in turn does not predominantly aim at
   education for all. We contend that our improved characterization of the
   situation helps create more productive openings for research and policy
   change on this important topic.},

Title = {Patrimonial Economic Voting and Asset Value - New Evidence from Taxation
   Register Data},
Journal = {BRITISH JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {48},

Abstract = {Recent research on economic voting has moved beyond the traditional
   reward-punishment hypothesis, according to which the economy is merely
   considered a valence issue. Instead, patrimonial economic voting
   research looks at voters as property owners within the economic system.
   These studies have relied on survey items that measure whether
   individuals own different kinds of property to test the patrimonial
   dimension. This study emphasizes the importance of a surprisingly
   neglected aspect: the value of assets. It uses official register data
   files from the Swedish Tax Agency on the value of individuals' assets
   merged with survey data from the 2006 Swedish National Election Study.
   The study finds that the relationship between patrimony and voting
   behavior in Sweden is similar to that found in other countries, but only
   when it is tested in a similar way as in these studies - that is, only
   when it is coded as whether voters own different assets. This study
   brings three important contributions to the debate. First, it offers a
   new empirically based categorization of the dimensionality of asset
   ownership and shows that the previous distinction between low- and
   high-risk assets is insufficient. Secondly, it shows that merely having
   assets or not, which is what previous studies have measured, is not what
   primarily matters; the relevant factor is the value of the assets. And
   thirdly, it demonstrates that only the value of some kinds of assets
   matters (especially stocks and real estate properties), while other
   assets (savings in bonds and funds) do not affect voting behavior or
   political opinions.},

   guarantee the transparency of public management. These are: the need to
   institutionalize the principles of maximum publicity and access to
   public information; the restriction of the exceptions to the mentioned
   principles; and, the creation of an autonomous and specialized body in

Abstract = {Popular accounts of the 2016 presidential election attribute Donald
   Trump's victory to the mobilization of angry white men seeking to
   restore traditional values and social roles. Whereas a majority of Trump
   voters were male, more than 40\% of women who went to the polls on
   Election Day also supported him. This analysis explores the motivations
   of these women, asking how partisanship, demographics, and beliefs
   motivated their vote choice. We found that, although party affiliation
   was an important predictor of both women's and men's vote choice, sexism
   and racial resentment had a greater influence on voters of both genders.
   Moreover, the influence of these biases was similar for women and men.},

   as politico-legal theory - pave the way to a novel methodology which
   will be exemplified through the analysis of the transparency concept.},

Abstract = {One of the inherent elements of democracy is citizens' participation in
   public life. The most frequent ways of realization of political
   participation are universal elections and direct democracy institutions.
   The aim of this article is to compare the level of application of direct
   democracy mechanisms at the local and national level in Poland. The
   research was inspired by diverse institutional positions of direct
   democracy instruments in the Polish political system. The national ones
   are based on the Constitution of 1997, which gives them the status of
   high significance. But on the other hand, especially regarding formal
   conditions, it functionally limits their possible application. Local
   direct democracy institutions are normatively based on lower order acts
   (laws), which are much easier to amend. Hence, they are more adaptable
   to changing political and social conditions. The authors' research
   confirmed the thesis that the use of direct democracy mechanisms is more
   intensive at the local level. As a continuation of their research, the
   authors reflect on the determinants of this situation, making six
   hypotheses.},

Title = {The neo-dirigiste production of French capitalism since 1980: the

Journal = {FRENCH POLITICS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {16},
Number = {2},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {What structures France's current model of capitalism divides academic
   specialists. For some, the dirigisme installed after 1945 is over
   because the country has simply adopted market liberalism. For others,
   French capitalism has resisted wholesale liberalization by becoming
   `post-dirigiste'. This article argues instead that the very nucleus of
   French dirigisme lives on. This claim is developed by analysing
   post-1980 change in three major industries (agriculture, defence
   aerospace and pharmaceuticals). If the inscription of French producers
   in international markets and global finance has indeed eroded national
   capacity to unilaterally determine economic practices and outcomes,
   often through investing in the European scale, many renewed modes of
   intervention have actually enabled French capitalism to retain its most
   significant institutions. Explanation for the political success of this
   `neo-dirigisme' is traced to struggles that have taken place within and
   beyond the state. During these conflicts, actors seeking to embed
   neo-liberal content into economic interventionism have consistently won
   out over opponents who advocate a wider range of interventionist policy
   tools.},

Abstract = {Given the renewed interest in C. B. Macpherson's political theory in a
   time of late neo-liberalism, the aim of this article is to complement
   existing scholarship with a detailed account of his early thought on the
   transition into socialism. Against the prevailing view, I suggest that
   the young Macpherson outlined a theory of transition, on which the
   actualization of his democratic vision depended. I trace how he
   investigated the nature of the state in the 1930s and early 1940s and
   asked whether a socialist movement could gain control of state
   institutions and shape their policies to establish an economic democracy
   that could serve as a defence against fascism. As a democratic
   socialist, he agonized over the idea that a forcible revolution and
   unconstitutional measures were likely required to establish socialism.
   To paint my intellectual portrait, I make use of archival material from
   the time that has yet to be commented on.},

Journal = {ELECTORAL STUDIES},

Volume = {53},
Pages = {139-149},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {The literature on vote-buying often assumes a complete transaction of
   cash for votes. While there is ample evidence that candidates target
   certain voters with cash handouts, it is unclear whether these actually
   result in higher turnout and vote-shares for the distributing party.
   Empirically, we find that cash handouts have a small to no effect on
   either turnout or vote-shares when using different matching techniques
   and accounting for district level factors during the 2011 Beninese
   presidential election. We cross-validate these results with additional
   surveys from four other African countries (Kenya, Mali, Botswana, and
   Uganda). Results suggest that, at least in these contexts, vote-buying
   can be best understood as an incomplete transaction between candidates
   and voters, and that handouts from multiple parties as well as
   district-level traits (e.g. clientelism, public goods) partly account
   for the small effects observed.},

Journal = {ELECTORAL STUDIES},

Volume = {53},
Pages = {11-19},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Doubts about electoral integrity, whether justified or groundless, can
   undermine faith in the legitimacy of the democratic process. We
   investigate the reasons for such doubts in the case of the 2016 Federal
   elections in Australia. A three-wave panel survey of the electorate
   established that one third of Australians believed (falsely) that the
   outcome was fraudulent - a remarkable level of scepticism in an
   established democracy with a long history of clean and well-run
   contests. One reason was that many Australians misunderstood their
   electoral system. Media stories of electoral maladministration also led
   Australians - especially electoral losers - to be suspicious and to
   embrace reforms. The results suggest that officials seeking to restore
   public confidence should strengthen civic education and improve
   electoral administration, particularly where the rules of the game are
   complex.},

Abstract = {Liberal Zionists blame Israel's five decade long occupation of the West
   Bank and the Gaza Strip primarily on Revisionist Zionist ideology and
   its manifestation in right wing parties such as the Likud. They also
   argue that the ``Two State Solution{''}, the creation of a Palestinian
   state alongside Israel, will forever solve this issue. This paper on the
   other hand argues that while the Israeli left have divergent opinions
   from the revisionists on many issues, with regards to the ``Palestinian
   question{''} and particularly on the prospects of allowing the formation
   of a Palestinian state, liberal Zionists have much closer views to the
   right wing than would most like to admit. To demonstrate this, the views
   of Theodore Herzl, the founder of political Zionism, David Ben-Gurion,
   the most important actor in the founding years of the state, as well as
   the approach of left wing Israeli political parties are examined.
   Finally, it is argued that none of the mainstream Zionist political
   movements will allow the creation of a Palestinian state even on a small
   part of Palestine.},

Abstract = {Polities that follow the consociational model of democracy adopt
   power-sharing provisions, guaranteeing a certain number of seats to
   representatives of their societies' main ethnic groups. Yet in all
   hardcore ({''}corporate{''}) consociational systems-Belgium, Bosnia and
   Herzegovina, Burundi, Lebanon, Northern Ireland, and South Tyrol-we also
   find ``Others{''}: citizens who do not belong to any of the main ethnic
   segments. These Others are typically subjected to patterns of political
   marginalisation and exclusion that are problematic for a liberal
   democracy. In some cases, such patterns have been deemed discriminatory
   by courts, most notably in several rulings of the European Court of
   Human Rights concerning the position of Others in Bosnia and
   Herzegovina. This article provides a conceptual framework for
   identifying Others in consociational systems and presents the first
   comprehensive overview of the legal and political status of Others in
   the six corporate consociations.},

Abstract = {Social media are the great social leveler - or so some commentators
   would have us believe. Social media put the power of communication
   directly into the average person's hands. They also present
   opportunities for politicians to improve their contacts with the common
   person - to directly share their messages with and better understand the
   concerns of constituents. This study explores whether and to what extent
   the potential for such citizen-politician engagement is fulfilled.
   Deploying an original dataset of tweets from politicians in the
   Netherlands, the United Kingdom, and the United States, this exploratory
   study examines the interlocutors with whom politicians engage
   reciprocally via Twitter. The results show that a large share of
   politicians' genuinely reciprocal exchanges includes average citizens.
   Although there is much room for improvement, this study suggests that
   Twitter is indeed opening spaces for citizens and policymakers to engage
   one another on matters of political import.},

Journal = {POLITICAL RESEARCH QUARTERLY},

Volume = {71},
Number = {2},
Pages = {270-283},

Abstract = {This paper introduces a new perspective into the literature on judicial
   legitimacy by examining the incentives for courts to cater to a popular
   majority and offering a novel model of legitimacy that has consequences
   for judicial responsiveness. The account integrates into the literature
   classic research on how strategic social groups shape public opinion. I
   theorize that citizens use their perceptions of the judiciary's support
   for various social groups as a means to assess the institution overall.
   From this insight, I derive specific expectations about the conditions
   under which the Supreme Court's protection of minority groups like gays
   and immigrants can damage its legitimacy. Using national survey data, I
   demonstrate that dislike for the beneficiaries of recent Court rulings
   systematically diminishes the institution's legitimacy. The influence of
   these group-based considerations shapes individual-level attitude change
   and can be observed at various points in time.},

Abstract = {Women participated as combatants in almost 40\% of civil conflicts that
   occurred between 1979 and 2009. We offer a novel argument about the
   effect of female combatants upon the outcomes of the civil conflicts
   that they join. Groups that recruit female combatants are more likely to
   achieve victory in their conflicts than are groups that do not recruit
   female combatants. However, when rebel groups rely upon forced
   recruitment, they risk undermining the benefits associated with female
   combatants, lowering their likelihood of victory relative to that of the
   government. We test this conditional argument using multinomial logistic
   regression models on a sample of 194 rebel groups globally from 1979 to
   2009. We find that female participation appears to decrease the
   likelihood of government victory in civil wars; this effect holds
   primarily in instances in which female participation could plausibly be
   thought of as voluntary. Forced female participation, by contrast,
   appears to increase the likelihood of a government victory.},

Title = {Partisan effects in morality policy making},
Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL RESEARCH},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {57},
Number = {2},
Pages = {427-449},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Current comparative policy research gives no clear answer to the
   question of whether partisan politics in general or the partisan
   composition of governments in particular matter for different morality
   policy outputs across countries and over time. This article addresses
   this desideratum by employing a new encompassing dataset that captures
   the regulatory permissiveness in six morality policies that are
   homosexuality, same-sex partnership, prostitution, pornography, abortion
   and euthanasia in 16 European countries over five decades from 1960 to
   2010. Given the prevalent scepticism about a role for political parties
   for morality policies in existing research, this is a hard' test case
   for the parties do matter' argument.Starting from the basic theoretical
   assumption that different party families, if represented in national
   governments to varying degrees, ought to leave differing imprints on
   morality policy making, this research demonstrates that parties matter
   when accounting for the variation in morality policy outputs. This
   general statement needs to be qualified in three important ways. First,
   the nature of morality policy implies that party positions or
   preferences cannot be fully understood by merely focusing on one single
   cleavage alone. Instead, morality policy is located at the interface of
   different cleavages, including not only left-right and secular-religious
   dimensions, but also the conflicts between materialism and
   postmaterialism, green-alternative-libertarian and
   traditional-authoritarian-nationalist (GAL-TAN) parties, and integration
   and demarcation. Second, it is argued in this article that the relevance
   of different cleavages for morality issues varies over time. Third,
   partisan effects can be found only if individual cabinets, rather than
   country-years, are used as the unit of analysis in the research design.
   In particular, party families that tend to prioritise individual freedom
   over collective interests (i.e., left and liberal parties) are
   associated with significantly more liberal morality policies than party
   families that stress societal values and order (i.e., conservative/right
   and religious parties). While the latter are unlikely to overturn
   previous moves towards permissiveness, these results suggest that they
   might preserve the status quo at least. Curiously, no systematic effects
   of green parties are found, which may be because they have been
   represented in European governments at later periods when morality
   policy outputs were already quite permissive.},

Title = {Legitimacy through targeted transparency? Regulatory effectiveness and
   sustainability of lobbying regulation in the European Union},
Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL RESEARCH},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {57},
Number = {2},
Pages = {378-403},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Regulating interest groups' access to decision makers constitutes a key
   dimension of legitimate and accountable systems of government. The
   European Union explicitly links lobbying regulation with the democratic
   credentials of its supranational system of governance and proposes
   transparency as a solution to increase legitimacy and regulate private
   actors' participation in policy making. This lobbying regulation regime
   consists of a Transparency Register that conditions access to decision
   makers upon joining it and complying with its information disclosure
   requirements. The extent to which transparency-based regulatory regimes
   are successful in ensuring effective regulation of targeted actors and
   in being recognised as a legitimate instrument of governance constitutes
   a key empirical question. Therefore, the study asks: Do stakeholders
   perceive the transparency-based EU lobbying regulation regime to be a
   legitimate form of regulatory governance? The study answers by building
   on a classic model of targeted transparency and proposes perceived
   regulatory effectiveness and sustainability as two key dimensions on
   which to evaluate the legitimacy of the Register. The arguments are
   tested on a new dataset reporting the evaluations of 1,374 stakeholders
   on the design and performance of the EU lobbying regulation regime. The
   findings describe a transparency regime that scores low in perceived
   effectiveness and moderate to low in sustainability. Citizens criticise
   the quality of information disclosed and the Register's performance as a
   transparency instrument. The Register did not effectively bridge the
   information gap between the public and interest groups about
   supranational lobbying. In terms of sustainability, interest
   organisations appreciate the systemic benefits of transparency, but
   identify few organisation-level benefits. Organisations that are policy
   insiders incur more transparency costs so they instrumentally support
   transparency only insofar it suits their lobbying strategies and does
   not threaten their position. Insiders support including additional
   categories of organisations in the Register's regulatory remit but not
   more types of interactions with policy makers. They support an imperfect
   regulatory status quo to which they have adapted but lack incentives to
   support increased transparency and information disclosure. Targeted
   transparency proves an ineffective approach to regulating interest
   groups' participation in EU policy making, constituting a suboptimal
   choice for ensuring transparent, accountable and legitimate
   supranational lobbying.},

Abstract = {Sport in Scotland has been a devolved area of activity since 1999. This
   paper seeks to examine claims that direct government expenditure on
   Scottish sport has been influenced by United Kingdom (UK) government
   austerity measures. Direct Scottish Government expenditure on sport is
   allocated to the Scottish national sports agency, sportscotland. An
   analysis of expenditure between 2008 to 2018 is used as a basis for
   considering whether trends in Scottish sports expenditure have been
   influenced by UK austerity measures alone or whether such an explanation
   is too simplistic. The paper concludes by suggesting that direct
   government expenditure on sport in Scotland cannot be explained solely
   as a result of UK government austerity measures between 2008 and 2018.},

Abstract = {In the past several decades, the study of geopolitics has experienced a
   true renaissance, which is reflected in the three works reviewed in this
   article. All of the reviewed books embrace the geopolitical domain in
   completely different ways, and each varies in its purpose, method, and
   structure of reasoning. The paper critically evaluates the methodologies
   and merits of these works and proposes ways to creatively use some of
   the concepts for further geopolitical analysis. The books serve as a
   preface to an in-depth discussion on the state of contemporary
   geopolitics and the reception of classical geopolitics.

Abstract = {Decolonisation has been said to be ``working toward a vision of human
   life that is not structured by the forced imposition of one ideal of
   society over those that differ{''}. This paper argues that political
   independence, responsive to the ``dialectics of identity, liberation,
   recognition and distribution{''}, is not a sufficient condition for
   decoloniality of being as well as decoloniality of power and knowledge;
   and that political independence addresses coloniality of being without
   confronting coloniality of power and knowledge. Scholars committed to
   substantive decolonisation are bound to decolonise knowledge.
   Decolonisation of knowledge presents at least the conceptual possibility
   of a decoloniality of power. Decoloniality of knowledge itself, and thus
   the true liberation of the academy, becomes a realistic operational
   possibility, though requiring considerable application. This effort is
   vitally important given the deep alienation of South African university
   students. The trend to mimic exogenous experts and sages accentuates
   this imperative. Apart from the trend being futile, wasteful and dreary,
   it forecloses fresh insight and impedes the search for truth. The aim of
   this paper is to fill a gap in the sparse South African legal
   scholarship on decolonisation, principally the lack of definitional
   clarity.},

Abstract = {The relative importance of selection and incentives is essential for
   understanding how elections structure politicians' behavior. I
   investigate the relative magnitudes of these two effects in the context
   of US House members' constituency communication. Consistent with
   previous research, I find that there is a negative cross-sectional
   relationship between electoral security and the intensity of
   constituency communication. The negative relationship holds in a
   panel-data setting where only within-legislator variation in electoral
   security is used to identify the effect of electoral security on
   legislator behavior. Due to the likely presence of myopic voters, the
   impact of electoral security increases as the election approaches. Point
   estimates suggest that the total effect is almost entirely driven by
   incentives, and I am able to reject the hypothesis that the incentive
   effect is zero at conventional levels of statistical significance.},

Journal = {AMERICAN POLITICS RESEARCH},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {46},
Number = {3},
Pages = {402-433},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Public beliefs about the frequency of voter fraud are frequently cited
   to support restrictive voting laws in the United States. However, some
   sources of public beliefs about voter fraud have received little
   attention. We identify two conditions that combine to make
   anti-immigrant attitudes a strong predictor of voter fraud beliefs.
   First, the recent growth and dispersion of the immigrant population
   makes immigration a salient consideration for many Americans. Second, an
   immigrant threat narrative in political discourse linking immigration to
   crime and political dysfunction has been extended to the voting domain.
   Using new data from a survey module in the 2014 Cooperative
   Congressional Election Study and the 2012 American National Election
   Study, we show that immigrant resentment is strongly associated with
   voter fraud beliefs. Widespread hostility toward immigrants helps
   nourish public beliefs about voter fraud and support for voting
   restrictions in the United States. The conditions generating this
   relationship in public opinion likely exist in other nations roiled by
   immigration politics. The topic of fraudulent electoral practices will
   likely continue to provoke voters to call to mind groups that are
   politically constructed as un-American.},

Abstract = {This article displays two different theoretical rhythms. The first part
   discusses the flaws of a critical mood that embraces a dialectic mode in
   order to criticize previous theories. This leads to a reproduction of
   some traditional patterns, so that any theory - no matter how critical -
   remains inside a framework that hampers the cultivation of new
   theoretical lines. The second part deals with emerging paradigm of
   postcritique, showing how an alternative approach to old problems (one
   that does away with traditional academic/theoretical standards, to
   incorporate different paths to knowledge) might prove useful to offer a
   new method to tackle, describe and understand the everchanging flux of
   reality.},

Abstract = {More than once, in a text or on a seminar, Lacan gives details on how to
   read. How to read a philosophical text, a piece of theater, or a novel.
   In Seminar VIII, reading Plato's Symposium, he even refers to ``our
   method of comment{''}, distinguishing it from the academic method. This
   article intends to develop this point, showing what psychoanalysis,
   specially the work of Lacan, can provide to the understanding of the
   different ways of reading and commenting on a text at the moment of
   accomplishing the act of teaching. In order to do so, the article
   inquires previously on Lacan's possible philosophical influences in the
   construction of his art of reading: Leo Strauss and Alexandre Kojeve.},

Abstract = {The use of social media is becoming a feature of political engagement in
   the Caribbean. This article investigates factors associated with digital
   and conventional political participation in Jamaica, Trinidad \& Tobago,
   Guyana, Surinam and Haiti using 2012 AmericasBarometer dataset. Based on
   logistic regression, attitudinal factors positively associated with
   digital political participation are: political understanding, support
   for democracy, conventional political participation, and internet usage.
   Digital political action is less likely for the politically tolerant.
   Engagement in protest is positively associated with digital political
   action, signing petition, greater levels of education, being male but
   less likely for those who use the internet. These findings demonstrate
   that digital political action and conventional political participation
   are mutually reinforcing.},

Abstract = {How does government partisanship influence sovereign credit ratings of
   developed countries? Given the convergence of fiscal and monetary
   outcomes between left and right governments in the past decades, credit
   rating agencies (CRAs) should in principle not discriminate according to
   ideology. However, we hypothesize that CRAs might lower ratings for left
   governments as a strategy to limit negative policy and market surprises
   as they strive to keep ratings stable over the medium term. A panel
   analysis of Standard \& Poor's, Moody's, and Fitch's rating actions for
   23 Organisation for Economic Co-Operation and Development (OECD)
   countries from 1995 to 2014 shows that left executives and the electoral
   victory of nonincumbent left executives are associated with
   significantly higher probabilities of negative rating changes. We find
   no evidence of similar systematic partisan bias in spreads on government
   bonds, but spreads do adjust to partisan-biased downgrades. This
   suggests that CRAs may introduce partisan discrimination into sovereign
   credit markets.},

Abstract = {Primary elections have become an important aspect of the French party
   system. In the 2017 presidential elections, the process used by both the

   or not participation in the primaries and the level of competitiveness
   are associated with the results of the 2017 presidential elections,
   focusing on the similarities, differences, and effects in these two open

Abstract = {What has Russia become? The regime is best characterized as a
   conservative populist autocracy. It eschews all transformational
   visions, be they restorative or progressive, while pursuing elite
   appropriation and reproduction of the political status quo as overriding
   aims. The ruler relies for legitimation on populist appeals to great
   power nationalism and traditional folk morality, but he eschews the
   ethnocentricity often found in populism of the right. His judicious
   populist politics and skillful campaign to centralize and concentrate
   power have helped forge a stable, popular autocracy that yields bounty
   for the ruler and his favorites. But the predatory economic model and
   the extraordinary personalization of authority create vulnerabilities
   that may jeopardize system's durability.},

Abstract = {Experimentation has taken on a new life in political science. As the use
   of experimental methods proliferates, it is important for researchers to
   share their experiences and best practices, particularly with
   early-career researchers. This article provides reflections from
   practical experience in the laboratory, particularly geared toward
   graduate students and early-career researchers who are conducting their
   first laboratory experiment. These lessons do not apply only to
   first-time experimenters. Experiences are presented regarding time
   management, using confederates and deception, incentivizing
   participation, and keeping a laboratory notebook. Finally, early-career
   researchers are encouraged to go for it if the methods are appropriate
   to their research question.},

Abstract = {Methodologists and econometricians advocate the partial observability
   model as a tool that enables researchers to estimate the distinct
   effects of a single explanatory variable on two partially observable
   outcome variables. However, we show that when the explanatory variable
   of interest influences both partially observable outcomes, the partial
   observability model estimates are extremely sensitive to
   misspecification. We use Monte Carlo simulations to show that, under
   partial observability, minor, unavoidable misspecification of the
   functional form can lead to substantial large-sample bias, even though
   the same misspecification leads to little or no bias under full
   observability.},

Abstract = {How does offshoring affect individual party preferences in multiparty
   systems? We argue that exposure to offshoring influences individual
   preferences for those political parties with clear policy positions on
   issues relevant for individuals with offshorable jobs (left, liberal,
   and center-right parties) but does not affect voting decisions for
   parties concentrating on other issues (green or populist right parties).
   Examining individual-level data from five waves of the European Social
   Survey for 18 advanced democracies, we find that these effects vary by
   skill level and exposure. Offshoring increases preferences for liberal
   and center-right parties that advocate economic openness among the
   highly skilled. In contrast, low-skilled individuals exposed to
   offshoring are more likely to prefer leftist political parties that
   champion social protection and redistribution. Offshoring does not
   affect the propensity to vote for green and populist right parties.},

Abstract = {Just like members of the House, US senators vary in how effective they
   are at lawmaking. We create Legislative Effectiveness Scores for each
   senator in each of the 93rd-113th Congresses (1973-2015). We use these
   scores to explore common claims about institutional differences in
   lawmaking between the House and the Senate. Our analysis offers strong
   support for the claim that the Senate is a more egalitarian and
   individualistic lawmaking body, in comparison to the relatively
   hierarchical institutional structure of the House. The scores developed
   here offer scholars numerous opportunities to explore important
   lawmaking phenomena.},

Abstract = {Aesthetic transformation, for William Morris, leads to broader social
   and political transformation. The arts of design, in particular, ought
   properly to be in the forefront of social change. A brilliant designer
   in his own right, Morris spent much of the period 1877-1886 formulating
   principles (he called them ``moral qualities{''}) whereby design might
   be practiced so that it advances the greater social good. In this essay,
   I discuss those principles as Morris enunciated them in two of his most
   neglected essays, ``Making The Best of It{''} and ``Some Hints on
   Pattern-Designing,{''} both originally written for and addressed to
   audiences of artisans and artworkers. When freed from the constraints
   that would enslave his mind and practice, Morris argues, the designer
   might create work that both promotes and incarnates the principle of
   radical transformation, whereby life might be made palatable for those
   living and working in intolerable conditions.},

Year = {2018},
Volume = {31},
Number = {1},

Abstract = {From Marx to Althusser, the materialist approach has tended to assume
   that individuals (that is, workers, proletarians and other social
   actors) unconsciously reproduce the social structures of capitalism that
   alienate them. It is assumed that individuals accept the conditions
   forced upon them and no longer seek to rebel against a world that
   substantially impoverishes their labour, their spirit and their
   creativity. In this paper, I suggest that by favouring Marx's concept of
   alienation almost exclusively, there is a considerable risk that
   materialist thought will take only a negative path and remain stuck in
   the very Hegelian idealism that it intends to surpass. Whilst I
   acknowledge Marx's significance to materialism, I argue that his stance
   should be combined with that of the anarchist and libertarian French
   thinker Proudhon. Proudhon presents a conception of the worker as more
   than just alienated. Workers can also cooperate and experience a
   reciprocity seemingly at odds with the character of capitalism. Under
   Proudhon's influence materialism takes a positive turn, enabling us to
   avoid falling into the utopianism that the theory of social economy
   employs to critique capitalism-a utopianism that renders its critique
   even less effective than that of Marx. Today, Proudhonian theory also
   allows us to envisage the end of capitalism without necessarily
   rejecting the very concept of work. It thus improves on theories of
   `basic income', for example, which persist in seeing in work nothing but
   negativity.},

Title = {Democratic development and increased militarism in East and Southeast
   Asian rivalries: Perverse political accountability and military
   conflicts},
Journal = {ASIAN JOURNAL OF COMPARATIVE POLITICS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {3},
Number = {1},
Pages = {25-45},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {This article asks the simple question of why East and Southeast Asian
   rivals have experienced a sharp increase in military activity despite
   their decisive shift to democracy. To explain this puzzle, I develop a
   ``theory of perverse political accountability{''} in East and Southeast
   Asian rivalries. Central to my theory is that perverse political
   accountability, in which a hawkish leadership adopting a more
   conflictual policy toward foreign rivals is rewarded by a hard-line
   constituency or selecto-rate, makes democratic leaders in rival states
   highly conflict-prone. In addition, the theory claims that democratic
   rivals will likely initiate military conflicts against autocratic rivals
   due to their leaders' hawkish preferences and to perverse political
   accountability, and that autocratic rivals will likely initiate
   conflicts against democratic rivals and against each other due to their
   leaders' hawkish preferences and to the absence of perverse political
   accountability. The article finds strong empirical evidence for these
   theoretical arguments. The findings contribute to an enhanced
   understanding of the causes of increased militarism in East and
   Southeast Asian rivalries.},

Abstract = {Turkey has been pursuing the goal of accession to the EU since it
   applied for an Association Agreement in 1959. This goal proved to be a
   vital source of dynamism, modernization, and growth for Turkey
   especially in the phases of establishing the Customs Union, acquiring
   candidate status, and starting accession negotiations. However, the
   momentum stalled due to a stalemate in the negotiations. Currently,
   refugee cooperation, visa liberalization dialogue, and the prospects for
   a modernized Customs Union are areas that promise some progress in
   relations. Nonetheless, these areas do not constitute a comprehensive
   framework for the future of the relations, therefore rendering the
   revitalization of the accession process imperative.},

Abstract = {In this paper we examine how political contexts mediate citizens'
   ability to understand political parties' ideological positions, focusing
   on education level. Using cross-national data from the Comparative Study
   of Electoral Systems (CSES), we explore how the effect of individual
   education level is mediated by contextual factors influencing the supply
   and clarity of information in a party system. The results show that the
   effect of education levels in improving citizens' ability to perceive
   party ideological locations varies with some political contexts. First,
   in cases where the supply of such information is limited due to less
   democratic experience and less programmatic party politics, the effect
   of education is weakened. However, the effect of education increases in
   contexts where we would expect less clarity of party position
   information where parties are least polarized and where institutional
   factors add complexity to party competition.},

Abstract = {The massive use of ICTs by children and teenagers exposes them to forms
   of online sexual interaction with adults that have elements common to
   offline sexual abuse. It is therefore necessary to define the
   differences between these two phenomena in order to ensure that
   preventing potential victims is implemented in a manner compatible with
   the principle of proportionality, with the consequent need for a
   differentiated legal response. In order to do this, we investigate the
   characteristics of online victimisation and its effects on victims,
   address the problem of identifying protected legal assets and conclude
   with a series of recommendations for legislative reform and restrictive
   application of criminal offences.},

Abstract = {Tertiary institutions in South Africa have been dichotomised through the
   colonial structure and apartheid which sought to subjugate some
   institutions and elevate others. Not only have historically
   disadvantaged institutions (HDIs) faced a set of deep material
   difficulties, they have also had to grapple with the negative
   implications of naming. Using the work of Stryker and Burke as well as
   Bourdieu, this article interrogates the complexities of the HDI label
   for the University of the Western Cape. This is a complex issue because
   the same label can simultaneously provide access to state resources and
   inhibit opportunities from potential sponsors and employers. Unlike
   individuals who can hold multiple identities, institutions are expected
   to embrace a particular identity. Our conclusion is that we need to open
   the conversation about institutional labelling and develop a new
   language to describe former HDIs which should ideally acknowledge their
   difficult history without perpetuating stigma.},

Abstract = {The ECOWAS principle of non-interference in the internal affairs of
   member states included in its Charter was in line with the sovereignty
   of states in the international system. This principle, ECOWAS, has to
   some extent been kept, but the growing insecurity arising from internal
   conflicts in West Africa states motivated the adoption of ECOMOG as a
   mechanism for peace and security. The ECOMOG, in the effort to
   securitize the region to enable economic integration and development as
   major goals of ECOWAS, has engaged in several peacekeeping operations.
   However, the nature of the conflict from these states rendered
   peacekeeping operations inadequate, leading to the adoption of peace
   enforcement as a new mechanism for mitigating intractable conflicts in
   West Africa. It is in this context that this article investigates the
   role of ECOWAS in peacekeeping operations and its transformation to
   peace enforcement in the West African security complexes.},

Abstract = {The 15M movement or indignados stands out among the social movements
   that have emphasized the citizen participation through the appropriation
   of space. Occupation practices present a `political space' in which the
   conflict becomes a key analytical issue, and simultaneously, this
   implies a scenario of possibility for the emergence of new forms of
   political participation. This ethnography analyzes the social production
   of space in the indignados movements, through the study of the
   repertoires of action and identifications of the activists in three
   occupation processes in the autonomous community of Extremadura (Spain)
   between the years 2011 and 2014. 111e work discusses the scope and
   limitations of the strategies of the movements in the extension of the
   demands and forms of organization to institutional and representative
   frameworks of political participation, from the analysis of the
   practices of meaning and of management of the conflict that the
   participants develop in the spaces.},

Abstract = {The social sciences disagree on how democracy should be defined and
   measured. This study approaches the conceptualization of democracy from
   the demos side. Using Q-methodology, we pin down the way ordinary
   Estonians live and understand democracy. The analysis reveals three
   distinct discourses: a libertarian democracy as freedom; a participatory
   democracy as empowerment; and a populist democracy as the utopia of good
   policies. It also points to strong consensus on what it means to live
   together in society. The study has both general and specific value. It
   tests the correspondence between defined democracy and lived democracy;
   it demonstrates how Q-methodology can objectivize the subjective; and it
   provides new empirical knowledge about how ordinary people perceive
   democracy. Understanding how people conceive of democracy is essential
   for ensuring measurement validity when using either conventional
   quantitative or qualitative approaches.},

Title = {The economy of secrecy: security, information control, and EUUS
   relations},
Journal = {WEST EUROPEAN POLITICS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {41},
Number = {4, SI},
Pages = {890-913},
Abstract = {This article develops an economy of secrecy' as a framework to
   understand how secrecy regulates interstate relations and to explicate
   why states react differently to breaches of secrecy. Drawing upon
   Simmel, the article argues that secrecy shapes interstate relations by
   tuning the ratio of knowledge' and ignorance'. Furthermore, while the
   economy of secrecy acknowledges the existence of many types of secret,
   it emphasises their common underlying mechanisms, namely: secrecy as a
   field of power, secrecy as a field of performance, and secrecy as a
   normative terrain. Finally, the economy of secrecy is agnostic with
   regard to the moral character of promoting secrecy. In order to
   substantiate the argument, the article examines three recent iterations
   of how secrecy has disrupted EUUS relations: extraordinary renditions,
   WikiLeaks, and Snowden's revelations. In addition to showcasing how the
   economy of secrecy operates, these examples contribute to our
   understanding of how secrecy affects information flow and dissemination
   in world politics.},

Title = {Influence of Voter Demographics and Newspaper in Shaping Political Party
   Choice in India: An Empirical Investigation},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF POLITICAL MARKETING},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {17},
Number = {1},
Pages = {90-117},
Abstract = {Choice of political party is an important decision a citizen faces in a
   democracy. In recent times, as democracies in many countries have
   matured, a number of studies are focusing on party and candidate choice
   and their various determinants. India, being the largest democracy,
   provides a fertile ground for such research. Accordingly, in this paper
   we concentrate on demographic characteristics, newspaper-reading habits
   of voters, and their political choice. To study this we have considered
   a very unique data set collected just before the watershed elections in
   the state of West Bengal in India, where the ruling Communist coalition
   was defeated after thirty-four years of power in the state. The survey
   was conducted using a structured questionnaire to collect information on
   demographic characteristics of voters and their political choice. The
   respondents were asked to indicate their party choice from among the
   three major political parties. As the literature shows that gender, age,
   education, income levels, marital status, occupational status, and
   choice of newspaper have significant impact on political choice, we have
   considered these as predictor variables for our study. From our study it
   is seen that among the demographic determinants, gender, marital status,
   and income of the respondents do not influence the choice of political
   party in our sample. However, occupation and newspaper choice of voters
   have significant impact on political party choice in our sample. In
   addition, we have observed that certain categories of age of voters
   significantly influence decision making of voters along with occupation
   and newspaper choice categories.},

   RELIGIOSITY},
Journal = {POLIS-POLITICHESKIYE ISSLEDOVANIYA},
Year = {2018},
Number = {6},
Pages = {8-31},
Abstract = {The growing prevalence of religious commitment and the advancement of
   secularism are the two parallel tendencies, though in confrontation with
   each other, that underlie the contemporary world development. In many
   parts of the world, including its Islamic segment, there is an expansion
   of the ``Zone of Disbelief{''}. However, simultaneously, a process of
   some sort of religious renaissance is underway, which is related to the
   need of reviewing the routine socio-ecclesiastical values and behavioral
   stereotypes, likewise the search of a spiritual dimension, so typical of
   our high-tech reality. One of such tracks invokes an appeal to the
   traditional religions or a formation of new religious trends. In this
   context, especially given the exacerbating conditions of other
   problematic aspects pertinent to the societal development, the most
   versatile and staggering ``discharges{''} become highly likely. The
   rampage of right-wing and left-wing extremism is periodically in
   evidence across the political spectrum in Europe and Latin America.
   Also, in some parts of the Islamic world, and not only in the Middle
   East, a powerful impetus is given to religious radicalism, which entails
   largely dramatic and broad-ranging consequences. Controversial
   tendencies linked to the religious factor are woven into the
   not-less-controversial fabric of globalization. While objectively
   creating the prerequisites for a dialogue of religions, likewise for
   rapprochement of various denominations within one and the same religious
   doctrine, at the same time it overshadows their conserving, identifying
   function. And this forms a part of the resistant reaction of society
   through revitalization and activation of particularism. The religious
   world is confronted with the erosion of values and their desecration. A
   dual process of expansionand-reduction is in place - when the quantity
   indicators of the area of religiousness can be on the increase, while
   its quality indicators can be subject to readjustment. Although in
   certain religious traditions, inner heterogeneity remains a serious
   factor of tension (the Sunnis-the Shiites), overall, the World of Faith
   is becoming less rigid - including in connection with the perception of
   elements belonging to other cultures and customs. Similar tendencies are
   witnessed in the World of Disbelief. The reasons and prospects for the
   ongoing upsurge of radicalism in the Middle East should be viewed within
   the context of more fundamental and longer-term processes underway both
   regionally and globally. And, by all means, with due account for the
   vigorous, but contradictory globalization trends, as well as apparently
   inexhaustible relevance of religious factors for the evolution of
   society.},

Volume = {22},
Number = {2, SI},
Pages = {95-111},
Abstract = {For many citizens in postcolonial states like Indonesia, the reality and
   experience of citizenship depend not just on the content of laws and
   regulations but also on the strength of their personal social networks.
   In this introduction to the special issue, we argue that instead of
   being antithetical to citizenship, this reliance on personal connections
   to deal with state institutions should be seen as a constitutive
   dimension of citizenship. Drawing on the articles in this issue, we
   illustrate this argument by discussing how informality in its three
   dimensions - mediation, the invocation of social norms and the use of
   social affiliations - shape the character of everyday state-citizen
   interaction in Indonesia. The cultivation of personal connections
   constitutes an important form of political agency. It enables citizens
   to deal with the unresponsive and unpredictable nature of Indonesia's
   state institutions.},

Abstract = {Large numbers of Americans endorse political rumors on surveys. But do
   they truly believe what they say? In this paper, I assess the extent to
   which subscription to political rumors represents genuine beliefs as
   opposed to expressive responsesrumor endorsements designed to express
   opposition to politicians and policies rather than genuine belief in
   false information. I ran several experiments, each designed to reduce
   expressive responding on two topics: among Republicans on the question
   of whether Barack Obama is a Muslim and among Democrats on whether
   members of the federal government had advance knowledge about 9/11. The
   null results of all experiments lead to the same conclusion: the
   incidence of expressive responding is very small, though somewhat larger
   for Democrats than Republicans. These results suggest that survey
   responses serve as a window into the underlying beliefs and true
   preferences of the mass public.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this article is to analyze the process of
   internationalization of higher education in Argentina, centered around
   the debate on the scope of the structural reforms in Latin America.
   Through the historical reconstruction of the path, followed by the
   Argentinean higher education system from 1995 to 2015, we seek to
   contribute to the debate on the nature of the reform and the factors
   that determined its origins and scope. The selection of the Argentinean
   case is due to its national peculiarities, which make it an exemplary
   case of structural reforms in the areas of privatization,
   decentralization, and government (de)regulation. The conclusions
   demystify both the explanations that emphasize an exogenous
   over-determination as well as the arguments that underline the
   ideological orientation and poitical calculation of government leaders.},

   Framework in Canadian Context},

Abstract = {This paper uses Stephen Skowronek's framework for the study of
   presidential politics to detect recurrent leadership patterns in Canada.
   While institutional differences, most notably variation concerning the
   incumbent's time in office as well as the less fragmented institutional
   architecture of Canada's Westminster democracy, require some
   modifications, the paper demonstrates that prime ministers and
   presidents, in principle, face a similar leadership problem. Depending
   on the condition of the political regime (vulnerable or resilient) and
   the respective incumbent's political identity (opposed or affiliated),
   Canadian prime ministers - just as presidents in United States - tend to
   engage different leadership patterns. These insights, the paper
   concludes, open up interesting opportunities to put the American
   presidency into a comparative perspective.},

Abstract = {With regard to notions of legitimate masculinity, Black South African
   men are torn between two antithetical discourses: one organized around
   liberal notions of rights and freedoms and driven by secular civil
   society, the other grounded in the values of `traditional' masculinity.
   In this article, I draw on Bourdieu's theory of social fields as well as
   recent ethnographic work in Cape Town and substitute this dichotomy with
   a fourfold matrix of liberal, traditional, youth gang-oriented and
   religiously based masculinities. Employing a relational methodology, the
   article explores how Pentecostal men in Cape Town's townships position
   themselves within this field of masculinities and the shifting
   implications of this positioning for the politics of sexual citizenship.
   I argue that Pentecostal masculinity is not a stable and fixed
   configuration of gendered attitudes, values and performances, but a set
   of cultural distinctions that shift with the problem-space these
   distinctions address as well as the values they are meant to articulate.},

Title = {From The World of Homo Faber to The Victory of Animal Laborans: An
   Analysis of the Human Condition in Which Totalitarian Domination Can
   Come into Existence in Arendt's Political Theory},
Journal = {SIYASAL-JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCES},
Year = {2018},

Abstract = {It would probably not be wrong to say that the 20th century was the most
   terrifying in human history. What made this century especially
   terrifying is not only the fact that its means of destruction reached a
   level of power beyond the imagination of its manufacturers, but also the
   experience of totalitarianism, which radically destroyed all
   institutions and structures shaped by mankind for centuries. Hannah
   Arendt's work The Origins of Totalitarianism strikingly reveals that the
   origins that make Nazi totalitarianism new and unprecedented are, in
   fact, ``right now happening{''} in the world. These constructions,
   relations, and situations that continue in the form of
   ``undercurrent{''}-as Arendt calls it-did not die out with the defeat of
   Nazism. Here the idea of ``humancondition,{''} which constitutes the
   second part of Arendt's investigation, makes the phenomenological
   analysis of three forms of activity that underlie it. One of the most
   important theses of Arendt's work is that there exists a dramatic
   relationship between the process of conquest of all human relation by
   the principle of utilitarianism and instrumentalism, which motivates all
   work and production, and the social climate in which totalitarian
   regimes can be shaped. In this study, we will examine how the human
   condition, i.e., homo faber, and the utilitarian principle-in which
   totalitarian domination can come into existence-in Arendt's political
   theory may result in instrumentalization and gradually make the whole
   world seem worthless. We will also try to explain how these events form
   favorable conditions for the total domination of people.},

Title = {Digital dilemmas: the unintended consequences of election technology},
Journal = {DEMOCRATIZATION},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {25},
Number = {8},
Pages = {1397-1418},
Abstract = {Digital technologies are increasingly used in elections around the
   world. Where the resources and capacity of the state are limited, some
   have argued that such technologies make it possible to rapidly leapfrog
   to cleaner and more credible elections. This article argues that the
   growing use of these technologies has been driven by the fetishization
   of technology rather than by rigorous assessment of their effectiveness;
   that they may create significant opportunities for corruption that
   (among other things) vitiate their potential impact; and that they carry
   significant opportunity costs. Indeed, precisely because new technology
   tends to deflect attention away from more traditional strategies, the
   failure of digital checks and balances often renders an electoral
   process even more vulnerable to rigging than it was before. These
   observations are not intended as a manifesto against the digitization of
   elections; apart from anything else, we argue that the drivers of the
   adoption of these new methods are too powerful to resist. But the
   analysis draws attention to the importance of more careful assessments
   of the problems, as well as the benefits, of such technologies - and to
   the need for more careful planning in their deployment.},

Journal = {CITIZENSHIP STUDIES},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {22},
Number = {4, SI},
Pages = {381-400},
Abstract = {This paper examines a complex bureaucratic process of remembering that
   was central to the Chinese head tax system in Canada known as C.I.9s
   (Chinese Immigration 9). The C.I.9s constitute the first mass use of
   identification photography in Canada. Unlike any moment in its prior
   history, the Canadian Government isolated one specific group of people,
   purely on the basis of race and ethnicity, in order to identify each
   individual member of that group through the creation of a massive
   apparatus that would systematically correlate their identity with a
   photographic image. This system was developed so that the government of
   Canada could remember these migrants in order to continue to exercise
   the processes of their exclusion from citizenship. Using the theoretical
   work of an early internet pioneer on surveillance, Philip Agre, and new
   media theorist, Wendy Chun, I suggest that the C.I.9s function as a
   technology of mass capture through which noncitizens are made.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF POLITICAL MARKETING},

Volume = {17},

Pages = {122-136},
Abstract = {One of the key determinants of the popularity of politicians is keeping
   election pledges, which promises voters' satisfaction and ensures their
   backing for those in power. Economic slowdowns and social and political
   crises are the most challenging periods in terms of retaining or
   boosting popularity. To face up to such dire circumstances, authorities
   seek to pass through drastic reforms affecting either all or some
   selected groups of voters. Based on Polish examples, the empirical
   studies presented herein demonstrate such strategies of governance and
   the creation of such electoral political messages that help maintain the
   popularity of the government or, at least, materially alleviate the
   negative consequences of introduced, yet unpopular reforms. The
   strategies rest upon regularities derived from the prospect theory
   concerning the linking of negative events in the minimizing of
   dissatisfaction and the separation of positive events in the maximizing
   of satisfaction. The investigated hypothesis covers the internal
   consistency of different but negative information about unpopular
   reforms. For it is not enough to combine negative events with a view to
   reducing the negative emotions in political messages. The effect of such
   a reduction will only be guaranteed when the linked events are perceived
   as consistent by voters.},

Journal = {TEORIA Y REALIDAD CONSTITUCIONAL},

Pages = {425-451},
Abstract = {Interim relief pursues a vital role as its purpose is not only to enable
   an effective examination of the case at hand, but also to ensure that
   the protection afforded to the claimant is effective. In order to
   achieve those aims, interim measures need to be adopted in a very short
   period of time and when the claimant faces an irreparable harm. In the
   last years, interim relief has become a distinctive feature of the
   European System of Human Rights. Thus, the purpose of this paper is to
   evaluate the European Court of Human Right's practice and case - law in
   order to determine whether it is truly guaranteeing rights that are real
   and effective through its interim measures.},

Title = {The politics of diversity: Social and political integration of
   immigrants in Iceland},
Journal = {ICELANDIC REVIEW OF POLITICS \& ADMINISTRATION},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {14},
Number = {1, SI},
Pages = {131-148},
Abstract = {The ethnic diversity of modem states raises the question of where
   successful countries are in terms of immigrant inclusion. The number of
   immigrants in Iceland has increased significantly since 2004, and by the
   end of 2016, immigrants made up around 10\% of the population of
   Iceland. Research reveals a gap between immigrants and natives in terms
   of social and political inclusion. This paper examines the social and
   political integration of male and female immigrants in Iceland via
   comparisons with the native population. We ask how native Icelanders and
   people with a non-Icelandic background experience their social position
   and political participation within Icelandic society. We focus on
   political efficacy, ideas about what makes a good citizen, and
   subjective status position as indicators of the degree of social and
   political integration. We use data from the 2014 International Social
   Survey Programme (ISSP) on Citizenship, which is based on a random
   sample of 2,000 individuals and random samples of 600 individuals each
   targeting two of the largest immigrant groups in Iceland-Lithuanians and
   Poles-as well as the largest Asian immigrant group: Filipinos. Although
   the findings show integration of immigrants up to a certain extent, the
   differences between Icelandic and non-Icelandic participants are
   apparent and include certain disadvantages for participants with a
   foreign background. Although other variables-such as income, education,
   paid employment status, and age-play a larger role in social and
   political status than foreign nationality, the findings of this study
   suggest that there is room to improve the integration of immigrants in
   Iceland.},

Abstract = {A review of research into teaching and learning in political science
   education concludes that this literature emphasizes student outcomes and
   ``show and tell{''} descriptions of pedagogical interventions (Craig
   2014). The present study instead aims to open the ``black box{''} of
   conceptual learning in political science, illustrating the ambiguous
   role that everyday understandings of core concepts may play in the
   learning process. Starting from the conceptual change literature, we
   present findings on how everyday understandings influence learning
   regarding the concepts of ``positive rights{''} and ``anarchy,{''}
   resulting in various learning difficulties. The results suggest that
   teaching needs to explore and explain differences in meaning between
   scientific and everyday understandings.},

Title = {TWISTS OF EUROPEAN INTEGRATION},
Journal = {POLIS-POLITICHESKIYE ISSLEDOVANIYA},
Year = {2018},
Number = {5},
Pages = {184-191},
Abstract = {The author analyzes various approaches to the study of European
   integration, referring to a number of recently published works on
   European integration and, in particular, to a unique textbook
   (Evropeiskaya integratsiya: uchebnik dlya vuzov. Pod red. O.V.
   Butorinoi, N.Yu. Kaveshnikova {[} European Integration: Textbook. Ed. by
   O.V. Butorina, N.Yu. Kaveshnikov]. Moscow: Aspekt Press. 2016. 736 p. (
   In Russ.)). The author compares the models of analysis in this book with
   the analytical models of European integration used in modern European
   studies. One of the key problems of contemporary political science is
   the absence of a ``grand theory{''} of European integration. This
   problem could be solved by applying various middle-level theories to
   different dimensions of European integration. The author believes that
   the question of how to study European integration is far from
   rhetorical, especially in the light of such factors as the growing
   complexity of the processes within the EU, its unprecedented crisis, as
   well as aggravation of ideological and political tensions, including in
   relations between Russia and the EU. The book ``European Integration{''}
   edited by Olga Butorina and Nikolai Kaveshnikov is analyzed both in the
   context of theoretical issues of EU development and its specific
   activities, as well as through the prism of European integration studies
   in Europe and Russia.},

Journal = {CRITICAL REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL SOCIAL AND POLITICAL PHILOSOPHY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {21},
Number = {5},
Pages = {545-553},
Abstract = {For over forty years, economic inequality and distributive justice have
   been two of the primary concerns of political philosophers. This volume
   addresses these issues in a novel way, by focusing on the concepts of
   solidarity and public goods as both descriptive and normative
   frameworks. Solidarity links the social, political and moral together,
   in a distinctively political approach that recognizes the social sources
   of power on the one hand and sources of moral motivation on the other.
   Public goods such as education, healthcare, and transport systems are
   indispensable to the forging of solidarity, but at the same time they
   may become sources of oppression or injustice, when they fail to respect
   individual autonomy or when they calcify majoritarian preferences. The
   essays in this volume explore different features of the political, moral
   and civic approaches to solidarity. The moral theory of solidarity is
   advanced in one case as an intrinsically valuable concept of social
   connectedness and in another as an approach of epistemic deference; a
   structural account of solidarity theorizes about action against racial
   oppression, and a power-relations account points at the urgency of the
   affective, non-rational dimensions of solidarity. The social value of
   property and its moral implications are articulated through the lens of
   French 19th Century `Solidarism' and as a complementary theory to
   left-libertarianism. Public goods are defended as instrumental to
   solidarity, in one case within a liberal framework and in another within
   a human-perfectionism framework. By providing a series of
   thought-provoking debates about social obligations and justice, the
   volume re-establishes solidarity and public goods as pertinent concepts
   for theorizing about social justice and inequality.},

Abstract = {Since 2015, Fidesz, the ruling party in Hungary, has been mobilising the
   population on an ongoing basis. Here, the central theme is immigration.
   Although the number of new arrivals to Hungary is low, the government,
   primarily Prime Minister Orban, is using a huge amount of resources to
   stoke fear of migrants. Several `national consultations' and a
   referendum, prior to which the government staged campaigns lasting
   several months, served to generate enemy images through suggestive
   questions. The government is doing battle against the European Union,
   the opposition parties and civil society. The main figure behind these
   and other enemies of Hungary is George Soros, who is pursuing a plan to
   flood Hungary and the whole of Europe with Muslim migrants. The
   government is aiming for nothing less than the destruction of open
   society.},

Abstract = {Some of the most visible recent movements in Russia cannot be accurately
   described as either bottom-up or top-down. They are copycat movements,
   in that the initial idea for a new type of public activity spreads
   quickly across numerous locales with minimal organizational efforts on
   the part of those who originated it. This article analyzes three such
   movements and discusses the structural features they share despite their
   widely differing ideological background, objectives, and popularity: the
   Strategy-31 protests for the freedom of assembly, the ultranationalist
   temperance movement known as Russian Runs, and the commemorative

Abstract = {Despite their differences in terms of their populations, geographical
   size and economic power, Russia and Turkey have several things in
   common. In both countries, nearly three-quarters of the population live
   in cities, the proportion of people living in poverty is almost the
   same. The scale of the shadow economy and the degree of corruption is
   slightly lower in Turkey. Russia's domestic economy is growing more
   slowly than that of Turkey, although it has a higher level of
   macroeconomic stability due to foreign trade surpluses. While the
   potential workforce in Russia is likely to decline by five million by
   2040, in Turkey, it will increase by nine million. As a result, Turkey
   will also achieve higher growth rates in the future, but is more prone
   to crises than Russia.},

Abstract = {The French extreme right, from Franco-German collaboration during World

   marked by the continuity of two lines of thinking: economic ideas and
   politico-cultural thinking. Intertwined and parallel at the outset, they
   ended up opposing each other. While intellectuals of the extreme right
   associated with the journal Defense de !'Occident first hailed European
   integration after 1945, as it was consonant with the ideas of
   collaboration, the Front National finally came to protest against the
   ``real{''}, purely economic European Community from the 1990s on.},

   the strait between Turkey and the Greek island of Lesvos on their way to
   safety in Europe in 2015, thousands of citizens from all over Europe
   temporarily abandoned their day jobs to be of some sort of assistance
   for the refugees as they arrived on the beaches of Lesvos. We analyze
   the process and the relationships between the various stakeholders who
   were involved in the refugee crisis between April 2015 and January 2018,
   arguing that there is a need to find new ways of managing this type of
   spontaneous volunteerism without on the one hand strangling flexible and
   innovative volunteering initiatives, and on the other hand without
   compromising knowledge-based humanitarian responses.},

Abstract = {The article can be regarded as a contribution to the analysis of both
   the historical tradition and the prospects for social change in
   post-communist societies, taking into account the actual question of the
   extent to which contemporary theoretical debates reflect the real
   political, ideological and communicative trends in this region. The
   article raises a series of timely and acute questions about the modern
   condition and future of post-communism in the Central and Eastern
   Europe. The first part of the article is devoted primarily to the
   institutional and ideological aspects of post-communist transformations.
   These aspects are highlighted not by chance, because today there are
   many problematic research areas that are still historically and
   methodologically difficult to perceive by scientists as quite adequate
   research objects. In the theory of democratic transit, post-communism
   was initially viewed as a relatively short historical period that
   separated the dominance of authoritarian communist power from the
   triumph of consolidated democracy. In fact, the formation of the
   ``core{''} of the post-communist institutional project, namely, the
   creation of political system that would effectively replace the old
   system with a minimum of transaction costs was the most difficult part
   of the process. The classical theory of modernization, forced to
   substantially restructure its methodology, nevertheless appeared, in the
   eyes of most Western scholars, to be much more suitable for studying
   post-communist processes than ``transitology{''}. The article explores
   in detail a very characteristic model of ``antipolitics{''} implemented
   in most post-communist countries already at the first stage of reforms.
   In the scientific literature for a long period, the problem of the
   formation of ideological discourses in the post-communist world has
   received much less attention than institutional aspects. Analysts
   everywhere note that, at the present time, the formation of ideological
   discourse in post-communist polities is carried out for the most part
   situationally, depending on the emerging external and internal political
   conjuncture. At the beginning of the XXI century the disappearance of
   the dichotomy itself of ``capitalism-socialism{''} from the mass
   consciousness undoubtedly strengthened the diffuse character of both
   mass consciousness and the emerging new ideological discourse.},

Abstract = {The second part of the article is devoted to the question of the role
   played by political communication and the mass media in the development
   of social processes in the Central and Eastern Europe. The study of
   paradoxical properties of the phenomenon of post-communism has become
   one of the most important incentives for the turn of the humanities in
   the direction of analyzing the specifics of the new communicative and
   rhetorical properties of political texts in the structure of ideological
   discourses both in Europe and outside it. The specific nature of
   post-communist social communication when ideological labels are often
   meaningless and exchangeable, and citizens remain unengaged in the
   political process, increased the role of manipulative factors realized
   through the media. This tendency initially manifested itself in various
   ``mediocratic{''} projects and utopias based on the desire of
   politicized intellectuals to form a ``new political language{''} and
   thereby strengthen their positions in political discourse, ultimately
   winning the legitimate right to power. The rapid evolution of the
   post-communist political discourse from ``liberal humanism{''} and
   ``universal values{''} to reactionary myth-making, nationalist rhetoric
   and xenophobia, clearly demonstrates that one of the main sources of
   constant ideological transformations in the public consciousness is the
   extremely contradictory political ideas and attitudes of intellectuals
   rushing into power already at the initial stage of reforms. At the same
   time, crisis situations, the growth of traditionalist nationalism
   indicate that pathological tendencies and changes in the structures of
   post-communist regimes have a systemic and global character.},

Title = {THE MASKILIM OF ROMANIA AND THE QUESTION OF IDENTITY: ``THE
   ROMANIAN ISRAELITES{''}},
Journal = {ANALELE UNIVERSITATII BUCURESTI-STIINTE POLITICE},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {20},
Number = {1},
Pages = {5-26},
Abstract = {The aim of this paper is to answer some questions concerning the
   identity of the maskilim of Romania, mainly those of the second
   generation, called ``the generation of 1878{''} or ``the generation of
   the Congress of Berlin{''}. They called themselves ``Romanian
   Israelites,{''} similarly to the maskilim of other countries, just like
   the ``French Israelites,{''} ``German Israelites,{''} ``Russian
   Israelites,{''} and so on. What was it that defined their Jewish
   identity and what their Romanian one? When did this ``Romanian
   Israelite{''} identity appear? Under what conditions did the new kind of
   maskil of the ``generation of 1878{''} emerge, and why did these
   maskilim struggle for emancipation? Did this identification influence
   the Romanian Jewish community on issues other than emancipation as well?
   In fact, the ``Romanian Israelite{''} identity appeared with the
   maskilim of the first generation of Moldavia and Wallachia, in the fifth
   decade of the 19th century, under the double influence of the Haskalah
   ideology and the national-cultural Romanian Renaissance. The refusal of
   the succeeding Romanian governments to naturalize the Jews gave an
   impetus to the maskilim to fight for emancipation, mainly after the 1878
   Berlin Congress. In their polemics related to Romanian citizenship, they
   used various arguments to demonstrate that the Jewish presence in
   Romania dated back to ancient times, that they were descendants of Jews
   who had lived on these lands from the antiquity and the middle ages.
   They also tried to convince the entire Jewish community to accept the
   ``Romanian Israelite identity{''} and apply for individual
   naturalization. They promoted the idea of a double identity, Jewish
   ({''}Israelite{''}) from the viewpoint of religion and ethnicity, and
   Romanian from that of nationality.},

Abstract = {This article examines the effects of natural resource extraction on
   authoritarian governments' provision of public services, using
   subnational data from China. Facing no electoral constraint that would
   reflect the policy preferences of citizens, Chinese local leaders
   instead allocate public funds differentially based on their need for
   quality labor in local economic development, a critical criterion for
   their political success. When the local economy benefits from natural
   resources, the need for skilled local labor dissipates, and leaders
   invest less in social services that enhance labor productivity. Using
   panel data across all prefecture-level cities (1992-2010), I find
   evidence that mineral resource abundance leads local governments to
   provide fewer public services for education and health care. Meanwhile,
   services unrelated to labor quality remain unaffected. The results are
   robust to the inclusion of key confounding factors such as FDI inflows
   and state-owned enterprises' output contributions. Additional analyses
   reject alternative mechanisms including political turnover.},

Abstract = {Since the September 11, 2001 attacks on New York and Washington, DC,
   al-Qaeda and other extremist Islamist groups have become a focal point
   of international security debates. Drawing on the `levels of analysis'
   theory of international relations, this paper examines the root causes
   of the emergence of al-Qaeda in an integrative framework which organizes
   the individual, group, and international level causes of this
   organization in a single account. This paper not only includes causes,
   correlations, and explanations at all three levels but also considers
   the significant impact of the relationship among causes belong to
   different levels on the emergence of al-Qaeda. Drawing on this
   theoretical framework, I argue that individual jihadis' `quest for
   significance,' Salafi-Jihadism as a group ideology, and the sole great
   power's post-Cold War foreign and military policies in the Muslim world
   factored into the rise of al-Qaeda. Although the empirical basis of this
   research includes a single case study, the method used in this paper has
   possible implications for studying more similar cases.},

   In this article, we test the relationship between violence and trust
   using both individual and municipality data for Mexico from 2006 to 12.
   Using multilevel analysis, we find no support for the thesis that
   individual experiences with criminal violence drives trust, nor do we
   find a relationship between levels of violence at the municipio level
   and trust. However, we do find that perceived threats to individual
   security leads to less social and institutional trust, but this is
   independent of personal experience and whether the individual resides in
   violent communities.},

Abstract = {Over the past two decades, the literature on international security has
   been characterised by an emphasis on the current radical changes in the
   character of warfare. While different strands focus on different aspects
   of modern warfare, they are united in the belief that the character of
   war is undergoing a radical shift. Sidharth Kaushal argues, however,
   that contemporary changes in the conduct of war represent not a radical
   shift in the character of warfare, but a regression to the
   eighteenth-century paradigm of positional warfare.},

Abstract = {Present-day Spanish society is suffering from political institutional
   crisis raising vivid cutting-edge discussions on its sources. Widely
   spread is the viewpoint blaming the actors of the transition who laid
   the foundation of the current political system in the second half of
   1970s - first half of 1980s. Such an approach demonstrates radical
   reevaluation of values since until quite recently the dominating belief
   in the public conscience in Spain and beyond treated the Spanish
   transition as a model type within the third wave transition framework.
   The author does not agree with the negative appraisal of the transition
   which allowed Spain not only to avoid a new civil war but to set up the
   regime of representative democracy for the first time in its history.
   The transition politics certainly had weaknesses and limitations. The
   successor political actors had the opportunities to remedy the situation
   by changing the legislation and practices but they did not do it since
   ruling as usual was easier. At the same time the Spanish transition
   experience compared to the present-day reality proves that even
   successful decisions work only for some time. New stages of societal
   development demand the correction of previous and development of new
   pragmatic solutions taking national interests into account. The issues
   which were not dominating the political discourse at the time of the
   transition and seemed to be solved (like monarchy vs. republic, conflict
   between staunch Catholics and secularists, evaluation of the past) were
   brought to the center of political struggles many years after. The
   author concludes that it is incorrect to define the direct relation
   between the modern problematic zones of the Spanish society and the
   policy at the time of democratic transition.},

Abstract = {Nowadays education can not only be studied within the framework of a
   country's internal politics, because, across national boundaries,
   education, like all spheres of human activity, tends to be global. And
   so it becomes one of the resources of the foreign policy of the states:
   a powerful and long-term perspective tool. Lately, many states support
   the development of soft power politics, and Education is a part of this
   strategy as one of the main instruments to create a positive image of
   the country abroad. Because of this, international collaboration in the
   field of Education is part of the geopolitical interests of the state.
   We consider that it is a current issue, not only to study the importance
   of international educational collaboration within the framework of the
   social policy of the country, as well as to analyze it from the point of
   view of international relations. In the article we research the
   comparative analysis of the foreign cultural policy of Russia and Spain.
   We describe the experience of the creation of the first Double Degree
   programs between Russia and Spain in the context of the educational
   development strategies of the two countries. We analyze the first
   results of the operation of these programs which represented a very
   important progress in the international collaboration of the two
   countries.},

Abstract = {Improvements in human development under democratic institutions are
   often attributed to electoral contestation. We evaluate the effect of
   multiparty contestation on infant mortality in the authoritarian
   context. Contrary to what extant scholarship argues, we find no evidence
   that multiparty elections in authoritarian regimes reduce infant
   mortality. Specifically, we show that electoral autocracies do not
   produce better infant mortality outcomes compared to closed autocracies
   holding no multiparty elections. We also demonstrate a non-monotonic
   effect of electoral competition on infant mortality: Infant mortality
   increases in levels of electoral contestation common in electoral
   authoritarian regimes and decreases only at levels of contestation that
   are nearly exclusive to democracies. Finally, we show that increases in
   infant mortality in electoral authoritarian regimes operate partially
   through increased political violence and reduced state capacity.},

Abstract = {This article discusses the immoderation of incumbent Islamic parties -
   defined by the pursuit of a moral agenda and by an unwillingness to
   compromise with the opposition - through a comparative study of four
   incumbent Islamic parties in the socio-politically different regimes of
   Turkey, Egypt, Morocco, and Tunisia. Building on literature from
   religion and politics, social psychology, sociology of religion, and on
   the inclusion-moderation hypothesis, this study argues that (1) Islamic
   parties' strong organizations resulted both in their success and in the
   absence of internal pluralism and that (2) their dominant status in the
   party system consolidated their majoritarian understanding of democracy.
   Through its discussion of immoderation this study aims to contribute to
   the interdisciplinary literature on religion and politics.},

Abstract = {The European Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP) has often been a
   paper tiger lacking the required tools to translate the EU's goals and
   objectives into action on the ground. At the core of this problem is an
   enduring expectations-capabilities gap rooted in the meagre results of
   joint military capability development of CSDP member states. Many actors
   in the field, who work under conditions of hierarchical interaction
   favouring nation states over other actors, hamper the execution of joint
   projects. Those planned are jeopardised by a lack of shared strategic
   culture. Christian Kusters argues that a functioning European defence
   and technological industrial base is essential to underpin the CSDP.},

Journal = {WEST EUROPEAN POLITICS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {41},
Number = {5},
Pages = {1146-1165},
Abstract = {This article tests the personalisation thesis in Portugal (2002-2015),
   as well as its causes, focusing on changes in the level of party
   identification and perceptions of the economy. Portugal is an
   interesting example given its recent experience of a harsh economic
   crisis, as well as a decline in party identification. Results confirm a
   growing exogenous impact of leader evaluations on voting over the period
   but not in a linear fashion. During the crisis, the growing trend of
   leader effects for the incumbent party continues for those voters who
   have a positive perception of the economy. Conversely, for the main
   opposition party, leader effects are greater for those who perceive the
   economy as being worse. Thus the crisis operates as a catalyst for
   leader effects. The impact of leaders is also greater among the
   de-aligned, the numbers of which rise considerably during the period
   under analysis. It is voters with no party identification, who use
   leaders as proxies to a greater extent. These conclusions may extend to
   further studies on leader effects in Western democracies and help to
   shed light on the process through which leaders are becoming more
   relevant in voting decisions.},

Volume = {14},
Number = {1},
Pages = {1-23},
Abstract = {Hostage taking of Westerners by militant groups has increased since
   9/11. Despite this rising problem, there has been little academic
   research on how a hostage's individual characteristics influence the
   outcome of the incident. Using a newly collected dataset of over 1,000
   individuals taken hostage in incidents involving terrorist groups since
   2001, this article evaluates how individual, national, and group
   characteristics influence the likelihood that hostage incidents end with
   the release or execution of the hostage. The findings show that a
   hostage's nationality and occupation are significant individual-level
   drivers of outcomes, while the nature of the militant group itself also
   matters.},

Journal = {CITIZENSHIP STUDIES},

Volume = {22},
Number = {7},
Pages = {745-768},
Abstract = {This article engages with the liberalist conception of extraterritorial
   citizenship in examining the pioneering attempt of the Malaysian
   diaspora to make a rights-based claim for extraterritorial voting. Using
   the case study of MyOverseasVote (MOV), a transnational advocacy group,
   this paper demonstrates how the Malaysian diaspora staked their
   constitutional claim as absent citizens and challenged the state's
   definition of absent voters. The bottom-up reform is framed within the
   context of equalization of rights due to the salient ethnic element
   embedded in extraterritorial Malaysian citizenship. This liberalization
   of the external voting legislation has de-ethnicized but not equalized
   voting rights outside the country between publicly and privately
   employed citizens overseas. During the 13th General Election (GE13),
   Malaysia introduced a limited diaspora franchise conditioned upon
   territoriality and connectivity, affirming the continued relevance of
   territorial sovereignty.},

Abstract = {In 2015/16 - at the refugee crisis' peak - Germany was facing numerous
   demonstrations and acts of violence - such as arson attacks, common
   assaults, and verbal aggressions - directly or indirectly related to the
   social group of refugees, their shelters, and/or the federal
   government's refugee policy. This article explores to which degree
   right-wing extremists - both partisan and non-partisan - were capable of
   instrumentalising the anti-asylum protests in all East German states for
   their own political purposes. After comparatively delineating the number
   of anti-asylum protests (as well as the number of participants)
   influenced by right-wing extremists, this contribution depicts the
   extremists' strategies, their aims, and their mediate and immediate
   political impact. Unlike the majority of media coverage, the data seem
   to reveal that Saxony was far from being an exceptional case in
   Germany's east, but an ``average{''} region instead.},

Title = {NEOPATRIMONIALISM: CLASSIFICATION AS A WAY OF OVERCOMING THE CONCEPTUAL
   STRETCHING},
Journal = {POLIS-POLITICHESKIYE ISSLEDOVANIYA},

Number = {2},
Pages = {68-81},
Abstract = {The article summarizes the claims made for increasingly popular
   neopatrimonialism concept. Formed as a response to non-obviousness of
   basic assumptions and conceptual lengthiness of transit paradigm,
   neopatrimonialism concept itself became to generate significant
   conceptual stretching in the analysis of states, political development
   that contrasts with the Western democratic patterns. Regarded as
   neopatrimonial, African, Latin American, Southeast Asian, Central Asian
   and Eastern European states vary greatly according to the imposing
   volume of settings: on the principles of bureaucracy functioning, on the
   degree of political competition, on the role and the spread depth of the
   patron-client networks, nepotism and other informal practices.
   Therefore, speaking about neopatrimonialism, researchers focus each time
   on a different set of characteristics. An impressive body of empiric
   neopatrimonial researches sprained his conceptual framework to
   significant confusion. Following the theory of conceptual stretching by
   D. Sartori, one can say that in comparative neopatrimonial studies there
   is violation of rules on climbing the ladder of abstraction. Against the
   background of a large number of empirical studies carried out in line
   with the neopatrimonial paradigm, researches on understanding
   neopatrimonial concept per se constitute a negligible percentage and
   require development. The indiscriminate and uncritical application of
   neopatrimonial paradigm can be overcome through the more complete
   conceptualization of the neopatrimonialism concept. One of the main
   tasks in this way is the classification of neopatrimonial regimes.
   Author analyzes the existing approaches to such classifications and
   justifies the necessity of separation neopatrimonial regimes for
   regulated and predatory forms. The article analyzes the concepts
   emerging in the related fields of Political Studies, for their ability
   to enrich the proposed classification of neopatrimonial regimes. The
   idea of predatory neopatrimonial forms enriched by achievements of the
   ``predatory state{''} phenomenon research. Neoinstitutional dilemma of
   the credible commitment of property rights could potentially be fruitful
   to study the regulated forms of neopatrimonialism. This approach to
   classification of neopatrimonial regimes offers significant prospects
   for further operationalization and conceptualization of
   neopatrimonialism.},

Abstract = {The India-Pakistan conflict, one of the oldest unresolved interstate
   conflicts in the world, began in 1947 and has shown no signs of abating.
   Both realist and constructivist interpretations have offered several
   differing explanations as to the roots and persistence of this conflict.
   The article argues that a realist-constructivist approach as suggested
   by Samuel Barkin provides a new and better angle for explaining the
   genesis, evolution, and persistence of the India-Pakistan conflict, in
   addition to allowing prediction of future developments. Importantly,
   realist-constructivism combines several different analytical dimensions:
   It looks at the way in which power structures affect patterns of
   normative change in international relations and, conversely, the way in
   which a particular set of norms affects power structures. Both these
   dimensions have been overlooked as variables that can explain why it
   will be difficult to come up with lasting solutions for the
   India-Pakistan conflict.},

Abstract = {It is generally accepted that the normative idea of personhood is
   central to African moral thought, but what has not been done in the
   literature is to explicate its relationship to the Western idea of
   rights. In this article, I investigate this relationship between rights
   and an African normative conception of personhood. My aim, ultimately,
   is to give us a cursory sense why duties engendered by rights and those
   by the idea of personhood will tend to clash. To facilitate a meaningful
   philosophical discussion, I locate this engagement in the context of a
   debate between Ifeanyi Menkiti and Kwame Gyekye about the nature of
   Afro-communitarianism, whether it will ground rights as primary or
   secondary. I endorse Menkiti's stance that duties are primary and rights
   secondary; and, I also problematise moderate communitarianism for taking
   a Western stance by employing a naturalist approach to rights.},

Abstract = {Climate change is a scientific, health, political, economic, national
   security, environmental, moral and religious issue, among many others.
   The article presents the findings of a study which investigates what
   messages and messengers best engage young people with climate science
   and its solutions. The opinions and media habits of young adults, aged
   18-25 currently residing and studying in two metropolises of India,
   Bengaluru (Bangalore) and Chennai (Madras) vis-a-vis climate change have
   been elicited and interpreted. A survey of 500 randomly selected college
   and university students studying and residing in these two metropolises
   have revealed a heightened concern for the global environment and
   climate change issues among youth. The extent of information the
   respondents had on climate change issues was considerable. The
   respondents relied more on social media, especially blogs and networking
   groups for information on climate change, than the traditional mass
   media. Gender, economic status, course of study, and parental education
   were some of the important variables strongly associated with knowledge
   about climate change issues.},

Journal = {OSTEUROPA},

Volume = {68},

Pages = {231+},
Abstract = {Freedom of the press has never been guaranteed in Turkey. Restrictive
   laws have set strict boundaries. In addition, the army has repeatedly
   restricted the work of journalists and the media. Since the summer of
   2016, the situation has worsened further. The government under Recep
   Tayyip Erdogan used the attempted coup as an excuse to attack the media.
   Nearly 200 television stations, news agencies and newspapers were
   closed, while thousands of journalists were fired, accused of supporting
   a terror organisation or of ``terror propaganda{''}, and prohibited from
   working in their profession. Hundreds of them were arrested, convicted
   of crimes or driven into exile. Critical, independent media have been
   eliminated. Today, the government directly or indirectly controls 90
   percent of the media via the AKP. The conditions under which the press
   is currently operating in Turkey must be classified as being ``not
   free{''}.},

Abstract = {Environmental civil society organizations in Turkey have been drawn into
   the deep cultural and religious divide that characterizes Turkish
   society more broadly. Turkish environmental organizations are viewed by
   the Islamist leaning government as proxies for secularist opposition
   forces and not as independent voices truly committed to environmental
   protection. Interview data from fifty environmental leaders and Turkish
   state officials are analyzed to demonstrate how effective civil society
   functioning in the environmental sphere has been undermined by these
   deep partisan divisions. Local environmental struggles create one area
   of opportunity where environmental advocates can bridge the divide and
   work in collaboration with conservative government supporters.},

Journal = {POLITICA Y SOCIEDAD},

Pages = {135-159},
Abstract = {This paper analyses the perceptions that Spanish MPs have about the
   descriptive and substantive dimensions of political representation and
   the implications that these would have on the practice of representative
   democracy. Drawing on 18 in-depth interviews with members of Congress
   and Senate in the seventh legislature (2000-2004), of both sexes and
   from all political parties, we make a typology of discourses MPs have
   about these two dimensions of political representation before the Law of
   Equality came into force in 2007. Using an original analytical framework
   for the qualitative study of political representation, the study reveals
   that attributes belonging to both that actors and the context underlie
   the differences in the interviewees' discourses. Adding to previous
   literature, results suggest that sex (and the gender role linked) is not
   the only and determinant factor to understand MPs'definition of
   political representation. Other variables from the context appear to be
   crucial.},

Abstract = {The end of the Sixties is considered as the lost possibility for a
   shifting point within the long term decline of the political project of
   the American liberals. That historical moment opened up the transition
   towards the hegemony of the Conservatives and, a decade later, for the
   affirmation of the neoliberal political economy characterizing the
   United States of the last thirty years - even among the different
   political shades of the Administrations. However, analyzing this process
   from the point of view of the ``1968{''} in Detroit makes more
   complicate this too linear report of the liberals' decline. Therefore,
   the article discussed the urban riots, the factory's strikes and the
   emersion and breaking up of the Black Power during the Detroit's
   ``revolutionary moment{''}, inserting them within a more general
   scenario and along a long term historical perspective.},

Abstract = {The Andean region is integrated by four Latin American countries:
   Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador and Peru unified in the regional association
   Andean Pact, signed in 1969, which was redefined as the Andean Community
   of Nations (CAN, for its acronym in Spanish) in 1996. Through more than
   45 years of existence the main causes of the economic performance of the
   Andean region need to be understood: an intraregional trade that does
   not show the expected takeoff; and trade with countries outside the
   regional perimeter, deeply dominated by raw materials, despite recurrent
   attempts to establish regional industrial development programs. This
   article studies the case of the economic and political relations of the
   member countries of the CAN with relevant hemispheric actors, especially
   the United States This article states that the configuration of the main
   export markets determines the productive structures of the Andean
   economies to the detriment of a process of deep regional economic
   integration.},

   COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS},
Journal = {SRAVNITELNAYA POLITIKA-COMPARATIVE POLITICS},

Volume = {9},
Number = {2},
Pages = {114-132},
Abstract = {The article is devoted to the problems of regional positioning as the
   most important factor in the growth of the symbolic potential of the
   state, whose political and social communities are interested in the
   sustainable and progressive development of their territories. The
   authors, based on the results of the conducted research, assess the
   progress in the semantic fields of the attractive image of the Tyumen
   region. Image models are considered for the purpose of revealing the
   similarities and differences in the characteristics expressed in them.
   It is established that the objective image integrates positive and
   problem manifestations of regional reality. In subjective constructions,
   negative aspects do not find fixation. The dynamics in the perception of
   the Tyumen region by the population of Russia is revealed. In the matrix
   of mental design there are many new associates replacing part of the
   core brand of hydrocarbon specialization and referring to the
   diversification of the economy, its innovative restructuring, historical
   and cultural heritage, sports and scientific achievements, and tourism
   opportunities. In the representations of citizens of the CIS countries,
   the uniqueness of the Tyumen region is associated with the exportraw
   material supply, as well as a capacious labor market, favorable
   conditions for training, life, self-realization. The European countries
   do not have the necessary level of recognition of the region. The oil
   and gas component in Western societies is more closely associated with
   the image of the Russian Federation as a whole as an energy power. The
   set of image features is reduced to the limits of immersion in business,
   educational, sports and other communications within the framework of
   international cooperation.},

Pages = {395-424},
Abstract = {Fifty years after the ECtHR delivered its first judgement, the time has
   come to rethink the defining function of this jurisdiction. That means
   recognizing and analyzing in detail the tension between its role as a
   protector of individual rights and its role as a standard-setting body
   through which the process of European harmonisation in the field of
   fundamental rights takes place. This rethinking actually means
   considering which of the two functions, the protective or the
   harmonising one, should prevail in determining the position of the Court
   of Strasbourg in the European judicial area. One of the clearest
   elements of this transformation of the Court is the pilot judgment
   procedure, which tests the potential of the European Court as the
   European Constitutional Court.},

Pages = {383-398},
Abstract = {George Orwell explained how totalitarian regimes oppressed the
   individual, and his influence is still great in politics and even in
   daily life. However, Coming Up For Air (1939) appears to be more
   relevant today than his long-studied and widely read Nineteen
   Eighty-Four (1949). In Coming Up For Air, Orwell describes the life of
   the common man in the democratic England of the time, focusing in the
   way political power is resisted rather than exerted, because there
   really is a dull oppression under democracy, exerted on the individual
   whose political freedom protects and fosters. This paper aims at
   clarifying in which way is the individual oppressed and how he can,
   according to Orwell, resist the oppression.},

Abstract = {The perpetual struggle for separatism among Moros in Mindanao is
   produced on a background of historical and cultural injustices and by
   the presence of Moro liberation fronts, along with the government
   responses to this issue. This article endeavors to trace and interweave
   the roots of historical and cultural factors of Muslim separatism in
   Mindanao, along with its implication to the present Marawi crisis as
   fueled by the ISIS-linked groups who attacked the Philippines' Islamic
   city on May 23, 2017. It looks into the history of the arrival of Islam
   and the subsequent islamization of Mindanao. It then discusses the
   Muslim resistance movement against two foreign regimes, Spanish and
   American, which is followed by its resistance against the Philippine
   government. Factors that trigger Muslims' desire for separatism include
   at least three notorious massacres: Jabidah, Manili, and the Tacub
   Massacre. Such historical factors of injustices have fuelled the
   century-old struggle for separatism and self-determination. With the
   government's and non-government forces' failure to pacify the island,
   such struggle resulted into continuing war in the region killing over
   120,000 Mindanaoans. Recently, this conflict in the region was reignited
   when an ISIS-linked group attacked the Philippines' Islamic city of
   Marawi, affecting over 84,000 internally displaced persons from over
   18,000 families who are now seeking refuge in 70 different evacuation
   centers, in a state of discomfort, missing home and psychologically
   distress.},

Abstract = {College campuses have taken on increased responsibility for mobilizing
   young voters. Despite the discipline's commitment to civic engagement,
   political science departments play a minimal role in this programming.
   This article outlines a course structure-including learning objectives,
   course outline, and assessments-that treats a campus-wide voter
   mobilization drive as the basis of an applied political science course.
   Transforming a campus voter mobilization program into a political
   science practicum offers advanced skill-building for students seeking
   political careers and links learning objectives to real world
   activities. Participants report gains in both knowledge of campaigns and
   grassroots campaign skills. We argue this type of course particularly
   benefits students attending colleges and universities in geographic
   areas that receive little attention from political campaigns as well as
   those students for whom the traditional route of gaining political
   experience-an unpaid, off-campus internship-is impractical or even
   impossible.},

   Reflections on the Fatiguing and the Luminous},

Year = {2018},
Volume = {30},

Pages = {142-153},
Abstract = {Marx famously described the learning of Marxism as both potentially
   fatiguing and luminous. Marxian pedagogy must navigate the perils
   encountered by students of Marxism, and encourage glimpses of the
   enlivening possibilities that this encounter may enable. To reflect on
   Stephen Resnick's pedagogical contributions to the teaching of Marxism,
   this essay employs insights from psychoanalysis and education theory to
   reconsider the author's experience of Marxism in Steve Resnick's
   classroom. It highlights the concepts of overdetermination and
   exploitation in order to reflect on the ways in which Resnick both
   provoked and supported struggles with what Cho calls ``knowledge of the
   disturbing kind.{''}},

   Communities},
Journal = {CONFLICT STUDIES QUARTERLY},
Year = {2018},
Number = {22},
Pages = {95-108},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Even though there have been numerous studies on the quality of life of
   the Romani (Roma) communities, their role in society, marginalization or
   poverty, at this time, there are few studies that show how these
   communities understand and regard conflict and the methods (especially
   the traditional ones) that they use to solve these problems. Previous
   research has provided evidence to show that Romani people have developed
   their own indigenous system of justice, rather than relying on official
   agents of social control to deal with disputes in their communities.
   Through the use of the ethnographic approach, using participatory
   observation and the interview as methods of data collection, the present
   study aims to present how Roma people use and impose justice in their
   communities through a better understanding of their moral codes.},

Abstract = {How is it that the UK government continues to export weapons to Saudi
   Arabia for use in the war in Yemen, despite an explicit commitment to
   international humanitarian law (IHL)? And how is it that the High Court
   recently dismissed a case of judicial review, confirming that the
   government was rationally entitled to conclude' that arms exports pose
   no clear risk to IHL in Yemen? In what follows, I explain how a flexible
   interpretation of risk, reliance on secret information, and deference of
   the Court to the executive serve to facilitate rather than restrict arms
   exports. The judges' decision provides a stamp of approval to an arms
   export policy that has directly contributed to the deaths of thousands
   of civilians in Yemen. Attention to the Saudi/Yemen case shows the
   political and legal manoeuvring that goes into managing the
   contradictions in government arms export policy.},

Abstract = {In the article a problem of positioning of Ukraine between Europe and

   The scholar's emotionality in historiographic and politological
   discourses that became sensibly manifested when he put the question of
   the Ukrainians' geopolitical interest on axiologic lines the friend -
   the foe{''} is particularly specified. In that case, on the contrary to
   his repeatedly declared pro-western orientation, M. Hrushevsky's
   sympathies were often at the side of the Russian neighbour. The fact
   that such ambivalence was characteristic to Ukrainian humanitarian
   studies and political thought not only of the 20th century, but
   elsewhere in Ukrainian historical time is pointed out. The
   aforementioned fact activates the continuation of the research of the
   problem Ukraine between Europe and Russia{''} in wider chronological and

Abstract = {Prior to the 2002 electoral reform, political parties in Russia's
   regional legislative elections showed poor performance. Since December
   2003, however, all regions have been obliged to elect no less than half
   of the members of their assemblies by proportional representation. As a
   result, party competition at the sub-national level became unavoidable.
   This study tests three kinds of hypotheses dealing with the
   institutional, sociological, and political factors in the fragmentation
   of party systems within Russia's regions. The analysis demonstrates that
   political factors, especially the activity of the Kremlin and the heads
   of regional executives, have played the primary role in shaping regional
   party systems.},

Abstract = {Citizenship develops in relation to the specific way in which the
   colonial state and local societies reshaped each other. This article
   traces the history of that relationship in Indonesia over the last two
   hundred years. At first, a central colonial state with insufficient
   resources to enforce its will negotiated halfway accords with a host of
   local rulers. Villagers belonged' to their patrimonial ruler, with the
   choice to submit or run away. By the early twentieth century, the state
   began to develop its technical means to bring about major economic and
   social changes, but only in densely populated areas with agrarian
   potential. Capitalism there began to disrupt village life and loosen
   clientelistic bonds. An indigenous constituency emerged for relatively
   autonomous citizenship. After independence in 1945, state politics there
   were (left-)populist rather than liberal. Where the state had fewer
   interests, however, the central state presence remained thin. The
   nineteenth century halfway house was reinvented and stabilized. Local
   leaders more easily gained monopolistic control over economic resources,
   allowing them to enforce clientelistic forms of citizenship. Central
   state elites were happy to grant local autonomy there, since it also
   relieved them from direct citizen pressure on their own prerogatives.},

Journal = {WEST EUROPEAN POLITICS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {41},

Pages = {1-27},
Abstract = {In every democracy, established political parties are challenged by
   other parties. Established parties react in various ways to other
   parties' presence. A key hypothesis in the relevant literature is that
   established parties can decrease another party's electoral support by
   parroting it, i.e. adopting its core policy issue position. This article
   argues, and demonstrates empirically, that this hypothesised effect
   mainly occurs in the event that a critical prerequisite is in place.
   Parroting a party decreases its support only if that party is ostracised
   at the same time. The article classifies a party as ostracised if its
   largest established competitor systematically rules out all political
   cooperation with it. Analysing 296 election results of 28 West European
   parties (1944-2011), evidence is found for a parrot effect - however,
   concerning ostracised parties only. On several occasions established
   parties have substantially decreased another party's support by
   simultaneously parroting that party and ostracising it.},

Abstract = {The impact of terrorist events on attitude formation and change among
   mass publics has been well established in political research. Still, no
   individual-level study has examined the impact of terrorist attacks on
   political participation. This article aims to fill that gap. Drawing on
   theories of affect, it is predicted that fear stemming from a terrorist
   attack will increase motivation to seek out political information, yet
   will have a negative effect on actual participation. On the contrary,
   anger will hinder information seeking but will boost the intention to
   participate in political rallies. These hypotheses are tested using data
   from a two-wave panel study that collected one wave before and a second
   wave after the January 2015 Paris attacks, and from one cross-sectional
   study carried out soon after the November 2015 attacks.},

Abstract = {The casualty effect is a widely studied explanation of public support
   for war in the context of overseas military operations, yet work on the
   effect of casualties on support for intrastate war is scant. This paper
   examines the impact of local casualties on support for using military
   action as a conflict resolution method for intrastate war, using data
   from two public opinion surveys, collected in Turkey in the absence and
   presence of large-scale violence, and an original dataset for the local
   casualties. We find that local-level casualties on average increase the
   support for military action in ethnic wars.},

Abstract = {The main purpose of this paper is to construct a new conception of
   federalism by reinterpreting the logical-theoretical relationship
   between the categories of the federal center, the subjects of the
   federation and the federal whole. In the author's opinion, the task of
   comprehending the factual material, despite the importance of this
   procedure, is of secondary importance in comparison to the task of
   identifying a common plan, or scheme, hidden in the existing empirical
   foundation. The author starts with discussing the phenomenon of the
   federal center, which becomes the logical and theoretical point of
   intersection of all basic categories of the theory of federalism. On the
   basis of the phenomenological analysis of the center as a general
   category, the author formulates a non-trivial justification why it is
   necessary to distinguish between the center and centrality as an
   ontological content of the system, which allows the author to rethink
   the relationship between the real political centers and centers of
   social unification. The author concludes that the federal political
   unity represents an integral expression of a united (political, social)
   center, which dialectically reflects the unity of the federation itself.
   Therefore, the fundamental problem of the theory of federalism consists
   not so much in answering the question ``who is more important?{''}, but
   rather in searching for a way of describing the special unity of the
   political center of the federation, which manifests itself in the
   federal center and the political centers of the subjects of the
   federation, while preserving an arbitrarily wide variety of elements of
   a federation.},

Journal = {POLITICA Y SOCIEDAD},

Abstract = {Violence and politics have always been related throughout history. The
   use of weapons as an instrument of political transformation has been
   characteristic of revolutionary processes. However, today's times mark
   new realities, challenges and contexts where violence is no longer the
   only, nor the best alternative. This article seeks to investigate the
   futility of revolutionary violence today, from a look at the FARC-EP. It
   starts with a framework on the relationship between violence and
   politics. It raises some of the main discourses that have served to
   justify the just wars in general and revolutionary violence in
   particular. Finally, a tour through of the evolution of the FARC-EP is
   made, pointing out how it has been changing its actions and its
   speeches, to the point of questioning the validity of violence as a
   method of political action, reconsidering its strategies and
   considering, in recent times, abandonment of the armed route.},

Abstract = {Building on the author's previous works discussing Gramsci's and
   Ambedkar's political philosophies in favor of subalterns and Dalits as
   well as the concept of ``spirituality{''} through which they affirm
   their full humanity, this essay explores their envisaged role of
   education in allowing the excluded to achieve participation in the
   democratic process. After discussing scholarship around education and
   Gramsci, the essay examines the same topic for Ambedkar, noting their
   commonalities, with the help of work from Padma Velaskar and Shaikaja
   Paik. After examining Dewey's influence on Ambedkar's ideas on
   education, the essay emphasizes the latter's originality in adapting his
   teacher's pragmatism to the Indian milieu and considers those authors
   who have explored a closeness between Gramsci and Dewey. The conclusion
   suggests a return to the practical educational philosophy of Gramsci and
   Ambedkar as still indispensable in the contemporary scenario for making
   democracy effective for all.},

Number = {4, SI},

Abstract = {Japan during the interwar period was more globalized in many ways than
   it is now. Japan prospered under the liberal international order. The
   Japanese people at the time believed that the country needed more land
   overseas to feed the increasing population, but the growing mainland
   economy gave jobs to the most Japanese population. The benefits the
   colonies conferred were not great, but some Japanese, particularly
   military and civil personnel in the colonies, were major beneficiaries.
   Japan was among the first to recover from the Great Depression, and by
   the middle of the 1930s was in a full employment situation. Japan did
   not need to export its population to other countries or to acquire
   territories through military action. The military expansion into China
   and the shift to a controlled economy in Japan and Manchukuo benefitted
   those who supplied goods to the military and obeyed the authorities.
   Such benefits, though, came at the expense of Japanese taxpayers and
   consumers, who were oppressed and were unable to criticize the military.
   The benefits gained from the military clampdown and a controlled economy
   were quite visible, but the benefits of the liberal international order
   often cannot be clearly seen. Japan still had a chance to recognize the
   true benefits of the liberal international order and the false benefits
   of colonization, military expansion, and a controlled economy, but could
   not. Wilsonian-Taisho moment was lost at the end of the 1930s.},

Abstract = {Sanctuary city policies seek to protect undocumented community members
   from federal detention or deportation. Debates over sanctuary cities
   have become increasingly prominent and partisan in American politics.
   Republicans accuse sanctuary cities of enabling crime, while Democrats
   laud them for protecting communities from rights violations. Despite
   partisan salience, we have little information about peoples' substantive
   knowledge of sanctuary policies or how crucial that knowledge is in
   shaping partisan attitudes toward those policies. Drawing on a unique
   survey dataset of sanctuary attitudes, we demonstrate that an absence of
   political knowledge has asymmetrical effects on sanctuary attitudes
   along ideological and partisan lines. Knowledge about sanctuary policies
   increases support for sanctuary cities among liberals/Democrats, whereas
   conservatives/Republicans do not require substantive knowledge to align
   their attitudes on sanctuary cities with their ideological
   predispositions. This finding advances scholarship on the interplay
   between political knowledge and ideology, and has important
   immigration-related policy and advocacy implications.},

Abstract = {Under what conditions are ``holding-together'' federations created? And
   what shapes the development of their territorial structures? This
   article answers these questions through a comparative-historical
   analysis of territorial restructuring in Belgium, Spain, and the UK. It
   shows that ``holding-together'' federations are created during a
   critical juncture opened by a surge of regional nationalism and that the
   strategic responses of mainstream parties to this threat are conditioned
   by their ideology and their ability to ``credibly'' deploy accommodative
   strategies. These constitutional settlements put countries on a path of
   institutional development that is conditioned by mainstream parties'
   ideational adaptation to the political foundations of the federation and
   by their power in the system of inter-governmental relations. Even when
   regionalist parties regain control of the agenda, mainstream parties'
   ideological adherence to the norms enshrined in the constitutions,
   coupled with their resilient power in the system of intergovernmental
   relations, means that institutional change is gradual. These insights
   bear relevance for institutional theory and for comparative federalism.},

Abstract = {The main subject matter in this article is the development policy of the
   Russian Far East as one of the aspects (constituent elements) of the
   regional development of the Russian Federation declared and implemented
   by the country's leadership since the mid-1990s. The Russian experience
   of regional policy related to the development of the Far East is of
   scientific and practical interest. The analysis of modern regional
   policy allows us talking about a new content interpretation, formation
   of basic approaches, principles in the development of the Russian Far
   East. The main features and peculiarities of this policy are considered
   by the authors in the context of a discussion about the so-called new
   paradigm of regional policy that is unfolding in recent years. The
   article analyzes the strengths and weaknesses of the new regional policy
   based on the provision of tax and other benefits to business entities,
   and evaluates its effectiveness.},

   in Western Europe. An analysis proposal},
Journal = {REVISTA ESPANOLA DE CIENCIA POLITICA-RECP},
Year = {2018},
Number = {48},
Pages = {45-72},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {The aim of this article is to analyse the electoral settings favorable
   to the populist parties in Western Europe after the economic crisis. To
   this end, a comparative process tracing has been applied to a selection
   of cases (Spain 2011-15, United Kingdom 2010-15 and Sweden 2010-14)
   after a fuzzy Qualitative Comparative Analysis (fsQCA) to 26 general
   elections held in Western Europe between 2010 and 2015. The results
   suggest that the electoral success achieved by these parties cannot be
   explained by a single causal condition, but different paths can lead to
   the same phenomenon: on the one hand, a very favorable demand (high
   levels of dissatisfaction and political mistrust) can be sufficient to
   explain the electoral success of these parties, even when competing
   within an unfavorable political and institutional context; on the other
   hand, certain party competition patterns (coalitions and convergence in
   proportional electoral systems) can be sufficient, even if demand is
   unfavorable. Finally, this analytical proposal can be extended to the
   study of other types of political organisations, such as the so-called
   anti-immigrant parties.},

Abstract = {We develop a theory of electoral competition in multidistrict
   legislative elections when nomination decisions are made by local
   policy-motivated party members, and voters care about both local and
   national positions. We show that the asymmetry generated by different
   national party positions reduces or even entirely removes the
   competitive pressure to nominate moderate candidates. The model has
   important implications for our understanding of policy divergence and,
   in particular, of the effects of gerrymandering.},

Title = {Positions and saliency of immigration in party manifestos: A novel

Abstract = {Immigration is one of the most widely debated issues today. It has,
   therefore, also become an important issue in party competition, and
   radical right parties are trying to exploit the issue. This opens up
   many pressing questions for researchers. To answer these questions, data
   on the self-ascribed and unified party positions on immigration and
   immigrant integration issues is needed. So far, researchers have relied
   on expert survey data, media analysis data and proxy' categories from
   the Manifesto Project Dataset. However, the former two only give the
   mediated party position, and the latter relies on proxies that do not
   specifically measure immigration. The new dataset presented in this
   article provides researchers with party positions and saliency estimates
   on two issue dimensions - immigration and immigrant integration - in 14
   countries and 43 elections. Deriving the data from manifestos enables
   the provision of parties' unified and unfiltered immigration positions
   for countries and time points not covered in expert surveys and media
   studies, making it possible to link immigration and immigrant
   integration positions and saliency scores to other issue areas covered
   in the Manifesto Project Dataset. Well-established criteria are used to
   distinguish between statements on (1) immigration control and (2)
   immigrant integration. This allows for a more fine-grained analysis
   along these two dimensions. Furthermore, the dataset has been generated
   using the new method of crowd coding, which allows a relatively fast
   manual coding of political texts. Some of the advantages of crowd coding
   are that it is easily replicated and expanded, and, as such, presents
   the research community with the opportunity to amend and expand upon
   this coding scheme.},

Abstract = {This article claims that racism is undoubtedly the foundation upon which
   colonialism prospered and assumed its nature and characteristics. Hence,
   a rethinking of issues associated with conceptions of race is
   simultaneously a decolonisation process. It is impossible if not
   inconceivable to think of racism in post-apartheid South Africa without
   making reference to the colonial nature of the practice. It is beyond
   dispute that the issue of race and identity is still a bone of
   contention in post-apartheid South Africa. A lot has been written and
   done in this regard but this article argues that from what has been
   accomplished no effective and workable recommendations have been
   successfully put forward. The article challenges the prevailing
   recommendations and proposals to be revised beyond anger and emotion.
   Such an endeavour does not perceive anger and emotion as irrelevant but
   pushes to re-channel them in ways that support emancipatory strategies
   that serve to unlearn racial stereotypes. It proposes not a solution but
   a foundation of a thinking process inspired by Fanon which seeks to
   understand the problem before we attempt to propose a solution.},

Abstract = {The four volumes on human rights norms reviewed here investigate a
   puzzle introduced by quantitative studies, which shows that the
   expansion of commitments with human rights does not guarantee compliance
   with these rights in practice. Going beyond the classical opposition
   between constructivism and rationalism, the volumes explore the
   conditions and mechanisms that are likely to close this `compliance
   gap'. This essay starts by reviewing the arguments of the books before
   focusing on two major themes: compliance mechanisms and international
   denunciations. It argues that the introduction of `reintegrative
   shaming' and `stigma' to compliance research may help refine current
   knowledge on normative change and resistance to change.},

Journal = {EUROPEAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {10},
Number = {4},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {This paper contributes to current debates on the politicization of
   international politics by examining party-political contestation of
   peace and security missions. It is guided by two inter-related
   questions, (a) to what extent deployment decisions are contested amongst
   political parties and (b) what drives such contestation. We examine data
   from a new data set on parliamentary votes on deployment decisions in
   France, Germany, Spain, and the United Kingdom and from the Chapel Hill
   Expert Survey. Against conventional wisdom and in an effort to address
   the often-overlooked role of political parties, we find that military
   deployments have been systematically contested amongst political parties
   across Europe. Further, we find that contestation is driven by the
   left/right axis, as opposed to newer cleavages captured here by the
   so-called gal/tan axis. We also find evidence that patterns of
   contestation depend on parties' positions in government or opposition, a
   factor we relate to bureaucratic and international pressures on the
   parties in office, and to political opportunities for opposition
   parties.},

Abstract = {Dyadic data from the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees
   (UNHCR) on the size of the global refugee population are widely used.
   However, for a large fraction of the refugee population, these data
   provide no information about refugees' country of origin, which
   contributes to a high nominal rate of unreported values in the data. In
   this article, I demonstrate that two imputation approaches outperform
   the current standard approach, which assumes that all unreported values
   are zero. The first approach interpolates the unreported values, while
   the second predicts them based on trends observed in other dyads.
   Drawing on different types of information, the two approaches'
   performance is similar. Replicating a published study on the effect of
   refugee crises on international war and peace, I demonstrate how both
   approaches strengthen the author's findings and help to minimize the
   risk of a null finding.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF POLITICS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {80},
Number = {4},
Pages = {1389-1393},

Abstract = {In this article, we assess the explanatory power of two contrasting
   theories about the sources of political trust. Using a unique survey of
   expatriated Swedes together with two cross-country surveys, we
   investigate how a move from a context of high institutional quality to
   countries characterized by low institutional quality affects peoples'
   institutional trust and satisfaction with democracy. Our analyses show
   that Swedes living in countries with low levels of institutional quality
   display significantly lower levels of political trust and support
   compared to the native population, demonstrating that experience of
   institutional quality is more important than socialization and culture.
   However, long-time exposure to, and socialization into, a new cultural
   and institutional setting triggers something like a process of
   resocialization, in which the difference in satisfaction and trust
   decreases over time. The results are robust to a wide array of
   specifications and statistical techniques.},

Abstract = {This article's main interest is the link between the dramaturgy arts and
   contemporary politics. It proposes a deconstruction from the political
   anthropology perspective of a state ritual promoted since the Frente
   Amplio's first national government with respect to the so-called recent
   past. It specifically addresses a commemorative ritual called ``Day of
   the Never Again{''} promoted by President Tabare Vazquez in which he
   sought to reconvert the patriotic commemoration of the birth of the
   national hero Jose Artigas in a ritual of the nation's rebirth and
   reconciliation to end the still open wounds from the recent past
   represented as fratricidal sin. The underlying myths and the basic
   performance sequences that structure this commemorative ritual in the
   assembly of its four editions carried out between 2007 and 2011 are
   analyzed.},

Abstract = {Scholars have found differences between older and newer foundations and
   their giving priorities and strategies, especially in education.
   Foundations founded in recent decades with still-living benefactors have
   been more vocal, result-oriented, and focused on education initiatives
   like charter schools and alternative certification than their older
   counterparts. In this paper, I examine whether these differing patterns
   hold for new and old foundation grants to state departments of
   education, leading new foundations to target contexts politically
   amenable to education reform while old foundations focus less on
   politics and more on state need. Using data on the largest 1000
   foundations, in addition to grants from the Gates and Wallace
   Foundations, I find that new, but not old, foundations, are more likely
   to support education reform policies when giving to state education
   agencies. I also find that new, but not old, foundations support state
   education agencies possessing political contexts conducive to education
   reform as well as higher levels of child poverty. I illustrate these
   findings with the case of Kentucky. These findings suggest that, by
   taking advantage of state need while seeking out political allies, new
   foundations behave like interest groups in their grants to government.},

Abstract = {Empirical research consistently finds that people with high education
   have more liberal immigration attitudes. To what extent this
   relationship reflects a causal effect of education is, however, largely
   unknown. We rely on the staggered introduction of a major Norwegian
   education reform to get exogenous variation in respondents' level of
   education. The reform lifted the bottom of the education distribution by
   increasing the compulsory years of education by two years. We find no
   significant difference in immigration attitudes between those who were
   educated in the old and the new education system. Our results suggest
   that if education has a causal effect on immigration attitudes, it is
   likely to operate on other education margins.},

Abstract = {Minority traditions of thought within the West have typically not been
   examined as objects of study within comparative political theory, which
   as a field has tended to focus mainly on non-Western thought in its
   interventions within the broader theory subfield. This article offers an
   illustration of the takeaways to be derived from placing black political
   thought into conversation with comparative theory by examining the work
   of W. E. B. Du Bois from the early twentieth century to the early 1940s.
   I contend that through his argument in support of black autonomy or
   separation among African Americans, which draws inspiration from a
   particular form of internationalism, Du Bois transforms Western values,
   making them sensitive to the particularities of black life and the
   enduring nature of racial injustice, and in the process, usefully
   demonstrates how universalism can be re-thought by dwelling on the
   points of contact between different traditions of thinking.},

Abstract = {This article argues that in order to understand the form of modern
   political freedom envisioned by Rousseau, we have to understand his
   theory of taste as refined Epicureanism. Rousseau saw the division of
   labour and corrupt taste as the greatest threats to modern freedom. He
   identified their cause in the spread of vulgar Epicureanism - the
   frenzied pursuit of money, vanity and sexual gratification. In its
   place, he advocated what he called `the Epicureanism of reason', or
   refined Epicureanism. Materially grounded on an equitable proportion of
   needs and faculties, this was a hedonist theory of self-command designed
   to cultivate the temperate enjoyment of sensual pleasure. I argue that
   Rousseau hoped that a shift from vulgar to refined Epicureanism would
   secure political freedom in modernity by grounding the politics of the
   general will in an economics of balanced growth and a reinvigorated
   appreciation of natural beauty. This perspective provides a new way of
   both clarifying the role of economic justice and aesthetic judgment in
   Rousseau's republican state theory, and of assessing the consistency of
   his moral and political thought.},

Abstract = {This essay considers the informal in the work of Howard J. Wiarda, both
   in his observational approach to research and in the interactions he
   observed in Washington political society. I contend that Wiarda's focus
   on these phenomena was important, although he did not take his analysis
   of it far enough. In response, I draw upon the literature on informal
   institutions, policy networks, and social capital to reframe Wiarda's
   observations about interactions in Washington in the context of
   political science, in order to find greater meaning in an important
   theme in his work. I find that the informal interactions which Wiarda
   observed in Washington political society, as he asserted, undermine and
   polarize the U.S. policy-making process, and that they do so because
   they do not produce the bridging social capital that is expected of
   heterogeneous social networks.},

   as a proxy for machine prowess},
Journal = {ELECTORAL STUDIES},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {55},
Pages = {109-119},

Abstract = {I study the aggregate electoral benefits of control of mayoral offices
   by a clientelist party in Buenos Aires province, Argentina.
   Clientelistic machines require resources to exchange them for their
   clients' votes. The control of mayoral offices gives clientelist parties
   access to resources to do this, as well as to build patronage networks.
   Using a regression discontinuity design, I show that the clientelist
   party enjoys a strong incumbency advantage in mayoral elections.
   However, its control of local office does not translate into an improved
   electoral performance for other offices, despite the incentives that the
   local machine faces to do so. The lack of electoral benefits for mayoral
   and other offices jointly suggests that the clientelist practices may
   have a limited impact on aggregate electoral outcomes, possibly only
   benefiting mayoral candidates.},

Abstract = {Nomadism has been an age-long mode of pastoralism. Over the centuries,
   the practice has thrived amidst certain socio-ecological dialectics
   which has influenced its essence, including conflict and insecurity,
   climate change, urbanization, as well as changing patterns of land-use
   systems. Embedded in the practice of nomadism is the phenomenon of
   transhumant migration whereby pastoralists undertake a seasonally
   amenable geo-spatial sojourn in search of pasturable fields, resulting
   to both trans-local and trans-national migration. This pattern of
   migration has become a veritable source of security and livelihood
   threats in some parts of Africa in the contemporary times. This study
   explores the nexus between nomadic migrancy and rural violence in
   northern Nigeria against the backdrop of the degenerating complexion of
   nomadism in that context over the recent years. By means of a
   descriptive analysis, predicated on secondary sources and anchored on
   the `ungoverned spaces' thesis, the study sets forth to establish how
   nomadic migrancy has accentuated and/or complicated the incidence of
   rural violence in the focal area. The study posits that non-regulation
   of nomadic migration and pastoralism by the Nigerian government has
   provided an opportunity for the perpetuation of violent crimes, such as
   rural banditry and herdsmen militancy in the focal area. The study makes
   a case for a pragmatic securitization of Nigeria's border and
   immigration governance systems as the way forward.},

Abstract = {With the first female presidential candidate at the top of the
   Democratic ticket, the gender gap in 2016 was predicted to be the
   largest ever. Although the gender gap proved to be bigger than any other
   in recent history, with a majority of women voting for Hillary Clinton,
   a disaggregation of the vote by race indicated that not all women
   equally supported the female presidential candidate. This suggests the
   existence of a racialized gender gap not previously explored by extant
   research. Thus, this article explores the nature of this interracial
   gender gap by examining the political evaluations of men and women, by
   race, in the 2016 presidential election. Using data from the 2016
   American National Election Study (ANES) Time Series Study merged with
   the ANES Cumulative Data File (1948-2012), predictors of the gender gap
   were explored and the circumstances under which an interracial gender
   gap can be narrowed were examined.},

   and attributional responsibility},
Journal = {ELECTORAL STUDIES},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {55},
Pages = {62-72},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {In this research, we show that positive and negative framings of the
   economy motivated racial resentments and consonant judgments among
   Whites about President Obama's responsibility for the economy. Using
   experimental data collected in the 2012 Cooperative Congressional
   Election Study (CCES), we find that Whites attributed more
   responsibility to Obama under negative economic conditions (i.e., blame)
   than positive economic conditions (i.e., credit). Partisanship
   influenced both patterns, but racial resentment matters only among
   Democrats and Independents, not Republicans. We also compared President
   Obama to governors, and found that Whites attributed equal
   responsibility to the President and governors for negative economic
   conditions, but gave more responsibility to governors than Obama for
   positive conditions. Whites also gave governors more responsibility for
   state improvements than they gave Obama for national ones. Our findings
   highlight the likely inescapability of racial biases regardless of
   positive information or shared political identity.},

   Evidence from Canada},

Abstract = {While the literature on tactical voting suggests third parties are not
   likely to form under first-past-the-post rules, the literature also
   provides several potential explanations for why third parties have
   flourished in several first-past-the-post systems, and why voters will
   support these parties. This research note examines the most popular of
   these explanations, which holds that voters supporting parties placing
   third or worse in their district fail to recognize their party is out of
   the running. Using Canadian Election Study data from three recent
   elections, the results show that most voters supporting parties placing
   third or worse in their districts recognize that their parties are not
   likely to finish first or second. These results suggest more attention
   should be paid to other potential explanations for third-party voting in
   first-past-the-post systems.},

Abstract = {Habitual party donors represent an important revenue source for American
   political parties. What remains unclear is whether the party committees
   can also count on these donors to support the congressional candidates
   who represent the parties' best chances for seat maximization. Utilizing
   structural equation modeling and contribution data from the 2006 to the
   2012 election cycles, I find habitual party donors and certain new party
   donors respond to changes in party control of the House by providing
   more support to incumbents when their party is in the majority and more
   support to nonincumbents when their party is in the minority. Moreover,
   party donors are more likely to give to congressional candidates,
   especially those competing in priority races, than nonparty donors.
   Party donors additionally are revealed to be an important funding source
   for congressional candidates.},

Abstract = {To date the research of Orientalism in Russia did not present the whole
   mosaic palette of its competing schools and disciplines. The influential
   missionary Orthodox Orientology remains understudied. Even known is the
   contribution in the making of intolerant discourse on Islam by state
   atheist associations who seized its niche under the Soviet rule. This
   article attempts to integrate applied missionary and atheist schools of
   Oriental studies into the general debates on Orientalism in the 20th
   century Russia. The focus is on agents and networks of the Soviet
   propaganda, as well as on its changing language, topics and messages. A
   special attention is paid to continuities in the Orientalist imagination
   of Islam between pre-Soviet Orthodox missionaries, Soviet militant
   atheists, post-war philosophers and dissident Muslim preachers of the
   post-socialist Islamic appeal.},

   ARCHIVES},
Journal = {SOCIALIST STUDIES},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {13},
Number = {2, SI},

Abstract = {This article centers on the experiences of Jodh Singh, a marginal figure
   in the history of the Ghadar movement, who exists as the sum of a few
   documents in official archives and the media record of the Hindu-German
   conspiracy trial of 1917-18 in which he served as witness. Based on a
   close reading of these materials, at the center of which is an official
   account of the insanity of Singh, I undertake an analysis of discourses
   of patriotism and paranoia in the archive. Making a case for viewing
   Singh as exemplifying the condition of subalternity, I describe how the
   juridical-legal-medical framework of the American state that condemns
   Singh is based on anxieties about madness, foreignness, and sexuality as
   threatening to the legitimacy of the state. I also argue that Jodh
   Singh's story offers the basis of a critique of the idea of the Ghadar
   Party as an exemplar of cosmopolitan values and solidarity, given that
   Ghadar discourse shares some assumptions with the state apparatus that
   has judged Singh as defective, guilty, and diseased. In undertaking such
   a reading, the article illustrates how the story of Jodh Singh troubles
   the distinction between patriotism and paranoia as it exists in the
   imagination of the state.},

Journal = {EUROPEAN POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {17},
Number = {3},
Pages = {404-421},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {The study analyses the stock and the change of social capital in Greece
   at the onset of the economic crisis and tests for the effect of soft
   social capital elements on civic participation scores. Public servants
   are analysed separately as a potentially distinct group of citizens in
   terms of their civic engagement profile. At the empirical level, we
   identify social capital via the measurement of six main constructs,
   namely, social trust, social altruism, equality, tolerance,
   humanitarianism (soft social capital elements) and civic participation
   (a hard social capital element). Data are drawn from the European Social
   Value surveys Rounds 4 and 5. Results show that the country experienced
   a statistically significant decline in its social capital level during
   the 2008-2010 period, although public servants show higher (albeit also
   declining) levels of social capital. More importantly, soft social
   capital constructs do affect civic participation scores for the society
   as a whole but not for public servants.},

Abstract = {This article offers a prolegomenon to a relational theory of
   international relations (IR). The contention is that recent attempts to
   bring the Western and the Chinese strands of the ``relational turn{''}
   in IR into conversation have so far failed to transcend the bifurcating
   metanarrative of the mainstream, let alone account for the multiple
   intersections permeating the strategic search for relations with others.
   To rectify this trend, the following analysis suggests that a genuinely
   relational IR is also necessarily post-Western-i.e., it is neither
   Sinocentric, nor Eurocentric, but cultivated from the convivial, yet
   dissonant cross pollination of values, narratives, and practices in the
   study of world affairs. The attention of this article is to the ways in
   which the affordances of relationality are foreshadowed by the
   engagement with the Chinese concept of guanxi. While one of the terms
   that make the Chinese phrase for International Relations (guoji guanxi),
   it has remained occluded from the disclosure of an ontologically and
   epistemically relational IR. Guanxi is used thereby to amplify-not
   merely analyze-the intrinsic relationality both of global life and the
   realms of IR.},

Abstract = {In this article, I look at gender-based analysis, a gender policy used
   in Quebec to assess the impact of policies and programmes for men and
   women, and at the intersectional approach-the process of decentring
   gender as a point of departure for evaluating the experience of
   inequality. I examine two other policies, gender-based analysis plus,
   used in Canada, and the equal access to employment programmes in force
   in Quebec, to bring to light the elements of intersectionality that are
   present in or absent from these policies. I briefly introduce the two
   approaches to diversity management that have been adopted by Quebec and
   Canada, and I use these examples to discuss the influence of political
   culture on gender policies.},

Volume = {16},
Number = {3},

Abstract = {Using violence or threat of violence, ``thugs-for-hire{''} (TFH) is a
   form of privatized coercion that helps states subjugate a recalcitrant
   population. I lay out three scope conditions under which TFH is the
   preferred strategy: when state actions are illegal or policies are
   unpopular; when evasion of state responsibility is highly desirable; and
   when states are weak in their capacity or are less strong than their
   societies. Weak states relative to strong ones are more likely to deploy
   TFH, mostly for the purpose of bolstering their coercive capacity;
   strong states use TFH for evasion of responsibility. Yet the state-TFH
   relationship is functional only if the state is able to maintain the
   upper hand over the violent agents. Focusing on China, a seemingly
   paradoxical case due to its traditional perception of being a strong
   state, I examine how local states frequently deploy TFH to evict
   homeowners, enforce the one-child policy, collect exorbitant exactions,
   and deal with petitioners and protestors. However, the increasing
   prevalence of ``local mafia states{''} suggests that some of the
   thuggish groups have grown to usurp local governments' autonomy. This
   points to the cost of relying upon TFH as a repressive strategy.},

Abstract = {The aim of the article is to develop some reflections about the
   possibility of a redefinition of socialism. According to the author,
   socialism should be thought, firstly, as the theoretical and practical
   activity of criticism and transformation of all those modes of relation
   that, in the different spheres of social life, cause some individuals to
   be subjected to forms of exclusion and domination that prevent them from
   finding their self-realization and satisfaction. But, up to this point,
   we remain on the level of justice. Secondly, it is necessary to
   integrate the perspective of justice with the one of a theory of the
   good life. Social institutions should aim not only at realizing equal
   opportunities for all individuals, but also at reducing to a minimum the
   aspects of competition and antagonism between subjects and at promoting
   relations based on cooperation and solidarity.},

Title = {The direct and moderating effects of mass shooting anxiety on political
   and policy attitudes},
Journal = {RESEARCH \& POLITICS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {5},
Number = {3},
Month = {AUG 27},
Abstract = {In this article, we examine the effects of individual anxiety after the
   2016 Orlando, Florida, mass shooting, which killed 49 people and wounded
   58 others. Similar to prior research on the influence of anxiety, after
   the Orlando shooting anxious citizens supported policies and
   institutions perceived as protective and capable of minimizing future
   risks. In addition, anxiety counteracted ideology. Anxious citizens
   largely abandoned ideological processing, which resulted in a sharp
   reduction of differences between liberals and conservatives on essential
   beliefs and preferences associated with mass shootings. However, the
   degree of ideological abandonment turned on the alignment of ideology
   and anxiety. When anxiety about the Orlando shooting encouraged support
   for policies inconsistent with ideological preferences, the influence of
   ideology on subsequent preferences diminished notably. Conversely, when
   anxiety prompted support for policies consistent with ideological
   preferences, anxiety reinforced those preferences. The identification of
   ideological abandonment after Orlando, and the asymmetric influence of
   anxiety on political attitudes across ideology, are important
   contributions to theories of emotion and for research on tragic events.},

   identify the objectives of each group as well as the tactics that
   followed to reach them based on what is reflected in their bulletins. An
   analysis of its main publications has been made (Revolucion and Sierra
   Maestra for M26J, Alma Mater and 13 de Marzo for DR), which will allow

Title = {Trickle-Up Political Socialization: The Causal Effect on Turnout of
   Parenting a Newly Enfranchised Voter},
Journal = {AMERICAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {112},
Number = {3},
Pages = {698-705},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Scholars have argued that children affect their parents' political
   behavior, including turnout, through so-called trickle-up socialization.
   However, there is only limited causal evidence for this claim. Using a
   regression discontinuity design on a rich dataset, with validated
   turnout from subsets of Danish municipalities in four elections, I
   causally identify the effect of parenting a recently enfranchised voter.
   I consistently find that parents are more likely to vote when their
   child enters the electorate. On average across all four elections, I
   estimate that parents become 2.8 percentage points more likely to vote.
   In a context where the average turnout rate for parents is around 75\%,
   this is a considerable effect. The effect is driven by parents whose
   children still live with them while there is no discernible effect for
   parents whose child has left home. The results are robust to a range of
   alternative specifications and placebo tests.},

Abstract = {This article reconstructs the political and cultural history of a
   satirical figure, the ``psicobolche{''}, as it appeared in 1980s
   Argentina. Through this figure, the article analyzes the transformations
   in the relationships among youth, politics, and leftwing culture in the
   so-called ``democratic transition{''}, when an imaginary centered on
   ideas of revolution problematically coexisted with a language focused on
   democracy and its virtues. Those tensions erupted in the last third of
   the decade, and the satirical construction of the ``psicobolche{''}
   served as a venue for different youth cohorts to publicly discuss on the
   ``crisis of the left{''} and what was beginning to be known as
   postmodernism.},

Abstract = {``Poner el cuerpo{''} was a sentence which circulated in the armed left
   of the 70s in Argentina, to refer to the dedicated of people to
   revolution. However, what kind of bodies were they? From Joan Scott's
   perspective, this article makes a rereading of the PRT-ERP press to
   understand the frames in which the body's representations appear there
   in a paradoxical way. It's argued that while the press recorded the
   sexual difference, it did not delve into a thought around what that
   difference implied for the subject of revolution.},

Abstract = {Various scholars have argued and demonstrated that Western European
   populist parties have something in common. Although these parties adhere
   to various ideologies and employ different organizational forms and
   political styles, they all endorse a similar set of ideas concerning the
   relationship between the people and the elite. Yet despite our
   increasing knowledge about these parties, so far we know only very
   little about populist voters. Do the voter bases of populist parties
   also have something in common? To answer that question, I focus on the
   electorates of 15 prototypical populist parties from 11 Western European
   countries. I show that, in contrast with widely held beliefs, the
   electorates of populist parties do not always consist of individuals who
   are more likely to be losers of globalization' with Eurosceptic
   attitudes, low levels of political trust, and preferences for (more)
   direct democracy. This suggests that the' populist voter does not exist.},

   presidential election and a new poll aggregation model},
Journal = {ELECTORAL STUDIES},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {54},
Pages = {81-89},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {The U.S. presidential election results of 2016 surprised many
   poll-watchers, suggesting possible biases in estimated support for the
   major party candidates and posing a challenge for poll aggregation as a
   prediction tool. Using data from earlier elections and the 2016
   campaign, we evaluated poll aggregation performance for the major
   prediction web sites. We found that a proportional bias, partly due to
   non-major party preference during polling, had a large impact on
   state-level estimates. A novel smoothing mixed effects model that is
   sensitive to both national and state-specific trends showed similar or
   superior performance to other aggregation methods over multiple
   elections. The improvement of the proposed model over competing methods
   was especially large in 2016, which we largely attribute to the late
   swing in voter support for the candidates, and suggests that the average
   bias in polling may be smaller than assumed. Simulations of electoral
   college outcomes indicate that, on the eve of the election, the
   probability of a Trump victory was about 47\%. We suggest that an
   increased emphasis on fundamental statistical tradeoffs of bias and
   variance may be the key to further improved prediction.},

Abstract = {Labor market competition is a leading explanation for defensive
   attitudes towards immigration but empirical support for this hypothesis
   is widely debated. This paper re-evaluates its explanatory power by
   investigating the relationship between labor market retirement and
   attitudes towards immigration in 14 European countries. The empirical
   results, based on an instrumental variable strategy to deal with
   potential endogeneity, find that although retirement is an important
   change in a person's labor market participation, it does not generally
   shift opinions. As a plausible explanation for this, I use a
   cross-national survey experiment to demonstrate that individuals who are
   retired retain socio-tropic orientations towards immigration, which, I
   argue, likely override their ego-tropic orientations. The combined
   evidence indicates that the labor market competition hypothesis may not
   be suitable as a comprehensive explanation for public opinion about
   immigration.},

Abstract = {Existing studies of Congress argue that institutional power within the
   U.S. House of Representatives has shifted from committee chairs to party
   leaders during the post-World War II era. This shift was exacerbated by
   the reforms of the 1970s, which democratized governing processes in
   committees and enhanced the power of party leaders. If these studies are
   correct, there should be a notable shift in the public behavior of party
   and committee leaders, with committee leaders more active and visible
   early in the post-war era, and party leaders increasingly active
   thereafter, particularly following the reforms. To test this argument, I
   examine over 3,000 legislators' actions in the public sphere as reported
   by the Washington Post from 1949 to 2011. In assessing these actions, I
   find a shift from committee to party leadership activity that roughly
   confirms the expectations of previous studies, but I also find evidence
   that party leaders were nearly as active as chairs in the committee era.
   The results show that committee chairs and party leaders engaged in
   different kinds of action in the public sphere, with party leaders
   having a greater connection to the president than committee chairs
   regardless of era. These findings suggest that the committee era
   narrative is too limited.},

Abstract = {Survey research has expanded in the Arab world since the 1980s. The Arab
   Spring marked a watershed when surveying became possible in Tunisia and
   Libya, and researchers added additional questions needed to answer
   theoretical and policy questions. Almost every Arab country now is
   included in the Arab Barometer or World Values Survey. Yet, some
   scholars express the view that the Arab survey context is more
   challenging than that of other regions or that respondents will not
   answer honestly, due to authoritarianism. I argue that this position
   reflects biases that assume Arab exceptionalism more than fair and
   objective assessments of data quality. Based on cross-national data
   analysis, I found evidence of systematically missing data in all regions
   and political regimes globally. These challenges and the increasing
   openness of some Arab countries to survey research should spur studies
   on the data-collection process in the Middle East and beyond.},

Abstract = {This article aims to evaluate School Based Management (SBM), applied in
   Mexico through the Schools Quality Program (PEC), on schools performance
   and equity. From a quantitative approach, the PEC is evaluated by
   Differences-in-Differences (DiD) usin data from Enlace 2008-2013 and
   from the Statistics 911. From a qualitative approach, the PEC is
   analyzed in terms of school based management's success in a context of
   high privation by analysing data from a survey applied to a sample of
   schools benefited by the program. The findings indicate that PEC impacts
   in a positive and significant way only richer schools, while poorer ones
   do not show any improvement. From this analysis, the article proposes
   three hypotheses to explain the limited scope of the PEC in poorer
   schools. Finally, the document proposes a series of policy
   recommendations.},

Abstract = {The diversity of political spaces, availability of cheap labor, ease of
   access to powerful figures, and safety net of a foreign passport attract
   researchers to the developing world. However, environments of extreme
   state weakness and ongoing conflict permit research behavior that would
   be frowned on in the global north. We suggest that weak regulatory
   authority in conflict-affected states offers foreign academics
   opportunities that are not available when states have greater reach or
   capacity. Qualitative researchers may find requests to interview victims
   or perpetrators of wartime violence granted with ease. Experimenters can
   coerce under-resourced NGOs to pursue interventions at odds with their
   organizational mandates. We posit that conflict contexts can constitute
   permissive environments in which researchers can engage in conduct that
   would be considered deeply problematic at home. Because studying
   political violence can require firsthand research on aspects of
   political life not easily observed elsewhere, this article offers a set
   of guidelines to foster more ethical and responsible research practices.},

Abstract = {According to the literature, parliamentary scrutiny is either used by
   the opposition to control the government or by a coalition partner to
   control the leading minister. Yet, neither the opposition alone nor
   individual governing parties alone can muster a parliamentary majority
   to adopt recommendations, resolutions or statements. Therefore, we ask
   which parties coalesce in co-sponsoring such joint position papers on
   European Union policy proposals and why. Tying in with the existing
   literature, we offer three explanations. Firstly, position papers are
   co-sponsored by so-called `policy coalitions', a group of parties that
   hold similar preferences on the policy under discussion. Secondly,
   governing parties form coalitions which support their minister's
   position vis-a-vis his or her international partners in Brussels.
   Thirdly, party groups co-sponsor position papers to counter-balance the
   leading minister's deviation from the floor median.
   On the empirical side, we study the statements issued by committees of
   the Finnish Eduskunta and recommendations adopted by committees of the
   German Bundestag over a period of 10 years. Though having similarly
   strong parliaments, the two countries are characterized by very
   different types of coalition governments. These differences are mirrored
   in the observed co-sponsorship patterns.},

Abstract = {How does sharing a common gender identity affect the relationship
   between Democratic and Republican women? Social psychological work
   suggests that common ingroup identities unite competing factions. After
   closely examining the conditions upon which the common ingroup identity
   model depends, I argue that opposing partisans who share the
   superordinate identity of being a woman will not reduce their intergroup
   biases. Instead, I predict that raising the salience of their gender
   will increase cross-party biases. I support my hypotheses with a
   nationally representative survey of 3,000 adult women and two survey
   experiments, each with over 1,000 adult women. These findings have
   direct implications for how women evaluate one another in contentious
   political settings and, more broadly, for our understanding of when we
   can and cannot rely upon common identities to bridge the partisan
   divide.},

Abstract = {The corporations as right-holders of freedoom of religion was the main
   topic discussed in the emblematic case of the Supreme Court of the
   United States Burwell v. Hobby Lobby. In a tight ruling five to four
   votes, the majority opinion founds the transgression of the I Amendment
   rights to three closely held corporations due to the imposition of the
   contraceptive mandate contained in Obamacare. This article explains the
   context of the case delving into the evolution of the figure of the
   corporation in the United States, the recognition of the fundamental
   rights for legal entities and the peculiarities of the American
   healthcare system. Also summarizes the main arguments and facts of the
   case and the analysis of its implications.},

Abstract = {The constitutional provisions that ensure the Rule of Law in Brazil are
   constantly denied. Despite constitutional supremacy, tools of mutual
   control and the safeguards of rights are defective. A new threat for
   constitutionalism arises: a judicial branch that encroaches upon the Law
   as if it were merely advancing moral values. Populism - an old enemy of
   democracy - presents itself as a new friend of judges, who often
   disregard explicit rules so they can ``decide fairly{''}. This argument
   is certified by recent judicial rulings that often take hold of a
   ``language of exception{''} that authorizes judges to go beyond Law's
   boundaries in the name of the public's best interest or even in order to
   restrict democratically elected officials' rights and prerogatives. The
   same phenomenon can be witnessed when it comes to judicial review, when
   a single judge is authorized to temporarily withdraw a constitutional
   amendment or even when one starts to cherish a fabricated and supposedly
   democratic law that directly violates the Constitution - as a result,
   the constitutional articles in Brazil become irrelevant. The Rule of Law
   opens up no space for heroes, even those in robes. The judicial branch
   is lacking restraint when it comes to comply with its constitutional

Abstract = {How is modern constitutionalism related to anticolonialism? This Article
   takes into account this question with a special reference to the case of
   H? Chi Minh. It argues that modern constitutionalism offers a powerful
   ideational and discursive weapon for the colonized people to struggle
   against colonialism. To understand this, the Article introduces the
   concept of anticolonial constitutionalism', defined as a form of
   political discourse in which anticolonialists employ the language and
   ideas of modern constitutionalism to combat the predatory colonial
   government and to express the aspirations to a constitutional
   government. Anticolonial constitutionalism emerges under three
   conditions, namely exploitatory and arbitrary colonialism,
   anticolonialism, and constitutional enlightenment. The case of H? Chi
   Minh illustrates this phenomenon well. When Vietnam was under French
   colonialism as a part of French Indochina during the first half of the
   twentieth century, Vietnamese anticolonialism was vehement, and
   different anticolonialists employed the language and ideas of
   constitutionalism to oppose the colonial government. One of them was H?
   Chi Minh, considered by many Vietnamese as the father and icon of the
   nation. A tremendously influential anticolonialist, he was enlightened
   with constitutionalist knowledge and employed key ideas of modern
   constitutionalism, namely a written constitution, the rule of law,
   popular sovereignty, and fundamental rights to struggle against French
   colonialism and to express such aspirations to a constitutional
   government in Vietnam. This study has implications for the trajectory of
   constitutionalism in contemporary Vietnam given the continuing influence
   of H? Chi Minh's constitutionalist discourse in the country nowadays.
   More generally, this study has implications for the relationship between
   constitutionalism and anticolonialism.},

Title = {Gender Equality as a Closed Case: A Survey among the Members of the 2015
   Danish Parliament},
Journal = {SCANDINAVIAN POLITICAL STUDIES},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {41},
Number = {2},

Abstract = {Despite almost unanimous adherence to the principle of gender equality
   in contemporary Denmark, a society with a long historical record of
   gender equality policies and almost 40 percent women in parliament, are
   there still divergences to be found among the members of parliament
   concerning gender equality principles and policies? This article argues
   that in order to identify underlying cleavages it is necessary to pose
   fundamental questions that go beyond the day-to-day disagreements on
   policy issues. Based on a new survey of the members of the Danish
   parliament, this study finds that the support for gender equality is not
   just a matter of lip service insofar as few MPs hold traditionalist
   views on women. However, the study reveals conflicting perceptions,
   left-right cleavages and gender gaps, sometimes also within the parties.
   A new discourse is identified, supported by a large minority that
   includes all of the male MPs from the four right-wing parties; this
   minority considers gender equality to be a closed case' - that is, as
   having by and large been achieved. This may provide clues to the puzzle
   of the stagnation in gender equality reforms in spite of the general
   support for gender equality'. The article discusses the possible
   connection between the closed case' discourse, present neoliberal trends
   in society and the recent construction of gender equality as an
   intrinsic Danish value' - an argument familiar in other countries with a
   harsh debate over immigration.},

Abstract = {This paper focuses on the democratic quality of `new' modes of EU
   governance. Since these innovative governance arrangements are more
   likely to demonstrate democratic features of a deliberative nature, the
   criteria for an ideal type of deliberative democracy are developed based
   on the well-known work of theorists Jurgen Habermas and Iris Marian
   Young. The empirical test case of the Industrial Emissions Directive
   and, more specifically, the selection and deliberation processes of its
   Technical Working Groups are assessed using these criteria. The research
   reveals how a particular new mode of EU governance works in practice and
   how it performs from the perspective of deliberative democracy.},

Abstract = {Data contained in Voting Advice Applications (VAAs) is not only a
   prerequisite for the vote recommendations they provide but can also be
   used for estimating party positions in low-dimensional spaces. Given
   that VAAs can be designed differently in terms of their number of items
   and their measurement level, how much can one trust the party positions
   obtained from this source? We tackle this question by exploiting
   relevant variation in a real-world setting: three VAAs offered at the
   2017 Lower Saxony election. Despite substantial design differences, the
   policy spaces extracted through an inductive scaling approach are highly
   convergent. Simulated random item removal from the pooled dataset of all
   three VAAs furthermore suggests that about 40 items yield satisfactory
   reliability of the party positions. Finally, we find that a priori
   assigning VAA-items to ideological dimensions is potentially problematic
   as the interpretation of resulting party spaces may differ from the ones
   derived inductively.},

Abstract = {This study investigates the most frequently censored news in China.
   Existing studies show that the Chinese propaganda authorities are more
   likely to censor news considered harmful to the legitimate rule of the
   central state, yet allow news with negative consequences for local
   levels of government to be published. A content analysis of official
   propaganda notices (n = 728) reveals that the propaganda authorities,
   indeed, engage in selective news censorship. The selective censorship
   practice also reveals a structural difference: The central propaganda
   authority focuses more on news related to national guidelines and
   policies and the image of the central state and leadership, whereas
   local propaganda authorities tend to focus more on news that is harmful
   to social stability and the image of local government. The central
   authority is found to be more tolerant than its local counterparts, as
   it allows news media to report a considerable amount of news that have
   negative consequences for local levels of government-news which, on the
   other hand, is heavily censored by the local propaganda authorities.},

Abstract = {George W. Bush's presidency provides a fertile ground to further develop
   the standard model of presidential approval. In contrast to the vast
   presidential approval literature, early studies of Bush conclude
   economic conditions had no effect once the war in Iraq began. Rather
   than require a fundamental rethinking of presidential approval theories,
   we argue that approval models must take into account issue salience.
   When a factor is salient, it has a stronger effect. During the Bush
   presidency, with considerable over-time variation in the salience of the
   economy, terrorism, and the war in Iraq, each, in turn, power-fully
   affected Bush's approval.},

Abstract = {Since 2013, protests opposing police violence against Black people have
   occurred across a number of American cities under the banner of ``Black
   Lives Matter.{''} We develop a new dataset of Black Lives Matter
   protests that took place in 2014-2015 and explore the contexts in which
   they emerged. We find that Black Lives Matter protests are more likely
   to occur in localities where more Black people have previously been
   killed by police. We discuss the implications of our findings in light
   of the literature on the development of social movements and recent
   scholarship on the carceral state's impact on political engagement.},

Abstract = {`Rightful resistance' has become a mainstream theoretical framework for
   understanding social protests in contemporary China. However, the middle
   class in Shanghai is more inclined to protect its rights through loyal
   appealing' than rightful resistance. The middle class has had to express
   its loyalty and its voice' at the same time to minimize its political
   risk. Rightful resistance and loyal appealing' differ in several
   respects. First, rightful resistance professes loyalty only to the
   central government, whereas loyal appealing professes loyalty to the
   local government. Second, rightful resistance considers the local
   government an object to confront, whereas loyal appealing considers it a
   potential ally. Finally, activists who engage in rightful resistance use
   central government policies as their weapon, whereas activists who
   engage in loyal appealing use the local government's political
   performance as a bargaining chip. However, the middle class has not
   completely relinquished its right to rightful resistance; instead,
   rightful resistance is a backup to ensure the effectiveness of loyal
   appealing.},

Abstract = {The Protestant Reformation was undoubtedly one of the fundamental
   milestones of the occidental modernizing process. For that reason, and
   especially in the Anglo-Saxon universe, proliferated an enormous amount
   of studies that analyse diverse axes of such an important event.
   However, there is one aspect that received less attention, although its
   political and social implications have been as deep as doctrinal or
   governmental ones: the question of language. In this article, we examine
   Lutheran positions regarding the translation and transmission of
   writings in the German language as keys to the political transformations
   that the Reformation had to undertake. In order to to that, the
   positions of some referents prior to Luther are visited and the
   consequences of abandoning Latin, as the official expression of the
   Catholic Church, in favour of vernacular languages are taken into
   consideration.},

Abstract = {Politicians shirk when their performance is obscure to constituents. We
   theorize that when politician performance information is disseminated
   early in the electoral term, politicians will subsequently improve their
   performance in anticipation of changes in citizens' evaluative criteria
   and possible challenger entry in the next election. However, politicians
   may only respond in constituencies where opposition has previously
   mounted. We test these predictions in partnership with a Ugandan civil
   society organization in a multiyear field experiment conducted in 20
   district governments between the 2011 and 2016 elections. While the
   organization published yearly job duty performance scorecards for all
   incumbents, it disseminated the scorecards to constituents for randomly
   selected politicians. These dissemination efforts induced politicians to
   improve performance across a range of measures, but only in competitive
   constituencies. Service delivery was unaffected. We conclude that,
   conditional on electoral pressure, transparency can improve politicians'
   performance between elections but not outcomes outside of their control.},

Abstract = {The aim of this paper is to examine the relationship between food
   insecurity and conflict events short of war in Africa, taking account of
   a host of mediating factors, including the degree of inequality, the
   level of development, democratic quality, quality of governance and the
   degree of government expenditure, which we incorporate into our
   analysis. Our results suggest that food price volatility does contribute
   significantly to conflict events measured by political events in Africa
   (ACLED). Greater democracy can engender more conflict, but in a
   non-linear fashion. The broader V-DEM participatory index of democracy
   also encourages more protest. Our governance variables are significant,
   emphasising the salience of state capacity in this regard. An innovation
   of our study is the inclusion of inequality. We deploy two metrics of
   vertical inequality: the GINI coefficient and the broader V-DEM
   egalitarian index. The GINI index of income inequality has a
   counter-intuitive statistically insignificant sign, suggesting that
   greater income equality or middle-class share of income results in
   greater political unrest. We also utilise political measures of
   inter-group horizontal inequality which significantly engender conflict
   risk.},

Abstract = {This article uses the case of the 2012 presidential election in Russia
   to reveal a new mechanism of authoritarian resilience, which it calls
   infrastructural. This mechanism complements the currently dominant
   explanation of authoritarian resilience focused on material
   redistribution. The article argues that public sector organizations may
   significantly increase the ability of an autocrat to implement political
   decisions on the ground. This mechanism can partially explain Vladimir
   Putin's strong performance at the 2012 election, which was achieved
   through the engagement of schoolteachers, who frequently served as
   members of precinct-level electoral commissions, in agitation and
   electoral fraud. The article finds that if the factors contributing to
   the pressure on teachers were eliminated, Vladimir Putin might not have

Abstract = {The fundamental cause of the violence in Colombia has been the
   inequality in the division of the land, one of the most unequal in the
   world. Regarding this issue, the Colombian state has had two
   perspectives: either they have been wrong or have been conceived in a
   malicious way to favor a minority, in detriment of the peasant
   conglomerate. Such foolishness or insanity has had a violent expression
   that might be stopped through public development and in the long term
   through the Havana Peace Accords.},

Title = {Surviving Elections: Election Violence, Incumbent Victory and

Journal = {BRITISH JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {48},
Number = {2},
Pages = {459-488},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {It is often assumed that government-sponsored election violence
   increases the probability that incumbent leaders remain in power. Using
   cross-national data, this article shows that election violence increases
   the probability of incumbent victory, but can generate risky
   post-election dynamics. These differences in the consequences of
   election violence reflect changes in the strategic setting over the
   course of the election cycle. In the pre-election period, anti-incumbent
   collective action tends to be focused on the election itself, either
   through voter mobilization or opposition-organized election boycotts. In
   the post-election period, by contrast, when a favorable electoral
   outcome is no longer a possibility, anti-government collective action
   more often takes the form of mass political protest, which in turn can
   lead to costly repercussions for incumbent leaders.},

Abstract = {This paper discusses trends in criminal justice and penal policy over
   the past twenty-five years. This period has been characterised as a time
   of penal populism, which originated in the failure of the 1991 Criminal
   Justice Act, and the competition between the main political parties to
   be tough on crime'. However, this is not the only trend to be found in
   penal policy. There has continued to be a strong undertow of support for
   rehabilitation and community penalties, including restorative justice.
   There has been pressure from the left as much as the right to take
   domestic violence, sexual offences against women and children, and hate
   crimes more seriously. There have been pressures to meet performance
   targetswhich gradually transformed into calls to build the legitimacy of
   the justice system. Finally, there have been pressures to privatise
   criminal justice agencies. These various impulses have sometimes
   amplified and sometimes counteracted the pressures towards tough penal
   policy. If the period of intense penal populism ran from 1993 to 2007,
   inertia in the system has ensured that there have been no significant
   attempts to row back from tough policies, and to reassert the values of
   penal parsimony. Given that money has been tight since 2007 and crime
   has continued to fall, this must amount to a lost opportunity of
   significant proportions.},

Abstract = {One of the features that characterizes the complexity of the Middle East
   is its diffuse structure of power, which is constituted by a complex
   interweaving of the three fundamental geopolitical dimensions (local,
   regional and global), constituted by socio-political units, actors and
   processes that claim different executive fields (political, economic,
   military, technological, religious-moral, family and social), with
   different justifications and legitimations (traditional, charismatic,
   legal-rational). In order to provide a basic image of this diffusion,
   the article has been divided into four headings: the first is a brief
   introduction; the second tries to order a typology of the different
   socio-political units at all three levels; and the third explains the
   basic features that have generated the peculiar diffusion of power.
   Finally, with the help of Norbert Elias's figurative sociology, some
   types of games among political actors are established which can help us
   understand the various conflictive configurations of the region.},

Abstract = {The Belfast Agreement ended the bulk of paramilitary and state violence,
   underlined majority consent, acknowledged the desire for Irish
   unification, reformed policing, de-militarised security and embedded
   ethno-sectarian power-sharing. However, the past remains unhealed and
   without an adequate vocabulary and behaviour required to structure
   conflict transformation. This article argues that the responsibility of
   politicians and other agents of victimhood should be to question the
   utility of harsh and one-sided assertions regarding the past and to
   conclude that denial is unpalatable when tied to amplified demand. The
   agency of that contestation is performance centred and rhetorically
   driven and reproduces alternative interpretations that evoke profound
   and divisive emotional states. The friction over truth recovery is
   abstraction-laden due to the agency of victimhood and its variant
   constructions.},

Abstract = {Previous research has shown a steady decline of citizen's political
   trust and growing skepticism towards key institutions of representative
   democracy. Political parties, which perform the crucial role of linking
   citizens to the political system, are in the eye of the storm: citizens
   are generally more distrusting towards parties than other social and
   political institutions. The relevant literature mentions that parties
   often implement intra-party democratization to remedy party distrust.
   This article examines whether democratic candidate selection processes
   actually affect party trust among voters. The analysis is based on the
   cases of Belgium and Israel, where politicians made a strong case for
   intra-party democracy in recent history. The results indicate that,
   while inclusive selectorates indeed increase trust levels,
   decentralization decreases trust towards parties in both countries.},

Journal = {POLITICAL RESEARCH QUARTERLY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {71},
Number = {1},
Pages = {59-74},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Since Carmines and Stimson's seminal work, the concept of issue
   evolution has become a common theoretical toolkit to examine and explain
   polarization around cultural issues and partisan realignment in the
   United States. However, very few studies outside the United States have
   applied the concept of issue evolution to explain electoral change and
   realignment around new issues at national elections over time. Analyzing
   whether and how Carmines and Stimson's concept travels to electoral
   change in a multiparty system would provide more theoretical leverage
   and create empirical knowledge on the logic of issue evolution outside
   the United States and also whether the logic of electoral change differs
   from U.S.-style two-party systems. This article applies the issue
   evolution concept to a multidimensional multiparty system using
   micro-level data from 1971 to 2011 in combination with data on
   elite-level polarization to demonstrate that partisan realignment in
   Denmark follows an issue evolution process with niche parties as main
   drivers. Moreover, niche party polarization on the new dimension of
   conflict has a stronger effect on vote choice than mainstream party
   polarization.},

Abstract = {The development and growth of industrial robots started in 1947. The
   velocity of this process has increased as a result of development
   technology. Now, industrial robots have broad applications. They can be
   substituted for human force in different industries. The ever increasing
   growth and development of robotic technology in the field of industry
   was always challenging. One of these important challenges emphasizes on
   the negative effect of robotics on employment rate. As a result of cost
   reduction and production improvement, industrial countries have been
   motivated to employ robots and substitute them for workers in production
   lines. However, the broad use of robotic systems in the field of
   industry can have negative consequences in different societies. One of
   the common and negative effects of these systems is the reduction of
   employment opportunities which increases unemployment for those who look
   for jobs and for employed individuals. It can lead to employment
   insecurity and threat the health and safety of workers. These matters
   violate the human rights regarding the security and health of
   individuals, equality of opportunity, and particularly the employment
   rate. It also violates the employment standards supported by the
   international human rights instruments.},

Abstract = {It was when the European relocation and resettlement mechanism (ERRM)
   was passed in September 2015 that the regional group of the Visegrad
   states (V4) openly opposed the Council's decision and refused to
   implement it. This intraregional comparative study examines if the
   Visegrad group jointly contests the ERRM and if the reasons for this
   contestation can be found in the respective governmental constellations
   and the public opinion.The underlying data of the Commission's
   monitoring reports on the ERRM therefore serve as an essential data
   basis.A coherent contestation finally cannot be confirmed and similarly
   the governmental constellation or the public opinion in the V4 varies.},

Abstract = {In this article, we present a new dataset containing political science
   publications on Norwegian, European and international levels by authors
   affiliated with Norwegian institutions. 564 articles from 1999 to 2014
   are coded according to a variety of variables. Using this dataset, we
   explore questions regarding who publishes and what is published in
   Norwegian political science. We confirm suspicions that publications in
   international journals often contain quantitative methods, while
   publications in national journals use qualitative methods; that it is
   predominately professors who publish in high ranking international
   journals and that women are still strongly underrepresented in
   publications on all levels, despite rise in tenured female academic
   staff in Norway. However, we see a trend of more mixed-sex research
   teams on the international level, which can be explained by two
   interconnected hypotheses: (I) publication on the international level is
   more prestigious, and will often require collaboration between several
   researches; (II) there has been a rise in female PhDs while professors
   are still mostly male. By contrasting findings from Ireland, Portugal,
   and Spain, we also present the status of Norwegian political science in
   an international context. We encourage researchers to investigate
   further the evolution of Norwegian political science using these data.},

Abstract = {The current international security context is characterised by an array
   of globalised risks that has led the United Nations (UN) to adapt its
   policies to try to manage the complex challenges that are emerging.
   Within this context, the present article highlights the role played by
   conflict prevention - a trend that has gained more weight in the
   international community's agenda over the last years, as well as the
   potential of one of the tools integrated into conflict prevention
   policies: the early warning systems, the application of which has not
   been sufficiently explored-. Aimed at demonstrating the importance of
   this instrument in managing the security challenges the international
   community faces, this article analyses the experience of the Economic
   Community of the West African States (ECOWAS) in this field, since its
   early warning model is used as an example within the international
   sphere. Besides, the article shows the possibilities the partnership
   ECOWAS-UN offers in the field of early warning.},

Abstract = {This paper explores public perceptions of congressional partisanship in
   an era of polarized parties. We use data from a module on the 2014
   Cooperative Congressional Election Study (CCES) that asks respondents
   about the voting behavior of their legislators. Our results show that
   individuals underestimate the extent to which legislators from their own
   party vote the party lineeven when primed with information about high
   levels of party-line voting in Congresswhile fairly accurately
   perceiving levels of unity in the opposing party. We also find evidence
   that this perceptual gap endures, and at times widens, at higher levels
   of political knowledge and in the presence of elections. Finally, in a
   separate experiment, we explore how voters respond to differential
   levels of party-line voting by a hypothetical legislator. The combined
   results from the experiment and CCES module suggest voters' perceptions
   often align with what allows them to have the most favorable impression
   of their party's senators or unfavorable impression of the other party's
   senators. The results suggest that biases in how voters process
   information about levels of partisanship in Congress may limit
   accountability in meaningful ways.},

Abstract = {This article begins with the underlying assumption that data and the
   designing of informational infrastructure is not neutral; rather, that
   the acts of tagging, indexing, aggregating and defining of data and data
   categories are inherently political acts. How and whether information is
   collected, archived, categorized, and eventually published are further
   political choices that necessitate critical review, rather than being
   taken at face value. Taking a self-reflective approach, the objective of
   this article is to develop a methodological understanding of
   online-based open-source human rights investigations, with a particular
   focus on the Syrian Archive. This article aims to align with the work of
   other scholars investigating the new field of online open-source
   intelligence and big data analysis, particularly that by human rights
   organizations, as well as with scholars in the field of data ethics,
   digital rights and privacy, statactivism, and science and technology
   studies. Providing empirical and qualitative evidence on the potential
   of online-based open-source data collection in this context will address
   a crucial gap in the current literature.},

Abstract = {Political Science neglect classical insights on constitutional and
   economic conditions of the so called ``tax state{''} as a fiscal
   institutional architecture sui generis. While studies in Political
   Economy focus on distribution quality of the welfare state or compare
   budgets from local to international level fiscal research should also
   consider the capitalist structure of tax paradigm again. Only after such
   a regeneration the discipline could better reflect old and new
   democratic challenges of fiscal problems. Recalling former theories of
   interdependencies between fiscal, constitutional and ideological orders,
   this article suggests to make sense of conceptualizing democratic regime
   itself as prime public good. Because if it is fiscal sovereignty that is
   foremost to produce with democracy's budget it should be easier to
   analyze tax state driven regressive effects of democratic integrity.},

Abstract = {How to make sense of a popular vote is a question raised once again by
   the prospect of a Brexit referendum. To date the French rejection of the
   European Union constitutional treaty's ratification has been one of the
   most consequential electoral statements in the history of European
   integration. Still, what its actual message was continues to puzzle
   analysts. What were the French telling us? The article approaches this
   question of from the angle of the discursive processes of meaning making
   in the public sphere, through arguments, narratives and images.
   Complementing available explanatory accounts based on survey date or
   quantitative textual analysis, it presents a non-quantitative
   interpretive discourse analysis of political ideas providing structures
   of meaning in the debate around the treaty, as it was reflected in the
   press. The focus is on discursive and narrative techniques of meaning
   making and knowledge production. These are situated against embedding
   webs of beliefs, languages, and traditions. The reading offered presents
   the debate as structured (i) by the motif of an open-ended search for a
   better Europe, rather than an outright rejection of the integration
   project (ii) by a deep opposition between `social Europe' and a world
   where political agency over market forces is lost, and (iii) by an
   overarching discourse about reclaiming this agency, popular sovereignty,
   and asserting the will to influence Europe's political future.},

Abstract = {This paper studies the prevalence of ballot order effects in two
   different types of Canadian elections which differ greatly by the
   strength of party cues they provide to voters. Provincial elections are
   best described as a typical competition between well established and
   institutionalized parties, hence providing voters with strong party
   cues. Alternatively, municipal politics provide voters with much weaker
   party cues. We use electoral results from recent provincial and
   municipal elections in Quebec and find ballot order effects in municipal
   elections but not in provincial ones. Although ballot order effects may
   also be the product of alphabetic preference bias, we argue that in any
   case these are cognitive biases that are ultimately the product of
   insufficient cues that voters need in order to cast well-informed votes.
   The paper, therefore, sheds some light on an understudied type of
   election in political science.},

Abstract = {This paper explores the connective action mechanisms that underpin the
   rapid formation of online counter-publics in the wake of disruptive
   political events through a case study of crowd-sourced disability
   protest launched in response to Donald Trump's election as U.S.
   President. Coverage of this protest in U.S. news media is reviewed also
   as a first step towards assessing the ability of this initiative to
   influence public discourse. Findings suggest that controversial election
   results can spur mobilisation, but by themselves do not appear to be
   sufficient for connective action to really flourish and succeed.
   Personal action frames that typically are central to connective action
   struggled to emerge in crowd-sourced contributions that focused on Trump
   and his politics. The reasons behind these outcomes and their
   implications for the potential effectiveness of crowd-sourced protest
   are discussed.},

Abstract = {The Treaty of Union 1707 between Scotland and England and the respective

   the Presbyterian religion and the system of education, helped to ensure
   that Scottish identity was supported by some of the most powerful
   aspects of the state. This essay will examine some of the provisions of
   the Treaty, analyse aspects of the legal system and law that persisted
   after the Union, comment on the extent to which 310 years of the Union
   with England influenced that law, reflect on membership of the EU and
   the harmonization which it brought to the legal system and consider the
   impact of the Scottish Parliament on that law and legal system.},

Abstract = {Thanks to crowdfunding, deliberative mini-publics can be funded
   bottom-up to reach a wider support in the population and secure
   financial autonomy for their design. But who are the people willing to
   pay for deliberative democracy and why? This article answers this
   twofold question using an original survey with crowdfunders of the G1000
   in Belgium. First, the financial support for deliberative democracy
   mainly comes from the more socially advantaged groups. But second, the
   crowdfunders largely diverge in their democratic preferences. Some are
   critical and favour any forms of alternative decision-making process,
   including technocratic forms. Others demonstrate a stronger attachment
   to electoral institutions and their political actors. Hence, the study
   of the crowdfunders of the G1000 shows that deliberative democracy
   attracts the support of citizens with different political orientations.
   This sheds light on the complex and intertwined links between a
   mini-public and its larger maxi-public.},

Abstract = {A recent Special Issue in this journal devoted its pages to discuss the
   varied forms of capitalist development in different countries and
   regions across the globe. Specifically, the contributions offered a
   critical assessment of the hegemonic `neo-institutionalist' approach to
   the study of national diversity of capitalism, with particular focus on
   the `varieties of capitalism' approach. This article critically engages
   with the different alternatives to the varieties of capitalism approach
   that were put forward and shows that these other perspectives also fall
   short of providing a convincing framework to address the problematique
   of national or regional particularities as posed in the debate. In order
   to offer a more solid explanation of the phenomenon of `capitalist
   variety', the article draws upon Marx's fundamental insight into the
   determination of capital as a materialised social relation which becomes
   the immediate alienated subject of the organisation of the process of
   social life and also moves some way beyond it so as to cast fresh light
   on global transformation and uneven development in recent decades. More
   concretely, the article further submits that the specificity of the
   Latin American `variety of capitalism' must be grounded in the
   constitution and dynamics of the international division of labour which
   results from the underlying essential unity of the production of
   relative surplus value on a world scale by the global total social
   capital. In other words, we grasp the emergence of national
   specificities as the immanent result of the global unfolding of the `law
   of value'.},

Abstract = {What makes individuals tolerate government corruption? Can citizens
   tolerate government corruption but be intolerant of corrupt behavior in
   society? I argue not all attitudes toward corruption are the same.
   External territorial threats elicit a tolerance of government corruption
   since citizens allow for government corruption when they are concerned
   for their security. However, citizens become intolerant of corruption in
   society because they view this as maximizing individual welfare at the
   expense of the common good (i.e. security). Using data from three unique
   cross-national surveys, I find that citizens under territorial threat
   are less likely to think corruption is an important problem, are more
   likely to tolerate government corruption, but are less likely to
   tolerate corruption by private citizens.},

Title = {Moving beyond input legitimacy: When do democratic innovations affect

Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL RESEARCH},

Volume = {57},
Number = {1},
Pages = {135-152},

Abstract = {This article makes three key contributions to debates surrounding the
   effectiveness of democratic innovation, deliberation and participation
   in representative political systems. In the first instance, it argues
   that more attention should be paid to the role that participation
   actually plays in governance. The literature on democratic institutional
   design often neglects concern about the effects of innovative
   institutional designs on more traditional representative fora, at the
   expense of concerns about their internal procedures. Second, the article
   argues that despite limitations, replicable systematic comparison of the
   effects of institutional design is both necessary and possible even at
   the level of national governance. A comparative analysis of 31 cases of
   National Public Policy Conferences (NPPCs) in Brazil is presented.
   Finally, the article shows that popular deliberative assemblies that
   vary in their familiarity and their policy area of interest, and that
   organise their structure and sequence deliberation in different ways can
   be associated with differential effects on both option analysis and
   option selection stages of the policy process, respectively.},

Title = {The politics of justice: Levinas, violence, and the ethical-political
   relation},
Journal = {CONTEMPORARY POLITICAL THEORY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {17},
Number = {1},
Pages = {49-68},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {In the early and often ignored 1934 essay `Reflections on the Philosophy
   of Hitlerism', Levinas identifies a historically dominant form of
   politics rooted in the ontological reduction of the other to the same
   that provides intellectual justification for physical violence against
   the other. The ethical relation aims to overcome this political violence
   by thinking from the alterity of the other. The turn away from the
   political to the ethical does, however, lead to a problem - the third
   (le tiers) - that cannot be resolved by the ethical relation and so
   necessitates a return to the political. The political returned to is not
   the same as that left, but privileges the ethical relation and involves
   decisions about how to realize a prior norm: justice. This has given
   rise to debate in the literature regarding the relationship between the
   ethical and political that pits an oppositional account against an
   entwined one. I defend the latter, but argue that it depends upon two
   issues that are problematic for Levinas's attempted overcoming of
   ontological forms of violence. Specifically, his (1) claim that this
   form of politics entails a `good' form of violence, and (2) insistence
   that the political decision required to realize the ethically inspired
   conception of politics is compatible with his theory of substitution. I
   argue that the former undermines his claim that an ethically inspired
   politics is fundamentally different to an ontologically inspired one,
   while the political decision upon which his ethically inspired politics
   depends is incompatible with his notion of substitution.},

Abstract = {This study analyses the dynamics of causal linkages between terrorism
   and economic growth across four provinces of Pakistan using Bivariate
   and Trivariate Hsaio Granger Causality test. The empirical evidence
   reveals within country idiosyncratic causal trends; hence demonstrating
   the importance of analysing sub-national variations while determining
   the extent to which terrorism is related with other variables. The
   estimates suggest that terrorist activity Granger causes economic growth
   in Sindh, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan provinces. The reverse
   causation from economic growth to terrorism is observed in case of
   Khyber Pakhtunkhwa only. The evidence presented in this paper stresses
   the importance of taking into account higher vulnerability of
   comparatively weaker sub-national economies while formulating relevant
   policies to ameliorate negative impact of terrorism.},

Journal = {CONFLICT STUDIES QUARTERLY},

Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {In 2011, the World Bank reported that an estimated 1.5 billion people
   worldwide live in conflict-affected countries where repeated cycles of
   political and organized violence hinder development, reduce human
   security and result in massive humanitarian suffering. Out of this
   figure, the African continent is host to a significant number. Since the
   1960s, the continent has been laden with varied dimensions of conflicts,
   orchestrated by, but not limited to, border disputes, communal/ethnic
   differences and political agitations caused by her colonial origin and
   other internal trajectories. Using document analysis conducted through
   systematic review, this work identifies causes and consequences of
   conflicts in Africa and prospects for peaceful and enduring conflict
   resolution mechanism. It was also identified that the response of
   African Union and other sub-regional organizations to the intense and
   chronic nature of conflict situations in the region has, over the years,
   ranged from apathy to reliance on short-term security measures, which
   has otherwise not able to proffer lasting solutions to the conflict
   situations. It was posited that rather than rely on heavy military
   operations and response-centric approaches to conflict management, there
   is a dire need for a robust effort at good governance and people-centred
   policy reforms where socioeconomic development is accorded high priority
   to mitigate the perception of alienation and marginalization among
   various groups in African countries. Besides, appropriate institutional
   responses by African states are critical and necessary to transforming
   the volatile environment to peaceful havens, conducive for development
   and progress.},

Abstract = {Although Francisco Franco and Augusto Pinochet both died of natural
   causes (Franco in 1975 and Pinochet in 2006), and neither of them were
   put on trial for the crimes committed under their regimes, their bodies
   did not share the same fate. A comparison of these two cases reveals how
   the treatment of a perpetrator's corpse can, from the point of view of
   the international protection of human rights, constitute an obstacle to
   ending the impunity enjoyed by those responsible for the abuses.
   Conversely, the fight against that impunity can have a decisive bearing
   on the treatment applied to the remains of the deceased perpetrator. A
   close link may in fact be discerned between the fate of the corpses of
   mass criminals and the fight against impunity, along with the policy of
   commemoration, which is pursued - or not - by the state.},

Abstract = {The Eurozone crisis triggered deep political dissent in Southern Europe.
   As the crisis unfolded, citizens took massively to the streets in
   attempts to prevent austerity policies but also to call for more
   democracy. We analyze protest waves in four Southern European countries:
   Greece, Italy, Portugal, and Spain. We argue that protest events are
   reactions to austerity measures when austerity is the only game in town.
   Hence, we test the effects of elections, the presence of new
   challengers, and austerity votes on protest. We use a data set of
   protest events based on the coding of newswires covering protest in its
   different forms from 2000 to 2015. We show that protest waves took place
   in the four countries and that they reveal widespread dissatisfaction
   with austerity policies. Our article contributes to the understanding of
   the links between protest and institutional politics during the Eurozone
   crisis.},

Abstract = {The connections between Irish politicians and the private sector are the
   subject of constant speculation, particularly in the post Celtic Tiger
   period. However, there is little systematic evidence whether publicised
   cases of such ties represent the exception to the rule, or if they are
   symptomatic of a larger problem. In this paper we focus on one aspect of
   the public-private nexus and investigate whether a revolving door - the
   movement of individuals between public and private sectors - exists in
   Ireland. Using evidence from originally collected data on former TDs
   from 1989 to 2016, we find that almost one third of ex-politicians are
   in the private sector; however, many merely return to their previous
   occupations as solicitors or small business owners. Still, 11 per cent
   turn to consulting, lobbying or corporate board membership. We find that
   former cabinet ministers, the representatives of FF, PD and FG parties,
   as well as TDs who do not run and lose are more likely to join the
   corporate sector. We additionally compare former TDs with ex-officials
   in the civil service. Finally, placing Ireland in a comparative context,
   we find that the extent of the revolving door problem here is lower than
   in other democracies.},

Abstract = {This paper undertakes an analysis of the underlying presuppositions and
   terms of the international negotiations on the Iranian nuclear programme
   as covered in the mainstream Western media during 2013-14. Examining the
   deep-seated Orientalist presuppositions underlying the civilizational
   narrative through which the rivalry between the US/West and Iran is
   described, the paper argues that the notions of `nuclear
   responsibility', `international community', and `global peace' generated
   by such representations obscure global power and hierarchy. In effect,
   such a discourse ensures that Iran remains caught in the spotlight of
   dangerous nuclear transgressions while the nuclear programme of a
   normative West is rendered unremarkable.},

Pages = {293-311},
Abstract = {The purpose of this article is to examine the relationship between per
   capita income and democracy. Namely, do increases in income per capita
   affect a regime's level of democracy? The scholarly tradition has
   investigated this question over many years, and what we have learned
   about the actual association between these variables remains
   inconclusive. As opposed to producing yet another empirical analysis of
   this hypothesized relationship, this article sets forth to examine it
   via a new methodological approach. Applying the tools of meta-regression
   analysis to 33 individual empirical studies that investigate the
   relationship between income and democracy, this article finds that
   income has no statistically significant, quantitatively meaningful
   effect on democracy (understanding the latter as a graded concept). I
   also show that there is no theoretical or empirical reason to believe
   that this field of research is haunted by publication selection bias.
   Moreover, I identify a variety of systematic differences between these
   studies, that is, study heterogeneity, which explain why it is the case
   that after 60 years of research we still have not reached a consensus.},

Journal = {WEST EUROPEAN POLITICS},

Abstract = {This study investigates what impact the terrorist attacks in Paris
   (2015) and Nice (2016) had on political attitudes in France. Drawing on
   nine cross-sectional surveys, it tests the premises of three major
   theories of opinion change that predict contrasting shifts in opinion
   among ordinary citizens according to their ideological position in the
   aftermath of terrorist attacks: the Reactive Liberals Hypothesis (RLH),
   the Terror Management Theory (TMT), and the Bayesian Updating Theory
   (BUT). In line with both RLH and BUT, the findings show that left-wing
   sympathisers shifted toward the right following the attacks. However,
   the results suggest that, in line with BUT, the attacks only had a
   significant impact on attitudes toward security, while they had no
   effect on attitudes toward immigration, or toward moral and
   socio-economic issues.},

Abstract = {While the Free Speech Clause of the First Amendment prohibits government
   from imposing adverse consequences for speech it dislikes, in popular
   discourse this part of the Constitution is often referenced in an
   attempt to suppress nongovernmental criticism of controversial
   statements. To assess whether inappropriate, speech-suppressing appeals
   to the First Amendment cause intolerance of criticism or,
   unintentionally, promote tolerance of adverse responses to controversial
   statements, we employ a survey experiment and find evidence of the
   latter effect. Appeals to the Free Speech Clause that seek to suppress
   speech have the unintended consequence of increasing public tolerance
   for speech. Invoking freedom of speech is what matters, not the specific
   direction of the appeal.},

Volume = {38},

Pages = {379-407},
Abstract = {The year 2017 seemed a possible turning point for the economic, social
   and political model of the ruling party, Frente Amplio, which has
   governed Uruguay since 2005. The political and economic scenario was
   particularly sensitive for the government, both at the domestic and
   international levels. However, the year closed with unexpected economic
   growth, the improvement of some important social indicators, and the
   return of the parliamentary majorities that the Frente Amplio had lost
   in 2016. At the same time, new conflicts opened for the government,
   especially on the internal front. Among them, the process that led to
   the resignation of the Vice President of the Republic Raul Sendic, the
   negotiation processes for securing of an investment by the Finnish
   company UPM, the attempt to reform the ``Caja Militar,{''} and the
   generation of agreements for the so-called ``Ley de los
   Cincuentones.{''} For different reasons, these conflicts produced
   tensions within the Executive branch of the government, which finally
   settled over the course of the year. As has happened on other occasions,
   the Frente Amplio's internal politics were revealed as an especially
   relevant area for negotiation and decision-making related to the
   resolution of conflicts between the Executive and the governing party.},

Title = {Democratic Reform and Opposition to Government Expenditure: Evidence
   from Nineteenth-Century Britain},
Journal = {QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {13},
Number = {4},
Pages = {363-404},
Abstract = {Several theories have argued that democratic reform will lead to higher
   government spending. However, these theories have generally focused on
   expenditure on redistribution rather than expenditure on public goods.
   This paper presents a model predicting that democratization leads to
   lower government expenditure on infrastructure if the median pre-reform
   voter is middle class. This prediction is tested using a new panel data
   set of town council infrastructure spending and revenue in
   nineteenth-century Britain. An 1894 national reform implementing a
   system of ``one-household- one-vote{''} and the secret ballot is used as
   the treatment event in a difference-in-difference analysis. The results
   show that democratic reform led to lower levels of town council spending
   on public goods, including water supply and other public infrastructure,
   relative to towns that were democratized at an earlier date. In line
   with the theoretical prediction, this negative effect was strongest when
   democratic reform transferred power from the middle class to the poor.},

Abstract = {The year 2016 marked the sixtieth anniversary of the Suez crisis.
   Proposing a metaphor of a chain of hypothetical propositions, this
   article examines the construction of national interests through a case
   study of the Suez crisis. This metaphor offers a useful way to step back
   from common sense and to think of Britain's official representation of
   ``the Suez crisis{''} as numerous antecedents and consequents coupled
   together. It then enables researchers to: (1) detect each individual
   proposition hidden in plain sight through the identification of
   inference indicators; (2) examine the actual truth or falsity of each
   individual proposition; (3) see a striking parallel between the
   deduction of one proposition from another and the construction of
   national interests; and (4) apprehend why valid yet false inferences
   obtained by pure deduction could appear as incontrovertible truths even
   in the absence of empirical foundations.},

Abstract = {How have Russia's workers responded in the face of Russia's current
   economic challenges? In this article we explore changes in Russian labor
   protest over time, through the boom and bust cycles of the Russian
   economy. Relying on independent Russian databases, we examine evidence
   of a significant increase in labor protest in recent years, which also
   reveals that, despite apparent changes in the prosperous 2000s, Russian
   labor relations and protest are returning to past patterns. The protests
   are often spontaneous and their likeliness to spread stems less from
   union support than from policies that impact workers and others as a
   single category, such as the Platon road-tax system and its impact on
   truckers. Russia's truckers also illustrate the potential for economic
   protests to become politicized. In view of this potential, Russia's
   leadership appears to be reinforcing past practices such as avoiding
   mass layoffs, but such steps may harm long-term economic growth, itself
   a cause of protest.},

Abstract = {Discussions about the geopolitics of scientific knowledge usually make
   reference to science, universities and their learning models, yet today
   academic careers are rather centred on scientific publications and their
   impact. Hence the main purpose in this work is to analyse this change of
   paradigm. The articles places meditations on Southern epistemologies as
   a framework of reference from which to critically revise how science has
   traditionally defined itself and the hegemonic method for knowledge
   dissemination: scientific articles. To begin with, the article describes
   the evolution of science and how journals and impact factors have gained
   their current status. Next, the article ponders over a number of
   alternatives to the current model. It addresses the question of whether
   such alternatives widen the range of possibilities, or else deepen
   extant colonialist and elitist dynamics. Lastly, it shows why today the
   exploration of alternatives is linked to their potential for integration
   in the hegemonic system of knowledge management, while resistances offer
   strategies and practical frameworks for action that open up new
   horizons.},

Abstract = {This article draws a theoretical distinction between ``transgender{''}
   as an identity, and ``transgender{''} as a form of discrimination, in
   order to better understand the political stakes of recent and ongoing
   ``bathroom bills{''} that restrict access to sex-segregated public
   restrooms to our ``biological sex.{''} Some, but not all, transgender
   people encounter discrimination in sex-segregated bathrooms. And many
   people who do not self-identify as transgender are in fact harmed by
   this institutionalized social custom. This includes masculine-appearing
   cisgender women, feminine-appearing cisgender men, as well as all people
   who are directed to use female-designated bathrooms. I describe this
   far-reaching sexism as sex-identity discrimination. And because
   sex-segregated public restrooms, by their very nature, always prompt and
   enable this kind of discrimination, I argue that we should eliminate
   them, and use inclusive design to build no-gender public restrooms that
   meet our reasonable expectations for personal privacy and safety.},

Abstract = {This paper is intended to contribute to the widening literature on the
   complicated links between education, the state and violence. It also
   builds on previous analyses of Pakistan Studies textbooks, and utilises
   notions of citizenship to illuminate inequalities and the theoretical
   lens of cultural violence. To do this, I present an in-depth analysis of
   the Pakistan Studies Textbook for Secondary Classes used in government
   schools in Islamabad Capital Territory. This textbook analysis was
   conducted as part of a case study of one girls' secondary school in 2014
   which linked citizenship education to Galtung's 1990 violence triangle.
   I also demonstrate through classroom observations of the case study
   school the power that the textbook holds as the voice of authority in
   the classrooms in which it is used. The analysis is situated it in the
   broader historical context of the process of nation building. I
   illustrate the specific ways the textbook contributes to the narrative
   of exclusion of some Pakistanis from equal citizenship which has the
   potential to normalise violence against excluded groups.},

Title = {The Reform of the Succession to the Crown in the United Kingdom of Great
   Britain And Northern Ireland, and in the <<other Kingdoms>> of the
   Commonwealth of Nations},

Abstract = {The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland shares a
   Monarch with fifteen other Realms of the Commonwealth of Nations, in a
   phenomenon that is described as <<sixteenth separated Crowns in personal
   uinon>>. Since the 1970s or earlier reference had been made to the need
   to adapt the laws of succession to the principles of gender equality and
   religious freedom expressly or implicitly recognised in the Kingdoms at
   a constitutional level. However, reasons of expediency had resulted in
   resistance to such reforms. Amongst these are the delicate balance which
   underpins the monarchic institution, both in these States and in the
   Commonwealth as a whole, as well as the fact that three Protestant males
   are the first in line to succeed the long-living Elizabeth of Windsor.
   The engagement and subsequent marriage of the Duke and Duchess of
   Cambridge was what triggered the reform process, promoted via the Perth
   Agreement at the Conference of Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting
   (CHOMG) in October 2011. This work addresses the complexity involved in
   the reform of a corpus of legislation dating back to the 18th century
   but which has seen how with the passage of time the reality upon which
   it is projected, the British Crown, has evolved into sixteen separate
   Crowns linked to a Community of Nations formed by over 50 States, most
   of them republics. There is detailed analysts of a process in which
   questions of both political expediency and difficulties of legal
   interpretation have played their part. As will be seen, the
   socio-political and cultural particularities specific to some of the
   Realms, such as the federal realities or the uniqueness of Quebec in
   Canada, explain why the process of implementation of the aforementioned
   Agreement extended into the year 2015.},

Title = {Digital media and political opposition in authoritarian systems:
   Russia's 2011 and 2016 Duma elections},
Journal = {DEMOCRATIZATION},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {25},

Pages = {209-226},
Abstract = {The ability of authoritarian regimes to maintain power hinges, in part,
   on how well they are able to manipulate the flow of information to the
   masses. While authoritarian states have had success controlling
   traditional media, the growth of social media over the last decade has
   created new challenges for such regimes. The Russian experience offers
   an example of how an authoritarian regime responds to this potential
   threat. Because of the massive demonstrations surrounding the 2011-2012
   Duma elections, the ruling Russian government suspected that social
   media provided a significant impetus for the demonstrations. Social
   media, through its dissemination of opposition blogs, could have helped
   drive negative attitudes about the governing party. As such, the
   government responded by employing strategies to tighten their grip on
   the digital flow of information. We use survey data to demonstrate that
   exposure to blogs via social media at the time of the demonstrations led
   many to believe that the elections were fraudulent. Ultimately, we
   contend that Russian fears concerning the importance of social media for
   the fomenting of opposition movements is well grounded. Social media can
   drive support for opposition in an autocratic state.},

Title = {Utopia, Food Sovereignty, and Ethical Fashion: The Narrative Power of
   anti-GMO Campaigns},
Journal = {NEW POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {40},
Number = {4, SI},
Pages = {691-707},
Abstract = {The idea of utopia has become pervasive in the age of everyday
   humanitarianism. Digital media communicate utopian ideas that allow
   people to ``do good{''} for vulnerable others and the environment. At
   the same time, campaigns mobilize citizens by invoking apocalyptic
   images, such as genetically modified (GM) ``monster{''} foods. This
   article looks at the construction of utopian and apocalyptic narratives
   in social movement campaigns and how they contribute to the construction
   of identities in the campaigns against GM food and Bt cotton, especially
   in India. Based on an analysis of campaign material, we show that
   ``organic food{''} and ``ethical cotton{''} products would be less
   successful without the concurrent use of apocalyptic narratives.
   Narratives that are more radical enabled the anti-GM food movement to
   mobilize large resistance. By contrast, a more inclusive narrative
   approach in the cotton/textile sector risks supporting interests that
   are detrimental to social justice and environmental protection.},

Abstract = {Russia's army is considered to be a pure instrument of the state
   leadership. However, the situation is not as clear-cut. While in the
   Soviet Union, the army was subject to civilian control, under Gorbachev,
   the generals felt that they were being discredited and distanced
   themselves from politics. During the 1990s, the army played a very
   significant role in politics, but due to its deep mistrust towards
   politicians of all political persuasions it refrained aside from October
   1993 from any involvement in the battle for power between the President
   and his opponents. Only Putin succeeded in again assigning to the army
   the subordinate role that it had held during the Soviet era. However, it
   would be wrong to assume that the army blindly follows the orders of the
   civilian state leadership. With the militarisation of society
   implemented by Putin in order to increase his legitimacy, inclination
   towards insubordinate reactions among the generals has also increased.},

Abstract = {Through studies of four individuals, this article will explore the
   utility of biography as a method of disentangling strands of political
   allegiance in Northern Ireland during the era of the old Stormont'. The
   four individuals - Harry Midgley, Arthur Linden Agnew, Albert McElroy
   and Jack Hassard - are connected by progressive strands of political
   activism, Protestantism and use of Ulster-Scots or British identity to
   support their political stances. These four lives reveal much about the
   development of Northern Labour and Liberal politics, but as a collective
   biography, rather than a party or institutional history, they reveal
   much of the wider milieu of reformist Northern Protestants. Their
   diverse final political destinations highlight the tensions within this
   strand and the persistence of divisions in Northern Ireland.},

Abstract = {Institutionalizing of the personal data protection as an integral part
   of informational law and one of the main directions of national
   information policy, actualizes the issue of improvement its
   organizational and legislative framework. Above all, the state of
   information security depends on its organizational and legal support.
   Developed legislative and administrative basis optimizes the scope of
   information relations, making it tolerant to internal and external
   threats. In turn, serious legislative and organizational flaws entail
   wide range of destructive consequences. It undermine informational
   security, provoke conflicts, create preconditions for manipulation,
   abuse and harassment. From year to year, in Ukraine increases the number
   of illegal databases, the cases of unauthorized access to personal data
   systems, failures of protection personal data and the rights of its
   owners. Obviously, these trends will take place until systemic
   deficiencies in legal regulation and organizational support of personal
   data protection are eliminated. This stipulates the need for a
   comprehensive improvement of legislative and organizational support of
   personal data protection, based on the achievements of modern science,
   progressive law making and law-enforcement tendencies, best
   administrative practices in the field of informational security and

Abstract = {To the delight of Westphalian international law pluralists, recent
   decisions by national and regional courts have sharply challenged the
   authority of international organizations and tribunals. The U.S. Supreme
   Court, in Medellin (2008), rejected the power of the International Court
   of Justice (ICJ) to stick its own provisional measures in the wheels of
   Texan criminal justice. In the famous Kadi case (2008), the Court of
   Justice of the European Union (CJEU) challenged the applicability of
   Security Council anti-terrorism sanctions for their violation of
   European fundamental administrative justice rights. More recently
   (2014), the Italian Constitutional Court rejected the ICJ's decision
   requiring Italy to respect the international customary law protection of
   Germany's sovereign immunity from civil claims brought in Italian
   courts. Such national disobedience poses a challenge to the
   international constitutionalist ideal, by which state compliance with
   international law is assumed to promote human rights and the rule of
   law. But not all expressions of national disobedience to international
   law are homologous, and this paper will defend a kind of limited,
   ``civil{''} disobedience to international law, where national
   fundamental rights, ultimately international in character, are at stake.},

Abstract = {This article is a dialogue with Forst on the role of justification in
   power relations, which is theory building in its own right. The article
   starts with Forst's argument that power is a cognitive event that
   entails reason-giving. Developing this observation, the article explores
   how reasoning shifts across the four dimensions of power. How different
   types of power situations elicit different forms of justification in
   order to obtain compliance from the less powerful. This gives insight
   into the complex relationship that reason-giving has with structure,
   dominant ideology, reification, paradigms, discipline, domination and
   empowerment.},

Title = {Economic and corruption voting in a predominant party system: The case
   of Turkey},
Journal = {ACTA POLITICA},

Volume = {53},

Abstract = {Voting behavior studies have paid scarce attention to the predominant
   party system (PPS), in which one party has won three consecutive
   legislative majorities, despite the fact that nearly half of the world
   democracies have had a PPS. It is often unclear why a large portion of
   voters prefer the same party over a long period of time. We propose two
   hypotheses to address the question. First, since PPSs often thrive when
   economic performance is strong, the long-term economic success of the
   incumbent party produces a `'halo effect'' that renders voters
   insensitive to short-term economic changes. Second, voters blame the
   incumbent party for the corruption of politicians only, and not for
   bureaucratic corruption. The current Turkish government initially
   established its wide electoral support on the basis of its economic
   performance, which gave rise to a PPS in 2011. However, the Turkish
   government has been tarnished in recent years by corruption allegations,
   especially since 2013. This paper applies a three-choice multinomial
   logit model to 2014 survey data to examine voter preference between the
   incumbent party, opposition parties, and neither in Turkey under its
   PPS. The results supported both hypotheses.},

Abstract = {Since the authoritarian New Order regime ended in May 1998, human rights
   activists and survivors have campaigned for successive governments in
   Indonesia to address the needs of survivors of the 1965-1966
   anti-communist violence. The article traces the changing strategies of
   activists and survivors in this campaign. In the early democratic period
   from 1998 to 2004, Indonesian activists sought to transform ideas of
   citizenship into an inclusive one, embracing and restoring the rights of
   former political prisoners. However, Indonesian government inaction on
   past human rights abuses forced them to reconsider their strategy. It
   propelled them back to a historical practice under the New Order of
   calling on external allies, including international human rights
   organizations, to highlight the state's failure to protect citizens'
   rights. The reliance on international partners and norms, however, also
   implies accepting a limitation on the ambition of human rights activism,
   since enforcement remains in national governments' hands.},

Abstract = {Educational approaches that enable students to actively and directly
   participate in ``real-world{''} projects are increasingly recognized as
   valuable pedagogical tools and, as such, being incorporated into
   university curriculums worldwide. Though not traditionally associated
   with political science courses, project-based international service
   learning presents a tremendous opportunity to bring classroom concepts
   and theories to life, provide an active approach to addressing
   international challenges, and assist students in the development of the
   hands-on, problem-solving, team-based, critical-thinking skills that are
   increasingly important to employers across all sectors. This article
   seeks to encourage political science faculty to incorporate
   international service learning-and/or project-based approaches-into
   their educational offerings. Through examination of the course Global
   Synthesis in Liberal Arts and Engineering Studies at California
   Polytechnic State University, we have identified multiple factors that
   can help promote successful execution of project-based international
   service learning as a pedagogical tool, and provide additional
   suggestions for faculty interested in adopting specific aspects of these
   educational approaches, and/or in doing so closer to home.},

Title = {A two-step theory and test of the oil curse: the conditional effect of
   oil on democratization},
Journal = {DEMOCRATIZATION},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {25},
Number = {3},
Pages = {404-421},
Abstract = {Does oil impede democratization? This article posits that in order to
   understand the effect of oil on democratization one has to decompose the
   transition process into two steps: (1) the ending of the authoritarian
   regime, which initiates the process; and (2) the subsequent
   establishment of a democracy rather than an autocracy. I argue that oil
   has different effects on the two phases of the transition process: while
   oil has contradictory effects on the likelihood that an authoritarian
   regime fails, it diminishes the likelihood of the establishment of
   democracy following the failure. Oil's negative effect is conditional on
   the breakdown of the authoritarian regime, which itself is unaffected by
   oil. That is, although oil does not initiate the transition process, it
   does influence its outcome. Using data on 118 autocracies, I find
   evidence consistent with this hypothesis.},

Abstract = {The signing of international treaties is usually considered
   insignificant for international legal cooperation. Accordingly,
   International Relations theorists have paid it little attention. We show
   in this paper how and why treaty signature matters for the ultimate
   decision to ratify an international treaty. We argue that when multiple
   well-informed actors publicly sign an international treaty, this can
   provide a strong signal of issue importance to domestic veto players,
   and in turn may persuade them to ratify the treaty. We formalize this
   argument in a two-level signaling game, and test it on a data set of 126
   international environmental agreements. We find that treaties are more
   likely to be ratified when their signatories include countries with high
   levels of general or issue-specific knowledge.},

Title = {Schools of democracy: how trade union membership impacts political
   participation in Africa's emerging democracies},
Journal = {DEMOCRATIZATION},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {25},
Number = {1},
Pages = {158-177},
Abstract = {Trade unions in Africa have become increasingly vocal in calling
   attention to the widening socio-economic inequalities that have
   accompanied global market integration across the continent. This article
   argues that, in their quest to challenge neoliberal policies, labour
   movements have contributed to processes of democratization in Africa by
   acting as instruments of political socialization for their members.
   Using survey data from respondents in 18 African countries, this article
   demonstrates an empirical relationship between trade union membership
   and political participation. The article finds that membership in a
   labour organization increases one's propensity to participate in a range
   of political activities. Specifically, labour movements encourage
   participation by forging participatory spillover effects, which mobilize
   unionists across different arenas of the political landscape. Finally,
   the article finds that the effect of union membership on political
   participation is stronger in countries where unions maintain
   independence from ruling parties. This research contributes to
   literature on political participation across Africa and furthers our
   understanding of the role of labour movements in bottom-up processes of
   democratization on the continent.},

Title = {IN WHAT DOES LEVIATHAN DEAL? EVALUATION CRITERIA FOR STATES'
   COMPETITIVENESS ON ``SALVATION MARKETS{''}},
Journal = {POLITEIA-JOURNAL OF POLITICAL THEORY POLITICAL PHILOSOPHY AND SOCIOLOGY
   OF POLITICS},
Year = {2018},

Pages = {6-30},
Abstract = {The metaphor ``salvation markets{''} can be to some extent useful for
   understanding behavior of those actors who operate at the intersection
   of sacral and political fields, guided by their own rational logic, for
   example, states. The weakening of their soteriological function in the
   last decades can be explained by the contraction of ``salvation
   market{''} itself due to the reduction of the amount of human suffering.
   However, this contraction turned out to be only temporary. The
   restoration of demand for salvation forces states to redefine their
   strategies, oscillating between various versions of ``civil
   religion{''}, ``political religion{''}, radical laicism etc. At the same
   time, there is a toughening competition between states and other
   operators of salvation - other forms of political groups (Verbande), as
   well as traditional and non-traditional hierocratic groups (Verbande).
   Hypothetically, the degree to which citizens are ready ``to fight for
   their country{''} can serve as the evaluation criterion for states'
   competitiveness on ``salvation markets{''}. The hypothesis is supported
   by the fact that the category of the victim, which is present in one way
   or another in almost any sacral discourses and symbolical complexes,
   penetrated both discourses and mechanisms of symbolization and
   legitimation of the modern state. However, there are no intuitively
   obvious confirmations of this hypothesis in the sociological data.
   Meanwhile, a deeper analysis might help to reveal the supporting
   evidence of the hypothesis. Alternatively, there are grounds to suggest
   that further course of events will undermine altogether the efficiency
   of the ``market{''} metaphor in this context - and will call for a
   different metaphor. Most likely, it would be the metaphor of ``war{''}.},

Abstract = {Over thirty years after Africa's ``democratic experiments,{''} the
   number of registered political parties in many countries continues to
   multiply, and few such parties oppose incumbents throughout a
   presidency. These patterns challenge theories predicting that parties
   with poor electoral performance will disappear and that many remaining
   parties will rival those in government by staying outside of the
   president's electoral coalitions. Analysis of original data from elite
   interviews and archival research in Senegal shows that on an uneven
   playing field, most party leaders are primarily concerned with
   negotiating patronage; few are regular vote-seekers and fewer
   consistently oppose the ruling party in elections. Party leaders rely on
   personal resources for party-building and rarely possess the endowments
   that facilitate consistent opposition: experience as state
   administrators and international private financing.},

Abstract = {This paper uses panel survey data from 2002 to 2008 - covering a period
   of economic prosperity and intense economic difficulties - to analyse
   the impact of changing levels of economic and financial security from
   the 2008 economic crisis on individuals' environmental protection
   preferences. Declining economic conditions in the aftermath of the
   crisis have been thought to produce lower levels of support for
   environmental protection and previous literature has predominantly
   supported this claim. Due to the availability of data, most analyses
   undertaken to date have focused on aggregate changes using repeated
   cross-sectional data and various economic indicators. Research looking
   at individual-level change and how individuals' perceptions of changing
   economic conditions may affect their prioritization of environmental
   protection has however been lacking. This paper finds that neither
   changing economic perceptions nor changing household financial
   circumstances can account for the decline in environmental protection
   prioritization witnessed in the aftermath of the great recession.},

Abstract = {In political science, there is a profound tension between those who
   argue that the prediction of human behavior is possible and those who
   disagree. On the one hand, experimental methods may be able to detect
   behavioral patterns. On the other hand, events, the evolution of
   institutions, and individual behavior itself may in many cases be too
   historically contingent to be reliably predicted. Methodological
   pluralism, and a greater degree of openness to mere historical
   understanding, would therefore seem to be called for.},

Journal = {POLITIQUE EUROPEENNE},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {60},
Number = {2},
Pages = {8-33},
Abstract = {Since the 1990s, the European Social Fund (ESF) has been one of the
   European Union's main instruments of intervention in the Member States.
   Yet, the power issues underlying its local deployment remain poorly
   understood. Based on the results of their ethnographic surveys of
   departmental and regional administrations, the authors analyze the way
   in which these funds are appropriated, far from Brussels, by the agents
   in charge of their day-to-day management. Deconstructing an enchanted
   vision of ``partnership{''}, they show that the ESF feeds competitive
   strategies that help reconfigure local institutional relations. They
   also show how this process helps to redefine bureaucratic roles,
   building managerial rigor at the top of the hierarchy of legitimate
   professional competencies.},

Abstract = {It was at the beginning of the 1970s that the system of school guidance
   that we know today was constituted. The National Office for Information
   on Teaching and Professions, New Guidance Procedures, and a status for
   guidance counselors were in fact instituted between 1970 and 1973. With
   them, information, dialogue, and consultation were placed at the heart
   of the school guidance system. Nevertheless, these achievements
   coincided with the reflux led by Olivier Guichard and then Joseph
   Fontanet. This article proposes to bring out the dynamics that preside
   over the integration of the criticism of arbitrariness, expressed in
   particular during the events of May-June 1968, in the conservative
   school policy in the early 1970s.},

Abstract = {This article addresses the accession of Venezuela to Mercosur, observing
   the political conjuncture of the early 2000s, in the national, regional
   and international levels. This perspective seeks to understand the
   strategic calculation developed by president Hugo Chavez administration
   to broaden its room for maneuver in the South American context and to
   reach its goals of international insertion. Thus, the processes of
   withdrawal of the Andean Community and the approximation to Southern
   Common Market are analyzed, as well as the impulse towards the
   Bolivarian Alliance for the Peoples of Our America. The analysis is
   accompanied by an interpretation of both domestic and international
   political phenomena, which allowed for the development of aspects of
   South American regionalism.},

Journal = {POLITIX},

Abstract = {This article focuses on transformations of the work of the French Cour
   des comptes (Court of Auditors) between the 1980s and the 1990s. It
   details the evolutions of audit techniques; dismissing the old
   compliance audit, based on legal and formal criteria, members of the
   Court of Auditors gradually invented an audit based on performance. On
   its own initiative, the institution widened its missions to the
   ``evaluation of public policies.{''} Public reports focused on more
   politically sensitive issues and included recommendations. In doing so,
   actors moved the much disputed boundary between the administrative and
   the political. This case study shows that the French New Public
   Management turn can be seen as the result of structural evolutions in
   senior civil service. As a matter of fact, we claim that the attempts by
   members of the Court of Auditors to change their work can be seen as a
   ``ennoblement{''} of their profession, necessary to maintain their
   position in the context of a renewed competition within senior civil
   service.},

Abstract = {How do political parties guarantee enforcement of a clientelistic
   exchange? This research note empirically supports a catalog of
   clientelism compliance enforcement tactics. It also suggests that by
   focusing on the personalization of tactics and the constraints they
   place on individual voters, we can evaluate how intrusive these tactics
   are and further help to bridge existing instrumentalist and reciprocity
   theories of client compliance. The supporting evidence comes from
   interviews carried out with 73 elected Argentine local and provincial
   officials. How persuasive or coercive the tactics need to be to make
   clients comply with their part of the bargain has implications for our
   understanding of the legitimacy of the clientelistic bondage and our
   assessment of the roles of patrons and brokers in such exchanges.},

Abstract = {This article analyses how jihadist ideology groups discursively
   represent ``the West{''} and ``non-believers{''} in their online
   propagandamagazines. In doing so, it contributes to the field of
   Critical Terrorism Studies conceptually, by considering the voices of
   violent actors, and methodologically, by illustrating how linguistic
   tools of enquiry can advance current knowledge of jihadist ideology
   groups. Our work adopts a case study approach, focusing on the online
   magazines Inspire and Dabiq, which are part of the propaganda machinery
   of, respectively, Al-Qaeda and ISIS. The analysis reveals a number of
   similarities and differences in the discursive strategies that these
   twogroups use. On the one hand, both Inspire and Dabiq support and
   further construct an ``us versus them{''} dichotomy thatpolarises
   differences between their jihadist ideologies and those of
   Westerners/non-believers. On the other, Dabiq's discursiverepresentation
   of ``the West{''} targets a wider variety of individuals and groups of
   people and geographical locations than Inspire's. Additionally, Inspire
   places a greater focus on the pejorative construction of ``the West{''}
   than Dabiq, suggesting that Al-Qaeda places more emphasis than ISIS on
   presenting ``the West{''} as the enemy of jihad.},

Abstract = {This article develops a theory - rooted in the experience of the African
   National Congress in South Africa - to explain how, and why, a dominant
   political party is less likely to conduct orderly elections to select
   its political leadership. First, I demonstrate that canny party leaders
   - operating in the space between a divided society and a weak state -
   make an ideological turn to a congress-like political party, which is
   clever (in the short term) because it provides party leaders with an
   in-built electoral majority. It is, however, also a dangerous manoeuvre
   because it essentially endogenizes social competition for state
   resources inside the dominant party. This displacement of social
   competition away from the public sphere towards the partisan
   organization increases the likelihood of disorderly competition for
   party candidacies. Second, I demonstrate how this competition need not
   necessarily become the basis of violent competition inside the dominant
   party. The party leadership can use intra-party elections to stabilize
   competition, but only if the party invests in an organization that
   applies impartially the rules that govern the election.},

Pages = {157-173},
Abstract = {Creating and sustaining a shared sense of national identity is important
   in all societies, but it is especially crucial in societies with large
   immigrant populations. This paper uses a national public opinion survey
   collected in Australia to examine how Australians see their identity,
   and in turn to examine the consequences of these identities for views of
   immigrants and for party political support. The results confirm
   international research which shows the predominance of an ethno-national
   identity based on inherited characteristics, and a civic identity based
   on achieved characteristics. Both identities have consequences for the
   Australian public's views of immigrants - an ethno-national identity
   leading to negative views of immigrants and a civic identity leading to
   positive views. In turn, identities and views of immigrants
   significantly shape support for the major political parties, with
   parties of the left being more supportive of immigrants and parties of
   the right less so. From a public policy perspective, the results suggest
   that successive Australian governments have made only partial progress
   in generating a strong sense of civic identity within the Australian
   population.},

Abstract = {A shared identity has been shown to reduce prejudice between conflicting
   social groups. One such common national category is the `Northern Irish'
   identity which can be inclusive of both Catholics and Protestants. This
   study analyses the plenary sessions of the Northern Ireland Assembly to
   show how the national category `Northern Irish' is framed by
   politicians. Content analysis shows that it is used more often by
   centrist parties who tend to frame it positively and as part of their
   political viewpoint. There is also evidence of the instrumental use of
   this identity by unionists in line with the ingroup projection model.},

Abstract = {We argue that co-ethnicity should be significantly related to the
   decision to cast a ballot prior to Election Day. We use national survey
   data and voter registration files from Florida, Georgia, and North
   Carolina to test this extension of the co-ethnic mobilization
   literature. Our findings support the co-ethnic mobilization thesis by
   demonstrating that black voters were significantly more likely to vote
   in 2008 and 2012 than in previous elections. This effect, however, is
   smaller than the significant change toward voting prior to Election Day.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE EDUCATION},
Year = {2018},

Abstract = {Much of existing assessment and instructional design strategies revolve
   around the use of learning objectives. Learning objectives are used by
   faculty, by instructional designers, by accreditors, by assessment
   offices, and by students. But even as the use of learning objectives
   becomes more widespread, the definition and purpose have remained
   unclear. Instructional designers argue that learning objectives exist to
   provide a focused mindset for students engaging in the content, while
   faculty often view learning objectives as an administrative requirement
   that has little impact on teaching or student performance. Existing
   research on the subject is primarily normative and/or qualitative in
   nature (Harden 2002; Torrance 2007). In this article, the researchers
   seek to use empirical evidence to examine the definitions, purpose, and
   impact of learning objectives on student performance. We find that there
   is no shared understanding of definitions and purpose, and using an
   experimental design, we find that learning objective wording and use in
   the classroom does not affect student performance.},

Title = {``Stop the War on Women's Bodies{''}: Facilitating a Girl-Led March
   Against Sexual Violence in a Rural Community in South Africa},
Journal = {STUDIES IN SOCIAL JUSTICE},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {12},
Number = {2, SI},
Pages = {235-250},
Abstract = {Internationally, there is increasing recognition that girls and young
   women are engaged in various forms of resistance and activism to address
   social issues that impact their lives. However, in contexts that are
   hostile to girls and young women due to unequal gender norms, girls are
   often silenced, and activism is met with disapproval and even violence.
   Where activism does occur, the voices of girls and young women engaged
   therein are often ignored. It is for this reason that adult activists
   often team up with and support girls and young women's activism at the
   community level. In a rural community in South Africa, adult researchers
   and activists from a university worked with participating girls and
   young women to address sexual violence in the community. Within this
   collaborative project to commemorate the annual National Women's Day,
   and with the assistance of the adult researchers, the participants
   organized an awareness march against sexual violence in their community.
   This article examines this intergenerational collaboration and the role
   of adult feminists in enabling girl's voices to be heard regarding their
   experiences of sexual violence and how it might be addressed. The
   article concludes that in contexts where unequal gender norms produce
   high rates of gender-based violence, including sexual violence against
   girls and young women, girl-led activism is likely to occur with the
   support of adult activists with access to resources, and whose skills
   and relative authority gives them access to decision-makers and policy
   makers in communities and organizations.},

Abstract = {This article describes how Public Safety Organisations (PSO) come up
   against hybrid, demanding operations like terrorist attack or school
   shootings more frequently. Obtaining a realistic situation picture is
   crucial in organising the rescue operation and in minimising further
   violence. The role of PSOs' 24/7 situation centres becomes vital. In
   this paper, the authors explore how PSOs can ensure an information flow
   and a situation picture in hybrid environments. The empirical data were
   official reports and the data collected through interviews with staff at
   different PSOs. It was analysed using qualitative content analysis.
   Achieving a common operational picture involves taking account of each
   authority's needs and constraints, thereby enabling the exchange of
   relevant information between key authorities on-scene and off-scene. In
   addition, human factors play an important role in complex,
   multi-authority missions. Furthermore, the increasing role of citizens
   and social media in producing valuable information should not be
   overlooked.},

Abstract = {Understanding discourse as the special semiotic dimension of political
   reality, we consider the evolution of the practices of criticizing it.
   In other world struggle for language is regarded as entirely political.
   Initially, this approach was associated with revolutionary
   transformations (attempts to overturn the old symbolic order and create
   a new language of revolution). Then, under the influence of the
   avant-garde, there were established special forms of political practices
   that were aimed at discourse structures: anarchists tried to create an
   anti-hierarchical language; American Yippies seek to form outsidedness
   own space; in France leaders of Situationist International developed the
   practice of detournement (flipping). Only the latter turned to be
   politically successful until the present day. Under the influence of
   leftist political thought and the Avant-guard critical discourse studies
   became an academic (research) project. There are two stages of its
   development. The first is connected to criticizing discourse as a
   repressive totality (G. Marcuse, R. Bart and J. Baudrillard). Since the
   1970s. under the influence of the genealogical project of M. Foucault
   and development of interpretative and constructivist paradigms in the
   social sciences, a critical analysis of discourse increasingly focuses
   on destroying specific symbolic orders, essayist concepts, as well as
   everyday language, which, in fact, according to critical linguists,
   imbued with ideologies. Marxist ideal of ``universal liberation{''} was
   replaced by neoliberal ideal of equality, with an emphasis on the
   effectiveness of communication and human rights. Critical discourse
   studies became less ``philosophical{''} and more analytical; forms of
   critique also have changed - from external to internal and immanent.},

Title = {TRANSFORMATION OF IMAGES OF POWER AND POLITICAL LEADERS OF GREAT BRITAIN
   UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF BREXIT (On Materials of European and American
   Media, 2014-2017)},
Journal = {POLIS-POLITICHESKIYE ISSLEDOVANIYA},

Pages = {150-162},
Abstract = {The political images formed in the mass consciousness largely determine
   not only the attitude of citizens to certain political events and
   objects, but also their political behavior. Due to the fact that modern
   politics is increasingly becoming virtual, one should not underestimate
   the impact of mass communication on the formation of these images. It is
   obvious that the contextual factor, including situational changes
   occurring in the political arena both inside the country and outside it,
   is the determining factor in the content of the information that comes
   from the media and on the basis of which, accordingly, political images
   are formed in the mass consciousness. The article attempts to analyze
   the transformation of communicative images of power and political
   leaders of Great Britain under the influence of Brexit, i. e. during the
   period from 2014 to 2017. Since the main economic partners of this
   country are the United States and the European Union countries, the main
   news channels of these countries served as the source of data for the
   content analysis: American CNN and FOX News, as well as European
   Euronews and France24. According to the methodology developed at the
   Department of Sociology and Psychology of the Politics Department of the
   Lomonosov Moscow State University, a study was carried out which main
   goal was to compare the communicative images of power and political
   leaders of Great Britain in terms of strengths, weaknesses,
   attractiveness, unattractiveness, activity and passivity before and
   after Brexit. According to the results of the research, it was found
   that the image of power, regardless of the country's media affiliation,
   undergoes minor changes, which can't be said about the image of D.
   Cameron. The data obtained during this kind of research not only gives
   an idea of the actual image broadcasted by the media, but also allows us
   to identify both the psychological mechanisms of its formation and the
   limits of the influence of the media on the stable mental structures of
   citizens. In practice, such data can allow to determine those actions
   that the country needs to take to form its image and information
   strategy.},

Abstract = {The objective of this paper is to introduce, expose and analyze the
   original experience of pacifist empowerment of the Yaqui tribe of
   Sonora, Mexico; based mainly, but not only, on the expression in the
   Yaqui language ``Namalcasia{''} taken as a collective firmness which
   synthesizes and reflects its social value as an alternative peace
   practice in the face of adversity. Here we propose the use of the
   theoretical framework and the methodology of the Studies for Peace,
   specifically ``The Imperfect Paces{''}, with the axes of the so-called
   ``unitary matrix{''} proposed by Murioz and Molina (2007). The result
   reflects, according to the matrix used, that the Yaqui tribe empowers
   and builds peace, even imperfect, in the northwestern region of Mexico
   based on its cultural uniqueness and resilience, which is synthesized in
   the word ``Namakasia{''}, or firmness.},

Abstract = {Even though it was largely ignored in interventions after the 1990s
   conflict, the experience of post-World War II socialist Yugoslavia can
   offer useful directions for better understanding the ways in which

Journal = {WEST EUROPEAN POLITICS},

Volume = {41},
Number = {4, SI},
Pages = {825-845},
Abstract = {This article introduces a collection of papers devoted to the study of
   secrecy in European politics across a range of EU and national settings
   and policy domains. Academic interest in secret politics - those aspects
   of public activity intentionally concealed from the public eye - and the
   governance of secrecy - the political processes and regulatory
   frameworks governing secret keeping - is growing. This interest reflects
   technological, social and political developments that appear to signal
   the end of privacy and the rapid expansion of political secrecy in
   European multi-level settings. As a consequence, the tensions between
   democratic accountability, with its transparency requirements, and
   political secrecy, which is typically justified on grounds of
   effectiveness of state action, have become more marked and more
   politicised. Engaging with these developments, the contributions to this
   collection draw on actor- and interest-centred perspectives that focus
   on actors' motivations in secret politics; institutional perspectives
   that focus on contestation over secrecy norms; and organisational
   perspectives that emphasise the diversity of secrecy cultures. Further
   research will benefit from paying special attention to a diverse range
   of inter-institutional and inter-organisational secrecy settings; to
   political contestation over secrecy and the regulatory regimes that
   govern it; and to the refashioning of public-private secrecy
   architectures.},

Abstract = {In ``Unsettling the Privilege of Self-Reflexivity,{''}Andrea Smith
   argues that self-reflection is a deterrent to coalitional work and that
   in doing the work we will transform ourselves into coalitional beings.
   Maria Lugones, however, exposes how the ``
   do-the-work-and-the-transformation-will-follow{''} formula does not
   address the lack of motivation to do coalitional work that challenges
   one's sense of integrity as a good person. This article addresses the
   political problematic of ``self-reflection{''} among the `` relatively
   privileged{''} in feminist coalition work that requires disintegration
   of one's unified sense of being committed to resistance against all
   oppressions.},

Title = {Norm Mapping: Advancing the Study of Norms in Democracy and Security},
Journal = {DEMOCRACY \& SECURITY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {14},
Number = {4},
Pages = {389-413},
Abstract = {This article introduces a concrete method of constructivist inquiry
   called norm mapping that illuminates the social dimensions of discrete
   global security threats and advances the study of democracy and
   security. Specifically, this article uses the puzzle of incomplete
   democratization in fragile states to highlight the weaknesses of typical
   Western liberal approaches that fail to account for pre-existing
   deep-seated normative preferences. It then introduces norm mapping as a
   way to analyze and visualize the local normative landscape, providing an
   empirically grounded model of social intelligence to deepen our
   understanding of localized political norms (whether regarding political
   participation, gender equality, nuclear security culture, or government
   transparency). In doing so, norm mapping allows researchers to pinpoint
   the real social barriers to normative change and illuminates more
   reliable pathways for positive transformation. Thus norm mapping not
   only provides an improved way to theorize how political transformations
   can take place, but it also provides a practical tool to enhance policy
   efforts to encourage the embrace of positive norms such as transparency,
   accountability, and participation.},

Abstract = {In this article, Philip Sabin surveys how popular images of airpower in
   Britain, as reflected in books, films and the media, have changed over
   the past century. It argues that the British public has consistently
   focused more on the human traumas associated with airpower than on
   technology and tactics, but that the particular form of this human focus
   has varied widely over time and is still changing today.},

Abstract = {The ongoing conflict in the war on terrorism puts two emblematic modes
   of violence into sharp relief: the drone, as an ostensibly rational,
   clinical and measured weapon of war, and suicide bombings, frequently
   portrayed as the horrid deeds of fanatics. In this article, I seek to
   challenge this juxtaposition and instead suggest that both modalities of
   killing are part of the same technologically-mediated ecology of
   violence. To do this, I examine the material-semiotic assemblage of the
   drone and of the suicide bomber, paying attention to the technological
   production of each mode of violence, as well as the narratives that
   render each figure intelligible in the war on terrorism. I argue that
   the strongly divergent narratives found in Western discourse serve as a
   politically expedient sense-making device, whereby suicide bombing is
   pathologised, thereby justifying ever more intrusive violent acts with
   seemingly rational technologies like the drone. Rather than
   ``solving{''} the problem of terrorism, this creates counter-productive,
   or iatrogenic, effects, in which technological mediation escalates
   rather than diminishes cycles of violence. By way of response, I suggest
   that a better understanding of the relational nature of violence in the
   war on terrorism might be gained by reading the two not as antithetical
   figures, but instead as operating in the same technological key.},

Abstract = {Simulations are increasingly common pedagogical tools in political
   science and international relations courses. This article develops a
   classroom simulation that aims to facilitate students' theoretical
   understanding of the topic of war and peace in international relations,
   and accomplishes this by incorporating important theoretical concepts
   about the causes of war found in international relations theory into the
   design and implementation of the simulation. In addition to sharing a
   successful classroom simulation with other international relations
   instructors, the article makes two important contributions to the
   pedagogical literature on simulations. First, it shows how simulation
   design can be usefully based on the theoretical concepts and/or
   substantive problems that course instructors aim to impart to their
   students. Second, it demonstrates that it is possible to achieve
   important learning objectives with low-intensity simulations that do not
   require a big investment of time, energy, and resources.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF POLITICS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {80},
Number = {1},
Pages = {162-177},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Studies of macropartisanship exclusively focus on presidential
   performance's role in driving partisan updating. Performance may
   determine which party benefits from updating, but I propose that the
   occurrence of mass updating more so depends on whether there are changes
   to the substance of elite party divisions. The greater the change in
   what characterizes party differences in Washington the more likely a
   portion of Americans update their partisanship accordingly. In
   confirmation, mixture model estimates find a separate updating component
   within macropartisanship that does not automatically respond to party
   performance. Instead, updating significantly grows in prominence the
   more party divisions within Congress change by issue focus and
   ideological alignment. These findings extend and integrate
   macropartisanship and issue evolution studies by showing how they can
   fit together within a more general model of party coalition dynamics.},

   incentivizes the discrimination of the Ahmadiyah in Indonesia},
Journal = {CITIZENSHIP STUDIES},

Abstract = {Despite formal guarantees, minorities in new democracies often have
   difficulties securing their rights. Many scholars have focused on formal
   institutions to explain the quality and character of citizenship. In
   this paper, however, I argue that the ability of minorities to access
   the benefits and protections of citizenship is conditioned not only by
   formal guarantees, but through the clientelist networks through which
   political power is delivered. State actors will allow, or even actively
   participate in, the persecution of minority groups to win the support of
   brokers of key networks. I make this argument by looking at the
   restricted citizenship of Indonesia's Ahmadiyah community, which has
   experienced high levels of discrimination in the democratic era. Through
   a paired comparison of two districts, Bandung city and Tasikmalaya
   district, I demonstrate that the ability of Ahmadis to access their
   rights and protections was shaped by the structure of clientelist
   networks. In districts where politicians relied on the brokerage of
   individuals with anti-Ahmadiyah preferences to win political office,
   Ahmadis had more difficulty accessing the rights and protections
   provided by formal citizenship.},

Abstract = {This paper views cease-fires as being multifaceted with the potential
   for having diverse consequences for rebel governance development. It
   uses the February 2016 cease-fire for Syria as a lens through which to
   examine the interplay of order and violence at the national level on the
   development of local governance institutions in Syria's southern Dara'a
   province. It argues that cease-fires do not simply end or freeze
   hostilities but rather are political instruments that recalibrate
   complex systems of layered governance.},

   ISSUES},
Journal = {POLITICKE VEDY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {21},
Number = {4},
Pages = {162-177},
Abstract = {The Polish society is currently in the process of changes. These
   transformations are caused above all by socio-demographic changes that
   affect the overall shape of Polish society. These changes concern, among
   others: declines in the number of newly concluded marriages, an increase
   in the number of divorces, the use of alternative forms of marital
   family life (single), a decline in births and the phenomenon of
   depopulation. Demographers, economists and sociologists have noticed
   that demographic changes also result from the growing educational and
   professional aspirations of young people, especially women.
   (Introductory statement) Therefore, this article presents the
   socio-demographic changes affecting the basic social cell that is family
   in contemporary Polish society, and therefore the aim is to analyze the
   most important indicators of socio-demographic changes in Poland,
   including, among others: indicators of decline in births, average age of
   birth of the first child by women, the phenomenon of depopulation, being
   of professionally active by women. (Objective) The dynamics of
   socio-demographic changes of the Polish society has been studied in a
   wide range taking into account both Polish and European statistical
   data. (Scope) The results show that Polish society is an aging
   population, struggling with the problem of the lack of generational
   replacement, with the delayed procreative decisions, the increase in the
   popularity of alternative forms of marital-family life and low birth
   rates. (Findings) The reasons are also to be found in the deepening of
   globalization processes and in European integration, as well as in a big
   development of new technologies like the Internet, in the cultural
   amalgamation resulting from the collision of different civilizations,
   changing lifestyles, and finally in the economic crisis of the end of
   the first decade of the 21st Century. All of those causes contributed to
   the emergence of a new shape of the Polish state and Polish society.

Abstract = {Political protests constitute a major concern to authoritarian regimes.
   Existing research has argued that they indicate a lack of regime
   legitimacy. However, empirical evidence on the relationship between
   legitimacy and protest participation remains rare. Based on new survey
   data from Morocco and Egypt, this study investigates whether legitimacy
   played a significant role in student mobilization during the 2011
   uprisings. In doing so, we first develop a context-sensitive concept of
   legitimacy. This allows us to differentiate the ruler's legitimacy
   claims and the citizens' legitimacy beliefs. Furthermore, we distinguish
   between two different objects of legitimacy: the broader political
   community and specific regime institutions. Our empirical analysis
   suggests that legitimacy had an independent and significant impact on
   students' protest participation, yet in more nuanced ways than generally
   assumed. While protest participation was driven by nationalist
   sentiments in Egypt, it was motivated by dissatisfaction with the
   political performance of specific regime institutions in Morocco.},

Abstract = {This article analyses the impact of the main cleavages - ideological and
   identity-present in the Basque electoral competition for the 2012 and
   2016 elections, in order to establish these cleavages as an intermediate
   way between those theoretical developments that indicate the general
   preeminence of some of the dimensions for all political formations. For
   that purpose, we address these elections through the spatial theory of
   voting, by using binary logistic regression models. This has allowed us
   to know the unequal weight given by each of the electorates of the
   different political formations to these cleavages. Additionally, for the
   2016 elections we have been able to demonstrate the existence of
   opposing voting patterns, in such a way that the voters of the non-state
   parties tend to prioritize the ideological dimension as a
   differentiating element; while the voter of the state formations gives
   greater weight to the nationalist variable, specifically to the
   nationalism developed by its main competitor in the alternative
   dimension.},

Abstract = {Leadership in human rights was added to the `engagement policy' in
   Norway's foreign policy from the late 1970s, and the country emerged as
   a supporter of initiatives to draft new human rights treaties. This
   paper compares Norwegian participation in the drafting of three key
   human rights treaties in the 1980s in order to examine the significance
   of its dualist legal system in contributions to these efforts. Based on
   parliamentary negotiations, archival materials of the ministries
   involved, and private papers, the article argues that Norway's dualist
   legal system, as practised at the time, enabled the government to ratify
   human rights treaties quickly and also informed the state's disposition
   towards different human rights projects long before any ratification
   took place. In other words, it facilitated impulses to pursue
   ideologically and politically desirable projects under the rubric of
   international legal norms.},

Abstract = {Democratization of the formerly communist states of Central Europe took
   place during the ``third wave of democratization{''} (Huntington). It
   was a remarkably orderly process, resulting in the establishment and
   consolidation of new democratic systems. In this respect Central Europe,
   mostly because of its cultural identity as part of the Western
   civilization, differed positively from most of the former Soviet
   republics and from the Balkans. Recently, however, new authoritarian
   regimes, based on free election but abolishing the rule of law, have
   been established in Hungary and Poland, mostly due to the
   dissatisfaction of the poorer strata with the effects of system
   transformation.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF ELECTIONS PUBLIC OPINION AND PARTIES},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {28},
Number = {4},
Pages = {443-466},
Abstract = {Do far-left political parties influence the level of Euroskepticism
   among mainstream political parties within that same party system? This
   study seeks to address this question by building on previous work that
   has examined the effect of both far-left and far-right Euroskeptic
   parties on mainstream party positions regarding the EU. We theorize that
   when far-left parties place an emphasis on state control over the
   economy, mainstream parties in the same party system are less supportive
   of the EU. To test our theoretical expectations, we use data from the
   Comparative Manifestos Project in 25 EU member states from 1958 through
   2015. The analysis indicates support for the hypothesis that when
   far-left parties place greater emphasis on a need for state control of
   the economy, mainstream parties in that party system are more
   Euroskeptic. Our findings have important implications for understanding
   the nature of political party dynamics both generally, and more
   specifically in the European Union.},

Abstract = {There is an influential group within the Polish right wing that regards
   itself as the avantgarde of a conservative revolution. Its ideology and
   rhetoric are reminiscent of the `conservative revolutionaries' in
   Germany after the First World War. Like them, these Polish right-wingers
   characterise themselves as pioneers in the fight against liberalism and
   parliamentary democracy, against western civilisation and its allegedly
   corruptive influence on the state and national culture. Its goal is to
   renew the `national spirit', or `Volksgeist', in the traditions of the
   nobility during the early modern period and romantic messianism. The
   fact that the `conservative revolutionaries' prepared the ground during
   the Weimar era for the racial madness of the National Socialists should
   serve as a warning example to Poland.},

Abstract = {The post-crisis environment has seen a number of poignant developments
   over the nature of political and economic continuity. As austerity
   policies have emerged, a wide collection of resistance has grown which
   has been marked by civil and political demonstration. The result has
   been the emergence of a number of different positions from both the left
   and the radical right which have sought to challenge the centrist
   political management of the crisis. Following earlier work on the nature
   of such resistance (Worth in Resistance in the age of austerity. Zed
   Books, London, 2013b), this article argues that its fragmented nature
   has led to the failure of the left to develop a coherent alternative to
   austerity. It also highlights how some Eurosceptic positions on the
   right have emerged in such a way that they either have followed the Tea
   Party in advocating a far more market centrist neoliberal position (such
   as UKIP in Britain) or have looked to side-line economic issues with a
   reactionary pursuit of anti-multicultural issues. By using a Gramscian
   understanding of hegemony, the article suggests oppositional groups have
   lacked a form capable of mustering a successful `war of position' in
   challenging austerity. As a result, the main principles of neoliberal
   governance - market generated growth, deregulation, fiscal prudency -
   which were seen as untenable in 2008, have re-emerged through the guise
   of austerity and debt management. Indeed, it can be suggested that
   neoliberalism has actually consolidated its hegemonic position due to
   greater debates both on the role that state should play in bailouts and
   on the fact that through austerity, neoliberalism appears able to
   survive periods of crisis.},

Abstract = {We analyze the scope of Axel Honneth's theory of recognition as a
   critical theory of contemporary capita-society. Towards that end, We
   show how the theory of recognition articulates with the immanent
   critique of society, and how Honneth attempts to bridge the gaps in the
   program of the first Frankfurt School. Next, it is shown that the moment
   of ``intramundane transcendence{''}, distinguished by Honneth, is
   constituted by a political subject that is determined neither by its
   class condition nor by its location within the so-called ``new social
   movements{''}. With this, the ``society of contempt{''} and the
   corresponding struggle for recognition do not necessarily find their
   referents in the social struggles that occur in the contexts of advanced
   capitalist society. Finally, we analyze the scope of the theory of
   recognition in relation to the emancipatory objectives raised in the
   first generation of the Frankfurt School.},

Abstract = {Dutch Turks attracted international attention in March 2017 when
   hundreds protested the expulsion of a Turkish cabinet minister from the
   Netherlands - epitomizing the scale to which Turkey and European Union
   countries could play off tensions within diaspora communities. The
   dominant discourse in the Netherlands surrounding discussions of
   identities and political preferences of Dutch Turks has focused on the
   ``long arm of Ankara{''} and Dutch Turks acting under its influence.
   However, this nearsighted discourse fails to take into account decades
   of multicultural integration policies and the grievances that have
   pushed Dutch Turks to seek belonging in their Turkish identity. Even in
   light of these events, there is little creative thinking in terms of
   developing a new approach to integration that is more consistent with
   Dutch and Turkish experiences.},

Abstract = {While many scholars have studied how right-wing populist parties (RWPP)
   have recently increased their vote shares in national elections in many
   countries, fewer studies have assessed why some sub-national regions
   favor RWPP more than others. Addressing this gap in the literature, we
   analyze regional variation in voter support for one of Europe's most
   successful RWPP, the Front National (FN) Party of France which recently
   made it to the second round of France's 2017 presidential elections. Our
   research design examines electoral results across French regions between
   1992 and 2017 through the lens of four case studies analyzing regions
   where the FN has been consistently popular, gained in popularity,
   declined in popularity, and been consistently unpopular. Comparing these
   diverse regional cases, our study concludes that regional unemployment,
   urban support, and to a lesser degree past voting behavior are
   significant demand-side factors behind regional voting for right wing
   populism.},

Abstract = {A vast literature shows that voting for the winning party in elections
   boosts satisfaction with democracy. But in many list PR systems, voters
   do not only vote for a party, they can also vote for candidates within
   parties. Yet, we know very little about how such votes affect voters'
   satisfaction with democracy. In this paper, we analyse pre and
   post-election panel survey data from Belgium, in which we asked
   respondents to report their vote choice for parties and for candidates.
   The main finding is that casting a preference vote for a winning
   candidate makes little difference, as party-list voters are those with
   the largest increase in satisfaction with democracy. Such a finding is
   very important as reforms that increase voters' opportunities to vote
   for candidates within list have multiplied recently, and many of these
   reforms have been justified as being in line with voters' demand for
   more candidate centred electoral systems.},

Journal = {AMERICAN POLITICAL THOUGHT},

Volume = {7},

Month = {WIN},
Abstract = {In recent years, a growing scholarly literature has considered the
   presidency's unilateral powers by examining under what circumstances
   presidents act alone to achieve their policy ends. This article seeks to
   extend this literature by examining John Tyler's unique presidency.
   Lacking an electoral mandate, congressional support, and a political
   party, Tyler was completely isolated from institutional supports and
   forced to rely exclusively on his presidential powers; however, despite
   this disadvantageous position, he achieved many of his initiatives.
   Tyler therefore provides a least likely case study for evaluating
   Howell's unilateral presidency model that a strong Congress diminishes
   unilateral presidential power and a weak Congress enhances it. Using
   Tyler as an example also allows us to temporally extend the unilateral
   literature into the nineteenth century with an understudied president.
   In comprehensively observing Tyler's administration, we see the extent
   and limits of what an embattled president relying only on his own
   authority can accomplish.},

Abstract = {A ``walk up{''} survey conducted in the city of Caen between the two
   rounds of the 2017 French presidential election shows that more than one
   elector in six would like to have changed their first-round vote. Some
   voters faced a dilemma between strategic and expressive voting. The
   analysis of their motivation reveals that both types of regrets were
   present: many respondents wished that they had voted more strategically,
   and just as many wished that they had voted less strategically. Many
   participants also considered that they would rather have cast a blank
   vote in the first round rather than choosing a particular candidate.},

Abstract = {Although significant research has been conducted on economic voting in
   gubernatorial elections, very few explore the impact of state fiscal
   conditions in these elections. The little that has been done yields
   conflicting results regarding the effects of state spending and found
   that governors are not held responsible for a state's overall fiscal
   health. Our study examines the impact of spending and fiscal health on
   gubernatorial elections from 1982 to 2013. We find evidence that voters
   reward incumbent parties for fiscal health and spending growth and that
   unified government and stronger executive budget powers enhance fiscal
   accountability for these outcomes. These findings contradict previous
   research that suggests voters punish one or both parties for higher
   spending. We conclude by discussing the implications of this research
   for the debate about the balance of powers between the executive and
   legislative branches.},

Abstract = {This essay attempts to elaborate a political theory of capital's
   violence. Recent analyses have adopted Karl Marx's notion of the
   ``primitive accumulation of capital{''} for investigating the forcible
   methods by which the conditions of capital accumulation are reproduced
   in the present. I argue that the current scholarship is limited by a
   certain functionalism in its theorization of ongoing primitive
   accumulation. The analytic function accorded to primitive accumulation,
   I contend, can be better performed by the concepts of ``capital-positing
   violence{''} and ``capital-preserving violence.{''} In coining these new
   concepts, I first refine the conceptual core of primitive accumulation
   as the coercive capitalization of social relations of reproduction,
   which falls into sharpest relief in the violent history of colonial
   capitalism. I then elucidate this conceptual core with reference to Carl
   Schmitt's account of European colonial expansion and Walter Benjamin's
   reflections on law-making and law-preserving violence. The resultant
   concepts of capital-positing and capital-preserving violence, I
   conclude, can illuminate both the historical and the quotidian
   operations of the politico-juridical force that has been constitutive of
   capitalism down to our present moment.},

Abstract = {The United Nations Security Council's targeted sanctions seek to protect
   global peace and security. The majority of these sanctions are imposed
   on individuals deemed to be a terror threat and include measures such as
   asset freezes and travel bans. These measures can impede, inter alia,
   the right to private life and freedom of movement of targeted
   individuals. While it is accepted that certain rights can be restricted
   for the protection of public security, restrictions must be proportional
   under international human rights law. Given that UN sanctions regimes
   have come under scrutiny in recent years for their lack of procedural
   safeguards and disproportionate restrictions on fundamental rights, this
   article argues that proportionality based reasoning should be included
   in sanctions committees' substantive decision-making processes. Other
   procedural safeguards should also be incorporated by UN sanctions
   committees. This would help ensure that sanctions are more measured and
   minimise impairment of human rights.},

Abstract = {In the era of technology, Islamic State has shown that it is be able to
   link the radical reading of Islam with the modernity of the internet and
   social media to increase its scope of influence to all borders of the
   world. The social networks were very significant medium for Daesh.
   This article targets as its main concern, to analyze deeply the global
   strategy of ``Islamic State{''} (IS) for recruitment of foreign warriors
   by looking at the methods through which the outstanding plan is carried
   out. It tries also to elaborate the communication strategy of the
   Islamic State besides the contents of the messages which have been
   broadcasted. By borrowing Malet's conceptions, the paper schemes its
   theoretical bases and by relying on the own Islamic State sources, it
   tries to find and elaborate the required data.},

Title = {It Runs in the Family: A Study of Political Candidacy Among Swedish
   Adoptees},
Journal = {POLITICAL BEHAVIOR},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {40},

Abstract = {What motivates citizens to run for office? Recent work has shown that
   early life parental socialization is strongly associated with a desire
   to run for office. However, parents not only shape their children's
   political environment, they also pass along their genes to those same
   children. A growing area of research has shown that individual
   differences in a wide range of political behaviors and attitudes are
   linked to genetic differences. As a result, genetic factors may confound
   the observed political similarities among parents and their children.
   This study analyzes Swedish register data containing information on all
   nominated and elected candidates in the ten parliamentary, county
   council, and municipal elections from 1982 to 2014 for a large sample of
   adoptees and their adoptive and biological parents. By studying the
   similarity in political ambition within both adoptive and biological
   families, our research design allows us to disentangle so-called
   pre-birth factors, such as genes and pre-natal environment, and
   post-birth factors like parental socialization. We find that the
   likelihood of standing as a political candidate is twice as high if
   one's parent has been a candidate. We also find that the effects of
   pre-birth and post-birth factors are approximately equal in size. In
   addition, we test a number of potential pre- and post-birth transmission
   mechanisms. First, disconfirming our expectations, the pre-birth effects
   do not seem to be mediated by cognitive ability or leadership skills.
   Second, consistent with a role modeling mechanism, we find evidence of a
   strong transmission in candidacy status between rearing mothers and
   their daughters.},

Abstract = {Why do state legislators vote the way they do? Which influence is
   predominant: ideology, party, or public opinion? The implementation
   votes surrounding the Affordable Care Act (ACA) provides a unique
   setting to examine this question, as they make all three considerations
   highly salient. State roll call votes on ACA implementation were
   sometimes polarized and sometimes unexpectedly bipartisan. What accounts
   for the heterogeneity in individual legislator behavior on bills
   implementing the ACA at the state level? Using new data on legislator
   ideology and votes from 2011-2015, I show evidence that legislator
   ideology was by far the most important predictor of voting on
   implementation votes, far more so than legislator party or public
   opinion. Moreover, I show the influence of ideology is heterogeneous by
   issue area and bill.},

Volume = {19},

Abstract = {The presence of cross-institutional partisan links between the Council
   and the European Parliament is a key feature of bicameral law-making in
   the European Union. However, assessing the conditions under which
   national parties can and do influence `their' Members of the European
   Parliament is complicated by a lack of measurements of the national
   interest at stake. Analysing the Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation
   and Restriction of Chemicals regulation, this article shows that
   national parties represented in the Council only seek to influence
   `their' Members of the European Parliament when the national interest at
   stake is sufficiently large and, more importantly, when a legislative
   deal has been struck. These findings have implications for our
   understanding of legislative politics in the European Union and the
   relationship between Members of the European Parliament, European
   Parliamentary Groups and the Council.},

Abstract = {We examine some problematic narratives in the American international
   relations scholarship on Russia, focusing on some implicit assumptions
   about the drivers of Russian foreign policy. Most prominently, this
   includes the idea that Russian foreign policy is driven primarily by the
   qualities of its internal regime. While domestic institutions
   undoubtedly matter, we argue that two other factors are key for
   understanding Russia's foreign policy: the pursuit of primacy in its
   immediate neighborhood, and the pursuit of peer recognition with major
   Western powers. These imperatives are key for understanding Russian
   behavior abroad, transcend particular leaders and domestic institutions,
   and can help explain ``unexpected{''} shifts in Vladimir Putin's foreign
   policy that domestic explanations tend to miss.},

Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Rationality is an enduring topic of interest across the disciplines and
   has become even more so, given the current crises that are unfolding in
   our society. The four books reviewed here, which are written by
   academics working in economics, political science, political theory and
   philosophy, provide an interdisciplinary engagement with the idea of
   rationality and the way it has shaped the institutional frameworks and
   global political economy of our time. Rational choice theory has
   certainly proved to be a useful analytic tool in certain contexts, and
   instrumental reason has been a key tenet of human progress in several
   periods of history, including the industrial revolution and the
   modernity that emerged in the nineteenth century. Given the complexity
   of our current challenges, however, is it time to ask whether this
   paradigm might be better complemented by more holistic and heterodox
   approaches?},

Abstract = {This article attempts to trace the consequences of the death of Man to
   think, from there, the so-called ``animal question{''} from the
   post-nietzschean perspectives opened by Rosi Braidotti, Judith Butler
   and Jacques Derrida. In this sense I argue that ``the animal{''} is a
   strategic trope to dismantle the human device that places certain bodies
   in positions of precariousness, resulting in lives that can be excluded
   to guarantee the maintenance of the political community. Hence, it is
   fundamental to understand the fictional and historical character of Man,
   in order to operate a critical deconstruction of its regulatory norms,
   opening the space to various possible modes of resistance. The animality
   emerges then as a place of dislocation in front of the devices of power
   that spill over the forms of life and codify them within certain
   categories.},

Abstract = {Workers face a common dilemma when exercising their right to strike. For
   the worst-off workers to go on strike with some reasonable chance of
   success, they must use coercive strike tactics like mass pickets and
   sit-downs. These tactics violate some basic liberties, such as contract,
   association, and private property, and the laws that protect those
   liberties. Which has priority, the right to strike or the basic
   liberties strikers might violate? The answer depends on why the right to
   strike is justified. In contrast to liberal and social democratic
   arguments, on the radical view defended here, the right to strike is a
   right to resist oppression. This oppression is partly a product of the
   legal protection of basic economic liberties, which explains why the
   right to strike has priority over these liberties. The radical view thus
   best explains why workers may use some coercive, even lawbreaking,
   strike tactics.},

Abstract = {The aim of this article is to offer an interpreted reconstruction of the
   main political-theoretical undertaking of Etienne Tassin (1958-2018),
   his theory of cosmopolitics, as a political philosophy of the present.
   For this, we shall analyze his main productions as well as the public
   interventions he has upheld in recent years on the critical situation of
   migrants in Pas-de-Calais, France. Our argument will follow three steps:
   first, we will restore the author's diagnosis of our age ({''}Analytic
   of wordlessness{''}); second, we will expose the theoretical development
   he offers as a response to that diagnosis ({''}Typology of
   cosmopolitism{''}); and third, we will intend to shed light on the
   horizon of action towards which he projected his political philosophy of
   the present ({''}A philosopher in the jungle: Etienne Tassin's
   paradox{''}).},

Abstract = {This paper proposes a definition of populism from the distinction made
   by Karl R. Popper between the concepts of open and closed society,
   considering globalization as a new formulation of the open society and
   populism as a new reaction to the closed society. Popper conceives the
   open society as a tolerant and pluralist one, whereas the dosed society
   is the opposite and tends to take place as a response to the first one.
   For Popper, the closed society has taken various forms throughout
   history, including both the platonic aristocratic reaction to the
   Athenian democracy and the Nazi totalitarianism reaction to Weimar
   democracy. It is here argued that it is possible to define populism
   based on the three elements that characterize dosed societies according
   to Popper: historicism, collectivism and anti-rationalism. Populism can
   be understood as a political ideology opposed to liberal democracy,
   which arises as a response to some consequences of the development of
   contemporary liberal democratic societies, particularly as a reaction to
   the phenomenon of globalization. Taking globalization as the
   contemporary open society, populism can thus be defined as the current
   closed society.},

Abstract = {Political careers are a classic subject of elite studies. Scholars have
   sought to understand what affects political profiles and career
   patterns' formation. However, political career research is characterized
   by a variety of approaches and explanations, which often do not
   communicate each other. A framework that integrates existing
   contributions is lacking, and this undermines the process of
   accumulation of knowledge. A comprehensive assessment of the literature
   is necessary in view of this potentially welcomed undertaking. After a
   conceptual introduction, I provide here a general overview of the
   approaches used in political career research, classifiable into two main
   schools. It is stressed their theoretical arguments, methodological
   strategies, and deficits. The note will provide bases for developing
   further the research field, by underling epistemological, theoretical,
   and methodological lessons.},

Abstract = {Drawing on a unique data set that combines legislative behaviour data
   and electoral results at two elections in Romania (2008, 2012) and one
   in Hungary (2014), the study assesses the overall electoral value of
   parliamentary questions dealing with local issues. Our multivariate
   regression analyses illustrate that the effect of constituency questions
   is distinguishable from that of the overall parliamentary effort of the
   MPs. Constituency questions brought Romanian MPs significantly more
   votes at each of the last two elections. In Hungary, where the scope for
   a personal vote was much more limited at the analysed elections, no
   effect is found.},

Abstract = {We investigate the impact of globalization on electoral outcomes in 15
   Western European countries over 1988-2007. We employ both official
   election results at the district level and individual-level voting data,
   combined with party ideology scores from the Comparative Manifesto
   Project. We compute a region-specific measure of exposure to Chinese
   imports, based on the historical industry specialization of each region.
   To identify the causal impact of the import shock, we instrument imports
   to Europe using Chinese imports to the United States. At the district
   level, a stronger import shock leads to (1) an increase in support for
   nationalist and isolationist parties, (2) an increase in support for
   radical-right parties, and (3) a general shift to the right in the
   electorate. These results are confirmed by the analysis of
   individual-level vote choices. In addition, we find evidence that voters
   respond to the shock in a sociotropic way.},

Abstract = {To what extent do political campaigns mobilize voters? Despite the
   central role of campaigns in American politics and despite many
   experiments on campaigning, we know little about the aggregate effects
   of an entire campaign on voter participation. Drawing upon inside
   information from presidential campaigns and utilizing a geographic
   research design that exploits media markets spanning state boundaries,
   we estimate the aggregate effects of a large-scale campaign. We estimate
   that the 2012 presidential campaigns increased turnout in highly
   targeted states by 7-8 percentage points, on average, indicating that
   modern campaigns can significantly alter the size and composition of the
   voting population. Further evidence suggests that the predominant
   mechanism behind this effect is traditional ground campaigning, which
   has dramatically increased in scale in the last few presidential
   elections. Additionally, we find no evidence of diminishing marginal
   returns to ground campaigning, meaning that voter contacts, each likely
   exhibiting small individual effects, may aggregate to large effects over
   the course of a campaign.},

Abstract = {Remittances-money migrant workers send back home-are the second largest
   source of international financial flows in developing countries. As with
   other sources of international finance, such as foreign direct
   investment and foreign aid, worker remittances shape politics in
   recipient countries. We examine the political consequences of
   remittances by exploring how they influence antigovernment protest
   behavior. While recent research argues that remittances have a
   pernicious effect on politics by contributing to authoritarian
   stability, we argue the opposite: Remittances increase political protest
   in nondemocracies by augmenting the resources available to potential
   political opponents. Using cross-national data on a latent measure of
   antigovernment political protest, we show that remittances increase
   protest. To explore the mechanism linking remittances to protest, we
   turn to individual-level data from eight nondemocracies in Africa to
   show that remittance receipt increases protest in opposition areas but
   not in progovernment regions.},

Abstract = {This Essay describes the gap between the rhetoric and the reality of
   preferences for small business in the 2017 tax legislation. In the
   effort to shape public opinion on the legislation, proponents frequently
   highlighted the benefits for small businesses while often eliding the
   much larger benefits for large businesses and the wealthiest
   individuals. This strategic framing follows a recognizable historic
   pattern whereby tax benefits for the rich are sold to the public through
   a rhetoric emphasizing benefits lower down the economic ladder.},

Volume = {53},
Number = {4, SI},
Pages = {542-568},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {In referendums on issues of European integration, it is often unclear
   how important attitudes toward Europe are and whether these attitudes
   change during the campaign. Extant research showing the importance of EU
   attitudes particularly in salient and contested referendums has often
   had to rely on static data and limited conceptualizations of EU
   attitudes. This potentially underestimates the role of ( different types
   of) EU attitudes and hampers the ability to assess the dynamics of them.
   For the analysis of dynamics in EU attitudes, we mainly rely on pre -
   and post-waves for the Dutch Ukraine-European Union Association
   Agreement referendum, which extends a panel study leading back to the
   EP14 elections. This allows us to assess both long-term changes of EU
   attitudes since the last EP elections and also during the referendum
   campaign. We examine the effect of campaign-induced attitude changes for
   the referendum vote, while controlling for other relevant determinants.
   Our findings first show significant changes in EU attitudes during the
   referendum campaign, and second, highlight the relevance of some of
   these changes for the referendum vote. Both strengthening and especially
   emotional attitudes play respective significant roles, with the latter
   being in part dependent on media exposure.},

Abstract = {Minozzi and Volden advance the idea that a substantial portion of
   partisan voting activity in Congress is a simple call to unity that is
   especially easily embraced by ideological extremists. If correct,
   Minozzi and Volden's findings should extend from the House to the
   Senate, despite differences in institutional structures and in tools at
   the disposal of party leaders across the two chambers. We adapt the
   theory and measurement of party calls to the Senate. In so doing, we
   find that both the House and the Senate have relied heavily (and
   increasingly) on party calls over the past four decades. In the Senate
   in particular, the lens of party calls opens new opportunities for
   scholars to explore partisan legislative behavior. We take advantage of
   one such opportunity to show how electoral concerns limit senators'
   responsiveness to party calls, depriving party leaders of support for
   their agenda items.},

Abstract = {The new world system endowed the biggest semi-peripheral countries, most
   notably India, with a special role. Along with China, India appears to
   be transforming into a specific subsystem of international relations
   where both Asian giants can become competitors to the United States in
   the struggle for leadership. In this sense, history is repeating itself,
   with rivals appearing at the periphery. The international community
   still does not recognize India's status as a global power. Its
   realpolitik is still poor and the country follows a balancing strategy
   dating from the bipolar era. However, the Indo-Pacific region is a key
   direction of Indian foreign policy and it is deepening engagement with
   East Asia, thus making it easier to analyze the national interests of
   the country, its limits and opportunities, and the state of cooperation
   or contradiction with such global actors as the United States and China.
   The Asia-Pacific is also a vital region for Russia's national interests,
   but Moscow's political and economic presence is thus far more
   declarative than real. India is a natural and objective ally of the
   Russian Federation. However, the joint activities of India and Russia in
   the Indo-Pacific will be limited, primarily due to their different
   approaches toward relations with China.},

Abstract = {This research explores voter preferences in the multi-dimensional policy
   space of the 2015 UK general election, as well as the influence of those
   preferences on vote choice. In our original pre-election survey, we
   apply a conjoint experimental design where we use actual party
   manifestos to examine voters' policy preferences across five main policy
   domains. This design allows us to both identify voters' sincere
   preferences, as estimated by their responses to hypothetical policy
   packages, and to reveal the influence of these preferences on voter
   support in the actual election. Our analysis reveals a considerable
   level of congruence between voters' underlying policy preferences and
   their vote choice in the 2015 election. Our results also speak to the
   previous literature on policy preferences and vote choice by
   demonstrating that voters not only weigh the importance of particular
   policy domains differently, but also have clear preferences regarding
   specific policy positions in a given domain, which eventually influence
   their support for a party in the election.},

Abstract = {After a long decline in membership in political parties across Western
   democracies, parties in the UK have seen an upsurge, especially in young
   members. Surprisingly, few studies have explored young members of
   political parties. This article addresses this gap and examines the
   following: Who are the young party activists? What do they think about
   politics? What are their motivations for political participation? This
   article draws on a unique dataset of activists in the three main parties
   youth factions in the UK. It finds that the youth faction activists have
   very similar socioeconomic backgrounds, perceive themselves to be
   politically effective and hold quite positive views about politicians.
   The analysis also shows that these young people do not consider their
   youth faction to be the only way for them to influence politics and are
   not self-interestedly motivated-that is, joining to begin or advance a
   political career. Finally, the article proposes improvements as to how
   political parties, and their youth factions, engage with young people in
   order to secure their future viability.},

Abstract = {Since the outbreak of the Ukraine crisis, the world has observed a
   comprehensive Russian political warfare, which has had destabilising
   consequences and as well as wide-ranging implications for international
   security, in particular for Europe. On the other hand, in the aftermath
   of the Cold War, the West mostly focus on public diplomacy and strategic
   communication rather than political warfare. This change creates a gap
   in all features of political warfare and makes the West weak to
   political warfare waged by particularly one-man ruled states. In this
   respect, firstly, I will define political warfare in the continuum of
   peace and war. Then, I will develop a new conceptual framework which
   provides an interdisciplinary approach to understand the specifics of
   political warfare against the West and its counteractions. To explore
   how and why the West has failed in countering and undermining political
   warfare employed by especially one-man ruled states, I will explain the
   origin and evolution of Russian political warfare and particularly
   highlight the Ukraine Crisis as a turning point of Russian political
   warfare which has been evolving since the 1900s. Finally, I will propose
   ways and means to explain how to counter political warfare using hybrid
   tactics in the future.},

Journal = {BRITISH JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE},

Volume = {48},

Pages = {929-952},

Abstract = {This article argues that public opinion regarding the legitimacy of
   income differences is influenced by actual income inequality. When
   income differences are perceived to be high, the public thinks of larger
   income inequality as legitimate. The phenomenon is explained by the
   system justification motivation and other psychological processes that
   favor existing social arrangements. Three experiments show that personal
   experiences of inequality as well as information regarding
   national-level income inequality can affect which income differences are
   thought of as legitimate. A fourth experiment shows that the system
   justification motivation is a cause of this effect. These results can
   provide an empirical basis for future studies to assume that the public
   reacts to inequality with adapted expectations, not increased demands
   for redistribution.},

Abstract = {Donald Trump entered office with aspirations for transformational policy
   change, much of which would have to be approved by Congress. Despite the
   president's many unique characteristics, we can employ the framework of
   the president's strategic position to explain his lack of success. The
   president's opportunity structure was mixed. He lacked an electoral
   mandate but was fortunate enough to serve in a unified government.
   Nevertheless, Republican cohesion was imperfect, partisan polarization
   was high, and there was little public pressure for Democrats to abate
   their strong opposition. The structure of most of the choices before
   Congress did not favor the president. As a result, he has not been
   successful in obtaining congressional support for most of his major
   initiatives. Making strategic assessments by asking a few key questions
   about the president's political environment provides us with crucial
   leverage for evaluating a president's likely success in obtaining the
   support of Congress for his initiatives.},

Abstract = {The question of the role of parties within representative government is
   central to Stael's political reflection, though it has been generally
   overlooked by historians. The writer's experience in the early phases of
   the 1789 revolution convinced her that the absence of organised parties
   in the moderate camp was one of the main causes of the derapage towards
   radicalisation and Terror. The incapacity of the ``constitutional{''}
   majority to set aside their differences and to rally behind a leader,
   had paved the way for the victory of the more disciplined Jacobin
   minority. Stael - who was inspired by David Hume's writings on the
   subject - looked at English political parties as a model for modem
   representative systems. She described their essential role in mediating
   between public opinion and the expectations of electors on the one hand,
   and the action of government on the other. She also stressed the
   importance of parliamentary deliberation and of personal exchanges
   between electors and their deputies. In modem democracies, without the
   mediation exercised by parties, popular passions may easily spin out of
   control and destabilize political institutions.},

Abstract = {The French Revolution tipped the distribution of powers in favor of the
   legislative power and the idea of ``representation{''}. After Necker,
   Madame de Stael looks for the way of a government which is not confined
   to executing the law, but enjoys autonomy of conception and action. She
   advises her mistress, Louis de Narbonne, minister of Louis XVI, for an
   English Prime Minister. She then tries to intervene on the drafting of
   the Constitution of the Year III, supporting the moderate party in this
   sense. She wants a government with a suspensive veto and the right to
   dissolve the legislative power. The Fifth Republic of 1958 (foundation)
   and 1962 (direct election of the president by universal suffrage), as
   well as the current constitutional debate, confirm the French continuity
   of a preoccupation: how to preserve the eminence and the authority of
   the State while in assuring the responsibility of the government,
   distinguished from the head of state? Madame de Stael contributed to
   this perspective and encouraged Benjamin Constant in this way of
   thinking.},

Abstract = {Two distinct literatures have studied the macroeconomic effects of
   electoral systems and of labor market structures, respectively. Results
   include a positive association between proportional representation (PR)
   electoral systems and growth, but also between PR and inflation, as well
   as negative or hump-shaped relationships between labor market
   coordination and the `misery variables', unemployment and inflation.
   However, these results could be biased; particular electoral system and
   labor market features co-vary systematically, and extant studies have
   typically not taken this into account. Effects attributed to PR systems
   could really stem from labor market coordination, and vice versa. In
   this article the relationships with macroeconomic outcomes for both
   electoral systems and labor market structures are re-evaluated by
   modelling them jointly. Employing data from more than 30 democracies,
   with time-series from the period 1960-2010, some robust and some
   non-robust associations are identified. First, PR systems are, indeed,
   associated with higher growth rates, but not with higher inflation.
   Regarding labor market coordination, robust curvilinear relationships
   with unemployment and inflation are identified; intermediate levels of
   coordination correspond with worse macroeconomic performance - albeit
   not lower growth - even when accounting for electoral system features.},

Abstract = {The Zheng He Museum is an important depository of material artefacts
   related to Zheng He's seven voyages through the maritime world. This
   writing intends to highlight three contemporary narratives related to
   his legacies: (1) the idea of Zheng He as a symbol of the `art of
   collaboration'; (2) the narrative that associates Zheng He with peaceful
   tributary relations; and (3) the concept of Malacca as an emporium of
   trade that prospered under official trade and diplomatic exchanges with
   Ming dynasty China. All three narratives highlight the idea of the
   Maritime Silk Road as a metaphor for exchanges, trade, politics, culture
   and the `Asian' way of mediating differences between nations. The
   narratives conform to the idea of the Silk Road Ethos by
   exceptionalizing intercultural respect and non-hegemonic Pan-Asianism.
   Arising from these narratives and related to the material artefacts
   presented in the Malacca Zheng He Museum, the important legacies of
   Zheng He's maritime voyages related to contemporary concerns in East
   Asia are in the realm of conflict resolution, capacity-building and free
   trade, although, for objectivity, this writing will also selectively
   discuss contested elements and alternative interpretations of the
   symbolism of Zheng He's voyages.},

Abstract = {What challenges does feminist legal theory face today? This is the
   fundamental question posed by Thomas Casadei in his recent work Diritto
   e (dis)paritd. Dalla discriminazione di genere alla democrazia paritaria
   (Aracne, 2017). In this essay I analyze the main points of that work,
   starting from a brief reconstruction of the concept and history of
   feminist legal theory. The paper focuses on Casadei's theoretical
   proposal of a parity democracy not reducible to a simple quota system.
   Ultimately, the analysis underlines how feminist legal theory can be
   understood as a method and perspective from which to open an effective
   debate on constitutionalism and gender-related issues. From this
   viewpoint the critique combines theory and practice through the analysis
   of a particular case study: the new Tunisian Constitution.},

Abstract = {What explains how political donors decide where to give? Existing
   research indicates that people donate money to express support for a
   preferred political team and enjoy the emotional benefits of
   participating in politics. While this explains why people donate, it
   does little to help understand the different strategies that donors may
   pursue. In this paper, we use data on individual decisions as to where
   to allocate contributions to provide fresh insight into the strategies
   donors are pursuing. Our approach yields a much more nuanced view of
   campaign finance by showing how differently situated donors pursue
   divergent contribution strategies. Of particular note, we identify an
   influential class of engaged and wealthy political donors that spreads
   their dollars widely, especially focusing on giving to
   out-of-jurisdiction candidates. This illustrates just how influential
   the recent elimination of aggregate contribution limits may be in
   allowing a small share of donors to be broadly influential.},

Abstract = {Few political systems are completely closed to citizen participation,
   but in nondemocratic systems and developing democracies, such
   participation may come with risks. In these contexts where fear and
   uncertainty may be high, why do some citizens still take action and make
   complaints to authorities? The resource mobilization model identifies
   the importance of time, money, and civic skills as resources that are
   necessary for participation. In this paper, we build on this model and
   argue that political connections-close personal ties to someone working
   in government-can also constitute a critical resource, especially in
   contexts with weak democratic institutions. Using data from both urban
   and rural China, we find that individuals with political connections are
   more likely to contact authorities with complaints about government
   public services, despite the fact that they do not have higher levels of
   dissatisfaction with public service provision. We conduct various
   robustness checks, including a sensitivity analysis, and show that this
   relationship is unlikely to be driven by an incorrect model
   specification or unobserved confounding variables.},

   personalization. The decline of preferential voting in Belgium
   (2003-2014)},

Abstract = {For more than two decades, scholars have been debating the so-called
   personalization of politics. Some studies confirm such an evolution,
   while others demonstrate that evidence of personalization is at best
   mixed, or even absent. This article aims at shedding a new light on this
   controversy by looking at the evolution of the use of preferential
   voting in Belgium. Preferential voting has been constantly growing, but
   since 2007, the trend has been reversed and fewer voters decide to cast
   a preferential vote. We argue that this decline is not evidence against
   personalization. Rather, it illustrates the need to distinguish
   conceptually and empirically between two dimensions of personalization:
   centralized' and decentralized' personalization. The decline in the use
   of preference votes is not related to a decline in the former (which
   refers to a handful of political leaders). Instead, it is due to the
   decline of the latter form of personalization (referring to a large
   group of individual politicians). Candidates other than party leaders
   appear to have growing difficulties to attract votes. This negative
   relationship holds, even when we control for measures of electoral
   reform and the newness of parties. Our results also show that leadership
   effects are stronger in new parties.},

Journal = {ELECTORAL STUDIES},

Volume = {54},

Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Pundits and the popular press believe that the narratives about the
   candidates' personalities during the campaign influence the outcome of
   the election. Political scientists, in contrast, are dismissive of this
   influence. Instead, Political Scientists view the narrative about
   candidates as a sideshow and any connection between voters' impressions
   of the candidates' personalities and their vote as epiphenomenal.
   Unfortunately, the academic literature never directly measures the key
   concept of interest: the movement in image of the candidates'
   personalities during the campaign. Drawing on the connection between
   language and personality, particularly the Big Five model of
   personality, this paper demonstrates that the images of the candidates'
   personalities in the 2008 election shape the standing of the candidates
   among the electorate. The results suggest that the image projected of
   the candidates in the campaigns played an influential role in the
   outcome of the election.},

Abstract = {Because they are now members of most Western European parliaments,
   Populist Radical Right Parties (PRRPs) have the potential to influence
   the formulation of socio-economic policies. However, scholarly attention
   so far has nearly exclusively focussed on the impact of PRRPs on what is
   considered their core issue', that is migration policy. In this paper,
   we provide the first mixed methods comparative study of the impact of
   PRRPs on redistributive and (de-)regulative economic policies. Combining
   quantitative data with qualitative case studies, our results show that
   the participation of PRRPs in right-wing governments has noteworthy
   implications for socio-economic policies. Due to the heterogeneous
   constituencies of PRRPs, these parties not only refrain from welfare
   state retrenchment but are also less inclined to engage in deregulation
   compared with right-wing governments without PRRP participation.},

Abstract = {Colombia begins its post-conflict stage after more than 60 years of
   armed confrontation between groups outside the law and the State,
   therefore, it is pertinent and vital to support this process from the
   academy, encouraging the understanding of the conflict from education.
   In this sense, adopting the Chair of UNESCO, created to promote
   sustainable development and the culture of peace from education, allows
   the creation of the Chair of Peace with Law 1732 of 2014, as a tool to
   be implemented in a mandatory manner by all educational institutions, at
   all levels of education. The aim of this Chair is to create competencies
   and promote knowledge related to peace, which revolves around three
   areas: Culture of Peace, Education for Peace and Sustainable
   Development. In these terms, this article makes a conceptual recount of
   peace as a human right, and of the importance of the chair of peace in
   the Colombian post-conflict.},

Journal = {REVISTA BRASILEIRA DE ESTUDOS POLITICOS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {117},

Abstract = {This paper deals with the existential damage to workers caused by the
   working environment. The Kafkaesque character Gregorio Samsa represents
   the ordinary worker who, even though metamorphosed, worries more about
   his work than about his condition. The transformations in the world of
   work in an era of globalization and fast technological changes caused
   insecurity to the life and to the identity of the workers. Increasing
   labor demands, the new technologies, increased production and the
   repetitive work make impossible for workers be disconnected. A socially
   sustainable working environment is needed, where the worker enjoys
   creative leisure for his self-determination. In the study, we used
   bibliographical research through books, articles, and Brazilian legal
   norms that illustrate the presence of the theme in the Brazilian
   context. Most of court judges considered the right of disconnection
   fundamental to workers. The dialogue with the work of Kafka and Chaplin
   gives a new signification to worker, puts it in evidence. Life and work
   must be the object of reflection and choice. Labor does not have to be
   synonymous with alienation, sustenance and exploitation. The correct
   diagnostic and repair of existential damage needs further study.},

Abstract = {This article presents an analysis of the relationship teacher education,
   research, and university quality, taking as reference two transversal
   and fundamental areas for the development of Colombia: Social Sciences
   and Agricultural Sciences. This relationship is studied taking into
   account that in the post-conflict context, the country needs
   universities, among other entities, to assume that leading role, tending
   to identify and propose routes of social, political, cultural, economic
   transformation, etc., and that better time than this, full of present
   and future changes, where through this document a contribution is made
   to this context from the academic, highlighting the importance of
   locating points of encounter between both fields of knowledge. In this
   way, a proposal is presented from the academy that proposes a way to
   strengthen the development of Colombia, after the armed conflict that
   has disturbed the Nation in the last 50 years, and which now requires
   the articulation of different strategic areas.},

Journal = {PARTY POLITICS},

Volume = {24},
Number = {4},

Abstract = {This article assesses the importance of religious affiliation,
   observance, faith and party choice in categorizing attitudes to two of
   the most important contemporary moral and ethical issues: same-sex
   marriage and abortion. While religious conditioning of moral attitudes
   has long been seen as important, this article goes beyond analyses
   grounded in religiosity to explore whether support for particular
   political parties - and the cues received from those parties on moral
   questions - may counter or reinforce messages from the churches. Drawing
   upon new data from the extensive survey of public opinion in the 2015
   Northern Ireland election study, the article analyses the salience of
   religious, party choice and demographic variables in determining
   attitudes towards these two key social issues. Same-sex marriage and
   abortion (other than in very exceptional abortion cases) are both still
   banned in Northern Ireland, but the moral and religious conservatism
   underpinning prohibition has come under increasing challenge, especially
   in respect of same-sex marriage. The extent to which political messages
   compete with religious ones may influence attitudes to the moral issues
   of the moment.},

Abstract = {Fifty years ago, Enoch Powell made what still is one of the most
   notorious speeches in postwar British politics. Its tone was shocking
   for its use of inflammatory references to ethnic minority immigrants.
   Immigration continues to be divisive and references to it by politicians
   inevitably lead to comparisons with Powell. The aim of the collection is
   to examine Powell's speech from a number of perspectives, exploring how
   it was viewed both by contemporaries and in the light of subsequent
   developments. The objective of this article is to examine Powell's
   motivations, impact and legacy.},

Abstract = {In recent decades, some of the remote rural Slovenian communities that
   have been historically dependent on traditional economies have
   experienced the most drastic emigration processes. Among the
   particularly difficult challenges that they have faced are retaining
   their youth and attracting new inhabitants. At the same time, some rural
   exurbs have experienced population growth, which presents another set of
   leadership challenges for the local executives, i.e. mayors. The
   analysis of the statistical data reveals that a) the populations of more
   than half municipalities experienced emigration between 2010 and 2018;
   b) the populations of urban centres are growing; c) more than one fifth
   of population live in the three largest urban municipalities and d) the
   population is concentrated in Slovenia's centre, near the capital city,
   where we have seen a trend of dramatic population growth. Further
   analysis shows that the municipalities, which are relatively close to
   the highways, mostly experienced population growth during the last eight
   years. Most of the municipalities that are located farther from the
   highways, and therefore more difficult to access, have experienced
   population declines during the same period. We conclude that regardless
   of how local leaders tried to improve the attractiveness of their
   municipalities, the state and its public policies played a key role,
   directly impacting local efforts and, consequently, demographic changes.},

Abstract = {Within the framework of the colombian armed conflict, it has been
   necessary to approach other perspectives on conflict and peace that
   enriches the understanding of the phenomenon and that makes it possible
   to visualize new possible paths for the construction of peace. In this
   sense, this article synthesizes the results of a research whose
   objective is to analyze the social representations (RS) that the Sikuani
   indigenous community of Puerto Gaitan has about the armed conflict and
   the peace. It was approached from the perspective of Abric's social
   representation, as well as from a historical-political conception of the
   colombian armed conflict and the vision of peace developed by Munoz
   (2001, 2004). The study was qualitative with a ethnographic approach
   based on phenomenology and it used two techniques: interviews and item
   hierarchy. Based on a content analysis the research shows that the
   social representation of the armed conflict was the impossibility of
   being terminated, the representation of any actor and the power of the
   armed groups. On the other hand, in relation to peace, it is represented
   as an international reality and expressed socially but unattainable by
   the limitation of expressing cultural traditions.},

Abstract = {The conflict in Syria has brought up a great interest from very
   different spectrums of the academic world. Its length and complexity
   have created a great quantity of literature, specially from the
   political science and international relations fields, since it has
   become one of the greatest crisis after the second world war. Of course,
   the conflict's media treatment generates an important scientific
   interest due to the many implications that it involves. The goal in this
   research paper is to identify which frames did the british, spanish and
   french press use in the developing of the conflict in the arab country.
   Using a cuantitative methodological technique, trough the confirmative
   factorial analysis and the varimax rotation, the investigation focussed
   on which variables are correlated between each other in order to detect
   the frames in the newspapers analyzed. This contribution brings new data
   that support different studies which affirm that the european newspapers
   mainly define the problematic of the armed conflicts from a humanitarian
   approach.},

Abstract = {Various studies have outlined the institutional (e.g. the existence of
   quota laws and the electoral system type of a country) and
   non-institutional factors (e.g. the political culture of a country) that
   account for variation in women's representation, in general, and, in
   more detail, the low representation of women in the US Congress.
   However, no study has, so far, compared the Congressional career paths
   of men and women in order to understand whether this gender gap in
   representation stems from a difference in terms of the duration and
   importance of the careers of male and female policymakers. Using data on
   all US House elections between 1972 and 2012, we provide such an
   analysis, evaluating whether or not the political careers of women in
   the US House of Representatives are different from the political careers
   of their male counterparts. Our findings indicate that the congressional
   careers of men and women are alike and, if anything, women may even have
   a small edge over their male colleagues.},

Abstract = {The International Criminal Court is at a turning point, facing various
   challenges which call into question its effectiveness, legitimacy and
   survival. The problem derived from the Al-Bashir case is presented as a
   conceptual disagreement in essence and juridical-political conflict in
   appearance. Therefore, this research analyses the background to
   understand the set of elements taking part in this conflict and the
   African Union criticism over the extension of the Rome Statute
   provisions to States not parties. The case study inferred the incidence
   of the Peace-Justice Debate formulas in the current practice of the
   international criminal justice system, since they seem to form the basis
   of the legal-political discrepancy between the African Union and the
   Court, conditioning not only the arrest of President Al-Bashir, but the
   effectiveness of the entire system of cooperation. Finally, the
   conclusions of the work show the range of challenges facing the Court,
   adding to the root causes of the confrontation between the two
   institutions a conceptual discrepancy whose understanding is key to the
   transformation of the conflict and the consequent reinvention and / or
   survival of the Criminal Court International.},

Abstract = {This article examines the impact of Enoch Powell's speech on Britain's
   numerous right-wing fringe groups and their responsein particular, that
   of the National Front, who benefitted the most from Powell's
   intervention on race and for a brief moment became Britain's fourth
   political party. It begins by looking at the growth of post-World War II
   British fascism and how its emphasis switched from anti-Semitism to
   anti-colonial immigration. Throughout the piece, the relationship
   between Britain's far right and the Conservative party is examined to
   show how Powell inadvertently blurred the lines between the two. The
   article concludes with the 1979 general election victory of Margaret
   Thatcher who, by adopting Powellite themes but in more measured tones,
   destroyed the National Front's dream of an electoral breakthrough.},

Journal = {ASIAN POLITICS \& POLICY},

Volume = {10},
Number = {3},

Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {When a linguistically distinctive ethnicity is surrounded by much larger
   powers, its leader usually needs resources from one of them - and then
   that power may try to absorb it. The local leader quickly switches to
   reliance on the previous protector's main foreign enemy, simultaneously
   purging (often killing) domestic rivals. Albania's long history through
   Enver Hoxha, like North Korea's under Kim Jong-un still, shows recurrent
   examples of this link between independence and dictatorship - although
   not all tyrants emerge in this way. The essay also discloses violent
   aspects of past South Korean politics that few readers of English know.
   Historical parallels can be observed without any universal covering law.
   Further examples explore limits of this method. History can inform
   policies toward nonproliferation (American, Chinese, Japanese, and
   Korean), elucidate the recent effects of surrounding pluralistic states
   on small countries, and provide evidence about the likely benefits of
   Korean patriotism and reunification.},

Month = {JUN 13},
Abstract = {Can reminders of violence committed in the past influence citizens'
   policy preferences in the present? Prior work has found that under the
   threat of violence individuals prioritize safety and adopt policy views
   aimed at reducing the threat. Elites can then strategically employ
   concerns over personal safety and security to shape the public's
   preferences. I contribute to this literature by conducting an
   exploratory study of whether invocations of violence committed in the
   past shape preferences in the long-term, years after the actual violence
   has ended. To do so, I fielded an experiment on a large (N=1125) and
   nationally representative sample of respondents in Bosnia, the site of a
   major ethnic civil war in 1992-1995. I did not find evidence that
   reminders of wartime violence in and of themselves affect policy
   preferences. Ultimately, this study represents a first cut at a
   neglected question in the literature and has implications that could
   motivate future research on the relationship between violent conflict
   and policy preferences.},

Abstract = {Since the late-1970s, scholars have been engaged in a vibrant debate
   about the nature of post-war British politics. While some writers have
   suggested that the three decades that succeeded the Second World War
   witnessed a bi-partisan consensus on key policy questions, others have
   argued that it was conflict, not agreement, that marked the period. This
   article offers a novel contribution to this controversy by drawing
   attention to the epistemological beliefs of the Labour and Conservative
   parties. It argues that once these beliefs are considered, it becomes
   possible to reconcile some of the competing claims made by proponents
   and critics of the `post-war consensus' thesis. Labour and Conservative
   leaders may have been wedded to different beliefs, but they also shared
   a common enthusiasm for empiricist reasoning and were both reluctant to
   identify fixed political `ends' that they sought to realise.
   Consequently, they were both committed to evolutionary forms of change,
   and they eschewed the notion that any social or political arrangement
   was of universal value.},

Abstract = {Turkey's role and its commitment to NATO have frequently been questioned
   in Euro-Atlantic circles. A steadily growing relationship between Turkey
   and Russia in the last two years is a major concern for the North
   Atlantic Alliance and its members, particularly for the US. The question
   circling is whether Turkey is drifting apart from NATO and looking for a
   new kind of security relationship with Russia. Turkey's national defense
   strategy still relies fundamentally on its membership to NATO. Turkey's
   growing security concerns from the South, however, obliges the country
   to develop coordination with Russia to find a solution to the Syrian
   quagmire. If Russia and the US can develop a ``modus operandi{''} in
   Syria, this may set an example for Turkey, too, and Turkey's
   relationships with NATO and Russia can complement one another.},

   foreigners are more tolerant toward immigration and that economic
   development positively moderates the impact of trust in foreigners on

   trust in political institutions and the moderating role of economic
   development in the impact. We conclude by discussing the implications of

Abstract = {Does political participation make a difference for policy
   responsiveness, or is affluence what matters most? To examine whether
   participation beyond voting matters for policy representation, we
   analyze congruence between citizens' policy preferences and their
   representatives' roll call votes using data from the 2012 Cooperative
   Congressional Election Study. For the main policy issue for which
   citizens' political engagement beyond voting enhances congruencenamely,
   the Affordable Care Act (ACA) of 2010 we then investigate whether this
   effect holds when taking citizens' income into account. The findings
   show that for the ACA, constituents' participation beyond voting is
   associated with increased congruence with their representatives at all
   levels of income, and that those with less income who are politically
   active beyond voting experience the largest increase in congruence.
   However, our findings also show that the potential of political
   participation and income to enhance congruence is restricted to
   co-partisans, and to highly partisan and salient issues.},

Abstract = {During the ``Long Sixties{''} (1957-1973) in Chile, the labor movement
   experienced a process of political radicalization. This paper reviews
   the general dimensions and the concrete forms of this phenomenon,
   defined by a complex, class-based articulation of memory, identity and
   experience of the social conflict. Thus, it is argued that the
   radicalization of the labor movement did not start with the arrival of
   Allende and Popular Unity to the government in 1970. This process
   started several years before and it found in those three years
   (1970-1973) its ideal conditions for an overflowing deployment.},

Abstract = {The essay responds to the central question by trying to provide a
   clarifying definition of right-wing populism, in distinction to older
   categories such as right-wing extremism/radicalism. In particular, it
   discusses to what extent right-wing populism is a useful label for a
   party family. It argues that the way right-wing populism is discussed in
   the general public and in academia shows the lack of clear ideological
   characteristics of the phenomenon and generates only a new analytical
   haziness. Therefore, it cannot replace the established categories, nor
   can it be used to identify a party family. However, the more general
   term populism, understood as an empty political performance or style,
   can draw our attention to real deficits of democracy and accompanying
   discomfort.},

Abstract = {First-generation neo-Marxist class theorists advanced some way beyond
   the orthodox Marxist account that is grounded in a particular reading of
   the Communist Manifesto. However, capitalism's changing reality since
   then has revealed the limited extent of their break with orthodoxy. With
   the support of Bhaskar's critical realism and Gramsci's philosophy of
   praxis, this article addresses these limitations to facilitate movement
   towards second-generation neo-Marxist class theory. Rather than
   following first-generation neo-Marxist Poulantzas who dismissed the
   `class-in-itself'/'class-for-itself' distinction as a non-Marxist
   Hegelian residue, this article treats it as the central problematic of
   Marx's class theory. Bourdieu's subjectivist reformulations of the
   distinction that resonates with Marxist interpretations that run counter
   to the neo-Marxist social scientific aspiration are also critically
   engaged. The innovative conceptual framework arising from the article's
   critical engagement with these diverging intellectual trajectories is
   applied to sketch `class effects' in-themselves especially around the
   theme of the `relative surplus population'. Expected class effects
   implied by the core dynamic of the capitalist mode of production, and
   then contemporary empirical effects generated by neoliberal-led global
   capitalism, are outlined. This re-conceptualisation is then supplemented
   by critically examining Beck's argument that individualisation leads to
   capitalism without classes-for-themselves. The article concludes by
   reconsidering class-for-itself in the light of the preceding discussion.},

Abstract = {There is yet to be a comprehensive and systematic study of the views of
   peers on reform of the House of Lords. This article provides the first
   such study based on a powerful dataset of interviews with 77 peers
   during the Conservative-Liberal Democrat Coalition government. Albert
   Hirschman's typology of reactionary rhetoric is applied to the key
   themes emerging from the interviews. This article demonstrates that the
   opposition of peers can be understood as being based on the arguments of
   perversity, futility and jeopardy. In addition, an important strand of
   opposition to reform can be characterised as temporality. A systematic
   understanding of the views of those peers who oppose reform could
   potentially enable the formulation of more successful proposals for
   wholesale change than those set out by the Coalition.},

Journal = {URVIO-REVISTA LATINOAMERICANA DE ESTUDIOS DE SEGURIDAD},
Year = {2018},
Number = {22},
Pages = {86-100},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {This article synthesizes the main analytical trends that have addressed
   the dynamics of citizen security in Colombia. It analyses the strategic
   change regarding the object, objectives and dynamics of public security
   policies in the country, as well as the way in which the relationship
   between urban violence and public policies has been thought. From there,
   it seeks to demonstrate how the transition has been addressed in the
   treatment of multiple violence. In the second instance, the article
   demonstrates the way in which such modifications occur both within the
   profound changes in the international system of States and within the
   framework of a series of dynamics at the national level, which provide a
   new constitutional framework, from 1991 onwards. Finally, the academic
   production regarding the relationship between security and the
   constitution of the State's monopoly of force, its scope and
   limitations, are contextualized. Therefore, it is necessary to
   contemplate this set of perspectives as a contribution to the processes
   of construction of security policies in the framework of the Colombian
   post-conflict.},

Abstract = {Public and academic debates often lament a ``crisis of trust{''}
   endangering democratic stability. In contrast, this article seeks to
   demonstrate the value of distrust in political relations, a certain form
   of which should be considered, such as trust, a prerequisite of
   democracies. To underline this thesis, this contribution discusses
   categories that clarify the relationality of the concept of distrust
   (its directedness and modalities) and that allow for a discussion of the
   relation of trust and distrust, which are introduced as an asymmetrical
   pair of opposites - with far-reaching consequences for the common
   discourse on trust. After presenting several historical and current
   arguments in favor of the value of political distrust, this article will
   end with a deeper look on those forms of distrust that should indeed be
   considered dysfunctional and dangerous for democratic orders.},

Abstract = {Malaysia is one of the multi-ethnic, multi-culture and multi-religious
   countries in Southeast Asia. Malaysia is a classic case where the state
   has used wide-ranging preferential policies to manage ethnic problems.
   As a matter of fact, because of the ethnic politics in Malaysia, the
   ethnic preferential policies affected most domains of this country,
   including social, political and economic areas, especially Chinese
   education in Malaysia. The objective of this paper is to examine Chinese
   education in Malaysia under Malaysian ethnic politics. Data of this
   article is based on two sources, primary data were collected through
   interviews and the informants were selected based on purposive sampling
   and snowball sampling, meanwhile, secondary data were collected from
   journal articles, newspapers, website pages and online resources. Hence,
   the authors focused on these qualitative data especially the informants'
   oral interviews to reach the research objective. Content analysis was
   used to analyze primary and secondary data. Findings of this study
   indicate that, there is no doubt that the development of Chinese
   education in Malaysia is closely related to Malaysian ethnic politics,
   though it has undergone a thorny way, it is not a problem to maintain
   the status quo of the Chinese education; however, it is impossible to
   seek a great breakthrough at the present stage. Nowadays, the
   development of Chinese education in Malaysia depends to a certain extent
   on the development of China and it has a positive correlation with the
   Malaysia-China relationships.},
