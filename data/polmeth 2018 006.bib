Abstract = {If we examine the current literature, no study on policy agenda has so
   far addressed the agenda of a Constitutional Court in a country that has
   recently experienced crucial changes in its political system. The
   present contribution on the Italian Constitutional Court seeks to bridge
   this gap. We aim at assessing the role the Italian Court plays in the
   policy process in both the First and the Second Republic by answering
   two research questions: (1) in its decisions does the Court accommodate
   themes that are neglected in the parliamentary legislative process? (2)
   Does the Court (and if so, how often) represent interests and values in
   opposition to the interests and values supporting the current
   legislative majorities? By employing an original data set that puts
   together all decisions of constitutional illegitimacy under incidental
   review between the years 1983 and 2013, we found that in both Republics
   Court's agenda is significantly more concentrated than Parliament's
   agenda, and it does not broadly offer an alternative access point to the
   policy-making for new or neglected issues. However, at the same time,
   the alternational system of the Second Republic seems to trigger more
   immediate and salient' reactions from the Constitutional Court, which in
   that period becomes more prone to sanction recent legislation.},

Abstract = {Recent research has indicated that English identity was a strong
   predictor for a Leave vote in the referendum on membership of the
   European Union, and that it is an identity that is increasingly playing
   a role in British politics. In this paper, we explore whether
   Englishness affects even left-right positioning of parties. Focusing on
   Labour, we find that it does, even controlling for other attitudinal and
   demographic variables. Alongside age and perceptions of the party
   leader, perceptions of immigration change and perceived lack of
   political efficacy also play a significant role. Given the potential
   electoral significance of this, we reflect on and propose a range of
   policy options that Labour could utilise to address this gap between
   English-identifiers and the party.},

Abstract = {After what seemed like a hopeless impasse in the nuclear crisis on the
   Korean Peninsula, signs appeared that Pyongyang and Washington had
   changed their stances and were ready to seek a way out. The DPRK, the
   U.S., and South Korea announced a shift away from direct confrontation
   towards a search for compromise. When the Trump administration increased
   pressure on the DPRK, Russian policy on the Korean Peninsula drew
   attention, with some experts saying that Russia will act as a spoiler.
   For now, Russia remains one of the key actors and is able to play a
   constructive role. This article uses historical data to provide a
   complex analysis of the different players' positions. U.S., Japan, and
   South Korea conduct a well-coordinated process, with Washington drawing
   its allies into the negotiation process. Russia and China joined
   sanctions; however, they consider unilateral sanctions excessive and
   argue that only constructive dialogue can ensure progress on Korean
   affairs.},

Abstract = {Political philosophers' prescriptions for poverty alleviation have
   overlooked the importance of social movements led by, and for, the poor
   in the global South. I argue that these movements are normatively and
   politically significant for poverty reduction strategies and global
   justice generally. While often excluded from formal political processes,
   organized poor communities nonetheless lay the groundwork for more
   radical, pro-poor forms of change through their grassroots resistance
   and organizing. Poor-led social movements politicize poverty by
   insisting that, fundamentally, it is caused by social relations of power
   that exploit and subordinate poor populations. These movements and their
   organizations also develop the collective capabilities of poor
   communities in ways that help them to contest the structures and
   processes that perpetuate their needs deprivation. I illustrate these
   contributions through a discussion of the Landless Rural Worker's
   Movement in Brazil (the MST), a poor mobilization organization in
   Bangladesh (Nijera Kori), and the slum and pavement dweller movement in
   India. Global justice theorizing about poverty cannot just add on the
   contributions of such struggles to existing analyses of, and remedies
   for, poverty, however; rather, we will need to shift to a relational
   approach to poverty in order to see the vital importance of organized
   poor communities to transformative, poor-centered poverty reduction.},

Title = {Types of labor market policy and the electoral behavior of insecure
   workers},
Journal = {ELECTORAL STUDIES},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {55},
Pages = {1-10},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Recent research finds a significant difference in voting behavior of
   workers with secure employment and those without. What is less
   understood are the conditions in which the divergent political choices
   of these two groups overlap. Focusing on two types of labor market
   policies-unemployment insurance and active labor market programs, this
   paper examines how more generous government spending on different types
   of welfare programs shapes the electoral behavior of individuals with
   adverse labor market experience. By using multilevel analysis of
   individual surveys from 18 European countries (1999-2015), I find that
   unemployed and temporary workers are more likely to vote against
   traditional left-wing parties and to withdraw from voting at all. The
   greater spending on unemployment insurance, however, alters the outcome
   by realigning insecure workers with old left parties such as social
   democratic and center-left socialist parties. By contrast, expenditure
   on active labor market programs has a weak conditional impact in
   general. The important implication of this study is that while
   government policy does moderate the effect of adverse labor market
   experience, types of social policy matters in understanding policy
   feedback effects. I further discuss this point in relation to the
   different implications of income support and activation programs for
   risk mitigation.},

Abstract = {Conventional wisdom holds that languages, as ethnic markers, build
   communities with shared preferences and strong social networks.
   Consequently, ethnolinguistic homogeneity can facilitate growth. This
   article challenges this conception of language as a cultural marker. It
   argues that language is also a practical vehicle of communication;
   people can be multilingual, and second languages can be learned. Hence
   language boundaries are neither (1) congruent with ethnic boundaries nor
   (2) static. If true, the purported advantages of ethnolinguistic
   homogeneity should also be evident in countries with large populations
   of non-native speakers conversant in official languages. The study tests
   this hypothesis using an original cross-national and time-variant
   measure that captures both mother-tongue speakers and second-language
   learners. The empirical results are consistent with the understanding of
   language as an efficiency-enhancing instrument: countries with
   exogenously high levels of heterogeneity can avoid the growth tragedy'
   (1) by endogenously teaching the official language in schools.},

Abstract = {The outcome of the 2017 general election showed the demand for a break
   with a failed economic model. However, Labour needs to continue to
   develop its thinking, especially around questions of ownership,
   institutional reform, the devolution of power, and about wages and
   quality of work. The author argues that a focus on the everyday
   economy-those sectors upon which we depend for healthy, happy lives and
   communities and which employ many people, but which are all too often
   characterised by low wages, low productivity and low skill-can expose
   the failings of our present economic settlement and offer a blueprint
   for Labour to forge a new one. Central to this are questions of
   democracy, but more needs to be said about redressing the
   `financialisation' of the everyday economy.},

Abstract = {While liberalism is usually conceived as a political theory contrary to
   Utopia, in one of its versions developed during the twentieth century,
   we can see the rise of a liberal Utopia, whether it be the formulation
   of normative theories which express the idea of non-coercion or the
   outlining and defense of a political community where universal tolerance
   reigns supreme. This article will focus on the version of this double
   Utopia developed by Robert Nozick in his arguments favoring a minimal
   State. We sustain that -regarding the first aspect- his entitlement
   theory springs from idealizations which, when applied, lead to certain
   juridical aporias that reclaim a minimal State. And, regarding the
   second aspect, we sustain that the meta-Utopia described by Nozick would
   not lead to the blossoming of different micro-Utopias but rather to an
   ever-more entrenched hegemony of capitalist communities, a hegemony
   which would result in the colonization or dissolution of non-capitalist
   communities and, ultimately, in the minimal State in crisis.},

Journal = {POLITICAL THEORY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {46},
Number = {5},
Pages = {671-697},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {This essay reconstructs the place of utopia in realist political theory,
   by examining the ways in which the literary genre of critical utopias
   can productively unsettle ongoing discussions about how to do political
   theory. I start by analyzing two prominent accounts of the relationship
   between realism and utopia: real utopia (Erik Olin Wright et al.) and
   dystopic liberalism (Judith Shklar et al.). Elaborating on Raymond
   Geuss's recent reflections, the essay then claims that an engagement
   with literature can shift the focus of these accounts. Utopian fiction,
   I maintain, is useful for comprehending what is (thus enhancing our
   understanding of the world) and for contemplating what might be (thus
   nurturing the hope for a better future). Ursula K. Le Guin's novel The
   Dispossessed deploys this double function in an exemplary fashion:
   through her dynamic and open-ended portrayal of an Anarchist community,
   Le Guin succeeds in imagining a utopia that negates the status quo,
   without striving to construct a perfect society. The book's radical, yet
   ambiguous, narrative hence reveals a strategy for locating utopia within
   realist political theory that moves beyond the positions dominating the
   current debate. Reading The Dispossessed ultimately demonstrates that
   realism without utopia is status quo-affirming, while utopia without
   realism is wishful thinking.},

Abstract = {Governments of Western democracies responded quickly to the
   poisoning-allegedly by agents of the Russian state-of former Soviet spy,
   Sergei Skripal, and his daughter in Salisbury, UK in March 2018.
   Germany's response was not as categorically reproachful and drew
   attention to its relationship with Vladimir Putin's Russia more
   generally. It expelled four Russian diplomats and has applied sanctions
   since Russia's annexation of Crimea, yet continues with other bilateral
   trade and investment, significantly in the energy sector, and it has
   been hesitant about unconditionally rebuking aggressive Russian
   behaviour. A complex mix of domestic politics and international
   relations, historical memory, economic incentives, and political
   psychology in the age of the internet and `fake news' serve to influence
   German attitudes toward Russia. A contest between Putin critics and
   sympathisers sharpens in a polity in which the majority are ambivalent.
   In the aftermath of the Skripal affair, some rethinking of an ambiguous
   policy is occurring at high levels.},

Journal = {COMPARATIVE POLITICAL STUDIES},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {51},
Number = {10},
Pages = {1243-1278},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Comparative political scientists have sought to remedy their
   subdiscipline's structuralist tendencies by paying greater analytical
   attention to transformative political events. Yet, our conceptual
   understanding of events remains rudimentary. The article addresses this
   conceptual gap in two ways. First, it foregrounds symbolic
   meaning-making as the constitutive attribute of events. Second, it
   demonstrates that events are not inherently agency-facilitating by
   developing the concept of prospectively framed events. These are
   occurrences that actors know will take place, but of whose outcome they
   are uncertain. Political challengers frame the upcoming event so as to
   discursively trap incumbents into political action they would rather not

Abstract = {This article demonstrates the analytical advantages of studying not only
   the degree to which people oppose immigration in a country, but also the
   character of their opposition. Using Latent Class Analysis and data from
   the European Social Survey, Nordic patterns and trends are examined with
   the aim of identifying different kinds of immigration attitudes and how
   they develop in different national contexts. The Nordic countries are
   interesting to compare as, while they are similar in many respects, they
   also diverge significantly from each other in areas theoretically
   considered important to the formation of attitudes towards immigration.
   Studying the character of immigration opposition reveals five different
   types of immigration attitudes. These are differently distributed
   between the Nordic countries as well as over time, and include nativist
   opposition (opposition only towards immigrants of ethnic/racial groups
   other than that of the majority population) and economic opposition
   (opposition that entails a separation between immigrants considered to
   be an economic resource and an economic burden). By demonstrating how
   immigration opposition in the Nordic countries varies not only in degree
   but also in character, the article contributes to a deeper understanding
   of the nature of immigration opposition as well as of how different
   attitudinal profiles evolve under different contextual circumstances.},

Abstract = {Previous research has argued that while economic voting is quite
   consistently found to be an important mechanism in the rest of Canada,
   it is rather weak in Quebec. Guerin and Nadeau (1998) have demonstrated
   that whether or not citizens in Quebec vote economically depends on the
   party system. Following their lead, we expect that the presence of a
   dominant regionalist party in Quebec after 1993 (the Bloc Quebecois)
   inhibited Quebeckers from voting economically. However, our results do
   not offer evidence for this hypothesis. Furthermore, we find only weak
   evidence of economic voting being moderated by voters' attitudes towards
   Quebec independence. Our study hence suggests that the impact of
   economic accountability in Canada is not hindered by a strong regional
   party or by the salience of the issue of Quebec independence. The
   economic vote, it seems, is more stable and general than it is regularly
   argued to be.},

Abstract = {The rise of China in international affairs has prompted a vibrant debate
   among scholars; however, there is no consensus over what kind of power
   China is. This article argues that China can be seen as the
   representative of a new breed of great powers emerging in a decentered
   world. It does so by looking at China's participation in peacekeeping
   and antipiracy operations under the aegis of the United Nations. It is
   possible to see that since the early 1990s China's strategy has shifted
   from primarily aiming at being acknowledged as a great power, to trying
   to exercise its growing international authority effectively to better
   serve its expanding interests. It did so by strengthening its
   involvement through the UN in international security affairs.},

Abstract = {This study exploits exogenous policy discontinuities along state borders
   to estimate the influence of differences in local autonomy on the usage

Abstract = {The digital single market is one of the most important objectives and
   challenges for the European Union. However, given that digitalisation
   implies a borderless world it requires a different form of governance
   and has distinctive features from other aspects of the single market. In
   addition, it raises a number of practical and political issues for
   countries outside the EU, but which maintain close economic and trade
   relations with the latter The article examines the regulatory
   implications of the digital world from the point of view of states
   involved in the European Neighbourhood Policy, in particular Georgia,
   and looks into the future challenges in this process.},

Journal = {EUROPEAN POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {17},
Number = {3},
Pages = {494-518},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {This article discusses the advantages and drawbacks of a new pedagogical
   tool that is short games series. As an illustration, it introduces what
   could be called the `International Relations Games Show', a series of
   six short games that have been played with bachelor students to
   experience theories of International Relations (IR). These games were
   played twice during three academic years in IR introductory courses with
   100 students each on average. They illustrate, respectively, the logics
   of (i) Classical Realism, (ii) Neo-Realism and Neo-Liberalism, (iii)
   Neo-Marxism, (iv) Heterodox International Political Economy, (v)
   Constructivism, and (vi) Critical Theories. The article is organized in
   two parts. Part 1 discusses why short games series are potentially
   interesting pedagogical tools. It includes a reflection on students'
   evaluations of games. Part 2 develops the International Relations Games
   Show. The conclusion summarizes the main arguments and proposes ways
   forward. When adequately organized -not too long, with debriefing after
   the game and during the lectures, and with clear rules, short games
   series can improve attention, understanding, memory, general learning
   atmosphere, and favour success for all.},

Title = {Effects of Same-Sex Legislation on Attitudes toward Homosexuality},
Journal = {POLITICAL RESEARCH QUARTERLY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {71},
Number = {3},
Pages = {628-641},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Despite the long historical battle of members of the gay and lesbian
   community to gain equal rights as their heterosexual counterparts, the
   adoption of public policies at the national level that recognize
   same-sex partnerships and marriages is a relatively recent political
   development across the globe. Consequently, we know little about
   whether, and how, this type of legislation affects public attitudes
   toward homosexuality. This study examines the relationship between
   same-sex couple legislation and public opinion using data from the World
   Values Survey from the years 1989 to 2014. While previous studies
   examining this relationship in the European context have found a
   positive relationship, the results presented in this paper paint a less
   optimistic picture of the impacts that same-sex couple legislation has
   on attitudes toward homosexuality. Specifically, I find that instead of
   same-sex partnership legislation increasing favorable attitudes across
   the entire population, it only affects individuals who are already
   generally supportive of homosexuality. Implications for gay and lesbian
   rights are discussed.},

Abstract = {The impact of institutions on party system nationalization has
   traditionally been examined in a cross-national fashion. However, while
   in some cases institutional reforms may be expected to immediately
   affect party nationalization, in others, changes might take place over
   subsequent elections. In this paper, we argue that reforms affecting
   mainly elite coordination-such as decentralization-will take a longer
   time to have an impact on party system nationalization than reforms
   related to the mechanical effects of electoral laws, i.e. changes in the
   electoral system. In order to test this argument, we use
   error-correction models to test the impact of electoral reforms on party
   system nationalization in democratic elections held in 22 Western and
   Eastern European countries from 1945 to 2012. In accordance with our
   arguments, we show that both decentralization and the number of
   districts elected in the legislative power will have an impact on party
   system nationalization, but that the impact of the latter will manifest
   itself earlier.},

Abstract = {Particularly in the aftermath of the refugee crisis, the relationship
   between immigration and anti-immigrant sentiment and Euroscepticism has
   become salient in public discourse in European Union member states. The
   scientific literature has also devoted increasing attention to these
   relationships over the past dozen years. In this short research note, we
   synthesise recent research examining the immigration
   (attitudes)-Euroscepticism nexus. We find (1) that negative attitudes
   toward immigration generally trigger higher levels of Euroscepticism and
   (2) that this relationship does not apply to structural data on
   immigration. In most cases, higher immigration levels do not trigger
   more negative attitudes toward European integration. In light of the
   European refugee crisis, substantial further research could emerge on
   these issues.},

Abstract = {This article contributes to the literature on political heuristics by
   reporting two survey experiments conducted in Spain in 2014-2015 on
   party and ideology cues regarding preferences on a range of European
   Union and domestic issues in European and general elections. The
   findings reveal that party cues increase voters' competence to take
   positions on European Union issues more than ideological ones. Cues
   increase competence in a similar fashion regardless of the nature of the
   topic, although the effect of cues that parties provide on European
   Union issues seems to be stronger than that of cues on domestic
   policies. Party cueing effects are also consistent across different
   electoral arenas (national vs. European), and for all types of parties
   regardless of their age or positions toward the European Union
   integration process.},

Abstract = {Responses to the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) have been mixed. Many
   commentators have welcomed the opportunity for infrastructure
   development and projects to build economic, political and social
   connectivity across the region. Others have been openly critical or slow
   to formulate a clear position. In general, advanced economies have
   responded less positively than developing economies. This paper employs
   a constructivist approach to interpret responses to the BRI in advanced
   economies through analysis of commentary in the United States, the
   European Union, Japan, Australia and New Zealand. It identifies a
   diversity of responses within and among these economies and a strong
   ideational coherence in the frameworks used to assess the BRI. It is
   concluded that the reception of Chinese-promoted concepts in
   international affairs, like the BRI, remains challenging due to the
   dominance of liberal and realist assessments and the accompanying
   political values. This suggests a need for greater intellectual
   engagement and more substantial feedback between China and the advanced
   economies, so as to open the way for a long overdue regional
   conversation on how development is conceptualized and co-created in a
   region with diverse approaches to regional economic policy.},

Abstract = {Using a new regional database of national and European parliament
   elections on NUTS 2 level in 28 countries, we test the main theories
   explaining the electoral support for the European far right. Accounting
   for differences between the extremist (ER) and populist radical right
   (PRR), we find evidence in support of both economic insecurity and
   cultural backlash theses. The ER vote is associated mostly with economic
   insecurity and the PRR vote mostly with cultural backlash. Whereas micro
   and macro-level analyses have often produced conflicting results,
   unemployment, immigration and income inequalities have significant and
   robust effects at the meso level, indicating that the factors
   determining the far right vote might at large be operating at a
   sub-national level. In line with the ``contact{''} and
   ``salience-of-change{''} hypotheses, the effects of economic insecurity
   are more pronounced in regions that undergo sudden changes compared to
   those with high levels of immigration.},

Abstract = {The relationship between Scotland and the rest of the United Kingdom has
   become increasingly uncertain, due in part to growing levels of
   self-identified cultural difference on the part of Scots. However, this
   is a relatively new phenomenon and it is instructive to consider the
   role played by Scots in the founding or development of institutions that
   in turn have helped propagate discourses of British culture and values.
   That contribution has been particularly significant in the sphere of
   film and television. Indeed, Scotland's contribution to British film and
   television has been arguably far greater than basic demographics would
   have predicted. Has there been a discernible `Scottish' influence in the
   history and character of these institutions, and what might this mean
   for understanding British cultural identity and its more common
   alignment with Englishness?},

Abstract = {Cyberspace and the existence of the internet allows different types of
   crimes to appear. Hence, there is a need for new laws to be set with a
   collective, comprehensive, view of crime and a global understanding.
   This article studies 5 different countries' laws pertaining to
   cybercrimes namely: Jordan, Oman, Kuwait, Qatar, and Saudi Arabia. These
   different countries issued different laws at different times, some in
   2007 others are as new as 2015. The article looks at the laws from an
   academic definition of different crimes, and also describes the laws
   from a perspective of each country.},

Abstract = {This research analyzes the state of Political Science research with a
   focus on Latin America. To this aim, an unpublished database is
   presented containing articles published in Spanish and Portuguese
   journals that are included in JCR or Scimago indexes. First of all, the
   results show a discipline which is dynamic, theoretically plural, mainly
   inclined to the study of classic issues within the discipline, and with
   some methodological failures. On the other hand, it is confirmed the
   existence of very few journals where to publish, so the creation of
   specialized ones seems urgent. Furthermore, our empirical findings point
   out to the necessity of including both under-researched countries and
   relevant yet underexplored topics (e. g. corruption) in the research
   agenda. Finally, this work raises the urgency of promoting cooperation
   at institutional level.},

Abstract = {In a context of various crises in the country (political, economic,
   ethical, legal), this article aims to present a specific, that of tax
   foreclosures, which is well documented and can exemplify the others.
   Here it is argued that a part of it come from a strategy of public
   authorities to extend indefinitely such judicial actions, although
   contrary to clear legal precepts. However, the results are not favorable
   even from an economic point of view. To develop that argument, it was
   sought to use traditional but interdisciplinary dogmatic sources,
   creating the right environment to study legislation and jurisprudence of
   regency, notably a relevant decision of the Superior Court of Justice.
   In it, previous parameters have abruptly ceased to be applied, which is
   typical of a troubled time. In this environment, it was identified how
   the attorneysin-fact, as public advocates, can be fundamental in
   overcoming the crisis. The conclusion reached is the strategy of giving
   greater legal security, valuing the Democratic Rule of Law.},

Abstract = {In the past democratic presidents were removed by military coups. Since
   the return of democracy in Latin America there were numerous
   presidential interruptions, but these took place via constitutional
   mechanisms. Governments fell, but the democratic regime remained. Over
   the last three decades, the experiences of presidential dropouts have
   led to the development of a theory about presidential interruptions,
   which attempts to explain the phenomenon of new presidential instability
   in Latin America. This paper touches on seven distinct issues, in order
   to add insights to the theoretical debate on presidential interruptions.
   These issues are: 1) presidential interruption's connection with the
   theory of constitutional succession; 2) the alleged breach of the fixed
   term and independence of powers; 3) the reconsideration of the alleged
   new flexibility of the presidential system; 4) timing and rules of the
   presidential fall and the timing and rules of the president's
   replacement; 5) the situation of ``ruling gaps{''}, both in relation to
   the presidential interruption, and the president's replacement; 6) the
   so-called ``thin line{''} between the parliamentary coup and
   impeachment; 7) expectations and cycles of presidential strength and
   weakness that show a certain structural vulnerability of the system.
   These issues add to the debate by introducing new approaches to studying
   the phenomenon of presidential interruptions.},

Abstract = {This article assesses the character, role and outcomes of the Airports
   Commission. Analysing its workings from September 2012, it evaluates the
   final recommendations and then charts their subsequent public reception.
   The article claims that the Airports Commission's endeavours to
   depoliticise aviation by using reasonable' methods and impartial
   judgementsoften embodied in Howard Davies himselfhave been met with
   local resistance and political opposition, focussed on the proposal to
   expand either Heathrow or Gatwick. It exposes how the recourse to expert
   commissions offers only temporary respite for government responsibility
   and accountability in the making of hard decisions. It concludes that
   the inability to secure a binding and acceptable agreement does not just
   reside at the door of the Airports Commission, but rests also on the
   failures of political leadership and the missed opportunity' to
   articulate a sustainable vision for aviation after the 2010 moratorium
   on airport expansion in the south-east of England.},

Journal = {REVISTA DE PAZ Y CONFLICTOS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {11},
Number = {2},

Month = {JUL-DEC},
Abstract = {The paper presents a study about the potential impact of ProSavana in
   the Nacala Corridor, north of Mozambique. ProSavana is an
   agro-industrial project, originated in the trilateral cooperation
   between Japan, Brazil and Mozambique, with which it is intended to
   transform part of the north of the country. The potential impact on the
   population of the Nacala Corridor and the anticipation of possible
   violations of human rights has provoked an important social and academic
   response within and outside the country. Based on an interdisciplinary
   vocation, the article frames ProSavana according to various studies and
   documents, and addresses the problem of impact from the analysis of the
   speeches of social, peasant and human rights organizations leaders in
   Mozambique. In the same way, the confrontational strategies that the
   critical social opposition with the project is carrying out are
   addressed. In the study, 35 testimonies of social leaders and peasants
   are collected through interviews and focus groups. The results show that
   ProSavana can have serious economic, socio-cultural and environmental
   impacts in the Nacala Corridor, highlighting a possible usurpation of
   land to the peasantry, the displacement of population, and the breakdown
   of traditional ways of life, representing serious violations of human
   rights.},

Abstract = {The Trump-Kim Summit in Singapore can be regarded as a meaningful first
   step in a long journey towards complete denuclearisation of North Korea.
   At the Singapore summit, President Donald Trump and Chairman Kim Jong Un
   agreed that North Korea would denuclearise completely and that the
   United States would in return provide North Korea with security
   guarantees. However, due to political complexity of the North Korean
   nuclear issue and technical difficulties of nuclear dismantlement, the
   process towards complete denuclearisation of North Korea is expected to
   be protracted and difficult. The prospects for future US-North Korea
   nuclear negotiations will largely depend on how both countries can work
   out together the concrete steps, phases and timelines for the
   implementation of denuclearisation.},

Abstract = {Recent voting behavior literature is concerned with the consequences of
   the global financial and economic crisis. During 2008-2009, most
   European countries faced a considerable slowdown in economic growth and
   an increase in unemployment levels. Theoretically, this would lead us to
   expect strong economic effects on incumbent support. However, recent
   academic work suggests that diminishing clarity of responsibility makes
   it increasingly difficult for voters to attribute blame for economic
   outcomes, consequently making punitive voting less likely. Has the
   sanctioning-rewarding mechanism then changed over time? Was economic
   voting more or less pronounced during the crisis than it was prior to
   the economic downturn? Analyzing the European Election Studies (EES)
   data for 12 Western European countries in 1989, 1994, 2004, 2009 and
   2014, this paper finds support for neither proposition: there is very
   little abrupt change in economic effects over time. The statistical
   relationship between the economy and voting remained remarkably constant
   and was not subject to short-term fluctuations, even after the most
   dramatic economic recession in our lifetime. The stability of economic
   voting is particularly noteworthy considering that levels of voter
   dissatisfaction with national economic performance skyrocketed in 2009.},

Abstract = {To explain political parties behavior solely based on external factors,
   or exclusively on internal dynamics, isn't enough to understand the real
   causes of their actions. The current proposal considers the political
   party as a microsystem inside of the party system, which in turn is to
   be considered as a part of the political system as a whole. These three
   systems are constantly changing as a result of the feedback that happens
   between themselves and the internal dynamics that happen in each one of
   them. Thanks to this analisis model integrating pre-existing theories,
   we can come to a more satisfying understanding of party behaviour in the
   multiple competitive contexts of contemporary politics. This proposal
   includes identifying the multiple systemic elements to be considered.},

   experiments},
Journal = {RESEARCH \& POLITICS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {5},
Number = {2},
Month = {JUN 26},
Abstract = {Twenty-five years after Entman (1993) argued that the framing paradigm
   was fractured, debates about the value of framing as a theoretical
   concept are still ongoing. In particular, discussions focus on the use
   of: (a) equivalence frames (i.e., frames with logical equivalence such
   as gain and loss frames) versus emphasis frames (i.e., frames that
   emphasize different dimensions of an issue); and (b) generic frames
   (frames that are applicable to multiple issues) versus issue-specific
   frames (frames that are applicable to one issue only). We conducted a
   systematic review on the use of these frame types in 21st-century
   political-framing experiments (N = 372) to establish whether and how
   scholars' positions in these debates have changed across disciplines and
   over time. Results demonstrate that emphasis frames are more popular
   than equivalence frames, and that a slight majority of frames are
   issue-specific rather than generic. Moreover, frame preferences differ
   across disciplines and have hardly changed over time. This study thus
   shows that debates about what types of frames should be studied have had
   little influence on scholars' frame choices across disciplines in
   previous research on political framing.},

Abstract = {This study investigates whether citizens' concerns about the EU's impact
   on social security are a distinct source of Euroscepticism. By analysing
   data from the European Values Study 2008, we show that citizens
   differentiate between domain-specific fears about European integration
   (i.e. about social security, national sovereignty, culture, payments and
   jobs), meaning that they cannot be reduced completely to a general fear
   about European integration. Furthermore, socioeconomic determinants and
   ideological position are more important in explaining citizens' fear
   about the EU's impact on social security than in explaining their
   generalised fear of European integration. In countries with higher
   social spending, citizens are more fearful of European integration in
   general, however, social spending does not affect fears about social
   security more strongly than it affects other EU-related fears.},

Abstract = {African politics long revolved around `personal rulers' who either
   overstayed in office or were quickly ousted by coups. The multiparty
   reforms of the 1990s were meant to change and regularise the way in
   which African rulers access and are removed from office. There is,
   however, a dearth of systematic data through which the evolution and
   implications of leadership transitions can be examined. We thus built a
   comprehensive Africa Leadership Change (ALC) dataset covering all 54
   countries in the continent from 1960 to 2015. The dataset provides
   information for all leaders who held power in the region, the modes of
   access to leadership and several other key election and regime
   variables. An exploratory analysis illustrates how Africa's reforms
   affected the dynamics and timing of leaders' replacement, as well as
   their socio-economic implications. A comparison with existing datasets
   shows that ALC is more suitable for investigating leadership transitions
   in Africa.},

Abstract = {Most foundational theories of congressional representation were
   developed during an era of less polarized and less partisan politics.
   These theories viewed the incumbency advantage as buttressed by the fact
   that some constituents were willing to support legislators from the
   opposite party because of their ``home styles.{''} But in an era of
   policy immoderation in Congress, this perspective leads to an assumption
   that citizens evaluate their members of Congress based on what those
   legislators do for them individually, rather than what they do for their
   districts more broadly. In this paper, we ask whether citizens take the
   interests of their fellow constituents into account when evaluating
   their members of Congress. Using both survey data and an experiment, we
   uncover support for the notion that citizens take a more communal view
   of representation as at least part of their evaluations of their
   representatives. This suggests individuals may have a more nuanced
   understanding of representation than purely self-interested approaches
   tend to assume.},

Abstract = {In the 20 years after its introduction, the principal-agent model has
   seen increasing use to study political processes in virtually all policy
   domains in which the EU is active. Relaxing the strict assumptions that
   guided the original economic applications has greatly widened the scope
   for potential applications. This very phenomenon has also created an
   existential challenge to the model's contemporary use, which is
   combining the reductionist aims of the model (from which it derives its
   strength) with the complex empirical settings to which it is
   increasingly applied. To facilitate this balancing exercise, we propose
   a two-step approach to principal-agent analysis, in which the mapping of
   the principal-agent proof relation is separated from the effective
   analysis that examines the reasons, modalities and consequences of
   delegation and control in the EU. In doing so, we show how the
   principal-agent model can continue to provide new insights at the
   various stages of the research process.},

Abstract = {This article examines whether labor unions punish incumbent Democrats
   who vote for free-trade bills in Congress. We theorize that punishment
   is a risky strategy for interest groups that prefer one party over the
   other. Therefore, interest groups must be substantially affected by
   decline in party support to punish. Consistent with our theory, we find
   important differences between public- and private-sector unions in their
   willingness to punish. Although public-sector unions articulate
   opposition to free trade, they do not follow through with either
   deterrence (withholding contributions to send a signal) or
   incapacitation (withholding contributions to replace the wayward
   candidate with a more supportive one). Private-sector unions,
   specifically unions that organize trade-vulnerable industrial workers,
   do attempt to punish Democrats via deterrence. The estimated deterrence
   effect is a 6 percent reduction in contributions. This study improves on
   previous studies by modeling punishment across several congressional
   sessions and multiple trade votes. The results reveal new insights into
   labor's approach to declining protectionism among congressional
   Democrats.},

Abstract = {This article investigates civic-political and cognitive participation as
   they play out in democratic theory. Its core purpose is to develop a
   conceptual-normative critique of the presupposition in liberal
   democratic theory that these logics are mutually reinforcing and
   complementary. This misunderstanding of a theoretical ambivalence
   contributes to inhibiting constructive assessment of
   epistocratic{*}technocratic frameworks of democratic interpretation and
   theory. I demonstrate that these logics circulate contrasting views of
   democratic power and legitimacy and should be disentangled to make sense
   of liberal democratic theoretical and political spaces. This critique is
   then fed into a political-epistemological interrogation of post-truth
   and alt-facts rhetorical registers in contemporary liberal democratic
   life, concluding that neither logic of participation can harbor this
   unanticipated and fundamentally nonaligned way of doing liberal
   democratic democracy.},

Abstract = {Studies of the ``delegated state{''} highlight the growing role of
   nongovernmental organizations to fulfill public purposes. We argue that
   America's delegated state has taken two distinct forms: a civic-public
   model prominent in the North and Midwest and a very different
   religious-private model more evident in the South and the West.
   Distinctive regional legacies rooted in European immigration, religion,
   race, and the timing of urban growth gave rise to diverse organizational
   configurations for assisting the poor in different parts of the country.
   As a consequence, the institutions for assisting the poor are weaker in
   the growing regions of the South and Mountain West.},

Abstract = {President Trump's decision to withdraw the United States from the Paris
   Agreement on Climate Change is both a major reversal of the Obama
   administration's climate policy and a huge blow to global climate
   governance. The comprehensive regression of President Trump's climate
   policy manifests mainly in three aspects: abolition of the clean energy
   plan, exit from the Paris Agreement, and a return to traditional energy
   policies, which reflect the cyclical and volatile nature of the U.S.
   climate policy. With its lasting negative impact, the China-U.S.
   cooperative leadership in global climate governance is stranded. In this
   light, China should strive for a bigger role in leading global efforts
   to address climate change and enhance cooperation through various
   mechanisms. Under the current U.S. policy environment, China can still
   strengthen cooperation with the United States in such fields as
   traditional energy, infrastructure investment, global energy market, and
   green finance.},

Abstract = {International wars and interstate rivalry have been at the center of our
   understanding of the origin and expansion of state capacity. This
   article describes an alternative path to the development of state
   capacity rooted in domestic political conflict. Under conditions of
   intra-elite conflict, political rulers seize upon the temporary weakness
   of their rivals, expropriate their assets, and consolidate authority.
   Because this political consolidation increases rulers' chances of
   surviving an economic elite's challenge, it enhances their incentives to
   develop state capacity. These ideas are evaluated in post-revolutionary
   Mexico, where commodity price shocks induced by the Great Depression
   affected the local economic elite differentially. Negative shocks lead
   to increased asset expropriation and substantially higher investments in
   state capacity, which persist to the present.},

Abstract = {Radical parties have been found to succeed under conditions of mass
   polarization. It is argued that their message resonates better with
   voters at the extremes of an ideological spectrum. This paper
   investigates if the reverse also holds, meaning that radical parties may
   contribute to the polarization of the public. I test this claim in the
   Netherlands, a country that has experienced the rise of populist radical
   right parties since 2002, using a synthetic control model built with a
   pool of comparable countries and Eurobarometer survey data. Results show
   that, after the rise of Pim Fortuyn and Geert Wilders, the level of
   polarization among the Dutch public increased more than it otherwise
   would have. These findings contribute to understanding the connection
   between elite- and mass-level polarization, and the consequences of
   populist radical right parties' emergence in Western Europe.},

Abstract = {The objective of this paper is to analyze the performance of the
   Argentine Communist Party in the trade union world after the coup d'etat
   of 1943 and until 1946. This process still has multiple edges to
   investigate because, among other characteristics, it has been evaluated
   repeatedly in terms general, sometimes abstract or mostly in their
   political aspects. To reconstruct the union party proposal, it is
   necessary to address, with the appropriate methodological reading, the
   official organs of the PC such as Orientacion, La Hora, El Patriota and
   Unidad Nacional. Our intention lies in investigating the construction of
   the strategic gremial party position in the face of changes in the
   political scenario of Argentina and the formation of new actors in the
   labor movement. In this journey, we will seek to contribute to a greater
   knowledge about the circumstances in which the drift of, until then, one
   of the main ideological currents with insertion among the workers began.},

Abstract = {Radical Right Parties (RRPs) consistently attract more male than female
   voters. Puzzlingly, there is no equally consistent gender difference in
   policy preferences on the main issues of these parties - immigration and
   minority integration policies. Indeed, in some countries, for instance
   the UK, women have as restrictive immigration policy preferences as men,
   but are still less likely to vote for RRPs. This article proposes a
   novel answer to this gender gap puzzle that emphasizes the normative
   conflicts about prejudice and discrimination that surround RRPs across
   Europe. It uses representative survey data to show, for the first time,
   that women are more likely than men to be motivated to control
   prejudice, and that this difference in motivations has political
   consequences. More specifically, the study demonstrates that the higher
   prevalence of internal motivation to control prejudice among women
   accounts for the gender gap in voting for RRPs that become trapped in
   conflicts over discrimination and prejudice. Voting patterns for RPPs
   that have been able to defuse normative concerns about prejudice, such
   as the Progress Party currently in government in Norway, are different.},

Abstract = {Indonesia's response to the 2016 UNCLOS tribunal ruling was
   underwhelming, even as a nonclaimant in the South China Sea disputes.
   Given its maritime geography and interests, the response is symptomatic
   of the country's underdevelopment of an archipelagic foreign policyone
   where the entire foreign policy system, from its bureaucracy, doctrine,
   and strategy, should be geared to secure and defend its external
   maritime interests. This article further argues that the authoritarian
   New Order regime (1966-1998) repressed the development of an
   archipelagic foreign policy in two ways: (1) the army-dominated foreign
   policy establishment deprioritized external maritime interests and (2)
   the infusion of the National Resilience (Ketahanan Nasional) concept
   into the Archipelagic Outlook (Wawasan Nusantara) doctrine as a regime
   maintenance tool further domesticated what could have been a
   geopolitical outlook. These authoritarian legacies put Indonesia's
   foreign policy on a path-dependent trajectory that even President Joko
   Widodo's Global Maritime Fulcrum could not break.},

Abstract = {The 2016 referendum vote to leave the European Union (EU) brought about
   significant change in the policy and strategy of the Conservative Party.
   Despite David Cameron's resignation, these dramatic shifts have not been
   matched by changes in personnel or dominant faction as MPs who voted
   Remain continue to outnumber those who voted Leave at the top echelons
   of the party. 140 Conservative MPs, many with a record of rebellion on
   EU issues, voted Leave, but among Remain-voting MPs were many `reluctant
   Remainers'. All except Ken Clarke subsequently voted for the Bill
   triggering Article 50 but, in a party long divided over the EU issue,
   the institutional support mechanisms underpinning policy change are
   fragile. Conservative divisions have also changed as soft and hard
   Brexiteers disagree over the withdrawal process and the UK's future
   relationship with the EU. With the Conservatives now a minority
   government, parliament offers various ways in which MPs can register
   dissent and influence policy, from amending core Brexit legislation to
   supporting critical Select Committee reports.},

Abstract = {Scholarship on democratic responsiveness focuses onwhether political
   outcomes reflect public opinion but overlooks attitudes toward how power
   is used to achieve those policies. We argue that public attitudes toward
   unilateral action lead to negative evaluations of presidents who
   exercise unilateral powers and policies achieved through their use.
   Evidence from two studies supports our argument. In three nationally
   representative survey experiments conducted across a range of policy
   domains, we find that the public reacts negatively when policies are
   achieved through unilateral powers instead of through legislation passed
   by Congress. We further show these costs are greatest among respondents
   who support the president's policy goals. In an observational study, we
   show that attitudes toward unilateral action in the abstract affect how
   respondents evaluate policies achieved through unilateral action by
   presidents from Lincoln to Obama. Our results suggest that public
   opinion may constrain presidents' use of unilateral powers.},

Abstract = {This article considers Russian income inequality in relation to the
   trend toward rising inequality in the U.S. and in most parts of the
   world. Income and wealth inequality in Russia has been rising except in
   periods when the economy is in recession, and wealth inequality in
   Russia is now highest in the world. The analysis shows that inequality
   trends in Russia share some characteristics with other developed and
   developing economies, including technological change, increased
   integration in the global economy, and the capitalization of rent
   streams. Financialization and dependence on natural resource extraction
   contribute strongly to both cross-sectional and cross-regional
   inequality in Russia. The absence of institutions for aggregating broad
   competing social interests whether corporatist or partisan restricts the
   capacity of the political system to set agreed rules governing the
   distribution of the burdens and benefits of economic growth. As in other
   political systems, both democratic and authoritarian, high inequality
   undermines the state's ability to provide public goods that would
   contribute both to inclusive economic growth and a growing middle class.},

   in psychology. Most existing work on war duration, however, neglects
   psychology, and even when psychological biases are explicitly
   incorporated into theories, their implications typically simply
   exacerbate rationalist factors impeding settlement. I argue that three
   central difficulties complicate efforts to apply insights from
   psychology to explain war duration. First, many psychological biases
   produce empirically intractable predictions because core concepts cannot
   be operationalized clearly. Second, common psychological biases that
   might produce extended violence, such as sunk cost bias, do not produce
   good explanations for shorter conflicts. Third, in the few cases in
   which psychology produces compelling hypotheses, extant rationalist
   arguments point in the same direction.},

Abstract = {This article aims to explore whether-and if so, how-the EU is perceived
   as a normative power (NPE) in Turkey in the context of deteriorating
   Turkey-EU relations. By adopting the Habermasian understanding that
   legitimacy is a prerequisite for NPE and through employing a focus group
   methodology novel to NPE research, the article finds that a certain
   segment of the Turkish public views the EU as a normative power,
   suggesting that claims for the existence of NPE need to be qualified
   both by the level of analysis and by the local context which comprises
   socio-cultural factors as well as government/opposition dynamics. The
   article also shows that contestation of the EU's actorness takes place
   over moral and ethical-political arguments rather than utility-based
   debates, demonstrating that polarization is noticeably present as far as
   the EU's norm ativity is concerned,. and not on the perceived costs and
   benefits of EU accession.},

Abstract = {What explains the extension of greater rights to traditionally
   marginalized minorities? This article compares the extension of legal
   equality to lebian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) people in
   Mexico and the United States with a focus on the legal recognition of
   same-sex relationships. A national-level comparison of gay rights in
   Mexico and the United States presents a theoretical puzzle: most
   theories predict that the United States would have more egalitarian
   policies than Mexico, but in fact, Mexico has provided greater legal
   equality for LGBT people for a longer time than the United States. A
   subnational analysis of equal relationship rights in the United States
   and Mexico provides evidence to support social movement and partisan
   theories of minority rights. We find that religion plays a different
   role in Mexico than in the United States. The different findings at the
   national and subnational levels suggest the importance of subnational
   comparative analysis in heterogeneous federal systems.},

Abstract = {Party cohesion is a crucial aspect of parliamentary systems, and it
   varies across time, parties and systems. To explain these variations,
   scholars have set forth the influence of macro-level and
   individual-level factors. Although party-level factors have also been
   considered, the role of party family has been overlooked. This research
   seeks to fill this gap. To this end, I focus on one dimension of
   cohesion: the extent to which legislators have internalized the norm of
   party loyalty. The concept of party family permits to investigate the
   effect of party origin and party ideology beyond a policy-based approach
   and left-right dimension. Using attitudinal data of 829 parliamentarians
   elected in 14 European national assemblies, the analysis uncovers a
   party family effect, particularly in the green and radical right
   parties. The results suggest that a greater attention should be directed
   towards party family as a determinant factor of legislative cohesion.},

Abstract = {The Italian 2013 election ended the period of bipolarism that
   characterized the so-called `Second Republic', and paved the way for new
   parties such as the Five Star Movement. We investigate that election,
   which took place after the technocratic government led by Mario Monti,
   through the analytical lenses of the retrospective theory of economic
   voting applied at the provincial level. Local unemployment rates shape
   the electoral performances of those parties that were more supportive
   and sympathetic to the caretaker executive, thus confirming a
   distinction between incumbent and non-incumbent even in that critical
   and politically undecided election. We further contribute to the
   literature on retrospective voting by relaxing the locally untenable
   assumption of independence among the units. Making use of spatial
   regression models, we demonstrate the relevance of both the internal and
   contiguous economies, and their relative impact due to the different
   size of the provinces.},

Abstract = {Are police agencies less likely to use torture in democracies than in
   non-democracies? Much empirical research has shown that democracies are
   less likely to engage in torture in general, but most of this research
   does not distinguish among victim types or state agencies. Using the
   Ill-Treatment and Torture (ITT) Data, we focus on police agencies and
   evaluate whether they are less likely to use torture against
   (separately) political dissidents, criminals, and marginalized
   communities. Using logistic regressions with random effects, we find
   that the well-established and relatively high level of democracies'
   respect for the rights of dissidents extends to police agencies as well.
   However, we find weaker statistical evidence that police agencies in
   democracies are less likely to use torture against criminals, and no
   evidence that they are less likely to torture marginalized communities.
   Our results suggest that one of the most robust empirical facts in the
   literature must be qualified. The protection from violence offered by
   democratic institutions does not seem to generalize beyond violence
   directly related to political competition and dissent.},

Abstract = {General attitudes of citizens toward the European Union (EU) have
   frequently been analyzed. However, European integration represents a
   multifaceted process and citizen attitudes may well depend on the
   precise nature of policy proposals. In this contribution, we analyze the
   determinants of specific support for three prominent EU economic policy
   proposals: the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership,
   Eurobonds, and a EU financial transaction tax. Drawing on Eurobarometer
   data, we find that four standard explanatory factorsideology, utility,
   identity, and cuesalso affect support for these policies. However, they
   do so in systematically different ways, depending on whether the
   policies primarily represent positive or negative integration and
   market-making or market-correcting, on how they affect national
   sovereignty, and on how they are affected by complexity and salience.},

Abstract = {Turkey's relations with the EU date back to 1958. In this article, 60
   years ofrelations have been classified into seven periods whose defining
   characteristics and themes can be resumed as Period of Delving into
   Different Designs (1958-1962); Period of Decisions: The Ankara Agreement
   (1963-1979); Period of Degradation, Distancing, and then Democratization
   (1980-1986); Period of Disequilibrating Conditions and New Drives
   (1987-1998), Period of Durable Determination (1999-2005); Period of
   Dissonance, Discouragement, and Deception (2006-2017); Period of Doubts
   and New Debates (2018- ... ). Finally, the question of where doubts and
   debates faced today may lead to is discussed. The changing faces of
   Turkey and the EU, the growing divides, and the ideological and
   political changes occurring within both render it difficult to assess
   what the future holds for all.},

   study of the Anti-Media Monopoly Movement in Taiwan, it investigates how
   the activists' use of social and mainstream media contributed towards
   their collective action and mediated visibility. We argue that the
   effectiveness of social media activism is augmented by the activists'
   engagement in protest actions and tactics catering to news media logics.
   Through their hybrid media practices, the activists were able to
   mobilise local and overseas groups into forms of collective and
   connective action and amplify the impact of protests.},

Title = {The Three Waves of Party System Institutionalisation Studies: A Multi-
   or Uni-Dimensional Concept?},
Journal = {POLITICAL STUDIES REVIEW},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {16},
Number = {1},
Pages = {60-72},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Since Mainwaring and Scully's resurrection of the concept in 1995, party
   system institutionalisation has become something of a buzzword to which
   many refer without a proper definition. Indeed, most scholars simply
   assume that its meaning is clear and unproblematic, focusing all
   subsequent efforts on developing operational indicators, but without
   really concerning themselves with its conceptual refinement. However, an
   in-depth literature review of all major works dealing with the concept
   reveals that in reality there is very little agreement on what party
   system institutionalisation actually is or how it should be measured. In
   fact, since Huntington introduced the notion of institutionalisation
   some 50years ago, party system institutionalisation has been
   characterised as a multi-dimensional (mostly four, but also three and
   two) as well as a uni-dimensional (around stability) concept. Now that
   half a century has passed, the time has come to look back and, with the
   benefit of hindsight, take stock of the way party system
   institutionalisation has been conceptualised and operationalised, trying
   to distinguish both commonalities and discordances, while looking at
   what still needs to be done. In order to do so, we will distinguish
   three different (both discrete and thematic) waves of party system

Abstract = {This article engages genealogy as a form of critique in International
   Relations. It demonstrates that Foucault's genealogy has had an
   important, albeit hitherto unexamined, impact on how critique is
   understood in post-structuralist International Relations. Specifically,
   the article argues that a genealogical disposition tends to inscribe
   violence as foundational to the human condition, and genealogically
   informed empirical applications in International Relations risk
   reproducing this gesture. In the first part, the article returns to the
   first generation of post-structuralist International Relations and also
   examines examples of contemporary scholarship using frameworks of
   governmentality and biopolitics. The second part of the article traces
   the problem of ontologically inscribing violence back to Foucault's
   genealogical phase. Drawing on the work of John Milbank, the article
   then contrasts a genealogical ontology of violence with one that refuses
   violence as foundational. The article ends by arguing that empirical
   scholarship drawing on governmentality and biopolitics should be careful
   not to read the genealogical ontology of violence into their analyses of
   global political life.},

Journal = {IDP-INTERNET LAW AND POLITICS},
Year = {2018},
Number = {26},
Pages = {3-14},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {The new Law 39/2015 conceives the Administration by default as
   e-Administration and gives a twist to the obligation to interact
   electronically. With the new law, the administration has to be
   electronic by default and the consent of citizens is no longer required
   for the electronic relationship, although they have the right to choose
   and change the face-to-face or electronic channel, but this choice can
   be presumed. We have moved from the right to the obligation to
   communicate electronically with the administration, almost by default.
   We analyse the possibility of imposing the electronic relationship
   through regulatory standards under certain requirements and material
   budgets. However, neither the law nor the courts are demanding nor
   guaranteeing, against which the author relies on guarantees against
   possible discrimination or helplessness. Likewise, we analyse the fact
   that some collectives are obliged ``in any case{''} by law to interact
   electronically and precisely all those obliged to the electronic
   relationship do not have the right to be assisted. Finally, we consider
   the consequences of the failure to comply with the duty to interact
   electronically, which has been regulated by Law 30/2015 in a very
   improvable way and with little guarantee.},

Title = {All spending is not equal: European Union public spending, policy
   feedback and citizens' support for the EU},
Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL RESEARCH},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {57},
Number = {1},
Pages = {3-23},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {While public support is central to the problem-solving capacity of the
   European Union, we know little about when and why the EU can increase
   its citizens' support through spending. Extensive research finds that
   citizens living in countries that are net beneficiaries of the EU budget
   are more supportive of the EU, assuming that citizens care equally about
   all forms of spending. It is argued in this article, however, that the
   amount of spending is only part of the story. Understanding the effects
   of spending on support requires a consideration of how transfers are
   spent. Drawing on policy feedback theories in comparative politics, it
   is shown that support for the EU is a function of the fit between the
   spending area and economic need in individuals' immediate living
   context. Results from a statisticalanalysis of EU spending on human
   capital, infrastructure, agriculture, energy and environmental
   protection in 127 EU regions over the period 2001-2011 corroborate this
   argument. As the EU and other international organisations become
   increasingly publicly contested, the organisations themselves may
   increasingly try to shore up public support through spending, but they
   will only be successful under specific conditions.},

   Evidence from 49 Field Experiments},

Volume = {112},

Abstract = {Significant theories of democratic accountability hinge on how political
   campaigns affect Americans' candidate choices. We argue that the best
   estimate of the effects of campaign contact and advertising on
   Americans' candidates choices in general elections is zero. First, a
   systematic meta-analysis of 40 field experiments estimates an average
   effect of zero in general elections. Second, we present nine original
   field experiments that increase the statistical evidence in the
   literature about the persuasive effects of personal contact tenfold.
   These experiments' average effect is also zero. In both existing and our
   original experiments, persuasive effects only appear to emerge in two
   rare circumstances. First, when candidates take unusually unpopular
   positions and campaigns invest unusually heavily in identifying
   persuadable voters. Second, when campaigns contact voters long before
   election day and measure effects immediatelyalthough this early
   persuasion decays. These findings contribute to ongoing debates about
   how political elites influence citizens' judgments.},

   1964. By focusing on the legality of nuclear testing during peacetime,
   the AALCC report was able to advance its objective of delegitimizing the
   possession of nuclear weapons without confronting the issue directly, a
   battle that militarily weak countries could not win. Using international
   law to compensate for political marginality was a novel anti-nuclear
   weapons strategy that would be adopted by other campaigns in decades to
   come. The article offers a critical genealogy of the dominant narrative
   of international arms control by situating the AALCC report within the
   historical context of decolonization and pointing out the importance of
   taking seriously the influence of global public opinion on superpower
   negotiating tactics. This approach adds a new dimension to our
   understanding of the global pressures shaping negotiations over the
   Partial Test Ban Treaty.},

Abstract = {Research finds that intergovernmental organizations (IGOs) influence
   domestic public opinion on foreign policy matters. This article applies
   these insights to crisis bargaining, arguing that IGO support will help
   democratic leaders prevail in crises, but it will have little systematic
   benefit for nondemocratic leaders. IGO support helps democratic leaders
   generate leverage by increasing domestic support for their policies. In
   turn, leaders with greater support will be more risk acceptant in crises
   and put greater pressure on their adversaries to make concessions. Such
   leaders will also face an increased likelihood of domestic punishment if
   they back down after receiving IGO approval. In contrast, nondemocratic
   leaders will see little advantage following IGO backing because domestic
   actors have fewer opportunities and face higher costs for punishing
   their leaders. The argument is empirically assessed on international
   crises from 1945 to 2006. The findings indicate strong and consistent
   support for theoretical expectations advanced in the article.},

Abstract = {This article analyzes the professional careers of legislators who
   conclude their terms and retire from electoral politics. The study uses
   a mixed-methods approach, drawing on data from interviews, media
   reports, secondary source material, and an original database of
   Ecuadorian legislators' political careers between 1979 and 2007.
   Counterintuitively, the findings suggest that nearly half of Ecuadorian
   deputies have what Schlesinger (1966) termed discreet legislative
   careers. In addition, the article argues that weak political party
   institutionalization, understood as the monopolization of candidate
   selection mechanisms by party leaders, explains this type of political
   behavior. Following this theoretical argument, which contradicts the
   theories of electoral connection and political ambition, discreet
   political careers appear to constitute a pattern of systematic political
   behavior in some Latin American legislatures.},

Title = {Does Rape Culture Predict Rape? Evidence from US Newspapers, 2000-2013},

Abstract = {We offer the first quantitative analysis of rape culture in the United
   States. Observers have long worried that biased news coverage of rape -
   which blames victims, empathizes with perpetrators, implies consent, and
   questions victims' credibility - may deter victims from coming forward,
   and ultimately increase the incidence of rape. We present a theory of
   how rape culture might shape the preferences and choices of
   perpetrators, victims and law enforcement, and test this theory with
   data on news stories about rape published in U.S. newspapers between
   2000 and 2013. We find that rape culture in the media predicts both the
   frequency of rape and its pursuit through the local criminal justice
   system. In jurisdictions where rape culture was more prevalent, there
   were more documented rape cases, but authorities were less vigilant in
   pursuing them.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF POLITICAL IDEOLOGIES},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {23},
Number = {2},
Pages = {157-182},
Abstract = {This article reconstructs the concept of right-wing
   extremism/radicalism. Using Mudde's influential 1995 study as a
   foundation, it first canvasses the recent academic literature to explore
   how the concept has been described and defined. It suggests that,
   despite the frequent warnings that we lack an unequivocal definition of
   this concept, there is actually a high degree of consensus amongst the
   definitions put forward by different scholars. However, it argues that
   the characteristics mentioned in some of the definitions have not been
   organized meaningfully. It, therefore, moves on to distinguish between
   the defining properties of right-wing extremism/radicalism and the
   accompanying ones, and in so doing it advances a minimal definition of
   the concept as an ideology that encompasses authoritarianism,
   anti-democracy and exclusionary and/or holistic nationalism.},

Abstract = {How can we understand the role of secrecy in the making of the European

   of functional necessity for policy-makers and actually compatible with
   good governance. Moreover, we must not put too much stock in
   transparency alone in that the relationship between secrecy and
   transparency is not zero-sum historically, transparency has sometimes
   been an instrument of control and domination. The article considers the
   case of the Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP) to shed light on
   what kind of secrecy exists in the foreign policy area, and argues that
   this is mainly a combination of functional and compound secrecy.},

Abstract = {Taking into account a discursive dimension of populism as a political
   phenomenon, this article debates how the logic of online communication
   enhances features of populism on the public and political representative
   interactions. This is shown both on the populist phenomenon and on
   expressions of monitoring and inspection of democratic institutions. The
   article's objective is to realize an approximation of the debate of
   populist communication with the theory of monitory democracy, and for
   this, the communication on social networking sites is used as common
   thread. The features of relations between representatives and those
   represented on both perspectives are articulated through a bibliographic
   review which considers a classic and theoretical literature and some
   results of recent empirical studies. In conclusion notes, some common
   features discussed in the article are highlighted, like a way the
   communication on social media sites attends and enhances the logic
   populist of the political communication and the crisis of institutional
   representativeness in the contemporary democracies.},

Title = {Detention of Child Asylum Seekers in the Pursuit of State Interests: A
   Comparison of the Australian and EU Approaches},
Journal = {NORDIC JOURNAL OF HUMAN RIGHTS},

Abstract = {The widespread use of detention of asylum seekers as a form of
   controlling borders and migration is an acknowledged reality that
   carries a particular significance in cases where children are involved.
   Many studies provide evidence on the detrimental impact of detention,
   especially when this measure affects particularly vulnerable persons.
   This article is an inquiry into the detention of child asylum seekers in
   Australia and the European Union (EU). The right to liberty in the
   asylum context and the protection needs of children are addressed from a
   legal and policy perspective. The two examined situations display
   significant differences, yet many commonalities can also be traced in
   the increasingly restrictive approach to migration favoured by many
   states. This paper builds on existing arguments and evidence by
   demonstrating how detention of asylum seeking children has become a
   matter of policy rather than a measure of last resort, with children not
   seen first as children, but as detainable foreign subjects. Hence, this
   analysis questions the logic behind the capacity of states to detain
   children due to their migration status and identifies relevant
   protection gaps within the Australian and EU spheres.},

Abstract = {Economic underdevelopment has become a problem in many countries,
   including Turkey. The importance of the ``human'' factor, which is at
   the core of relevant problems in Ottoman-Turkish society, has not been
   investigated in detail. In this context, this paper has two aims that
   are closely related to each other. The first, based on the perspectives
   of Sabri F. Ulgener and Idris Kucukomer, is to identify the reasons
   behind economic underdevelopment in Ottoman-Turkish society. The second
   is to understand the importance of the human factor in Turkey's
   sustainable socio-economic development. This paper emphasizes material
   and spiritual rationales, which may disable the human factor.},

Abstract = {Based on archives, interviews, and testimonies, this study aims to
   follow the trajectory of Jacques de Chalendar, a senior official from
   the Finance Inspectorate during the French ``May 68{''} events. This
   Gaullist aristocrat, at the time in disgrace, took advantage of the
   crisis situation to become an expert on the matter of university reform.
   He succeeded in being recruited into the two cabinets of the National
   Ministry of Education that had replaced the initial one. This individual
   case exemplifies the possible effects of the ``events{''} on a specific
   biography. It highlights the role of individuals, in this case
   responsible for educational policy, in the course of the events. The
   study of this trajectory and its encounter with this particular
   historical moment contributes to the sociology of policy-making in the
   context of a crisis.},

Journal = {NEW PERSPECTIVES},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {26},
Number = {1},
Pages = {63-85},
Abstract = {Who is the real Kafka? What do his writings really mean? These are the
   questions that have dominated Kafka scholarship, which has predominantly
   focused on issues of the author's identity and the meaning of his
   writings. As the heirs of a modern metaphysics that posits the existence
   of an objectively rational and free subject, we - including many Kafka
   scholars - have generally assumed that there is a true self, that reason
   enables access to universally verifiable knowledge, and that this
   subject presupposes and authorizes the works of knowledge, art, and
   cultural productions that bears the subject's name. It is time to ask,
   however, whether the metaphysical approach to Kafka and his writings
   obscured more than it has illuminated? What if, instead, we abandon the
   metaphysical search for the true Kafka? There is now an emerging
   postmodern account of Kafka's subjectivity and the dynamic, discursive
   relationship between the construction of his subjectivity and the
   production of his writings. Utilizing Foucault's interrogation of
   metaphysical subjectivity, I investigate Kafka's voluminous letters and
   diaries as the effects of disciplinary power and the vehicles through
   which resistance to this power is pressed into the service of aesthetic
   self-creation.},

Abstract = {Previous research suggests that female politicians face higher standards
   in public life, perhaps in part because female voters expect more from
   female politicians than from male politicians. Most of this research is
   based on observational evidence. We assess the relationship between
   accountability and gender using a novel survey vignette experiment
   fielded in the United Kingdom in which voters choose between a
   hypothetical incumbent (who could be male or female, corrupt or
   noncorrupt) and another candidate. We do not find that female
   politicians face significantly greater punishment for misconduct.
   However, the effect of politician gender on punishment varies by voter
   gender, with female voters in particular more likely to punish female
   politicians for misconduct. Our findings have implications for research
   on how descriptive representation affects electoral accountability and
   on why corruption tends to correlate negatively with women's
   representation.},

Abstract = {The notion of ``extremism,{''} we argue, can be understood as an element

   necessitates robust critical theoretical attention. As part of this

   dimensions of Leftist ``extremism,{''} reading and retrieving this
   material in light of its utopian significance. Here, we examine far-Left
   extremism that deals with the utopian re-making of the subject, what
   might be called the ``revolutionary anthropology{''} found in far-Left
   work. Exploring some of the historic twists and turns of this
   revolutionary anthropology, drawing on the work of Luc Boltanski and
   associates, we suggest three distinctive facets of this renewed critical
   bearing within contemporary far-Left thought: insurrectionary
   immediatism, a new anti-foundationalist collectivism, and a theological
   turn. Attention to the sphere of revolutionary anthropology, we hope,
   might help us think the subject(s) able to not only resist the current
   social order but also to realise a new one.},

Abstract = {In the 1930s, activists fought for the protection of civil rights in the
   Republic of Finland, expanding the notion of rights to include also
   categories of people who had been previously excluded, such as political
   prisoners, the mentally ill, and foreign refugees. Two of these
   activists were the editor of the journal Tulenkantajat, Erkki Vala, and
   the chair of the League of Human Rights in Finland, Vaino Lassila. Their
   usage of the concept `human rights', drawing from the traditions of
   liberal humanism, Christian anarchism and the socialist labour movement,
   is analysed in the national and international context of the interwar
   era. During the 1930s, Erkki Vala increasingly used the concept `human
   rights' in ways that seem to predate the so-called starting point of
   modern human rights discourse in the 1940s. He met with compact
   resistance from the authorities, which contributed to his political
   marginalisation and radicalisation. This article shows that the notion
   of universal human rights was not unthinkable before the end of the
   Second World War, but it was heavily politicised and controversial even
   in a democratic country such as the Republic of Finland.},

   1975, when extensive planning took place for the possibility of a vote
   to leave the European Community. However, there has been little in the
   way of detailed analysis of the contingency planning undertaken in 1975.
   Using archival evidence of the Wilson government's preparations, this
   article highlights the complex challenge that withdrawal would have
   posed for the UK in 1975, the tensions that existed between the
   political imperative for a swift withdrawal, in the event of a leave
   vote, and the civil service's concerns as to whether such a withdrawal
   was deliverable. Finally, it shows how dependent the UK's position would
   have been on the approach taken by the other members of the EC.},

Abstract = {Russia traditionally maintains close political and economic ties with
   the foreign countries of the Baltic region, which is the key factor
   connecting the region into a single whole. However, there is substantial
   difference in the socio-economic landscape of these countries, as well
   as in the intensity of Russia's relations with each of them. The
   contradictions in the relations between Russia and the West are
   manifested here as well. Strengthening ties is mutually beneficial for
   all countries in the region, but objective and subjective obstacles
   often arise for their development. In the article, in the context of the
   geopolitical changes taking place, the changes in the level and dynamics
   of GDP and are assessed, as well as the development of trade relations
   between Russia and countries of the region. Differences in GDP dynamics
   are shown for the countries of the Baltic region in 1989-1998,
   1998-2007, 2007-2016. The changes in the trade turnover of Russia with
   other countries of the region over the period 1995-2016 are
   characterized.},

   `noumenal power.' In particular, he stresses the non-normative character
   of the approach and clarifies how the account of the exercise of power
   as working through `giving' reasons also includes non-reflexive and
   non-transparent forms of producing reasons in others. This has
   implications for aspects of power that relate to the unconscious, the
   body and for understanding ideological as well as structural power.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF ELECTIONS PUBLIC OPINION AND PARTIES},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {28},
Number = {1},
Pages = {19-37},
Abstract = {A prominent feature of media coverage during the UK's referendum on
   European Union (EU) membership was the stark difference between the
   pro-EU young and their Eurosceptic elders, widely assumed to reflect a
   generational divide. The positive relationship between age and hostility
   towards the EU is well established in academic research, however only
   Down, and Wilson {[}(2013). ``A rising generation of Europeans?
   Life-cycle and cohort effects on support for `Europe'.{''} European
   Journal of Political Research 52: 431-456] have considered whether this
   reflects a generational or life-cycle effect. While their research
   confirms that there is such a generational effect, their capacity to
   explain it is limited. This study utilizes data from Britain and builds
   on previous attempts to identify and explain generational trends in
   Euroscepticism, bridging it with studies on individual-level
   determinants of hostility towards the EU, providing the most detailed
   assessment of the extent and causes of generational differences in
   Euroscepticism to date. The results confirm that today's young people
   are the most supportive generation of EU membership, caused by a
   combination of factors including their experience of the EU during their
   formative years, their relationships with domestic political
   institutions, and their access to education.},

Abstract = {Most elections in the United States are not close, which has raised
   concerns among social scientists and reform advocates about the vibrancy
   of American democracy. In this paper, we demonstrate that while
   individual elections are often uncompetitive, hierarchical, temporal,
   and geographic variation in the locus of competition results in most of
   the country regularly experiencing close elections. In the four-cycle
   period between 2006 and 2012, 89\% of Americans were in a highly
   competitive jurisdiction for at least one office. Since 1914, about half
   the states have never gone more than four election cycles without a
   close statewide contest. More Americans witness competition than
   citizens of Canada or the UK, other nations with SMSP-based systems. The
   dispersed competition we find also results in nearly all Americans being
   represented by both political parties for different offices.},

Title = {Australian bicameralism as semi-parliamentarism: patterns of majority
   formation in 29 democracies},
Journal = {AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {53},
Number = {2},
Pages = {211-233},
Abstract = {The article analyses the type of bicameralism we find in Australia as a
   distinct executive-legislative system - a hybrid between parliamentary
   and presidential government - which we call semi-parliamentary
   government'. We argue that this hybrid presents an important and
   underappreciated alternative to pure parliamentary government as well as
   presidential forms of the power-separation, and that it can achieve a
   certain balance between competing models or visions of democracy. We
   specify theoretically how the semi-parliamentary separation of powers
   contributes to the balancing of democratic visions and propose a
   conceptual framework for comparing democratic visions. We use this
   framework to locate the Australian Commonwealth, all Australian states
   and 22 advanced democratic nation-states on a two-dimensional empirical
   map of democratic patterns for the period from 1995 to 2015.},

Abstract = {The problem of the possible prohibition of repetition of mandates that
   raises the proposition of law nowadays deposited in the
   Deputies'Congress, is approached in this work from the double
   perspective of his constitutionality and his political opportunity.
   While the first one turns out to be unquestionable in the light of the
   intellectual suppositions that from his origins they preside at the
   existence of the parliamentary regime, the second thing depends on the
   concrete aims that are chased and of his concrete functionality for the
   political life of a company. In the Spanish case, the need to impose a
   beginning of veracity opposite to the drift that takes a democracy that
   tends to the sham, and the exigency of protecting the freedom of the
   voting population opposite to the manipulative trends of the power, this
   way they advise it.},

   Up to now, the analysis that have been carried out on this process have
   focused on media discourses as reproducing the hegemonic social
   consensus. This study aims to extend the field of study to the practices
   of professional athletes and their identities and shared culture. Thus,
   through 31 in-depth interviews with fonner elite football players and
   coaches, along with journalists and referees, the Spanish football
   discourse transformation in the early 1990s is reconstructed, linking it
   to the ongoing commodification process in professional football. At the
   same time, it is clear that this discourse change involved at the same
   time a deep modification of the training and playing practices, and that
   both practices and discourses fed each other to modify the hegemonic
   understanding of football in Spain.},

Journal = {POLITICKE VEDY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {21},
Number = {1},
Pages = {176-192},
Abstract = {When it comes to institutional form of European security, the
   Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) plays a
   crucial role, side by side with other organization. Maybe it is due to
   the fact it is considered a ``soft security{''} organization and it is
   not as mainstreamed as e.g. NATO or EU in certain cases. Hence this
   article provides a theoretical overview on the role and substance of the
   OSCE as such. The article re-introduces theoretical approach to the
   concept of security community developed by K. Deutsh and E. Adler and A.
   Barnett, and the OSCE as security-community building organization as it
   was developed in the past years. In addition, it mentions some the
   crucial topics for the OSCE in the near future that have the potential
   to shape not only the organization but the European security environment
   in general as well. The result show that not only OSCE as organization
   itself, but also the OSCE region faces unprecedent challenges, because
   basic standards of European security architecture is violated and
   challenged. The paper argues that OSCE still remains the organization
   which on the one hand aims at constantly pointing to standards of
   political behavior in the northern hemisphere and on the other OSCE
   creates conditions for creative thinking and adopting proposals for
   contours of European security architecture as well.},

Abstract = {At a time when a single semester of law school can be a significant
   financial investment, the decision to attend law school should not be
   made casually. Instead, decisions should be influenced by data,
   reflection, and an understanding of real-world outcomes. In this
   article, I present The Legal Career Compatibility Project; a tool to
   help students make an informed decision about pursuing a career in law.
   Using Bolles (2003), Phases 1 and 2 help prospective law students
   determine whether they should pursue a legal career. Phase 3 helps
   students determine where and how to apply to law school. Considering
   that the odds of gaining admission to law school are high, conversations
   about whether one should attend law school are equally, if not more,
   important than conversations about how to gain admission. The purpose of
   the project is to influence how decisions to attend law school are made,
   not to encourage or discourage students from a career in law.},

Abstract = {The lives of Russians who settled down in Taiwan in the 19th century are
   still an unexplored field in studies on history of the island and
   Russian-{''}Taiwanese relations. In 1996 the grave of certain Johan
   Aminoff, born in Finland, was located by one of the authors at the
   Westerners' cemetery in Taipei (Tamsui district). Ten years later, a
   letter written by a person named Aminoff was found in the Archive of
   Foreign Policy of the Russian Empire (AFPRE). This letter was sent by
   him to the Russian consulate in Foochow in the summer of 1900. The
   content of this letter, forwarded to the Russian Embassy in Beijing and
   later to Sanct-Petersburg, was so significant that it was brought to the
   attention of Nicholas II, the Russian Emperor, who ``left the Highest
   mark on the original{''} with a blue pencil. As it's proved by our
   research, the author of the letter and the man buried in Taipei is the
   same person. This article details the amazing life story of Johan
   Aminoff, a Finnish with Russian-Swedish roots, who lived in Taiwan for
   nearly 30 years. He served in the Japanese police, but kept in mind
   Russia and the duty to his country. This biographical research is based
   on a wide range of sources, including reports from the American Bible
   Society, Finnish genealogical archives, documents from the Foreign
   Policy Archive of Russian Empire and the archives of Japanese colonial
   administration in Taiwan, as well as the publications in the
   pre-revolutionary Russian press.},

Journal = {OSTEUROPA},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {68},
Number = {1-2},
Pages = {83-97},
Abstract = {There are critics and readers who deny the literary nature of Svetlana
   Alexievich's work. However, in doing so, they fail to recognise the fact
   that her prose goes far beyond a pure accumulation of voices. In
   Alexievich's rendering, narrated testimony is consciously artistically
   reworked, allowing it to unfold its very own aesthetic power. Her
   concept of art has its precursors in the Soviet documentary prose of the
   1920s and 1930s and in the dissident literature of writers such as
   Solzhenitsyn and Shalamov. Alexievich focuses her attention on
   historical topics that have to date been marginalised and supplements
   these with an emotional perspective and a sense of the suffering
   involved. Her artistic process consists of piecing together, achieving
   the power of suggestion in her prose through dialogicity and
   emotionalisation. However, this process is at odds with the factographic
   claim to validity postulated by the author which has to date dominated
   the perception of her oeuvre among literary critics.},

Journal = {DEMOCRATIZATION},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {25},
Number = {3},
Pages = {524-544},
Abstract = {Recent studies of comparative presidentialism have emphasized the
   importance of informal relationships between presidents and other
   political actors in explaining how presidents build governing
   coalitions. What has generally been under-investigated in the literature
   is how the characteristics of presidents as agents impact how they
   interact with other political actors - in particular, how presidents
   relate to their cabinets in terms of turnover and inclusiveness. We
   hypothesize that presidents who were former rebel leaders will behave
   very differently from presidents that do not have such backgrounds. To
   test our hypotheses, we collected data from 36 countries that are
   classified either as presidential or semi-presidential systems in Africa
   with 93 individual presidential administrations from 1990 to 2009. We
   found that presidents who were former rebel leaders were less likely to
   have major cabinet turnovers than other presidents. However, former
   rebel leaders did not have less politically inclusive cabinets (at least
   in partisan terms) but did have less ethnically inclusive cabinets than
   presidents with other backgrounds. The results suggest that agent
   characteristics, that is, the previous experiences of the president as a
   decision maker, are as important as the structural constraints he or she
   faces.},

Journal = {TEMAS Y DEBATES},

Abstract = {The main research article studies the modalities of transnational
   management in double periphery substates units (DPSUs). This means,
   sub-state units that find themselves in double peripheral situations
   with respect to the states that they comprise and the international
   system.
   The cases of study are Jujuy province (Argentina) and Tarapaca Region
   (Chile). The temporal space considered was from the constitutional
   reforms that recognized the sub-state units in each case's capacity for
   international action through the conclusion of the presidencies of
   Cristina Fernandez (1994-2015) and Sebastian Pinera (1991-2014). The
   chosen cases, Jujuy and Tarapaca, represent examples of double periphery
   in a federal and unitary State, respectively.
   The hypothesis affirms that DPSUs are related with other similar units,
   using transnational management as a development tool and, at the same
   time, creating a transborder sub-region of sub-state units with common
   interests.
   The approach was based on local development studies and transnational
   management studies to analyze the action of sub-state units. The cases
   were analyzed through interviews and bibliographic and documentary
   sources.},

Abstract = {The principal aim of the study is to examine the broader role of the
   mutually assured destruction (MAD) concept formed and in operation in
   the second half of 20th century. Via theoretical perspectives on the
   nuclear weapon such as philosophical, ethical, or the security one, it
   is not only to provide an extended definition of the concept while
   utilizing categories of the broadly accepted game-theoretic approach to
   mutually assured destruction in the theoretical premises of humanistic -
   liberal conceptions, but also to figure out whether the ethical
   implications of the state of nuclear strategic balance of power
   empirically examined within the effect of deterrence can even be
   reconciled with the Kantian liberal conception of perpetual peace.},

   POLITICO-ANALYTICAL RETROSPECTIVE OF THE RUSSIAN REVOLUTION},
Journal = {POLIS-POLITICHESKIYE ISSLEDOVANIYA},
Year = {2018},
Number = {6},
Pages = {155-171},
Abstract = {The article gives comment on the special issue of the ``History and
   Modernity{''} journal devoted to the centenary of the Russian 1917
   revolution. The articles published in this issue reflect the public
   opinions as well as estimations of academic circles on the subject, on
   the whole. There are two main approaches. First, vision of and accent on
   objective reasons of revolution which, to a significant extent, the
   preceding investigations pointed out; and second, a quest of new
   interpretations predominantly connected with negative characteristics of
   the revolution. But the latter approach often ignores the principle of
   historicity, that is, why actors in the past thought and acted in such
   or another way in specific historical situation and only on the base of
   this adequate understanding a scientific or moral estimation is
   possible. The concept of the October revolution much depends on
   estimation of its results, that is, the Soviet epoch in the Russian
   history. The author presents his own explanation of the Soviet period in
   the context of world-wide evolution of the socialism. His main idea is
   to understand the Soviet socialism as many-sided phenomenon where to see
   only negative aspects would be wrong. The same approach is necessary in
   case of 1917 revolution(s).},

Abstract = {This article seeks to explain why some high-capacity democracies have
   high levels of internal violence. These regimes present a puzzle: Why
   are bureaucratically capable states that ostensibly answer to voters
   failing to provide security? Challenging the ``weak states{''} paradigm,
   we argue that states with high capacity and significant violence within
   marginalized populations exhibit a governance pattern in which governing
   factions deliberately weaken security services and collude with nonstate
   violent actors to maintain power and ensure extreme levels of privilege
   and impunity. Although these states do not feature ideal-type
   institutions, they are not weak. Instead, economic and political elites
   are complicit in enforcing a system of material inequality and uneven
   democratic incorporation maintained by violence. As politicized security
   agencies become incapacitated and repressive, citizens turn to nonstate
   security providers for protection, from private firms to criminals and
   insurgents, increasing social violence and obscuring the state origins
   of what we term privilege violence.},

Journal = {REGIONAL AND FEDERAL STUDIES},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {28},
Number = {1},
Pages = {47-78},
Abstract = {Brazil is an example of a challenging governance context par excellence:
   continental size, multi-levelled governance structures and diverse
   administrative cultures meet with ambitious, large-scale policy needs
   and objectives. The multilevel governance approach is applied here to
   analyse implementation and governance coordination of the Bolsa Verde
   Programme (BVP). Through a close reading of the narratives told by three
   programme officials - and zooming in on jointly exercised governance
   functions known from the metagovernance approach - we analysed how BVP's
   programmatic governance coordination was made sense of. The analysis
   showed that our interviewees were well aware of the shortcomings of the
   governance coordination in BVP, understood as rather hierarchical,
   centrally driven and often tackling challenges of vertical multi-actor
   coordination in a reactive ad-hoc manner. However, since the
   implementers have been able to creatively and skilfully solve governance
   coordination challenges, possibilities for developing more systematic
   and inclusive (meta) governance approaches seem feasible.},

Abstract = {Understanding political melancholy as central to the crisis of modernity
   and democracy implies a growing realization that melancholy teaches us
   something essential about different forms of political crisis and their
   affective modes. This essay contends that the relationship between
   political melancholy in Weimar Germany and its repurposing by German
   Jews for Zionist thought reveals how political melancholy was and
   remains at the heart of Zionism. The essay offers both a historical and
   theoretical consideration of political melancholy. Its purpose is to
   question how a political affect of melancholy helps us grasp Zionism,
   offering a new way to think through its failures. More specifically, the
   growing attention, both critical and affirmative, paid to ``left-wing
   melancholy{''} is used to examine a general sense of loss and crisis in
   the West and the more concrete expression of this sense in the history
   of Zionism.},

Journal = {POLITICS GROUPS AND IDENTITIES},

Abstract = {This essay claims that Asian American political theory (AAPT) exists but
   needs to be more explicitly articulated. I contour AAPT as the practice
   and tradition of critical theoretical reflection upon Asian American
   politics. I then situate Claire Kim's Dangerous Crossings (2015) and
   Lisa Lowe's The Intimacies of Four Continents (2015) within this
   contour. I read Claire Kim's approach to localized Asian American
   conflicts as a case of ethically and nationally inflected AAPT, while I
   read Lisa Lowe's approach to global Asian/Asian American figures as a
   case of historically and transnationally inflected AAPT. These examples
   show that AAPT fits within some parameters of political theory and
   political science, but also anticipates a wider reconfiguration of basic
   concepts such as Asian American politics. My proposal is that AAPT be
   conceived and developed as a disciplinary and transdisciplinary project.},

Title = {The Limits of Policy Analytics: Early Examples and the Emerging Boundary
   of Possibilities},
Journal = {POLITICS AND GOVERNANCE},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {6},
Number = {4},
Pages = {5-17},
Abstract = {Policy analytics has emerged as a modification of traditional policy
   analysis, where the discrete stages of the policy cycle are reformulated
   into a continuous, real-time system of big data collection, data
   analytics, and ubiquitous, connected technologies that provides the
   basis for more precise problem definition, policy experimentation for
   revealing detailed insights into system dynamics, and ongoing assessment
   of the impact of micro-scale policy interventions to nudge behaviour
   towards desired policy objectives. Theoretical and applied work in
   policy analytics research and practice is emerging that offers a
   persuasive case for the future possibilities of a real-time approach to
   policymaking and governance. However, policy problems often operate on
   long time cycles where the effect of policy interventions on behaviour
   and decisions can be observed only over long periods, and often only
   indirectly. This article surveys examples in the policy analytics
   literature, infers from those examples some characteristics of the
   policy problems and settings that lend themselves to a policy analytics
   approach, and suggests the boundaries of feasible policy analytics.
   Rather than imagine policy analytics as a universal replacement for the
   decades-old policy analysis approach, a sense of this boundary will
   allow us to more effectively consider the appropriate application of
   real-time policy analytics.},

Abstract = {The European system of protection of human rights created by the
   European Convention of 1950 has been subject of a deep evolution since
   its creation, concerning both its extension and its goals and
   proceedings. Three phases aat least are visible in this evolution: a
   first phase, initially oriented to an inter-State collaboration, where
   the main role corresponded to the European Comission of Human Rights; a
   second phase, centered on the individualised protection of Convention
   rights by the European Court of Humna Rights; and finally, ir seems that
   a third phase is starting, in which the Strasbourg Court is assuming a
   quasi-constitutional function.},

Abstract = {The communicative dimension of the social licensing process of a copper
   project in Southern Peru is analyzed in a context of socio-environmental
   conflict. A case study is developed by interviewing 38 people among
   leaders, people in favor and against the project, local communicators
   and regional journalists and company officials. The communication
   strategy developed by the company and the response of the groups
   opposing the project were analyzed. The results show that the company's
   passive reputation created conditions that structured conflict, but that
   did not address the communication strategy implemented. In addition, the
   company opted for a marketing strategy that achieves short-term impacts
   to generate support for the project and comply with legal administrative
   processes. However, the communication strategy does not incorporate a
   prevention and conflict transformation approach. Therefore, deteriorated
   relationships with the population have not improved and the existing
   polarization process has not been reversed, creating conditions for a
   new escalation.},

Abstract = {We identify an ideology gap in the Marxist EU (European Union)
   literature, which we then set out to narrow by identifying and analysing
   core elements of the particularising EU version of the global ideology
   of feel-good and ethical capitalism through which the EU interpellates
   certain subaltern classes towards identifying with the deepening and
   widening of neoliberal governance. We then show, by means of discourse
   analysis, how ideological state apparatuses (ISAs) secure but also
   occasionally undermine the ideological bloc of dominant and dominated
   classes. We conclude by arguing that the ideological dimension of EU
   foreign policy is becoming increasingly important as the EU's
   self-ascribed status as a uniquely normative power in world politics
   offers multiple opportunities for ISAs to obscure the reality of a
   materially increasingly polarised EU whose internal structure has
   acquired pronounced imperialist properties during the recent financial
   crisis. This does not harbour well for international order in Europe and
   beyond.},

Title = {Majesty and mercy: undocumented immigration, deferred removal action,
   and the spectacle of sovereign exceptionalism},
Journal = {CRITICAL REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL SOCIAL AND POLITICAL PHILOSOPHY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {21},
Number = {2},
Pages = {129-147},
Abstract = {The article casts a critical gaze at the Obama Administration's decision
   - articulated in a series of bureaucratic memos and directives issued
   June 2010-July 2012 - to exercise prosecutorial discretion in processing
   300,000 undocumented immigrants slated for deportation from the US
   Commentators on the partisan left hailed the Administration's decision
   as a pragmatic and humane effort to implement federal immigration laws.
   Commentators on the partisan right argued that prosecutorial discretion
   constituted an effective - and illegal-abdication of the president's
   mandate to execute the letter of immigration law. This article positions
   the decision, instead, at the nexus of sovereign exceptionalism and
   political community-building and argues that deferred action constitutes
   the highest and most controversial deployment of the ``majesty{''} of
   territorial state sovereignty: the process of selectively meting out
   ``mercy{''} to those who approximate the set of expectations bound up in
   the notion of the ``good{''} American. Petitioners for deferred action
   status, I argue, function, ideologically, to construct the undocumented
   petitioner's liminality as help and reify the sovereign power's
   exceptionalism. The discussion, in turn, invites us to revisit
   Schmittian and Agambenian conceptions of sovereign exceptionalism and
   rethink the work sovereign prerogative does in the everyday.},

Abstract = {UNESCO's Memory of the World' Programme promotes the preservation,
   universal access and public awareness of the world's significant
   documents as the common heritage of all humankind. The inscription of
   the Documents of Nanjing Massacre' into the Memory of the World'
   Register in 2015 reflects an increasingly globalised concern in the
   post-Cold War era over the remembrance of war and atrocity. Yet it has
   reignited the tension between Japan and China, resulting in strong
   pressure on UNESCO to reform its selection process for contested
   heritage. This paper addresses the limitations encountered by UNESCO in
   pursuing the promotion of global documentary heritage from an English
   School perspective. The 2015 controversy is relevant and indicative to
   an important question of International Relations on an inherent tension
   between the solidarist forces of promoting a normative agenda on human
   rights and common heritage and the pluralist pull of maintaining
   sovereignty and bringing heritage back to the hands of states.},

Abstract = {Multiculturality is phenomenon that, through the globalization and the
   emerging use of the Information and Communication Technologies (ICT),
   has become more notable within our society and has brought the need of
   having citizens able to value the differences present in others so,
   through the development of the Intercultural Competence, there can be a
   real intercultural dialogue and promote coexistence in schools. This
   article will analyze the characteristics of a training program based on
   the INCULTIC model and how it is related with the development of the
   Intercultural Competence and ICT Competence of future pedagogues in
   early childhood education. This study was developed under an
   Action-research approach, using both qualitative and quantitative
   techniques and instruments. A program based in the INCULTIC model was
   planned, designed, applied and evaluated in order to find out that,
   after finishing the program, there were significant changes in the
   development of the Intercultural Competence and ICT Competence of the
   participants after the training program. Through this study findings, it
   was evident that participants developed the skills and abilities to
   design and apply pedagogical strategies that were culturally
   appropriated in order to foster citizenship competences and
   communicative competences to promote school coexistence.},

Pages = {345-357},
Abstract = {The commemorative events marking the 150th anniversary of Canada's 1867
   confederation prompt us to reconsider the nexus between citizenship and
   memory. In the introduction to this special issue, we explore how the
   past continues to inform debates on Canadian identity in relation to the
   legacy of settler colonialism and its enduring impacts on Indigenous
   peoples, immigration and the transnationalization of Canadian society.
   Government responses to pressures to address historical injustices have
   resulted more recently in the establishment of a framework for
   reconciliation, apologies and other measures of redress. Demands for
   more democratic forms of citizenship though continue to be frustrated by
   systemic barriers to inclusion. We ask how Canadian idioms and practices
   of memory citizenship are reworked and grounded in attempts to transform
   dominant historical norms and narratives. Moreover, what role can
   increased scholarly attention to transnational memory play in unsettling
   the logics and practices upon which Canadian citizenship are built?
   Scholars of citizenship must think through not only the symbolic
   meanings of commemoration, but also engage with the political and legal
   ramifications of how physical and imagined sites of memory have been
   dealt with - and by whom.},

Abstract = {With the South Sudanese conflict in its fifth year in 2018, this paper
   seeks to not only examine the status of the civil war that has engulfed
   the youngest nation on earth but to also discuss the evolving narratives
   of its causes and provide policy recommendation to actors involved in
   the peace process. Having examined the continuously failing peace
   treaties between the warring parties, it is evident that the agreements
   have failed to unearth and provide solutions to the crisis and a new
   approach to examining the causes and solutions to the problem is
   therefore necessary. This paper argues that ethnic animosities and
   rivalry are a key underlying cause that has transformed political
   rivalry into a deadly ethnic dispute through vicious mobilisation and
   rhetoric. Therefore, it recommends a comprehensive peace approach that
   will address the political aspects of the conflict and propose
   restructuring South Sudan's administrative, economic and social spheres
   in order to curb further manipulation of the ethnic differences.},

Abstract = {A modernization project was started by the founding cadres of the
   Republic in Turkey during the nation-state building process. In the
   early years, policies towards creating a laic state and secular society
   became manifest in relation to women's bodies which gained a symbolic
   meaning, and as an aspect of the modernization process, a significant
   component of the national identity. The Republic argued that equality
   between women and men was an indispensable part of social and political
   life. But Alevis, in fact, claimed that equality between woman and man
   had long been among the main principles of Alevism for centuries.
   However, the attitude towards equality formed a common ground between
   the fundamentals of the Republic and Alevi belief and emerged as an
   important element in strengthening Alevi loyalty to the Republic. This
   rhetoric of equality is examined in terms of the religious beliefs and
   practices of Alevis based on research into a local Alevi group, the
   Ansabacilis. The claim of equality is found to be more to do with
   marking the boundaries of Alevi identity than putting equality into
   practice.},

Abstract = {The paper offers a reading of the section of the The Metaphysics of
   Morals in which Kant advances a secular conception of the legitimation
   of legal punishment, based upon the postulation of a (meta-) principle
   of respect as normative premise. On this basis, the precise meaning of
   the characterization of penal law as a ``categorical imperative{''} is
   addressed, as well as the status of the ``right of retribution{''} as
   standard for the commensuration of punishment. In this way, the paper
   seeks to undermine the linkage of Kant's conception with the leitmotiv
   of a metaphysical realization of justice, as well as its interpretation
   as a version of a mixed theory, which would allegedly combine a
   deterrence goal with a mere side-constraint of desert-based
   proportionality.},

Abstract = {In recent decades, the death of the nation-state has been announced,
   opening the door to the idea of a world that manages to overcome
   government, justice, economic redistribution, social integration and
   territorial control issues. After 2010, the idea of the disappearance of
   the nation-state has grown again, where there is a consensus on the need
   to recognize the leading role that cities currently play, and how they
   concentrate the conditions of power over which states can act. In this
   context, the aim of this paper is to inquire what metropolises represent
   with respect to contemporary nation-states. This question was resolved
   based on the review of texts written by experts, data derived from
   specialized journals and a review of specific news published in
   international newspapers. In conclusion, the nation-states see in the
   big cities, on the one hand, an opportunity to strengthen their
   political power in an unprecedented way; or on the contrary, a challenge
   to their power, understood as a permanent tension between urban areas
   and state government, seen as the subjection of the metropolis to the
   States.},

Abstract = {Based on newly available archival documents and recent literature the
   article presents an analysis of the origins and development of the
   Bilderberg meetings of transatlantic elite in 1950s-1980s. Conspiracy
   theories notwithstanding it is demonstrated that the organization of
   these meetings was a joint transnational project of European and
   American elites in which private and government structures merged and
   private initiative was interwoven with group and bureaucratic interests.
   The promotion of this project became an important part of the formation
   of the Cold War Atlantic community. Also examined on case studies basis
   are specific functions performed by the Bilderberg meetings: elite
   fraternization and networking, consensus maintenance and reinforcement,
   elite recruitment and rejuvenation. The final conclusion is that despite
   many deep changes in international and transatlantic relations since its
   establishment Bilderberg retains its importance compared to other more
   specialized and homogeneous transatlantic networks because it serves as
   a hub network of confidential contacts between all key sectors and
   national segments of transatlantic elites. Activities of Bilderberg as
   well as of other informal transnational networks present a fertile field
   for interdisciplinary studies combining methods of history, political
   science and sociology.},

Volume = {6},

Abstract = {Asian American men and women have voted at roughly similar rates across
   the last three presidential elections. This sets Asian Americans apart;
   women in America have generally voted at higher rates than men since the
   1980s. The women in politics and immigrant incorporation literatures
   suggest that pathways to participation may be distinct for women and
   men. Yet, there is scant attention to gender in studies of Asian
   American political participation. As a result, little theoretical or
   empirical foundation exists for explaining why the gender gap in
   participation is so different for Asian Americans. To better understand
   this puzzle, we analyze pooled data from the National Asian American
   Surveys of 2008, 2012, and 2016. The data show that women are less
   likely to vote than men once we account for variables related to
   resources, mediating institutions, and immigrant incorporation. We also
   demonstrate that Asian American women who are foreign-born citizens are
   less likely to participate across a range of modes of political action,
   and across ethnic groups. We argue that this is evidence that gender and
   ethnicity simultaneously condition the processes of immigrant political
   incorporation, and the study of gender gaps must be approached more
   broadly as a political and comparative phenomenon.},

Abstract = {This work aims to determine the reasons that led to the failure of the
   two moments of dialogue (2002 and 2016) between the Venezuelan
   government and opposition leaders. To this end, the methodological
   strategy consisted in making a critical examination of the political
   events of these two moments of dialogue and then analyze them in the
   framework of the Oliver Escobar model (2009, 20014), which is integrated
   by the deliberative theory of democracy and the philosophy of dialogue
   of Martin Buber (1878-1965). As a result of this analysis, it is shown
   that the dialogues carried out between the parties in conflict defined a
   communication of the type of confrontation, which prevented reaching the
   level of dialogical rationality required by a deliberative
   communication. In this sense, dialogue failure is attributed to the lack
   of dialogical will, which was rooted in ethical,
   psychological-ideological reasons. It is suggested that the transition
   from confrontational communication to buberian dialogic communication
   could achieve the necessary and sufficient agreements that guarantee the
   overcoming of the ``democracy deficit{''} of contemporary Venezuela.},

Abstract = {Existing political science and marketing scholarship suggests that a
   get-out-the-vote (GOTV) message focused on a neighborhood or
   not-in-my-backyard (NIMBY) issue will be more powerful than a basic GOTV
   script. However, randomized field experiments testing different scripts
   have found either minimal script effects or that neighbor scripts are
   less effective at moving voters to the polls. Here, we take advantage of
   a local vote on a NIMBY issue-approval of a zoning exemption for a
   low-income senior housing development-to test the effectiveness of
   reaching out to registered voters as members of a neighborhood.
   Consistent with prior work, we find that a basic GOTV message is more
   effective in increasing turnout; however, we also find that the neighbor
   message is more effective among some subgroups of voters, including
   those living farther away from the proposed development.},

Journal = {POLIS-POLITICHESKIYE ISSLEDOVANIYA},

Abstract = {This article describes the main contexts of internalization in the high
   school and several related aspects of teaching patriotism under the
   conditions of the intensification of intercultural interaction. The
   Peoples' Friendship University of Russia (RUDN) has for many years been
   a vivid example of the multinational multicultural educational
   environment, so the results of the sociological research conducted at
   the university, revealing the features of understanding, and manifesting
   patriotic views and attitudes of Russian and foreign students are of
   considerable interest. The conducted research has shown that there are
   no fundamental differences in the understanding of patriotism by Russian
   and foreign students. Nevertheless, it is worth noting, that the love
   for your country, the pride in its achievements, the willingness to
   sacrifice yourself for the good of the Motherland is more often
   associated with the concept of patriotism of the Russians. At the same
   time, veneration and respect for the state system, for symbols,
   willingness to serve in the army, love for one's relatives are more
   characteristic of foreigners. It was also interesting that a
   considerable number of foreign students (from various regions) are
   interested in remaining in Russia after graduation. The article also
   highlights the problems associated with the risks of interethnic
   conflicts, the language barrier and the common complex adaptation of
   foreign students, which can be solved by well-established methods of
   educational work and properly coordinated efforts. The data given in the
   article can be used to make managerial decisions in universities that
   teach foreign citizens.},

Journal = {NEW POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {40},
Number = {3},
Pages = {581-598},
Abstract = {This article takes a case study approach to examine social
   justice-oriented environmental activism of faculty in the context of
   neoliberalism. As an evolving trend, university corporatization places
   new economic burdens on universities and their students and has
   contributed to a tenuous landscape for faculty in terms of academic
   freedom and job security. In particular, we examine a faculty-led
   response to hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, at the University of
   Northern Colorado in Greeley, Colorado. Drawing on participant
   observation, semi-structured interviews, and campus-wide survey data, we
   document this response as a ``tempered grassroots leadership{''}
   approach to workplace inquiry and activism. We discuss both the
   opportunities and limitations of promoting more transparent, informed,
   and inclusive decision-making on campus via internal and tempered
   activism strategies. Ultimately, this case presents lessons learned
   regarding social change practices of teacher-scholar-activists on
   college campuses. These experiences are especially germane in the
   ``Trump era{''} of top-down and socially regressive decision-making.},

Abstract = {This paper explores the history and changing role of worker advice
   offices between the 1970s and the present. It summarises different
   aspects and different periods of legal advice office history. In the
   experience of these offices, we see an experimentation with new forms of
   worker organisation and sources of power for a workforce facing
   exclusion and oppression. During the struggle against apartheid, at a
   time when traditional union activity relied on workers' structural
   bargaining power, it was not always a safe option and institutional
   power was lacking, advice offices contributed to the labour movement by
   building workers' associational power and aiming at development of
   strong trade unions. In post-apartheid South Africa, on the contrary,
   despite gains in institutional power, labour faces weakening structural
   and associational power due to challenges of neoliberal globalisation,
   so worker advice offices have to look for new approaches to help workers
   defend their labour rights.},

Journal = {TEORIA Y REALIDAD CONSTITUCIONAL},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {42},
Pages = {221-245},
Abstract = {The European Convention on Human Rights of 1950 is not only an
   international treaty of protection of human rights, but also, in
   Strasbourg Court's terms, an instrument for maintaining and promoting
   the values and aspirations of a democratic society. This aim permeates
   all the case law of the Court, particularly in the field of articles
   8-11 of the Convention and article 3 of the First Optional Protocol. On
   the other hand, the ``quality{''} of the national political process has
   been considered in recent case law as a criterion for the application of
   the margin of appreciation doctrine.
   This paper analizes the concept of democracy shaped by the Court and its
   consequences for defining the extension of the national margin of
   appreciation.},

Journal = {GLOBAL CHANGE PEACE \& SECURITY},

Volume = {30},

Abstract = {The United Nations Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons presents
   complex challenges, including issues of verification and security.
   Verifying the transformation to a nuclear-weapon-free world (NWFW) is an
   adaptive, multi-stage process, involving various mechanisms and tasks
   for nuclear and non-nuclear weapon States, and monitoring a wide range
   of items and activities for increasing or decreasing nuclear weapons
   capability. Whether States find the Treaty verifiable depends on the
   available capabilities, but also on political assumptions and
   requirements. Verification plays an important role in the transformation
   towards a NWFW to diminish the role of nuclear weapons in a hostile
   environment where uncertainties are seen as threatening. Verification
   also helps to establish a viable international security landscape based
   on cooperation and trust that is able to address the complex
   implementation issues of nuclear weapons prohibition and elimination.},

Abstract = {This introductory article to the special issue on major powers in shared
   neighbourhoods sets the scenery by introducing the research objectives,
   situating them in the relevant academic context with references to the
   literatures on great power dynamics, regionalism and foreign policy
   analysis. It presents a conceptual framework for the study of `major
   powers', understood as regional leaders, and their different forms of
   interaction in shared neighbourhoods, before providing an overview of
   the key insights of the individual contributions. The article concludes
   by identifying the main factors explaining the shape of the relationship
   between major powers in their shared region and outlining a research
   agenda on comparative neighbourhood policy studies.},

Title = {Unravelling semi-presidentialism: democracy and government performance
   in four distinct regime types},
Journal = {DEMOCRATIZATION},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {25},
Number = {1},
Pages = {136-157},
Abstract = {Do semi-presidential regimes perform worse than other regime types?
   Semi-presidentialism has become a preferred choice among constitution
   makers worldwide. The semi-presidential category contains anything but a
   coherent set of regimes, however. We need to separate between its two
   subtypes, premier-presidentialism and president-parliamentarism.
   Following Linz's argument that presidentialism and semi-presidentialism
   are less conducive to democracy than parliamentarism a number of studies
   have empirically analysed the functioning and performance of
   semi-presidentialism. However, these studies have investigated the
   performance of semi-presidential subtypes in isolation from other
   constitutional regimes. By using indicators on regime performance and
   democracy, the aim of this study is to examine the performance of
   premier-presidential and president-parliamentary regimes in relation to
   parliamentarism and presidentialism. Premier-presidential regimes show
   performance records on a par with parliamentarism and on some measures
   even better. President-parliamentary regimes, on the contrary, perform
   worse than all other regime types on most of our included measures. The
   results of this novel study provide a strong call to constitution makers
   to stay away from president-parliamentarism as well as against the idea
   of thinking about semi-presidentialism as a single and coherent type of
   regime.},

Title = {Designing and Using Simulations in the International Relations Classroom},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE EDUCATION},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {14},
Number = {4},
Pages = {523-534},
Abstract = {The value of simulations in the classroom is well established, and there
   are numerous publications that feature specific role-play exercises that
   can readily be introduced into the classroom. Frequently, however,
   instructors would like to design their own simulations to fit their
   specific learning objectives for a class, but don't know where to start.
   This article lays out a series of structural and design questions for
   instructors to consider in order to craft their own simulations. We
   recognize that there is no singularly ``best{''} way to design
   simulations, so this article focuses on the key components of
   simulations and explores different possibilities for each of these
   components depending on the desired goals of the instructor. We begin
   with the basics of class size, topic selection, learning objectives,
   length, and timing. Next, we discuss the design parameters-including the
   nature of student interaction, desired output, background information,
   role-specific instructions, and a timeline for the phases of the
   simulation. We move on to considerations about the actual running of the
   simulation, and wrap up with reflections on debriefing, grading, and
   assessment. By stepping through the design questions that are summarized
   in the Appendix, any instructor, experienced or new to role-playing, can
   develop a custom simulation to help meet the learning objectives for
   their courses.},

Abstract = {How and when do Members of the European Parliament (MEPs) participate in
   EU policy-making in their national parliament? With the use of a unique
   survey (N = 150), we assess the attendance of MEPs in their national
   parliament's European Affairs Committee (EAC). We find that MEPs attend
   EAC meetings more often when 1) the EAC is strong; 2) they have advanced
   participation opportunities; and 3) they are members of a large
   political party. Taken together, MEPs who stand a chance of influencing
   their national government's position on EU affairs are more prone to
   attend the EAC meetings than MEPs who do not.},

Abstract = {The prevalence of social injustice suggests the need for radical
   transformation of political economy and governance. This article
   develops the concept of `everyday radicalism', which positions the
   everyday as a potential site of social change. Everyday radicalism is
   based on three main elements: dissensus and a rupture with dominant
   practices; collective rebellion and the creation of alternatives on a
   micro-scale; and the connection of these practices with utopian ideas to
   be able to develop strategies for social justice. The potential
   application of everyday radicalism is illustrated through a case study
   of a women's social intervention in Manchester. The article aims to show
   how everyday radicalism has the potential to contribute knowledge
   towards the transformation of everyday life and the institutions that
   govern society.},

Journal = {POLITICS AND GOVERNANCE},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {6},
Number = {4},
Pages = {62-72},
Abstract = {In 2016, a wave of American populism triggered emotional reactions to
   issues like trade and immigration, and dramatically impacted the Obama
   administration's plans to ratify the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP)
   during President Obama's final year in office. This article asks how do
   emotions infuse populism with political power, and why was populism
   effective in sparking American economic nationalism and retreat from
   free trade during the 2016 presidential campaign? Drawing on a
   psychoanalytic, narrative framework, the article argues that populist
   narratives deployed by US presidential candidates Donald Trump and
   Bernie Sanders characterized the American economy as a story of the
   people versus corrupt elites offering greater audience resonance that
   ultimately derailed President Obama's plan to pass the TPP and ushered
   in an era of economic nationalism under President Trump. The article
   contributes to the literature on emotions and foreign policy and
   explores the under-studied emotional features of populism as a
   discursive narrative.},

   intensification of public and academic discussions about the role of
   ideology allows one to understand the implicit and explicit interests of
   the key political players.
   On the basis of the analysis of the universal and specific parameters of
   the ideological influence on the system of state regulation and
   mechanisms of public policy formation, the author demonstrates that
   ideology, as an instrument alien to the public administration system,
   can play a positive role only under the conditions of the regime crisis,
   which requires a sharp increase in the solidarity of power and society.
   At other times, ideology is not in a position to set in motion the
   necessary vector of development in public administration, because
   ideology promotes a narrow set of social preferences used by the ruling
   classes to enhance their dominance rather than strengthens the
   discursive foundations for the choice of solutions and increase in the
   number of goal-setting alternatives.
   Ideology decreases possibilities of including society into the process
   of public policy formation, by serving an ideological barrier for
   choosing government decisions. From a managerial point of view, for the
   society ideologization forebodes an increasing abuse of power in
   designing and evaluating the results of state regulation. This expands
   the non-economic criteria for the production of government decisions and
   allows the authorities to write off failures on the intrigues of
   enemies. Politically, the use of ideology as an instrument of public
   administration (reflecting the elite's fear of future changes) means the
   inevitable growth of populism, which denies public pluralism and
   discredits political institutions.},

Abstract = {Why do leaders choose to drastically alter their state's international
   behavior? This article aims to identify common domestic and
   international conditions that led to a foreign policy shift (FPS). Given
   the difficulty associated with defining and measuring an FPS, this study
   advances a replicable and theoretically informed definition to guide
   case selection. This avoids both the type of selection bias evident in
   many previous qualitative analyses and the use of measurements that are
   not closely related to the concept as in preceding quantitative research
   designs. The subsequent historical analysis of FPSs in Latin America and
   the Caribbean between 1945 and 2008 identifies two causal paths that led
   to FPS. By one account, growing discontent with longstanding
   dictatorships led to political polarization and subsequent succession
   crises, including civil wars and/or international military intervention,
   from which new regimes/leaders emerged. By another, international
   isolation worsened economic conditions, causing leaders to implement
   administrative reforms to alter their foreign policy by conceding to
   pressures from major powers.},

Journal = {CONTEMPORARY POLITICS},

Volume = {24},
Number = {3, SI},
Pages = {325-345},
Abstract = {Among the neglected cases of presidential systems in Southeast Asia, the
   Philippines is particularly interesting as the oldest in the region and
   as a pure' case of presidentialism which provides seemingly strong
   evidence for its perilousness'. First wave' presidentialism theory
   appears to explain how competing legitimacy claims between a president
   and the legislature contributed to the downfall of a sitting president
   (Joseph E.Estrada in 2001). Yet, Philippine presidents have usually
   dominated other branches of government. O'Donnell's concept of
   delegative democracy' helps elucidate the hegemonic position of
   Philippine presidents generally and sheds light on the illiberally
   transgressive nature of the Marcos and Duterte presidencies in
   particular. When these twin perils of imperiled and imperious presidents
   are examined regionally, however, striking parallels are apparent in
   parliamentary Thailand while the Indonesian case provides a contrasting
   example of a relatively stable presidential system.},

Abstract = {Studies and debates on the concept of ``differentiatedintegration,{''}
   which has been a key feature of the political system of the EU for many
   decades, have come into prominence in the last decade in view of the
   multiple crises the EU has been facing. Whereas most of these studies
   dealt with internal differentiated integration within the EU, only a few
   studies focused on the ``external{''} dimension of differentiated
   integration, which could be described as third countries' differentiated
   levels of alignment with various parts of the EU's acquis communautaire
   without participating in the EU's central decision-making bodies. This
   study seeks to examine the development of different models of external
   differentiated integration between the EU and third countries based on
   the key premises and assumptions of neoliberalism and by focusing on the
   following three already established modes of external differentiated
   integration between the EU and third countries: European Economic Area,
   European neighborhood Policy, and Strategic Partnership. It further
   evaluates the latest developments in EU-Turkey relations and Turkey's EU
   accession process in light of neoliberalism's concept of
   ``interdependence{''} and touches upon the possibility of the formation
   of a model of external differentiated integration between Turkey and the
   EU, outside the framework of the accession process by taking into
   account the recently established bilateral dialog mechanisms.},

Abstract = {State capacity may be a crucial factor conditioning the democratizing
   power of elections in authoritarian regimes. This paper develops a
   two-phase theory considers the different effects of state capacity on
   turnover in elections and democratic change after elections. In regimes
   with limited state capacity, manipulating elections and repressing
   opposition is more difficult than in regimes with extensive state
   capacity, rendering turnover in elections more likely in weak states.
   However, if the new incumbent has limited capacity to deliver public
   services and make policy changes after coming to power, sustainable
   democratic change is unlikely. Hence, state capacity is hypothesized to
   have a negative effect on turnover, but a positive effect on democratic
   change. These hypotheses are confirmed in a sample of 460 elections in
   110 authoritarian regimes taking place in the period 1974 to 2012 using
   the Varieties of Democracy dataset. The findings suggest a need to
   revisit strong-state-first theories of democratization.},

Abstract = {One of the ways in which good' representation can be measured and
   assessed is by the degree of congruence between the preferences of the
   population and the preferences and policies of the political elite. One
   of the arguments for defending decentralisation is that governmental
   institutions on a smaller territorial scale can be closer to the
   population, and that they can provide policies that are more responsive
   to the population of the sub-states. This argument is often made in
   Belgium, where voters in Flanders traditionally vote centre-right, while
   the voters of Wallonia vote centre-left, and where federal coalitions
   need to reflect the preferences of both regions whereas regional
   governments can be responsive to their voters only. Using data from the
   Chapel Hill Expert Survey, this paper tests this assumption and compares
   the left-right orientation of the population and of governments at the
   different institutional levels and regions. The findings suggest that
   sub-state governments are partially more congruent to their sub-state
   voters than federal governments. However, congruence gaps are less
   related to constraints in government formation than to changes in
   behaviour of key political actors.},

Abstract = {In recent years, the study of friendship has gained traction in
   political science. The aim of this article is threefold: (1) to offer an
   overview of the status of friendship studies and how it relates to the
   emotional turn in international relations, (2) to present a wide variety
   of different approaches to studying friendship, and (3) to highlight the
   contribution that a friendship perspective can make to other fields,
   such as Peace and Conflict Studies. From Aristotle and Plato onwards, we
   trace the development of the concept of friendship, and present several
   theoretical conceptualisations and methodological approaches that can be
   readily applied when making sense of friendship, both on a personal
   level between elite actors, and on the international level between
   states. We end by drawing attention to the merit of the study of
   friendship specifically for the field of Peace and Conflict Studies,
   where it helps to address the lacuna of research on positive peace.},

   Korea},

Abstract = {Given the lack of studies on the relationship between personality and
   national pride, this study represents the first attempt to examine the
   impact of the Big Five personality traits on individual feeling of
   national pride in South Korea. The data for this study are obtained from
   the Korean General Social Survey (KGSS) of 2011 and 2012. The empirical
   evidence consistently shows that extraversion and agreeableness are
   significantly associated with individual feeling of national pride.
   Specifically, people who report elevated levels of extraversion and
   agreeableness are more likely to display a strong feeling of national
   pride. Contrary to theoretical expectations, conscientiousness,
   emotional stability, and openness to experience are not associated with
   individual feeling of national pride. Overall, the findings lend some
   support to the view that personality traits exert a significant
   influence on individual feeling of national pride and suggest that
   except for contextual factors, psychological factors also offer some
   explanatory power for individual feeling of national pride.},

Year = {2018},
Volume = {48},
Number = {1},

Abstract = {Theories on the origin of federalism generally only apply to
   coming-together federalism. In Asia, some states introduced federalism
   following decolonization to hold together multiethnic communities, but
   others centralized and pursued a nation-building agenda. Federalism was
   not established in Asia again until Nepal's new constitution of 2015.
   Why has federalism been resisted and what causes its
   institutionalization? Using the cases of Nepal, Myanmar, and Sri Lanka,
   I show that a moderate secession risk, together with a substantive
   peripheral infrastructural capacity, are necessary conditions for the
   establishment of holding-together federalism. A high secession risk
   prevents the formation of an alliance between minority ethnic groups and
   regime change agents from the dominant ethnic group, which I argue is
   the key mechanism for federalization in these contexts. A bargain with
   the core results in quasi-federalism for regime maintenance. Conversely,
   demands for federalism are too easily repressed when secession risk is
   low.},

Abstract = {The rise of ``new regionalism{''} is one of the most salient features of
   the post-Cold War international order. Despite the resurgence of
   regionalism in Europe, little consensus exists on how regional identity
   impacts public opinion toward the European Union. To remedy this
   problem, this study examines the impact of three types of
   individual-level regional identity on support for integration:
   parochialism (exclusive regionalism), inclusive regionalism, and
   pseudo-exclusive regionalism. Contrary to scholarly expectations, the
   multilevel analysis reveals that inclusive regionalists are as equally
   Eurosceptic as parochial regionalists. In general, regional identity
   depresses support for integration unless it is expressly combined with a
   supranational identity. This finding holds true even in minority
   nations, where respondents are, on the whole, less Euro-friendly.},

Journal = {POLITICAL BEHAVIOR},

Abstract = {Public opinion research suggests that rapid and significant
   individual-level fluctuations in opinions toward various policies is
   fairly unexpected absent methodological artifacts. While this may
   generally be the case, some political actions can and do face tremendous
   backlash, potentially impacting public evaluations. Leveraging broadcast
   and newspaper transcripts as well as a unique two-wave panel study we
   demonstrate that a non-random, rapid shift in opinions occurred shortly
   after President Donald Trump signed executive order 13769 into law,
   which barred individuals from seven predominantly Muslim countries from
   entering the United States for 90 days. The ban set off a fury of
   protests across U.S. cities and airports, garnering tremendous media
   attention and discussion. Drawing insights from literature on priming,
   we claim that an influx of new information portraying the Muslim Ban at
   odds with inclusive elements of American identity prompted some citizens
   to shift their attitudes. Our study highlights the potential broad
   political effects of mass movements and protests as it pertains to
   policies that impact racialized minority groups, and suggests that
   preferences can shift quickly in response to changing political
   circumstances.},

Abstract = {The Hungarian government's discriminatory actions against the Central
   European University constitute one of the most prominent conflicts
   between an academic institution and a government today. My contribution
   gives a detailed account of how the conflict has unfolded so far.
   Various frameworks of interpretation, including democratic backsliding,
   cultural war, and international politics are discussed. I place the
   story of the university in the context of the polarized cultural climate
   of Eastern Europe and draw attention to the power of universities in
   collaborating across borders in defense of academic freedom-and freedom
   in general.},

Abstract = {Communication and persuasion are considered ways of learning behaviors
   according to social psychologists,. If we take into consideration that
   behaviors are modified through the thought, we should acknowledge the
   importance of social media which are key referents for people ` s

   reality ` s perception and the way we ralet to it. Since the raise of
   TV, it became a useful tool for Franco ` s dictatorship to inoculate a
   way of behaving to Spanish people. However, some professionals of the
   public media managed to transmit antagonistic thoughts to those
   established by the regime for more than three decades. These jornalists
   managed, to renew the meaning of democratic concepts such as freedom,

Abstract = {Due to the rising number of asylum seekers in particular in 2015, asylum
   policies have gained importance during the last few years. Even though
   the political debate has focused on the federal level in the first
   place, the states have quite some leeway for pursuing policies of their
   own. As it is shown in this article, the asylum policies of the German
   states (Lander) vary significantly from each other. The causes of this
   variation in asylum policies of the states shall be analysed in this
   paper for one financial and one substantial outcome by using fuzzy-set
   Qualitative Comparative Analysis. The determinants of the expenditure
   per asylum-seeker as well as the question whether astate also is
   prepared to deport to Afghanistan will also be analysed. The results
   show inter-alia that there are huge differences in the asylum policies
   between Eastern and Western German states. For example, all five Eastern
   German States deported to Afghanistan while this paper was written. In
   contrast, the results for the socio-economic determinants like GDP or
   unemployment rate are mixed. Furthermore, the results reveal clear
   partisan differences. Center-Right-wing parties in government form
   asufficient condition for the willingness to deport to Afghanistan. The
   contribution of this article to existing literature on the subject is
   two-fold. Firstly, it shows that there is significant variance in the
   asylum policies at the state level in Germany, which is analysed and
   explained for two outcomes. The second contribution of the article is of
   methodological nature by showing that the application of fuzzy-set
   Qualitative Comparative Analysis can be fruitful for analysing variance
   in comparable policies of the German federal states. There are clear
   advantages of this method, namely, the appropriateness for medium-N-case
   studies, the differentiation between necessary and sufficient conditions
   as well as the principle of Equifinality which allows for different
   explanation paths for eastern and western German states in this case.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this study is to examine whether citizens are more likely
   to vote in a political system that uses a proportional electoral system
   if the election is close. The results show that citizens who live in
   Swedish municipalities in which the competition between the two leading
   parties is close are more likely to vote. However, the results also show
   that the vote gap between the two major traditional blocs, the left and
   the right, is not important for citizens when they are considering
   whether or not to vote in municipal elections. In the study, a
   theoretical argument has been formulated which suggests that voters are
   confused and discouraged when there are many aspects to consider
   regarding the form of an upcoming coalition government. Accordingly,
   potential voters see the issue of how the coalition will be formed as
   too complex, and therefore the vote gap between the two blocs is not an
   issue that is prioritised by potential voters.},

Abstract = {This study explores the perplexing role of the Internet in authoritarian
   settings. We disentangle the political impact of the Internet along two
   distinct dimensions, indirect effects and direct effects. While the
   direct effects of the exposure to the Internet shape political attitudes
   in a manifest and immediate way, the indirect effects shape various
   political outcomes via instilling fundamental democratic orientations
   among citizens. In authoritarian societies such as China, we argue the
   indirect effects of the Internet as a value changer tend to be potent,
   transformative, and persistent. But the direct effects of the Internet
   as a mere alternative messenger are likely to be markedly contingent.
   Relying on the newly developed method of causal mediation analysis and
   applying the method to data from a recent survey conducted in Beijing,
   we find strong empirical evidence to support our argument about the
   two-dimensional impacts of the Internet in authoritarian countries.},

Abstract = {From the moment Donald Trump took the oath of office, women's political
   engagement skyrocketed. This groundswell of activism almost immediately
   led to widespread reporting that Trump's victory was inspiring a large
   new crop of female candidates across the country. We rely on a May 2017
   national survey of ``potential candidates{''} and the 2018 midterm
   election results to assess whether this ``Trump Effect{''} materialized.
   Our analysis uncovers some evidence for it. Democrats - especially women
   - held very negative feelings toward Trump, and those feelings generated
   heightened political interest and activity during the 2018 election
   cycle. That activism, however, was not accompanied by a broad scale
   surge in women's interest in running for office. In fact, the overall
   gender gap in political ambition today is quite similar to the gap we've
   uncovered throughout the last 20 years. Notably, though, about one
   quarter of the Democratic women who expressed interest in running for
   office first started thinking about it only after Trump was elected.
   That relatively small group of newly interested candidates was
   sufficient to result in a record number of Democratic women seeking and
   winning election to Congress. With no commensurate increase in
   Republican women's political engagement or candidate emergence, however,
   prospects for gender parity in US political institutions remain bleak.},

Abstract = {Like other citizens, federal employees commit time and money to
   presidential candidates seeking federal office. However, unlike other
   citizens, federal employees work in an executive establishment governed
   by a person to whom they may donate. Are the contributions the
   collective will of the agency or an incorrect aggregation of individual
   action? By merging two original surveys of federal employees with all
   Federal Election Commission records of individual donations, this study
   examines the contribution behavior of federal employees to presidential
   candidates in 2004, 2008, and 2012. I find that the rate at which
   federal employees contribute to presidential candidates varies depending
   on the bureaucrat's political beliefs, characteristics about the job the
   individual performs, and career values of the individual federal
   employee. I find little evidence that contributions vary systematically
   from agency-wide characteristics.},

Abstract = {Do legislators and lobbyists trade favors? This study uses uncommon data
   sources and plagiarism software to detect a rarely observed relationship
   between interest group lobbyists and sitting Members of Congress.
   Comparison of letters to a Senate committee written by lobby groups to
   legislative amendments introduced by committee members reveals similar
   and even identical language, providing compelling evidence that groups
   persuaded legislators to introduce amendments valued by the group.
   Moreover, the analysis suggests that these language matches are more
   likely when the requesting lobby group hosts a fundraising event for the
   senator. The results hold while controlling for ideological agreement
   between the senator and the group, the group's campaign contributions to
   the senator, and the group's lobbying expenditures, annual revenue, and
   home-state connections.},

Abstract = {Many speculated that we would observe a gender gap in vote choice of
   historic proportions in the 2018 midterm elections. However, the 2018
   gender gap was similar to gender gaps in previous elections. I argue
   that the gender gap is not about a specific candidate or election but is
   driven by gender differences in partisan attachments. Variation in the
   gender gap in Senate and gubernatorial elections highlight that the
   gender gap does not advantage a particular candidate or party and that
   women candidates do not increase the size of the gender gap. Race and
   class intersect with gender to shape the partisan attachments and vote
   choice of men and women. Finally, while the candidates and events
   surrounding the 2018 election likely did not impact the gender gap in
   2018, I discuss how the 2018 election will shape the gender gap in
   future elections.},

Abstract = {The article based on longterm anthropological fieldwork in the area does
   not only look at Bamra as a rather successful dynasty in Odishan
   politics but compares it with a neighbouring former princely state of
   Bonai. While the former is now a general seat, the latter is a reserved
   constituency for Scheduled Tribes (STs) effectively depriving the royal
   family of its passive voting rights. It is argued that positive
   discrimination significantly shaped their electoral fortunes. It led in
   one case to a dynasty of princely politicians, though they are
   increasingly competing with rising Other Backward Classes (OBCs) forming
   their own, though still relatively shallow dynasties. However, a few
   kilometers away, arguably through the shifting support of former royals
   in Bonai for several MLAs, no other, potentially competing political
   dynasty has emerged, while relatively lower STs are also claiming
   political representation in a competitive field, in which royal
   influence is still relevant.},

Abstract = {The paper analyses the fiscal consolidation after the German
   unification. It focusses on the determinants for the different budget
   consolidation performance of the Lander since 1992. Different factors
   based on public policy theories are examined. Anew multidimensional
   consolidation indicator based on the primary balance and public debt is
   the dependent variable. Special focus is attributed on the
   parties-do-matter-theory. According to this theory different partisan
   complexion of governments should make adifference for budget
   consolidation. However, the empirical findings are rather weak for the
   partisan variables. The findings indicate in particular the importance
   of socio-economic causes. The higher the unemployment and the more
   welfare recipients in afederal state, the worse the consolidation
   balance. Acentral factor are interest rates, whose reductions over the
   past years contributed substantially to the consolidation success.
   Direct contributions from the Federal Government also played
   asignificant role.},

Abstract = {Policy advocacy is an indispensable function of nonprofits. With
   government becoming a critical revenue source, how government funding
   influences their policy advocacy emerges as a wide concern. This
   research explores the effect of government funding on nonprofit policy
   advocacy in three aspects: advocacy participation, advocacy strategy,
   and advocacy venue. The study finds government funding encourages
   nonprofit participation in policy advocacy. Along with advocacy
   participation, government funding increases nonprofit use of both
   insider and outsider advocacy strategies. Again, when nonprofits decide
   to advocate insider government systems, government funding motivates
   nonprofits to advocate administrative agencies over legislative bodies.},

Abstract = {We investigate the belief that it takes a leader with a strong hand to
   solve the problems of a country. Our case is Russian public opinion in
   2002 and 2012. We use conditional tree models to test a set of
   hypotheses that connect support for a leader with a strong hand to four
   major factors: political socialization and education; dissatisfaction
   with political and economic conditions; nationalism; and the charisma of
   the leader. We find that socialization interacts with nationalist
   orientations in shaping Russian opinion about the desirability of
   leaders with a strong hand.},

Abstract = {Recent research has shown that niche parties are both increasing in
   importance in European party systems and behave differently than their
   more mainstream counterparts. Indeed, there is growing evidence that the
   dynamic between green parties and social democratic parties is
   especially nuanced. Regionalist parties differ from other niche parties
   in that they can be found on the left, right, and center of the
   ideological spectrum. We find that regionalist parties benefit from
   increasing the ideological distance between themselves and the
   mainstream party that most often wins at the national level. However,
   regionalist parties' relationship with the mainstream party that most
   often wins in their home region is more nuanced. Regionalist parties
   must be distinct enough from the mainstream rival in their home region
   to be an alternative but close enough to serious compete for the same
   voters.},

Abstract = {In recent years, Kenya and Zimbabwe have been described in comparative
   terms. The similarities between the two countries include a shared
   colonial legacy, common experiences in the areas of power sharing,
   equitable distribution of resources, economic asymmetries, regional
   disparities, corruption and electoral reforms. The Independence
   Constitutions of the two countries were negotiated at Lancaster House in
   London, Britain, and are both referred to as Lancaster House
   Constitutions. Both countries have grappled with the challenge of
   creating widely accepted constitutions. Using a comparative case study
   approach, the article discusses the processes of constitution-making in
   the two countries. Although the article recognises the importance of
   content, it largely focuses on the processes leading to the creation of
   the 2010 and 2013 Constitutions of Kenya and Zimbabwe, respectively},

Abstract = {The article evaluates the arguments presented in Jason Brennan's Against
   Democracy, Ilya Somin's Democracy and Political Ignorance and Achen and
   Bartels' Democracy for Realists and their implications for democratic
   theory and practice. The article uses their work to shine a light on
   ongoing and contradictory trajectories of democratic reform in Britain
   at the local and national levels, and to argue against the widespread
   view that British democracy should be reformed in ways that give
   citizens more control over political decisions. These books point to
   ways in which democracy might be salvaged, rather than replaced, and in
   which British democracy in particular might be reformed in order to
   better meet the challenges of the twenty-first century, by focusing less
   on participation and more on representation. This requires a two-pronged
   strategy. First, that we reform liberal democratic institutions in ways
   which better harness the power of non-majoritarian institutions,
   strengthen formal epistocratic checks and balances, and embrace the move
   towards greater political elitism in order to appropriately constrain
   the popular will and to ensure rigorous scrutiny within a traditionally
   configured representative democratic system. Second, that we explore
   ways of incorporating citizens' voices at different points in the
   democratic system in order to circumvent some of the problems these
   authors describe and to ensure that the strengthening of representative
   institutions does not unfairly marginalise citizens.},

Abstract = {Right-wing populist parties (RWPP) have obtained outstanding electoral
   results during the Great Recession in Europe. While some authors have
   adopted a macro level approach to explain this success highlighting the
   relevance of the context of crisis, others have focused on micro
   explanations to analyse how the ``losers of globalization{''} (the
   elderly, less educated and lower class) comprise the main electoral base
   of these parties. However, RWPP have performed much better in countries
   less affected by the crisis and, in certain contexts, the so-called
   ``losers{''} of globalization have not been their main electoral base.
   Using individual data for 12 Western European countries provided by the
   European Election Studies (2014) database, in this paper we demonstrate
   that the combination of these two sets of explanations (at the macro and
   micro levels) is necessary not only for empirical reasons, but also for
   conceptual ones to understand the phenomenon. While the general profile
   of this family of voters tend to be older, less educated and belonging
   to the lower class, in countries most affected by the crisis RWPP voters
   tend to be younger and better educated.},

Abstract = {Theories of democratic legitimacy argue that people who believe the
   government is well managed and represents their interests are likely to
   defend the democratic status quo. Principal-agent theory predicts,
   however, that these same groups are also more likely to support
   executive actions that threaten vertical or horizontal accountability.
   Citizens who feel represented by an ideologically sympathetic and
   competent executive may be willing to delegate the president additional
   authority to enact their agenda, even at the expense of democratic
   principles. Survey data from Latin America are largely consistent with
   the principal-agent hypothesis; those who voted for the ruling party in
   the previous election or who perceive that the economy is strong say
   they not only like democracy and oppose coups but also support limits on
   critical actors and opposition parties and are willing to let the
   president bypass the legislature and court. Thus to understand the
   breakdown of democracy, we must not only examine the conditions that
   leave the losers of political and economic processes satisfied with the
   process that culminated in their defeat but also identify conditions
   when winners tolerate electoral and institutional challenges and are
   willing to protect space for public criticism.},

Abstract = {The rest of the world worries about Trump's bellicosity, ignorance, and
   patronising arrogance. In the US he presents a clear and present danger
   to civility and democracy. His xenophobia and racism, his deep
   resentment of our educated elites and his ignorance of and contempt for
   much of our history mark his politics. He has found a supportive public,
   perhaps about 40 per cent of the electorate, in what the experts
   politely termed `low information voters'. Many are white working-class
   citizens who think themselves left behind by the economy (rightly) and
   suffering disadvantages as compared to allegedly favoured immigrants,
   Afro-Americans and Latinos. A large charge of anger at the independence
   of women accompanies this complex. Trump, schooled in the most vulgar
   aspects of television, keeps attention on his antics whilst a piratical
   gang of ideologues and political operatives staff his government. They
   are proceeding with systematic intensity to the destruction of our
   regulatory state and the eventual destruction of our welfare state.
   Perhaps the special prosecutor will bring down Trump; perhaps we face a
   severe constitutional crisis as he defies the juridical system. Trumpism
   will not disappear with Trump. He has brought to the centre of our
   politics the entire spectrum of our social pathologies, has seized the
   Republican party and neutralised a Democratic party which cannot quite
   escape nostalgia for its better day and is, above all, incapable of
   presenting solutions to the twenty-first century problems of the nation.},

Abstract = {Do people hold politicians accountable for the performance of
   government? I test this question using individual-level experiences with
   the performance of one major public service: transportation. I compile
   records of transit performance, tracked via individuals' fare
   transactions and train delays, and link these data to opinion surveys. I
   show that people perceive different levels of performance but fail to
   connect performance with judgments of government. I build on this by
   testing the importance of responsibility attribution on people's ability
   to hold government accountable. I find that when people are
   experimentally provided with information on government responsibilities,
   they are able to connect their experiences of performance with their
   opinions of government. These results demonstrate that confusion about
   government responsibilities can frustrate accountability.},

Journal = {COMPARATIVE POLITICS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {51},
Number = {1},
Pages = {61+},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Scholarship on the rise of political parties mostly focuses on the
   electoral arena. From this perspective, the legislative arena is
   determined by party system properties. This article aims to show that
   the causal arrow points in the other direction as originally suggested
   by Duverger. Two mechanisms of legislative organization arguably allow
   for the ascendancy of political parties: control over the legislative
   agenda or powerful committees. A comparative analysis of thirty-six
   procedural reforms in the Swedish and French legislatures during the
   1866-1958 period suggests that, all else being equal, a quest for
   procedural efficiency originating from the dynamics of legislative
   democracy led to the creation of powerful committees. Only if
   anti-system obstruction of legislation posed a threat to the survival of
   legislative democracy, individual legislators became willing to
   unilaterally surrender inherited powers to control the plenary agenda to
   party leaders. Since both the empowerment of committees and the
   centralization of agenda control occurred independent of the properties
   of party systems, parties are the product rather than the origin of
   legislative democracy.},

Title = {Fiddling While Rome Burns? A Response to Weyland on Full Professor
   Promotions},
Journal = {PS-POLITICAL SCIENCE \& POLITICS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {51},
Number = {4},
Pages = {825-829},

Abstract = {This article responds to the stimulating comments of Kurt Weyland (2015)
   about the important but seldom discussed full professor promotion
   process. He suggested a number of problems, particularly candidates who
   are too eager to ``go up{''} and institutions with insufficiently
   rigorous publication standards. Rather than proposing a top-down
   solution, Weyland urged associate professors to wait until they cleared
   a high research bar. By contrast, I see few systemic problems with the
   current promotion process. Although research is important, our academic
   ecosystem requires the valuing of a wide range of faculty activities and
   contributions. In addition, asking faculty to jump through even more
   research hoops may be `fiddling while Rome burns.' It overlooks the
   crucial issue that we all face: making the case for the value of higher
   education to taxpayers, parents, lawmakers, students, employers,
   philanthropists, voters, and society. I am optimistic that we can do so,
   but it may require a new set of academic priorities-less of the status
   games that can animate our academic lives and more of a focus on how our
   work benefits society.},

Abstract = {While there exists a large literature characterizing the political
   determination of the size of the government, much less attention has
   been paid to the political determination of the scope of government
   (i.e., what activities are undertaken by public rather than private
   entities). While there are economic costs and benefits to privatization,
   there is also a political benefit to incumbents: by privatizing today,
   politicians transfer future revenues (when they might not be in office)
   to the present. This political benefit leads to overprivatization. We
   show that this political benefit persists even if politicians are able
   to borrow against public assets. We analyze the relationship between
   privatization and the political environment, as well as complete a
   normative analysis of the costs and benefits to society of allowing
   politicians to privatize assets.},

Abstract = {Who supports allowing Syrian refugees into the United States? As a
   candidate, Donald Trump clearly opposed doing so. In contrast, religious
   leaders across the broad spectrum of religious traditions in the United
   States have drawn on sacred texts to call their people to action in
   response to the Syrian refugee crisis. Many explicitly ask the
   government to resettle Syrian refugees in the United States. Thus, many
   Republicans may have experienced cross-cutting pressures. Analyses of
   three surveys from 2015 and 2016 found that party identification,
   ideology, support for Trump, partisan-news consumption,
   religious-service attendance, age, and education predicted support for
   bringing Syrian refugees to the United States. Overall, the partisan and
   ideological variables were far more predictive of attitudes than
   religious variables. These results raise important questions about
   refugee politics and contexts in which religious forces conflict with
   partisan and ideological forces.},

Abstract = {This article critiques Howard J. Wiarda's assumptions about U.S. foreign
   policy and the promotion of human rights and democracy. Focusing on
   pieces that Wiarda wrote in 1982, 1991, and 1997, it emphasizes the
   continuity in Wiarda's skepticism that the United States could or should
   more aggressively promote human rights in Latin America. I criticize
   this analysis as being out of touch with the degree of support that U.S.
   foreign policy gave to human rights-abusing regimes in the region and
   with the level of domestic support for democracy and human rights there.},

Abstract = {This paper presents a sociohistorical study of the ritual homages
   carried out by singers, artists, and left-wing activists at the
   graveside of Violeta Parra every February 5 in Santiago, Chile. The
   homages date from the years immediately following her death in 1967 and
   persisted during the military dictatorship, when they acquired an
   important political dimension. They have continued without interruption
   to the present day. The analysis privileges the concepts of collective
   memory, cultural trauma, social generation, and the importance of song
   in social movements.},

Abstract = {This article provides a detailed analysis of the policy positions
   advocated by the five political parties that won seats in the 2016
   elections to the National Assembly for Wales (Welsh Labour; Plaid Cymru;
   the Welsh Conservatives; United Kingdom Independence Party (UKIP) and
   the Welsh Liberal Democrats). It takes advantage of a unique dataset of
   party positions and justifications created for a Voter Advice
   Application website that ran during the election campaign:
   www.wales.electioncompass.org. The data collected reflects the responses
   of senior policy officers within each party to a series of 35 policy
   questions. This dataset is used to estimate the extent of party
   disagreement across each policy question as well as to create a matrix
   of inter-party similarity. These quantitative findings are supplemented
   by a discussion of the positional justifications proposed by the parties
   to the project.},

Journal = {AMERICAN POLITICS RESEARCH},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {46},
Number = {5},
Pages = {890-908},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {There is a sizable literature on the causes and effects of candidate
   positioning in elections. An implication of this research is that
   candidates present clear issue positions to the electorate and citizens
   then make voting decisions based on this information. However, if
   candidates are ambiguous in the positions they take, this may impair
   voters' decision-making and prompt voters to punish them for
   inconsistency. Although there is a growing literature on the effects of
   candidate and party ambiguity, consensus on the implications of
   ambiguity for candidates and voters is yet to be achieved. Using data
   from the 2010 House elections, we find that candidate ambiguity
   undermines voters' ability to vote consistent with the spatial logic
   just as Downs speculated. We also find, in contrast to Downs, that
   voters punish rather than reward candidate ambiguity. We suggest that a
   possible mechanism is in voters' valence ratings of candidates.},

   the government's analytical functions and the necessary conditions and
   hindrances in making such an impact. In doing so, it addresses several
   important agendas for researchers engaged in the arts, humanities and
   social sciences aiming to generate `research impact' and policy
   relevance. Narrowly, this research evaluates the generation of impact
   with the UK's government's central machinery for analysis. It makes this
   evaluation from primary data derived from several iterations of a
   research council-funded project, collectively known as `Lessons
   Learned'. The paper also presents an analysis of the business of
   `impact' and why these activities present enduring challenges to
   individual scholars, universities and end-users.},

Abstract = {The Ghadr Party, an eclectic group of diasporic Punjabis, was perhaps
   one of the most significant political movements led by emigre Indians in
   the early twentieth century. Designated as one of the biggest threats to
   colonial rule in the 1910s, the Ghadr Party spread its operations over
   five continents, and repeatedly committed ads of sabotage aimed at
   colonial officials from India. By the 1920s, however, the birth of
   popular movements in India marginalized various groups that believed in
   the spectacular actions of a vanguard as a strategy for overcoming the
   stifling impact of colonial rule. Members of the party, eager to find a
   foothold in the changed political scenario, opened discussions for
   building a popular front in Punjab, with many returning to the country
   to participate in such an endeavour.
   In this article, I study the encounter between the Ghadarite tradition
   and the communist movement in colonial Punjab through the writings of
   Sohan Singh Josh, who attempted to bring these two traditions together
   to produce a viable political project. I argue that Ghadar's encounter
   with Marxism not only influenced the former, but also radically
   transformed Marxism itself, particularly on questions of History,
   violence and volition.},

Abstract = {There has been a rise of illegal acts based on the advantages offered by
   ICT and social networks, mainly based on crimes against property. The
   most common acts are those relating to the purchase or sale of
   second-hand products, those exhibiting an influencer lifestyle or crimes
   relating to misleading advertising, among others. However, the complete
   range of crimes is much broader. The study reveals that, in any case,
   these are not ICT scams per se, as the number of parties suffering
   damages is very high. Its research also poses significant difficulties,
   as in many cases it does not mention the occurrence of bankruptcy
   problems.},

Abstract = {The aim of this article is to examine the impact religion has had on the
   post-Soviet economic development of Georgia and Estonia. The role of
   religion in economic development has been neglected in the field of
   social sciences, in which political and economic theories dominate.
   Considering the difference in the religiosity of the two
   countries-Georgia is one of the most religious countries in Europe while
   Estonia is the most atheist-religion will be incorporated as a factor
   that could have directly or indirectly impacted the post-Soviet
   development of the two countries. By studying the relationship of the
   church and the state in the two countries and the population's economic
   attitudes that may have been influenced by their religiosity, this paper
   will conclude that religion can be considered a contributing factor in
   the economic divergence between Estonia and Georgia. The article's
   overall findings will suggest that the practice of Eastern Orthodoxy in
   Georgia impedes the development of good governance and a free market
   economy, whereas the opposite holds for Protestantism or atheism in
   Estonia.},

Abstract = {The research is an attempt to comprehend with these issues and enunciate
   an argument that international labor rights and labor standards are a
   pivotal component of international trade, investment, and development
   strategy for the well-being of the entire society not only for the
   wealthy nations. Section 1 of the paper lays out unanimity of labor
   rights and standards depicted from different sources with evoking
   instances showing real concerns that have originated with the
   development of new universal trade. Section 2 illustrates various forums
   where the international labor rights assertion perhaps induced, through
   a discourse of multiple supervision or enforcement mechanism available
   under such forums. Last part of the paper concludes the study and
   proposes future initiatives to labor rights advocates from all
   discussions and further recommends new allegiances to international fair
   labor rights and standards by government, employers, and trade unions
   entered into a global economy.},

Abstract = {This article considers Jeremy Waldron's recent contribution to a growing
   conversation about how to make political theory and philosophy more
   responsive to real politicsPolitical Political Theoryin light of his
   broader body of work, especially Law and Disagreement. I argue that
   rather than providing a genuine alternative to the idealization and
   abstraction characteristic of what Waldron labels the justice industry,
   he uses the concept of what counts as properly political to grant nearly
   absolute priority to a certain class of concerns over others. This
   strategy places him in the company of a long line of liberal theorists,
   but it does not necessarily make his theory more political than its
   rivals. His alternative simply focuses its idealization and abstraction
   on the ideal of legitimacy rather than justice.},

Abstract = {The conservative asymmetry of elite polarization represents a
   significant puzzle. We argue that politicians can maintain systematic
   misperceptions of constituency opinion that may contribute to breakdowns
   in dyadic representation. We demonstrate this argument with original
   surveys of 3,765 politicians' perceptions of constituency opinion on
   nine issues. In 2012 and 2014, state legislative politicians from both
   parties dramatically overestimated their constituents' support for
   conservative policies on these issues, a pattern consistent across
   methods, districts, and states. Republicans drive much of this
   overestimation. Exploiting responses from politicians in the same
   district, we confirm these partisan differences within individual
   districts. Further evidence suggests that this overestimation may arise
   due to biases in who contacts politicians, as in recent years Republican
   citizens have been especially likely to contact legislators, especially
   fellow Republicans. Our findings suggest that a novel force can operate
   in elections and in legislatures: Politicians can systematically
   misperceive what their constituents want.},

Abstract = {This article demonstrates that ethnic segregation is a key determinant
   of local public goods provision. We argue that this results from
   politicians' strategic engagement in ethnic favoritism: Only when ethnic
   groups are sufficiently segregated can elites efficiently target
   coethnics with local public goods. We test this expectation with
   fine-grained data from Malawi on the spatial distribution of ethnic
   groups, geolocated distributive goods (water wells), and the ethnic
   identities of political elites. We find that members of parliament
   provide more local public goods to their electoral districts when ethnic
   groups are geographically segregated but that this increased investment
   is primarily targeted toward coethnics. Thus, while segregation promotes
   overall public goods provision, it also leads to greater favoritism in
   the distribution of these goods. Our logic and evidence provide an
   elite-driven explanation for both the considerable variation in ethnic
   favoritism across contexts and the underprovision of public goods in
   ethnically diverse settings.},

Abstract = {Conventional wisdom assumes that increased censorship will strictly
   decrease access to information. We delineate circumstances when
   increases in censorship expand access to information for a substantial
   subset of the population. When governments suddenly impose censorship on
   previously uncensored information, citizens accustomed to acquiring this
   information will be incentivized to learn methods of censorship evasion.
   These evasion tools provide continued access to the newly blocked
   information -and also extend users' ability to access information that
   has long been censored. We illustrate this phenomenon using millions of
   individual-level actions of social media users in China before and after
   the block of Instagram. We show that the block inspired millions of
   Chinese users to acquire virtual private networks, and that these users
   subsequently joined censored websites like Twitter and Facebook. Despite
   initially being apolitical, these new users began browsing blocked
   political pages on Wikipedia, following Chinese political activists on
   Twitter, and discussing highly politicized topics such as opposition
   protests in Hong Kong.},

Abstract = {This article offers a map of ``participatory institutions{''} (PI) that
   appear in conflict scenarios related to mining, hydrocarbons, wind and
   hydroelectric energy megaprojects in Mexico. The authors offer evidence
   of the existing gap between the implementation and the legal framework
   that regulates PI. Additionally, the authors suggest three possible
   outcomes pursued by the main actors involved in conflicts over
   megaprojects, which involve suboptimal exchanges: 1) preventing
   megaprojects, 2) decreasing violence and 3) obtaining pecuniary benefits
   towards the communities affected by megaprojects.},

Abstract = {Women make up just 6.1 per cent of Pacific parliamentarians. Increasing
   women's representation is a key area of focus for political leaders and
   aid donors, both as a human rights issue and as a vehicle for the
   substantive representation of women. Women's participation in politics
   in the Pacific Islands is often seen as a form of social contract
   between women. Female voters are expected to vote for female candidates.
   In exchange, female parliamentarians are expected to act, not just for
   the constituency that elected them, but for women as a group. This
   article examines the expectations that are placed on the political
   participation of Pacific women, and argues that attempts to increase
   women's participation in politics in the region should avoid reinforcing
   these expectations through an emphasis on substantive representation.},

Abstract = {Using an original database of legislative and presidential electoral
   results from the democratic transitions of the 1970s and 1980s to the
   present day, we provide a new assessment of electoral volatility in
   Latin America. Following a model established in studies of other
   regions, we decompose volatility into two subtypes: party replacement
   and stable party volatility. We demonstrate the relevance of this
   approach to Latin America and, further, document that volatility has
   persisted rather than waned in Latin America's posttransition period
   largely because of party replacement. We then examine the contested link
   between economic performance and volatility and document temporal
   instability in this relationship: our analysis affirms previous
   conclusions regarding a connection in the 1980s in Latin America but
   uncovers scant evidence of a relationship between the economy and
   volatility for the 1990s to present day.},

Abstract = {In October 2014, flyers appeared in mailboxes of Montana voters that
   positioned nominees for the state Supreme Court according to an
   ideological scale. The study, authored by researchers from Stanford and
   Dartmouth, was met with public outrage. The Commissioner of Political
   Practices in Montana asked me to vet the ethics of the study. The
   investigation led me to conclude that current Institutional Review Board
   (IRB) practices are inadequate for evaluating research involving field
   experiments in political science because there is no explicit attention
   in the process to protect a community. I believe the IRB should mandate
   that researchers explicitly address implications about how their
   research could affect the communities they study.},

Abstract = {Individuals who are more sensitive to negative outcomes from error are
   more likely to provide nonresponses in surveys. We argue Neurotics
   sensitivity to negative outcomes leads them to avoid gathering costly
   information and forming/reporting opinions about stimuli. Using data
   from the 2014 Cooperative Congressional Election Study, we show
   Neuroticism is strongly and positively associated with NA/DK responses
   when placing politicians on a seven-point ideological scale. We then
   introduce to political science a Bayesian hierarchical model that allows
   nonresponse to be generated by both a lack of information as well as
   disincentives for response. Using this model, we show that the NA/DK
   responses in these data are due to inhibited information collection and
   indecision from error avoidance by Neurotics.},

Abstract = {Recent studies show that protest campaigns have a greater chance of
   success if they adopt nonviolent tactics, while the use of violence is
   often self-defeating. This article argues that violence may prove
   effective when combined with high popular mobilization, embedded in a
   generally non-violent movement and practiced against an unresponsive
   regime with low cost-tolerance threshold. Based on the case study of
   Ukraine's 2014 revolution, the article shows that the presence of an
   ideologically motivated agency skilled in violent techniques lowers the
   initial costs of generating violence, while the moral outrage in the
   face of regime backlash decreases further participation costs. If armed
   resistance on the part of protesters can increase the costs of a
   crackdown for the regime beyond its tolerance level, it will yield to
   protest demands.},

   for that purpose ten general election surveys and more than 200 opinion
   polls taken from the Centro de Investigaciones Sociologicas database.
   Firstly, we depict the evolution of the ideological self-placement of
   members of different occupational classes during the last three decades;
   we identify changes that, in spite of their modest magnitude, imply a
   qualitative alteration of the formerly prevailing pattern of ideological
   differentiation. Secondly, we show that these changes are not simply a
   by-product of the makeover of the socio-demographic, educational and
   sector composition of classes. Finally, we try to find out whether the
   observed changes are due to a process of generational replacement,
   finding this to be so only in part. We close the article outlining three
   possible explanations that should be tested in future research.},

Abstract = {The human rights that integrate the rights of children are conceived of
   as the substantial content of a democratic system and consequently frame
   the state and the social construction of families. The objective of this
   article is the analysis of the development and implementation of the
   public policy for children and adolescents in 2011-2021 for the city of
   Bogota. The methodology used is qualitative document analysis. In terms
   of the identification of the problem, it is shown that the policy-makers
   took the defined needs and the governance structure of the policy into
   account and accordingly presented several alternatives. The process of
   identifying typologies of public policy according to districts made it
   possible to understand the complexity of the exercise and that in marry
   cases the implicit existence of multiple types is due to the diversity
   of contents and embedded intentions. However, it is necessary that the
   policy is inclusive towards the population in general so that it becomes
   a window of opportunity for human development in all of its dimensions.},

Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Computational models have been underutilized as tools for formal theory
   development, closing off theoretical analysis of complex substantive
   scenarios that they would well serve. I argue that this occurs for two
   reasons, and provide resolutions for each. First, computational models
   generally do not employ the language or modes of analysis common to
   game-theoretic models, the status quo in the literature. I detail the
   types of insights typically derived from game-theoretic models and
   discuss analogues in computational modeling. Second, there are not
   widely established procedures for analysis of deductive computational
   models. I present a regularized method for deriving comparative statics
   from computational models that provides insights comparable to those
   arising from game-theoretic analyses. It also serves as a framework for
   building theoretically tractable computational models. Together, these
   contributions should enhance communication between models of social
   science and open up the tool kit of deductive computational modeling for
   theory building to a broader audience.},

Abstract = {Integration politics experienced a postcolonial crisis in the late
   1960s. This was a crisis driven by the simultaneous and inter-related
   eruption of Powellism and Black Power. This article uses the crisis of
   integration politics to show the Powellite conjuncture from its other
   side, as it played out in the reconstitution of black British politics.
   It shows how black activists responded to the rise of Powellism by
   demanding that the politics of integration be either abandoned or

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW},

Volume = {39},
Number = {3, SI},
Pages = {369-383},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Home-country institutions are increasingly engaged in reaching out to
   their emigrants to further their domestic agendas. Using a
   most-different systems design, I compare two cases in which emigrant
   outreach is dominated by the state (Philippines and Mexico) and two
   cases in which it is dominated by parties (Lebanon and the Dominican
   Republic). My main argument is that each type of outreach results in a
   different trade-off between electoral mobilization and partisan
   autonomy. State-led outreach encourages emigrants to transcend partisan
   divisions but does not mobilize overseas voters. By contrast, party-led
   outreach generates higher electoral turnout while reproducing and
   reinforcing sectarian and/or clientelist patterns of interest
   representation. I conclude with the implications for whether emigrants
   are likely to play a democratizing role in fragile democracies with
   serious deficits in participation, representation, and accountability.},

Journal = {ELECTORAL STUDIES},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {53},
Pages = {1-10},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {How does the party affiliation of local elites influence the
   distribution of central government funds to territorial units? We
   revisit this question with the help of a new dataset on spending from
   Romania (2004-2011), a dataset that allows us to better understand the
   mechanisms linking local leaders to government spending, mechanisms that
   have not been systematically tested in the literature. Specifically we
   exploit the 2008 Romanian electoral reform in a research design that
   resembles a natural experiment. We identify two causal mechanisms that
   link the political affiliation of local elites to the receipt of
   government funds: (1) central leaders share the credit for the funds
   allocated with local leaders, and to get the most electoral benefits
   they are more likely to allocate funds to territories with leaders from
   the same party who act as vehicles for government credit claim; (2)
   central and local leaders engage in an exchange of perks game in which
   local leaders mobilize local resources in national electoral campaigns
   and receive in exchange funds from the government, which in turn help
   these local elites build a reputation and increase their re-election
   chances.},

Abstract = {The article focus on the choice of the single member district voting
   system under the Third Republic based on an analysis of the
   parliamentary debates about three electoral laws (1875, 1889 and 1927).
   The aim is to study the interaction between the electoral interests of
   political actors, the stakes of democratization and the evolution of the
   political regime. We use the researches on democratization and electoral
   studies to question the consideration of context as a variable of
   analysis in electoral reforms. We demonstrate that the presence and the
   interweaving of the determinants of electoral reform depend on the
   context, which is preponderant in explaining the electoral system
   choice.},

Abstract = {Political scientists have increasingly looked to the role that disgust
   plays in shaping public opinion and attitudes. This emotion plays an
   important role in building and reinforcing boundaries in the polity. It
   is particularly important in shaping attitudes toward gay rights. We
   analyze data from the 1993 American National Election Studies (ANES)
   data and two original studies. We find that disgust is a powerful but
   contingent rhetorical tool. It can powerfully shape public attitudes,
   especially on issues of sexual purity, but that efficacy must come with
   a strong caveat: our findings show that some members of the public will
   reject disgust rhetoric as an indignant reaction against the speaker.},

Abstract = {The central government established Pudong in Shanghai as the first
   national-level new area (new area). It replicated this territorial
   experiment in major cities, particularly during the last decade. As
   territories directly under the supervision of the central government,
   new areas receive large amount of preferential funding and exercise
   sub-provincial-level powers over land use change, infrastructure
   development and taxation. However, new areas are not the same territory
   located in different cities, but territorial configurations that
   heterogeneous nested hierarchies of power constitute. This paper
   conceptualizes new areas as dynamic centralizing strategy of the central
   government towards urban governance. During the last decades, the
   central government has established an increasing number of urban
   districts, enhancing the administrative capacities of city governments.
   New areas are part of this strategy by which the central government is
   gradually reconfiguring cities. This paper adopts a geographical
   approach to analyze territorial change in China as the underlying
   political dynamic that governs intertwined processes of investment and
   production that ultimately materialize urban transformation. New areas,
   as territorial strategies, propel further rounds of administrative
   centralization that extend the scope of urbanization. The introductory
   section of this paper presents a preliminary discussion about the
   political and economic context in which the central government designed
   and implemented new areas as a national strategy of development. The
   second section discusses new areas in relation to the power relations
   they form with other administrative territories in cities. Further
   rounds of land redistricting in the context of new areas are discussed
   in the third section. Finally, the last part of this paper remarks the
   importance of the central government in shaping urban transformation
   through territorial reforms.},

Abstract = {Extant findings show that voter fraud is extremely rare and difficult to
   prove in the United States. Voter's knowledge about voter fraud
   allegations likely comes through the media, who tend to sensationalize
   the issue. In this study, we argue that the more voters are exposed to
   media coverage of voter fraud allegations, the more likely that they
   will perceive that voter fraud is a frequent problem. We merge the 2012
   Survey of Performance of American Elections with state-level media
   coverage of voter fraud leading up to the 2012 election. Our results
   show that media coverage of voter fraud is associated with public
   beliefs about voter fraud. In states where fraud was more frequently
   featured in local media outlets, public concerns about voter fraud were
   heightened. In particular, we find that press attention to voter fraud
   has a larger influence on Republicans than Democrats and Independents.
   We further find that media coverage of voter fraud does not further
   polarize partisan perceptions of voter fraud. Rather, political interest
   moderates state media coverage on voter fraud beliefs only among
   Republicans. Last, our results provide no support that demographic
   changes, approval of election administration, or information concerning
   actual reported voting irregularities have any discernable effects on
   partisan perceptions.},

Abstract = {The autonomy of independent regulatory agencies (IRAs) raises concerns
   about how to keep them accountable. Remarkably, the process of
   Europeanisation has led to the emergence of a multilevel regulatory
   system linking IRAs to national and supranational actors but, on the
   other side, this process has influenced the capacity to make IRAs
   accountable. The literature about the accountability deficit of IRAs has
   tried to address this question, but the interplay between delegation,
   `multi-levelisation' and accountability has not been thoroughly
   investigated yet. Notably, theoretical analysis of IRAs' accountability
   in multilevel regulatory environments is still scarce. This article is
   aimed at contributing to the debate by pointing out that any theoretical
   discussion about the accountability of IRAs should be framed in
   normative terms and, precisely, should reconsider a crucial dimension
   neglected so far, that is, the goals accountability is expected to
   achieve. The article, in fact, argues that in multilevel regulatory
   environments the impact of devices adopted to improve the accountability
   of IRAs is generally weakened by the presence of a `neutral' idea of
   accountability, which dilutes its power. The only way to strengthen the
   effect of accountability is to bring politics and democratic values back
   into the regulatory process.},

Abstract = {The text presents a reflection on the notion of didactic transposition
   and the role of wise knowledge and the knowledge to learn in the
   framework of teaching-learning processes in large social mobilizations.
   I argue that the huge network of situated knowledge that is developed in
   the contours of mobilization occurs between collectivities in a
   horizontal relationship, without the mediation of wise knowledge. For
   this, I support an ethnographic approach to various processes that have
   sustained the wave of mobilization opened in 2011},

   As researchers work to ensure that replication materials are provided,

   provision-of journal archives. Based on our experience in analyzing and
   handling journal replication materials, we present a series of
   recommendations that can make them easier to understand and use. The
   provision of clear, functional, and well-documented replication
   materials is key for achieving the goals of transparent and replicable
   research. Furthermore, good replication materials enhance the
   development of extensions and related research by making
   state-of-the-art methodologies and analyses more accessible.},

Abstract = {The increasing visibility of prominent political leaders in news media
   is well documented in political science literature. The main concern
   that has been raised in this connection is that the complexity of
   political processes is being reduced to achievements and standpoints of
   individual politicians, and the importance of rational opinion building
   is discounted. The results of the current study provide the first
   empirical evidence to account for the misgivings about emotional effects
   of personalized political information on media audiences. Using data
   from an online experiment, this study shows that news coverage regarding
   behaviors and personal characteristics of a foreign leader influences
   (a) evaluations of personal characteristics typical of his or her
   nation's citizens and (b) emotional perceptions of that leader's country
   (sentiment and respect). This effect is shown to reflect a psychological
   phenomenon whereby people project their emotions and perceptions
   regarding a leader's personal characteristics onto his or her country
   and people.},

Abstract = {Emotions feature prominently in political rhetoric and media frames, and
   they have potent effects on how people process information. Yet,
   existing research has largely overlooked the influence of disgust, which
   is a basic emotion that leads people to avoid contamination threats. We
   illustrate how disgust may impede learning, as compared to the more
   commonly studied emotion of anxiety. Disgust and anxiety are natural
   reactions to many kinds of political threats, but the two emotions
   influence political engagement in different ways. This study
   investigated the distinctive effects of disgust in a series of
   experiments that manipulated information about the outbreak of an
   infectious disease. People who felt disgusted by a health threat were
   less likely to learn crucial facts about the threat and less likely to
   seek additional information. Thus, disgust has the counterintuitive
   effect of decreasing public engagement in precisely those situations
   where it is most critical.},

Abstract = {We study whether and how intergenerational social mobility affects
   political distrust. Mobile individuals may blame/praise the political
   system for their movement down/up the social ladder. Accordingly, we
   theorize how social mobility influences the way people evaluate the
   political system. We use Dutch survey data and apply diagonal reference
   models to study effects of intergenerational educational mobility. We
   find that-controlling for the influence of social positions of origin
   and destination-downward social mobility results in higher levels of
   distrust. This suggests that the downwardly mobile perceive their demise
   from a `blame the system' perspective, while the upwardly mobile
   perceive their success from a meritocratic perspective. Presumably
   because upwardly and downwardly mobile individuals rely on a different
   narrative to frame their experience of mobility, only downward mobility
   has an impact on attitudes towards politics. As our results demonstrate
   political consequences of social mobility, they highlight that there is
   a need to include socialization experiences outside the political domain
   that take place after early childhood into the theoretical framework to
   explain political trust.},

Abstract = {Revolutionary protests can spread surprisingly rapidly. Social contagion
   may play a key role in this process: people who observe others
   participating may be more likely to do so themselves, thus reinforcing
   the proparticipation signal. We leverage data from two surveys to assess
   the relationship between exposure to proparticipatory social signals and
   individual-level participation in the Tunisian revolution. We benchmark
   these effects to those associated with individual-level characteristics,
   including those tied to political and economic grievances. We find
   robust evidence of the importance of social signals: those who reported
   having friends who participated and those who lived in neighborhoods
   where others participated in the protests were substantially more likely
   to participate, even after controlling for an array of individual-level
   and contextual confounds. We find scant support for the expectation that
   participants and nonparticipants were distinguished by their commitment
   to democracy or by economic grievances.},

Abstract = {Archaeological investigations among the Upper Tanana speaking peoples of
   the Yukon-Alaska Borderlands began with seemingly conventional
   approaches to respectful consultation and collaboration in the early
   1990s. After having been engaged with this work since 2011, first as a
   student and now as a researcher at the Little John site, I have
   accumulated experiences which have shaped my ideas regarding the
   maintenance of collaboration, how it evolves over time, and how its
   unique community context promotes a relaxed and mixed methodological
   strategy that I call an unstandardized approach to collaboration. This
   includes formal and informal relationships or friendships, diversifying
   institutionalized concepts of capacity building, and deprioritizing
   disciplinary goals that impose time constraints in favour of just being
   present. This approach has been nurtured by the cultural ethos of our
   host community over twenty-five years of engagement and an ongoing
   conversation of ``how{''} anthropologists should approach and practice
   community collaboration. The result is an academic archaeological
   program which has become integrated into a small northern community of
   transitional hunter-gatherers that contribute to the shared goals of
   collaborative archaeologies-particularly the deconstruction of power
   resulting from colonial legacies and the reconstruction of power rooted
   in locality.},

Abstract = {Decisions by interest groups about when and how to work together inside
   coalitions are critical components of interest group strategies. This
   article argues that the composition of lobbying coalitions is a key
   factor that relates to these decisions. First, partisan diversity within
   a coalition may enhance contributions from groups if bipartisanship is
   seen as a positive signal of the coalition's likely success. Second,
   network embeddedness may enhance contributions from coalition members if
   concomitant relationships make it easier to collaborate. Using a
   two-mode exponential random graph model with structural zeros, the study
   draws on interviews with congressional staff members, interest group
   representatives, and coalition representatives working on health policy
   in the United States. The results demonstrate a robust, positive
   association of partisan diversity with contributions by interest groups
   to lobbying coalitions. The results also reveal positive correspondence
   with network embeddedness, although these results are contingent on
   model specification.},

Abstract = {This article analyzes China's policy approach to dispute settlement
   through the angle of its attitude on international law, especially the
   role of third-party compulsory mechanism in solving international
   disputes. It explains China's position of no acceptance and no
   participation in the South China Sea arbitration case and discusses the
   legal implication of the arbitration case and its political and security
   impacts on the South China Sea (SCS). A compulsory dispute settlement
   mechanism may not be the only or the best option for addressing the
   disputes in the SCS. A model of maritime dispute management is proposed
   with the goal of achieving peace and stability in the region of the SCS.
   This article suggests a practical four-tiered model of maritime dispute
   management in the SCS, namely, environmental security as a driving force
   of cooperation in the SCS, fisheries cooperation as a start of the SCS
   dispute resolution, United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea as a
   framework for ocean governance in the SCS, and lastly, transformation of
   ways of thinking as a foundation to lead policy and research direction.},

Abstract = {In the two decades since signing, the Good Friday Agreement (GFA)
   continues to generate acrimonious debate over whether it has brought
   about sustainable peace or fomented weak and sectarian governance
   institutions. In this article, I review the formation and outworking of
   the GFA. In so doing, I go beyond either/or analyses of the GFA to
   identify the complex forms of political agency it has generated, not
   necessarily envisioned by the Agreement's architects. I draw particular
   attention to the ways in which the central support beams of the
   Agreement-consociationalism and Europeanisation-have gradually become
   weakened to threaten the sustainability of power-sharing institutions.},

Abstract = {Recent discussions in Just War Theory have been framed by a polarising
   debate between traditionalist and revisionist approaches. This debate
   has largely overlooked the importance of an applied account of Just War
   Theory. The main aim of this essay is to defend the importance of this
   applied account and, in particular, a nonideal account of the ethics of
   war. I argue that the applied, nonideal morality of war is vital for a
   plausible and comprehensive account of Just War Theory. A subsidiary aim
   of the essay is to show that once we appreciate the importance of the
   applied, nonideal account, it becomes clear that the positions proposed
   by revisionists and traditionalists are, in fact, much closer than often
   presumed.},

Abstract = {A common theoretical framework underpins the work of the recent wave of
   paternalism defenders. While unacknowledged, authors who invoke
   libertarian paternalism, coercive paternalism, asymmetric paternalism,
   and other positions share fundamental, common assumptions and approaches
   that break with earlier defenses of paternalism, which were grounded
   primarily in natural law theory and liberal perfectionism. This break is
   sharp enough that it makes sense to speak of a new paternalism: a
   framework that avoids any comprehensive account of the human good;
   relies strongly on behavioral economics and psychology to justify its
   favored interventions; and uses a utilitarian calculus to evaluate when
   regulations, or rather nudges, are appropriate. After describing this
   framework, this article examines whether the new paternalism marks any
   advance over the old.},

Abstract = {Most policy-making decisions taken in parliamentary democracies are
   essentially matters of party competition. Yet, in some policies, the
   linkage function of political parties is limited by purpose, which is
   frequently the case in free votes with a morality dimension. This has
   led to a debate in the literature on the determinants of Legislators'
   preferences in free votes. The present research note adds to this debate
   by analyzing the parliamentary procedure to regulate pre-implantation
   genetic diagnosis (PGD) in Switzerland. By assessing whether and to what
   degree MPs based their decision on their personal characteristics and on
   the preferences of their constituents, the contribution shows that not
   only are MPs' voting decisions determined by these individual level
   factors, but also that these factors have detectable effects on the
   legislative outcome.},

Abstract = {Whistle-blowing has always been an important vector of resistance to
   state crimes, and technology has produced a new generation of digitally
   mediated truthtelling, which is novel in its provision of source
   material, its systemic critique and the breadth of its impact.
   International standards and national legal frameworks increasingly
   acknowledge the importance of whistle-blowers, but those whose
   disclosures challenge the state are often excluded from emerging
   standards of protection. The repercussions for those excluded include
   restrictions on freedom of expression pursued through the courts and the
   rhetorical framing of truthtelling as a crime against the state.
   Ultimately, if whistle-blowers' revelations about state crimes are to
   hit home, their status as human rights defenders needs to be asserted.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this article is to examine the partisan slant of cable
   news coverage of the unemployment rate and the impact presidential
   speeches have on this coverage. I examine coverage of the monthly
   release of the unemployment rate from September 2005 through April 2015
   for programs on all three major cable networks: The Situation Room,
   Special Report, and Hardball. Although the partisan leaning of these
   sources may affect coverage, presidents may be able to influence
   unemployment news coverage if the news reports the president's speeches.
   Using Lexicoder to content analyze the amount and tone of coverage, the
   findings reveal evidence of both partisan slant and presidential
   leadership of news coverage through speeches.},

Abstract = {This study uses empirical evidence from a nearly comprehensive set of
   electoral democracies that use single-member plurality systems or mixed
   electoral systems with single-member plurality components in order to
   establish empirically the impact of territorial patterns of electoral
   support upon vote-to-seat conversion. The analysis, employing individual
   parties as units of analysis and multiple linear regression with
   cluster-robust standard errors as its main methodological tool, confirms
   the hypothesis that single-member plurality rules give a
   representational bonus to parties with low levels of nationalization.
   This effect is contingent upon absolute and relative party size, so that
   very large parties, and particularly frontrunners in party competition,
   receive an advantage irrespective of their nationalization. Mixed
   electoral rules further facilitate their advantage, while the gains of
   very small parties tend to be enhanced by large assembly size. These
   findings contribute to a better understanding of the dynamics of party
   system development under Duvergerian conditions.},

Abstract = {How do non-governmental organizations (NGOs) affect sanction policies?
   Using two datasets of sanctions and NGOs, we study whether and how
   US-based NGOs working in a target state can influence the threat and
   implementation of sanctions initiated by the USA. At the threat stage,
   the sender government tends to perceive NGOs as a signaling device such
   that NGOs increase the probability of sanction threat. At the imposition
   stage, the presence of NGOs in a target state also increases the
   likelihood of a sender state imposing sanctions. In addition, the sender
   state tends to implement costly sanctions when NGOs have more field
   operations in target states. This study provides a systematic
   explanation of the relationship between NGOs and sanction threat and
   implementation.},

Abstract = {Unlike sovereign nations, minority nations cannot fully empower their
   societal cultures exclusively with their own autonomous institutions,
   because they are evolving within a larger political state and a more
   comprehensive legal order. In this article, we compare Catalonia,
   Quebec, and South Tyrol with regard to their legal capacity to develop
   their societal culture by their own autonomous institutions. In doing
   so, we identify six legally oriented pillars that are central for a
   minority nation to sustain its societal culture, on the one hand, and
   that are fundamental for a multinational (quasi) federation to feed a
   healthy democratic and hospitable environment for all, on the other
   hand. Those pillars form the building blocks of the Societal Culture
   Index, which allows measuring and comparing minority nations by
   combining normative studies and empirical research. Hence, we argue that
   governance in (quasi) federal system will be improved to the extent that
   minority nations score as high as possible on the Index.},

Abstract = {This article uses the theory of Red Queen competition to predict
   patterns in the founding of nationally active interest groups in the
   USA. The theory of Red Queen competition holds that competition among
   groups in a population is history-dependent such that each
   organization's competitiveness is a function of its historical
   experience. The theory predicts that: (1) a population relatively full
   of recently experienced incumbent organizations is extremely uninviting
   for newcomers; and (2) a population relatively devoid of recently
   experienced competitors (and thusly full of incumbents whose competitive
   experiences are either minimal or concentrated in the distant past) is
   relatively inviting for newcomers. We test these predictions against
   data from two group populations. Ultimately, we find strong support for
   the theory of Red Queen competition and its substantive predictions.},

Abstract = {Abundant research demonstrates that electoral rules have an impact on
   party system fragmentation. Building on these findings, and adopting a
   dynamic approach, this article investigates the effect of changes of the
   ballot structure on party system nationalization and shows that this
   effect is conditioned by levels of ethno-geographic concentration and
   political decentralization. Specifically, candidate-centered reforms
   hamper party system nationalization by making parties less likely to
   obtain similar vote shares across constituencies, whereas party-centered
   reforms tend to foster it. Moreover, concentration of ethnic groups at
   the district level or considerable political decentralization
   exacerbates the impact of candidate-centered changes. These effects are
   demonstrated through an analysis of an original dataset of electoral
   reforms and party system nationalization as measured with different
   indices across fifty-nine democracies and more than five hundred
   legislative elections.},

Abstract = {In the last decade, bio-politics and psychology studies indicated a link
   between conservatives' attraction to emotion-based appeals and liberals'
   attraction to logic-based appeals. This study seeks to contribute to
   current analyses by using an innovative approach, that of Aristotelian
   rhetorical analysis. This study examines the rhetorical strategies used
   by Israel's party leaders on Facebook and their reception during the
   2013 elections. Addressing the prevalence of emotion-based appeals
   (pathos) versus logic-based appeals (logos), we found that left-wing
   leaders used more logo appeals than all other candidates whereas
   right-wing party leaders used the most pathos. We also found that the
   most shared and liked messages of right-wing candidates were mainly
   pathos-based ones, whereas the most shared messages of left-wing
   candidates were logos-based posts. The findings strengthen-from a unique
   perspective-the notion regarding the dominance of emotional appeals
   among conservatives versus the dominance of logical appeals among
   liberals.},

Volume = {19},

Pages = {52-74},

Abstract = {Are national governments responsive to citizens' opinions when
   negotiating policies in the Council of the European Union? Conceiving of
   the Council's policy-making space as encompassing left-right and
   pro-anti integration issues, I argue that governments apply different
   modes of responsiveness' on these issues. As left-right issues are more
   reliably and intensely salient in domestic elections than pro-anti
   integration issues, governments' responsiveness to left-right public
   opinion should be more systematic than to pro-anti integration opinion.
   Statistical analyses of 3700 policy positions of governments in the
   Council demonstrate that governments highly structure their
   responsiveness on left-right issues according to electoral cycles and
   systems (systematic mode'). However, they only sporadically respond to
   public opinion on pro-anti integration issues, when parties and events
   trigger the public salience of integration (sporadic mode').},

Title = {Measuring issue-salience in voters' preferences},
Journal = {ELECTORAL STUDIES},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {51},
Pages = {103-114},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {We provide a new approach to the measurement of issue salience that
   explains how the salience of an issue among voters and the position of
   the parties on a given issue interact to each other and determine vote
   choices and aggregate election results. Analyzing the spatial model of
   voting, we show how voting probabilities can be estimated by a
   multinomial logit regression where the ideal policy locations of voters
   on each issue dimensions are independent variables, and where no
   individual specific perception about the location of the political
   parties is used in the regression. The pieces of survey information that
   are used to calculate issue-salience are: i) specific position of
   respondents on each issue dimension, ii) vote choice, and iii) the
   policy position of parties on each issue dimension, which is measured by
   the mean perceived position. Rather, only an aggregate estimate of party
   positions on issues is needed. To demonstrate the mechanics and value of
   the approach, we analyze regional elections in the Basque province of
   Spain. In that region, we find that the left-right dimension is about
   two times more salient than nationalism. The nationalism issue is,
   however, more divisive than the left-right issue. This shows that the
   issue that voters care more about, may not coincide with the issue on
   which the parties offer more distinctive policies. (C) 2017 Elsevier

Abstract = {Congress packages pork-barrel spending in complicated proposals that
   belie theories of distributive politics. We theorize that roll-call
   voting on such bills depends on grant programs' administrative
   centralization, party ties with presidents or home-state governors, and
   differences in geographic representation between chambers. Analyzing
   votes between 1973 and 2010 using a within-legislator strategy reveals
   that House members are less likely to support decentralized spending
   when they are copartisans with presidents, while senators support
   decentralization regardless of such party ties. When House members or
   senators share affiliation with only governors or with neither chief
   executive, the likelihood of support rises with decentralization.},

Abstract = {Extant literature demonstrates that holding public office is financially
   lucrative. Yet little is known about which sitting legislators profit
   from office. Relying on original data of members of the Florida
   legislature, I estimate predictors of income growth among sitting
   legislators. I find that legislators whose vote share increases by 10
   percentage points between elections report income growth of nearly
   \$20,000. This finding is robust to estimation technique and model
   specification, indicating that electoral safety is tied to income
   growth. Lawmakers appointed to legislative posts with agenda-setting
   power do not obtain additional income. These data demonstrate the market
   values of electorally dominant legislators.},

Abstract = {Capitalism as a mode of production and a form of social organization
   differs from all hitherto existing society in that it does not rely on
   the preservation of traditional hierarchies or on direct coercion to
   secure its reproduction. Capitalist society coheres on the basis of
   exchange which establishes a network of interdependent relations between
   individuals. Drawing on the work of Alfred Sohn-Rethel, this article
   engages with the apparent paradox of how the reproduction of class
   society takes the form of spontaneous exchange transactions between
   autonomous individuals. The article explores the argument that the
   conceptual basis of cognition is historically and socially conditioned,
   and highlights the unique identity between the structure of exchange and
   the conceptual mode of thinking. Finally, the article demonstrates how
   the hidden character of social domination and the secret identity' of
   commodity form and thought form serve to systematically obscure the true
   origins and nature of fundamental social problems. The case in point is
   the popular topic of rising inequality in the United States, a direct
   outcome of the reproduction of class relations, the underlying cause of
   which - the deepening division of intellectual and manual labor - is
   either conveniently ignored or, worse still, glorified.},

Abstract = {New approaches to citizen-building are flourishing, yet theoretical
   tools are lacking and empirical research is limited. This article
   contributes in several ways. Theoretically, it offers a
   reconceptualization of the traditional making of citizens framework,
   aiming to adapt it to contemporary needs and concerns. Empirically, it
   offers an examination of the content of civics curricula as well as
   original data on the outcomes of an ambitious state-led social
   engineering campaign in the United Arab Emirates, where leaders seek to
   build more globalization-ready citizensmore entrepreneurial, market
   friendly, patriotic, and civic minded, yet still loyal to the regime.
   Using a difference-in-differences framework, I find evidence that social
   engineering is succeeding in some respects but backfiring in others,
   giving rise to citizens not only more patriotic but also more entitledin
   other words, entitled patriots. Findings contribute to knowledge of
   state-led social engineering and citizen-building in the contemporary
   era.},

Abstract = {The repertoire of political participation in democratic societies is
   expanding rapidly and covers such different activities as voting,
   demonstrating, volunteering, boycotting, blogging, and flash mobs.
   Relying on a new method for conceptualizing forms and modes of
   participation we show that a large variety of creative, expressive,
   individualized, and digitally enabled forms of participation can be
   classified as parts of the repertoire of political participation.
   Results from an innovative survey with a representative sample of the
   German population demonstrate that old and new forms are systematically
   integrated into a multi-dimensional taxonomy covering (1) voting, (2)
   digitally networked participation, (3) institutionalized participation,
   (4) protest, (5) civic participation, and (6) consumerist participation.
   Furthermore, the antecedents of consumerist, civic, and digitally
   networked participation, are very similar to those of older modes of
   participation such as protest and institutionalized participation.
   Whereas creative, expressive, and individualized modes appear to be
   expansions of protest activities, digitally networked forms clearly
   establish a new and distinct mode of political participation that fits
   in the general repertoire of political participation.},

Abstract = {This article rescues the memory of four Chileans, who were linked to
   revolutionary organizations abroad and who developed a political work
   under the vision of militant Internationalism. The testimony of the
   interviewees is the gateway that allows us to wander the margins of a
   broad and far-reaching phenomenon such as Internationalism. Once there,
   we try to identify the theoretical components that interweave it, and to
   show the existence of other internationalist experiences that go beyond
   those studied by recent historiography, namely, the course of Communist
   Chileans trained in Cuba and who participated in the guerrilla
   Sandinista. Our focus was on the history of miristas, socialists and
   mapucistas, who practiced internationalism in Bolivia, Peru, Nicaragua
   and Argentina.},

Title = {IS IT TIME FOR LOTTERY-BASED AUTHORITIES?},
Journal = {POLIS-POLITICHESKIYE ISSLEDOVANIYA},
Year = {2018},
Number = {6},
Pages = {142-154},
Abstract = {The article analyzes the concept of political lottery as a way of
   selecting candidates for power positions as well as a full-fledged
   political institution. The use of lotteries in this capacity has a long
   tradition, it can be traced back to the historical experience of ancient
   Greek policies, namely, Athens. Currently, there is a discussion about
   the scope of possible use of political lotteries due to deformation of
   feedback mechanisms between government institutions and society at
   large. Political lotteries have already been put into practice in a
   number of countries, including Ireland and Germany. In other states,
   there is a discussion of the appropriateness and specific forms of
   implementing the selection of ``random{''} people in the decision-making
   bodies. The authors enumerate several approaches to the given
   phenomenon. The minimalists believe that the use of political lotteries
   and implementation of deliberate discussions between selected delegates
   can be useful only at the local level within narrow-issue framework.
   Inclusivists insist that political lotteries are applicable in different
   situations and the scope of their application should not be limited to
   the local level of decision-making. From this point of view, the
   randomly selected bodies can be included into the system of already
   existing political institutions. Finally, the maximalists believe that
   the selection method will create a new type of political regime that can
   ensure a more equitable representation of citizens' interests. The
   article explores the main arguments and points of disagreement among
   representatives of the three approaches as well as existing projects for
   creating ``lottery-based{''} political institutions. The authors analyze
   the main reasons for applying to the practice of political lotteries
   and, as a consequence, determine the main advantages of random selection
   for political positions. Among these advantages are the reduction of the
   corruption component in the selection process, a statistical
   representative sample as a result of the process and the decreasing
   importance of traditional social and political dividing lines. The
   authors come to the conclusion that political lotteries also have
   shortcomings such as the awkwardness of the functioning of the
   lottery-based bodies and the need to search for a new format of checks
   and balances.},

   regulation for the Mexican case, which are used in combination with
   several subtypes - including disclosure requirements, contribution
   limits, spending limits and public and private subsidies - and then it
   is confronted by the evidence accumulated by political science, the
   databases of International IDEA (Falguera, Jones and Ohman, 2014) and
   the OECD (2016), international organizations who systematize formal
   constraints or de jure frameworks in countries around the world. So that
   one can be in a better position to understand the consequences of the
   framing of such regulations and their de facto implementation. Finally,
   this essay addresses some proposals that can help optimize the
   regulation and use of money in politics for the Mexican case.},

Abstract = {Proponents of Scottish independence often foreground the claim that
   Scotland forms a democratically relevant and underrepresented community
   that would function better as an independent state. This argument casts
   the nation in cultural rather than ethnic or purely political terms, and
   thus implicitly draws on forms of both liberal nationalist and
   multicultural political theory. We argue that any plausible articulation
   of such a `cultural nationalism' ultimately reduces to a series of
   interrelated claims about the nature and effects of culture, identity
   and meaning. We provide a post-foundational account of culture and
   identity as fluid, contested, and overlapping, which we argue renders
   the cultural nationalist position unsustainable. We argue Britain is
   really constituted by multiple tiers of political identities,
   communities, and democratic structures, which suggests traction for
   post-nationalisms such as political liberalism and cosmopolitanism. We
   then sketch a distinctive form of post-national cosmopolitanism that
   focuses on local rather than universal attachments, identities and
   practices. We conclude that more polycentric governance is required to
   help accommodate the fluid nature of culture and identity. A deeper
   analysis of multicultural political theory post-Brexit therefore
   supports a fundamental remaking of current constitutional arrangements
   and radical devolution across the whole of the United Kingdom.},

Abstract = {Global citizenship education GCED) has been attracting all sectors of
   education with the focus on universal human rights and global issues.
   While all sectors are involved, the mainstream of instructional delivery
   is taking place in the informal education sector in Korea. The
   curriculum typically covers moral, values, and ethics with civics and
   citizenship education. Justice in relations to global issues, however,
   are often assumed, ignored or overlooked. Based on the changing
   educational demand in a rapidly changing world, there is a need for
   teachers with competency in addressing issues of globalization,
   diversity, and social justice. This paper identifies the crucial gaps
   along with missing context as to how justice fits into the larger
   picture in relation to grounds for recognizing the pathway for
   domesticating global issues through social justice.},

Abstract = {In 1974, Vattimo's ``Subject and the Mask{''} proposed a
   ``revolutionary{''} reading of Nietzsche, presented as an
   anarcho-libertarian prophet who intended to break down the totalitarian
   ratio of Platonic and modern/Cartesian metaphysics and, above all, the
   hierarchical social order stabilized in the capitalist state. Hence came
   the idea of combining Nietzsche with Marx, soliciting a dialogue between
   bourgeois intelligentsia (students and radicalized professors) and a new
   worker movement, postlaborist and post-Hegelian (Antonio Negri's mass
   worker). In the 1980s, however, the development of ``weak thought{''}
   coincided with an understanding of the absurdity of any
   ``revolutionary{''} and ``Marxist{''} reading of Nietzsche. This
   understanding is above all the recognition of the end of every project
   of political transformation in a period in which terrorism was revealing
   a strict relationship between dialectics and violence. This essay
   proposes a reading of the evolution of Vattimo's thought.},

Abstract = {This paper provides a dynamic theory of a parliamentary government
   system with proportional-representation elections, policy-motivated
   parties and voters, and an endogenous status-quo policy. The theory
   identifies the representation of parties in parliament, the governments
   the parties form, the policies chosen by those governments, and the
   duration of the governments and their policies. Governments are
   majoritarian, government parties are equal partners, they and their
   policies are durable, voters elect minority parliaments in every period,
   and government policies provide concessions to centrist voters. If
   crises can occur, governments can fall, but a new government forms after
   the next election. The theory provides explanations for three empirical
   findings: equilibria consistent with Gamson's law, an analog of
   Duverger's law for proportional-representation electoral systems, and
   compensational voting where voters give the out party additional votes
   when an incumbent government is expected to continue in office.},

Abstract = {The gap between the legislation and biotechnology advances it visible.
   In order to fill this gap, bioethics plays an important role as a
   subsidiary source of law, especially in controversial issues and the
   ones ``unreached{''} by legal regulations. At this point, it is
   necessary to observe the proximity between the principles that guide the
   legal order, since legalism may lack legitimacy. Therefore, in the
   development of biotechnology, taking into account the risks in different
   areas, ethical considerations are necessary aiming to overcome the
   instrumentalization of man whom, in certain circumstances, is reduced to
   the condition of object. The dialectic between bioethical and legal
   discourse, together with the responsible action of man in relation to
   his creations, is a condition for its survival, that of other beings, of
   nature, and of social equity. This approach is based on the thinking of
   Hans Jonas and aims to present the advances in biotechnology and the
   need for delimitations from (bio) law and ethics of responsibility to
   provide parameters of evaluation and growth in biotechnologies, so that
   in a preventive and corrective way, it can guide responsible and
   sustainable development. Thus (bio) law and ethics assume the task of
   legitimizing scientific behavior in the pursuit of justice and equity,
   in order to avoid the constipation of man and his relationships.},

Journal = {NEW POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {40},
Number = {4, SI},
Pages = {744-762},
Abstract = {Advocacy nongovernmental organizations based in the North adopt digital
   tools to bypass repressive regimes, raise awareness amongst global
   publics, sustain grassroots activists in the South, and engage in
   political action. Social media was expected to offer innovative
   platforms for mobilizing participants to act on behalf of ``distant
   others.({''}) But the practices of some organizations signal that
   something else is at play. Rather than empower individuals, digital
   campaigns reify elite politics, using outsider strategies to support
   insider lobbying. Through communicative processes of mediatization,
   organizations pay homage to the existence of a movement, but only afford
   thin forms of participation. Using the framework of media advocacy to
   explore Human Rights Watch and the Enough! Project, we argue that social
   media becomes a top-down platform that exacerbates the elite design of
   organizations, enabling them to assert legitimacy for political actions,
   while disingenuously marketing themselves as democratic with bottom-up
   credibility.},

   analysis of German Landtage},
Journal = {REGIONAL AND FEDERAL STUDIES},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {28},
Number = {5},
Pages = {547-574},
Abstract = {While the European Union's Lisbon Treaty has important implications for
   regional parliaments with legislative competences, most studies have
   focused on cross-country differences or examined the activities of
   regional parliaments at the EU level. This contribution shows the
   existence of substantial intra-country differences in the formal
   scrutiny rights of regional parliaments. We analyse how German regional
   parliaments (Landtage) have addressed the challenge of controlling their
   governments in EU affairs. Using fuzzy-set comparative qualitative
   analysis, we find that institutional and partisan factors (vote share in
   the second chamber, economic potential, and conservative governments)
   explain the differences found among German Landtage particularly well.
   Landtage with otherwise weak parliamentary prerogatives were successful
   in using the reform momentum to strengthen their rights in the field of
   EU policy. Combined with the party political salience of EU
   policy-making, the integration process has thus empowered formally
   weaker Landtage.},

Abstract = {Comparative studies routinely demonstrate that Australia underperforms
   relative to other established democracies on measures of campaign
   finance integrity and the role of money in politics. Scandals relating
   to the influence of political donations have affected both major parties
   in recent elections, and record numbers of Australians believe that the
   government is run for a few big interests. Previous studies have focused
   on the problems of Australian political financing arrangements, and
   reforms at the state level, but little is known about public perceptions
   of the influence of money in politics in Australia. This paper examines
   these perceptions with data from the Australian Election Study covering
   elections from 1990 to 2016. Using multilevel modelling we investigate
   the role of election level and individual level characteristics on
   perceptions of the influence of major interest groups in Australian
   politics. We find that when the Liberal-National Coalition is in
   government, there is greater concern over the role of big interests in
   politics. At the individual level, we find that partisanship, ideology,
   being an electoral winner or loser, and economic evaluations affect
   citizens' perceptions of interest group influence.},

Abstract = {Archbishop Desmond Mpilo Tutu is renowned for promoting peace, harmony
   and reconciliation in ways that are now associated closely with the
   African moral philosophy of ubuntu. He won the Nobel Prize for Peace for
   his nonviolent role in the fight against apartheid. His conception of
   ubuntu has come to be widely referenced in debates and judgements
   related to the transformative democratic constitution of the new South
   Africa. Tutu articulates ubuntu, in tandem with his Christian beliefs,
   as a means for achieving reconciliation and harmony where critics call
   for radical transformative violence. Scholars have recognised how Tutu's
   unique African Christian perspective shapes his version of ubuntu. This
   article adds to this literature by focusing on how Tutu's Christian
   conception of ubuntu informs his judgement, practice and thinking
   regarding just war. Given that black people have been historically
   denied serious recognition, the recognition of Tutu's unique
   contributions to ubuntu that this article pledges has important
   epistemological cum ontological and political significances.},

Volume = {39},

Pages = {157-176},
Abstract = {The contribution will attempt to reflect on the interplay in recent
   theories of populism and crowd psychology between the ideas of mob and
   crowd on the one hand, and those of mass and people on the other. Using
   an approach deriving from the history of ideas, it will outline two
   fundamental aspects of the complex and ambivalent interaction between
   the concepts of people, crowds, masses and mob: first, the
   transformation of the protesting crowd or mob into ``the eople,{''} the
   legitimate source of second, the distinction between regressive crowds
   and mobs and progressive masses and peoples, stated both explicitly and
   implicitly in crowd psychology and populist theory. This article will
   also aim to highlight an idea that has come to the fore in much of the
   recent literature on populism. It has long been observed that populism
   opposes ``corrupted{''} elites and the ``honest{''} people. But it has
   recently been observed that a major source of populist mobilization is a
   cistinction, within ``the people,{''} between a ``positive{''} people
   and the ``others,{''} the plebs who are left outside the dynamics of any
   kind of political representation. The article will show that this
   distinction is fundamental in order to understand not only the
   construction of populist political identity, but also the dynamics of
   the mobilization of new movements, which claim to take charge of the
   political processes and change the rules of the game.},

Abstract = {In the context of the European Year of Citizens 2013, the European
   Commission launched a new public instrument, the ``Citizens'
   Dialogues{''}. A series of public consultations were organised in the
   member states in order to restore the confidence after several years of
   crises. This article is based on the observation of dialogues that took
   place in Belgium in 2013 and 2014. It aims at understanding better which
   feelings such an initiative was supposed to strengthen in its initial
   justifications, at the first rank of which, feelings of belonging. Using
   Norbert Elias's reflections on national and post-national integration,
   the authors show that this experimentation eventually revealed in the
   chief of citizens a feeling of powerlessness more complex than expected.},

Abstract = {This article seeks to shed light on the critical role of
   interdisciplinary qualities for the societal relevance of Political
   Science. It traces the historical development of Austrian Political
   Science embedded in the larger international context and by considering
   the cases of the United States, France, Germany and Italy. It serves as
   a means to demonstrate the close linkage between interdisciplinarity in
   Political Science and its professional, political and civic relevance.
   By addressing the question of Political Science's societal relevance
   from a historical and cross-national perspective, it prepares the ground
   for consecutive studies that conduct in-debt comparative analysis},

Pages = {143-156},
Abstract = {The Australian way of life is claimed to be a celebration of sporting
   rather than intellectual achievement. The influence of sport for
   contemporary Australians is examined by asking a nationally
   representative sample of Australian adults to identify their most
   `influential' sporting heroes. Men are far more likely than women to
   view male sporting heroes as influential with a similar pattern apparent
   for Liberal/National Party identifiers over other party supporters,
   although younger people are less likely than their older counterparts to
   nominate male sports stars. Cricket legend Donald Bradman's iconic
   status transcends sport, signifying conservative, white, masculine
   elements of national identity.},

   some countries in Eastern Europe are returning to extractive industries
   and the exploitation of natural resources to finance their national
   budgets. The paper looks at mobilization in one locality in Romania and
   the Czech Republic and investigates the radically different pattern of
   mobilization in these two otherwise similar areas. Whereas in many
   Romanian cities affected by this economic ``transformation,{''} citizens
   have protested against it, as in Campeni with regard to the Rosia
   Montana gold mining project, in the Czech Republic, however, the
   extension of coal extraction was hardly opposed by the general
   population, with the exception of environmental groups. Using critical
   political economy approach, the paper explores the interaction between
   the economic changes, politics, and citizens' reactions and argues that
   the difference in outcome can be explained by the configuration of the
   economic organization, and the dominant ``social blocks{''} that sustain
   it, in each of the areas considered.},

Abstract = {Profits from legal gambling are often channelled to good causes. This
   system embeds the predicament of whether citizens' potentially
   problematic gambling activities should be a source of funding for the
   public good. In this article, this dilemma is unfolded by the receivers
   of public grants that stem from gambling revenues. A total of
   twenty-three representatives of Civil Society Organizations were
   interviewed as beneficiaries of the Finnish state-owned gambling
   monopolies. The article illustrates explicit dependencies and hidden
   ethical dilemmas, suggesting that CSOs may have limited possibilities of
   making ethically consistent decisions in view of the origin of their
   funding.},

Title = {Does the Conceptualization and Measurement of Democracy Quality Matter
   in Comparative Climate Policy Research?},
Journal = {POLITICS AND GOVERNANCE},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {6},
Number = {1},
Pages = {117-144},
Abstract = {Previous empirical research on democracy and global warming has mainly
   questioned whether democracy contributes to climate protection. However,
   there is no consensus in the theoretical literature on what
   institutional traits of democracy are crucial for climate policy. Thus,
   results based on indices that summarize multiple democracy quality
   dimensions could be misleading, as their effects could balance each
   other out or hide the relative importance of each institutional trait.
   This article examines whether the analysis of the effects of democracy
   quality dimensions, measured by separate indicators, contributes to a
   better understanding of cross-national variance in climate policy
   compared to the focus on the regime type difference, measured by
   democracy quality measures. Compared to earlier research, the results
   indicate that the positive effect of democracy on commitment to climate
   cooperation depends on the realization of political rights. We find
   little to support the claim that democracy quality dimensions matter for
   climate policy outcomes. The main implication of our findings is that it
   could be fruitful to use more disaggregated democracy measures for the
   analysis of substantive research questions.},

Abstract = {This paper presents the preliminary results of a qualitative survey on
   the implementation of quotas policies, in the context of higher
   education and research in France, in the field of computer science
   specifically. Beyond the theoretical controversy over quotas, it is a
   question of diving into the heart of an environment that we can describe
   as specific (and of which we will draw some of the specificities), to
   collect the experience, the words of women, who are computer scientists
   in the academic environment, in relation to quotas. The main idea is to
   question the quotas implementation in order to study in which sense
   these quotas can indeed lead to more professional equality, but also to
   study the context in which they can slow down this professional
   equality.},

Abstract = {The year 2017 demonstrated the capacity the Brazilian president to
   approve his governmental agenda and secure solid, majority support in
   the National Congress. Despite the unfavorable economic and social
   situation, as well as very law popular support, :timer approved a deep
   labor reform and rejected denunciations of corruption in the legislative
   branch. Through the distribution of important ministries to allied
   parties and the formation of an ideologically homogeneous partisan
   coalition, President Temer demonstrated the governability of Brazilian
   coalition presidentialism. Recent policy changes, including to foreign
   policy, have exemplified the president's dominance in Brazilian
   politics, especially the ability to mobilize the resources of the office
   in the delicate task of organizing a coalition in a context of high

   in the current political-economic context of rising neoconservativism
   and neoliberalism that is racialized and gendered. The following
   discussion examines these issues using the less-known case of Asian
   Pacific Americans and an intersectional approach. Although the
   dualistic, gendered, and racialized constructions of Asians as both
   ``model minorities{''} and ``yellow perils{''} make it difficult to
   build and sustain mass movements for social justice, the local
   political-economic contexts and personal experiences of community
   members matter. I suggest that an intersectional approach to the study
   of citizenship practice among progressive Asian Pacific American
   activists offers key insights into the ways in which groups marginalized
   by race, gender, ethnicity, class, and other social forces build and
   sustain communities of resistance and transformation towards social
   justice.},

Abstract = {According to John Rawls, maximin, which requires that the economic
   situation of the most underprivileged should be maximized, is one of the
   fundamental principles of social justice. Based on three scenarios which
   attempt to place respondents behind a ``veil of ignorance{''}, a French
   survey (PISJ, 2009) and an Italian survey (OSCF, 2016) conducted on
   representative quota-based samples show that support for this principle
   considerably outweighs support for strong equality and the maximization
   of total or average wealth. In addition, this choice transcends many
   sociodemographic or ideological divisions. The respondents were,
   however, much more undecided about which is more just: a society in
   which the poorest members are more numerous but richer or a society in
   which the poorest members are fewer in number but poorer. The robustness
   of the findings is confirmed by the similarity between the results from
   France and Italy.},

Journal = {POLIS-POLITICHESKIYE ISSLEDOVANIYA},
Year = {2018},
Number = {3},
Pages = {130-146},
Abstract = {The article attempts to identify and analyze the key factors that
   determine the current state and prospects for the formation and
   institutionalization of Russia's national identity. The author attempts
   to answer the question whether the Russian Federation is a national
   state or a state of nations. The research is focused on the factors that
   cause the fragmentation of Russia's national identity, which faces
   numerous challenges related to differences in traditions, lifestyles,
   cultures, natural conditions, the historical differences in the
   development rates of individual regions, subjects of the federation, and
   nations. The author identifies the differences between the two main
   types of nationalism - civil-political, based on the institution and
   culture of citizenship, the idea of nation and national sovereignty, and
   the so-called primordial type, primarily or exclusively based on the
   ethnic criteria of understanding the nation and national identity. The
   author substantiates the thesis that the Russian nation and,
   accordingly, the Russian national identity are formed in the process of
   ``remelting{''} the multitude of ethnoses in the single organic whole.
   In order to disclose the systemic and structural components of Russian
   national identity, considerable attention is paid to the factor of its
   ambivalence, the essence of which is that representatives of the vast
   majority, if not all the peoples of Russia, realize their identity
   simultaneously as representatives of the respective ethnic groups and
   citizens of the Russian Federation. The author shows that the process of
   forming a sense of socio-cultural, political-cultural, national
   consolidation of Russian citizenship and, accordingly, Russian national,
   civil or political identity, is still incomplete. The author deploys
   arguments designed to define the hierarchy of identities, based on the
   supremacy of all-Russian identity in relation to the ethnic identity,
   and draws attention to the fact of duality of the phenomenon of nation,
   formed both from below by the will of peoples, and from above under the
   leadership of the state. In this context, the article substantiates the
   idea of the decisive role of the federal center in the transformation of
   many constituent peoples into a single Russian polyethnic nation.},

Journal = {CRITICAL REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL SOCIAL AND POLITICAL PHILOSOPHY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {21},
Number = {4},
Pages = {521-543},
Abstract = {The topic of global trade has become central to debates on global
   justice and on duties to the global poor, two important concerns of
   contemporary political theory. However, the leading approaches fail to
   directly address the participants in trade and provide them with
   normative guidance for making choices in non-ideal circumstances. This
   paper contributes an account of individuals' responsibilities for global
   problems in general, an account of individuals' responsibilities as
   market actors, and an explanation of how these responsibilities coexist.
   The argument is developed through an extended case study of a consumer's
   choice between conventional and fair trade coffee. My argument is that
   the coffee consumer's choice requires consideration of two distinct
   responsibilities. First, she has responsibilities to help meet
   foreigners' claims for assistance. Second, she has moral
   responsibilities to ensure that trades, such as between herself and a
   coffee farmer, are fair rather than exploitative.},

Abstract = {Imagining the day in which there will be no survivors left to give
   testimony about their persecution and suffering during National
   Socialism seems to be so threatening and paralyzing that in the debate
   on the inclusion of the testimonies of survivors into historical
   education important aspects are overlooked. The article reflects on who
   the survivors were and are today and on the function of including
   testimonies of survivors into educational contexts. It then introduces
   and discusses alternative methods of including the perspective of the
   persecuted into educational contexts, while at the same time fulfilling
   the standard of presenting history in a multi-perspective way.
   Everything is discussed under the premise that nothing can replace the
   experience of personal encounter with those who suffered persecution
   during National Socialism.},

Abstract = {In April 1998, Pol Pot, the dictator who had been overthrown by his own
   movement one year earlier, died on the forest plateau of Anlong Veng,
   near the Thai border, to which the Khmer Rouge had gradually retreated
   in the 1990s. A modest tomb was erected there, on the very spot where he
   was cremated. Drawing on fieldwork carried out in October-November 2011,
   this contribution describes the strange aura which surrounds Pol Pot's
   tomb. The latter is the focus of funerary practices unusual in Cambodia,
   the historical reasons for which are examined in detail. It will be
   shown that the perpetrator continues to exert an almost supernatural
   hold over this last bastion of the Khmer Rouge, influencing the
   ideological and the military, the ritual and the religious spheres
   alike.},

Abstract = {While data analysis and the related skills of data management and data

   experiences using data work in upper-level courses in International
   Relations and American Politics, we discuss how data work and
   quantitative analysis can be incorporated into subject-based (i.e.,
   nonmethods specific) courses, and how it can also enhance critical
   reasoning skills. An evaluation of this approach using direct and

Title = {International Norms in Ethno-Territorial Disputes: Legitimacy and
   Efficacy in Outsiders' Views of Independence and Irredentism},
Journal = {CIVIL WARS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {20},
Number = {1},
Pages = {66-88},
Abstract = {Ethno-national territorial disputes typically involve conflicting
   homeland claims between states and minority ethnic groups. Where such
   minority ethnic groups have cross-border ethnic kin who themselves
   constitute a dominant or influential ethnic group in a neighbouring
   state, separatist goals may take the form of either irredentism or
   independence. We conjecture that external sympathy for irredentism and
   independence may vary significantly, and that this variation may be an
   important influence in situations where secessionist groups and ethnic
   kin states have a choice between the two goals. Using a bargaining
   framework that controls for variation in relative power, status quo
   conditions and minority-side leadership preferences, we present
   experimental evidence indicating that external audiences are likely to
   support more confrontational policies in pursuit of independence than in
   pursuit of irredentism. Our evidence also indicates that independence
   attracts greater support largely because outsiders perceive it as a more
   legitimate goal; and that practical efficacy is not important in
   stimulating sympathy for either independence or irredentism. These
   results also support a broader argument in the literature on
   international norms - that such norms receive support not only because
   they may justify pre-existing goals or interests, but also because they
   are perceived as having greater legitimacy per se.},

Abstract = {This chapter examines the attitudes of the 27 member states to the
   prospective UK departure from the European Union (EU) and to the future
   of the EU, both in terms of the perspective of their governments and of
   their public opinion. It looks at the risks of the rise or reinforcement
   of home-grown populists or even of copycat referendums. It also asks
   whether other member states will seek to slow down or accelerate the
   process of European integration, or else to buttress the status quo.
   Finally, it considers some other sensitive issues, such as the balance
   between representative democracy and the use of referendums on EU
   matters and the interrelationships between the Brexit process and other
   challenges to the EU such as those posed by illiberalism in Hungary and
   Poland.},

Pages = {189-210},
Abstract = {The news media around the world has experienced drastic changes in
   recent decades, and the Icelandic media is no exception. These changes
   originate in political, economic and not least technological
   developments. In this article we map key developments in the Icelandic
   media system and illustrate the changes it has undergone in the first
   decades of the 21st century. Journalism and media studies are
   under-researched fields of study in Iceland, and the country is usually
   absent from comparative work in these fields. Often it is simply grouped
   together with the other four Nordic countries. We argue that the
   Icelandic media system differs from those countries in several ways.
   Whilst it has moved towards the liberal model there are also indications
   of increased partisanship in the media in the last decade. The smallness
   of the media system has made it more vulnerable to the increasing
   competition and commercialisation in the digital era, and Iceland was
   particularly badly hit by the financial crisis in 2008. News media
   companies in Iceland are struggling financially, several media outlets
   have come and gone, mergers have been frequent and trust in the media is
   low. The view that some sort of public support is required to secure an
   independent media and high quality journalism is gaining ground in
   Iceland. This could lead to its media system becoming more similar to
   the democratic corporatist Nordic countries than is the case now.},

Abstract = {In this article, we study the U.S. Senate to understand how legislators'
   previous experiences in elected office influence their political
   behavior. We posit that, as a result of their experiences in office,
   former governors in the Senate are less partisan than their colleagues.
   We code the political jobs held by senators between 1983 and 2015 and
   analyze the effects of these careers on party loyalty in Senate floor
   votes. We find that gubernatorial service is associated with a 7-8\%
   decrease in Party Unity. We test several hypotheses for the observed
   ``governor effect{''} and find that, relative to their colleagues,
   former governors are supported by donor networks that are less
   ideologically extreme. We conclude that the unique experiences
   associated with serving as governor, along with the personalized nature
   of governors' electoral support coalitions, affect a senator's
   relationship with the party. Ultimately, our analysis illuminates how
   personal attributes, such as prior experience in elected office, can
   inform the study of legislative behavior.},

Abstract = {In the article the author analyzes conflicts arising between scientists
   aiming at participation in the global science field and scientists who
   are predominantly tied to the context of national science. These
   conflicts are examined via ``academic capitalism{''}, ``global
   capitalism{''} and ``national elites{''} theories. The article considers
   collision of interests between scientists oriented towards connections
   with the infrastructure of the global science, including world class
   universities, multinational corporations and supranational research
   funding institutions, and scientists aimed at expanding by use of local,
   mainly state resources. The analysis includes a historical overview of
   institutional changes in science since late 1940s with emphasis on the
   following stages: division of basic and applied science in accordance
   with new tasks of scientific and technological development in 1940-50s;
   gradual transformation of relations between science and politics in
   1960-70s; university reforms in the 1980s; emergence of global markets
   of research and educational services beginning the 1990s. Following this
   overview, the article examines three cases, which allow to characterize
   interests, serving as a basis for fractions within the scientific
   community. They are the functioning of a two-tier system of research
   funding in the EU; dominance of English language journals in the
   scientific press; implementation of policy aimed at building of world
   class universities in countries with developed research cultures, which
   differ from the American research culture. This examination leads us to
   a conclusion that the scientific community is internally divided in
   accordance with choice of locally or globally oriented strategy.},

Abstract = {Why do some coalition cabinets terminate early and others run until the
   end of the legislative term? This article analyses whether coalition
   agreements lower the risk of early government termination. The main
   argument is that coalition agreements can increase the stability of
   coalition cabinets as they lower the probability of intra-cabinet
   conflict. The theoretical expectations are empirically evaluated on the
   basis of a newly compiled comprehensive dataset on cabinet duration and
   control mechanisms in coalition governments. Drawing on event history
   analysis, the effect of coalition agreements on cabinet duration is
   tested for 420 coalition cabinets from 1945 until 2015 in 23 Western and
   Eastern European countries. The results show that the existence and
   duration of a coalition agreement lower the risk of early government
   termination. These findings have important implications for our
   understanding of the interaction between coalition governance and
   coalition termination.},

Abstract = {An analysis of `fractured polity' and `fractious politics' highlights
   the impact of multiple crises on the European Union whose distinctive
   characteristics have been severely tested and contested in recent years.
   I explore three dimensions of Europe's fractured polity, beginning with
   the manner in which the Union has addressed or failed to address the
   crises it faces. I go on to reveal the impact of these crises on
   European politics, and finally point to issues that demand attention
   from social scientists.},

Title = {Trajectory of Asian American Nonpartisanship: Transitory, Transitional,
   or End State?},
Journal = {NEW POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {40},
Number = {2},
Pages = {368-383},
Abstract = {Scholarship holds that high rates of party identification constitute a
   key marker of successful immigrant incorporation, yet rates of
   Democratic or Republican affiliation remain surprisingly low among Asian
   Americans. This longitudinal study investigates the extent to which
   nonpartisanship for Asian Americans is stable or likely to change. Using
   a unique dataset that matches cases with corresponding observations over
   time, the analysis finds that No Preference is relatively permanent for
   individuals from large segments of Asian America. Low party support from
   Asian Americans is likely affected by weak party outreach. More than
   that, however, parties are a central organizing institution for
   aggregating the interests of and advocating for the base. Therefore, one
   potential consequence is that Asian Americans may be less effective in
   institutionalizing their interests and priorities in party politicking
   and in the political mainstream. This type of marginalization merits
   substantial reconsideration in a democratic and inclusive society.},

Abstract = {Following Prime Minister Theresa May's statement of 12 March 2 018 in
   response to the Novichok incident in Salisbury, news reports and social
   media platforms were awash with talk that it constituted an armed attack
   by Russia against the UK, that the UK had a right to respond in
   self-defence. and even that an international armed conflict existed
   between the UK and Russia. The circumstances of the incident and the
   response of the UK government raise important questions of international
   law. Stephen Lewis considers whether the Salisbury incident. assuming it
   was carried out by Russia, amounts to an `armed attack' for the purposes
   of Article 51 of the UN Charter, engaging the UK's right to forcible
   measures in self-defence, and explores the potential legal consequences
   of characterising the incident as a use of force.},

Journal = {IRISH POLITICAL STUDIES},

Abstract = {Accurate information on public opinion is a necessary condition for the
   effective functioning of democracies. For Lasswell, the open interplay
   of public opinion with policy is the distinguishing mark of popular
   rule' {[}Lasswell, H.D.(1941). Democracy through public opinion.
   Menasha, WI: Banta]. Yet, despite its importance, there is a distinct
   gap in methods and tools to understand large volumes of public opinion
   statements on any issue. The 2013 referendum in Ireland on the abolition
   of the Seanad (Senate) was a prominent example of this gap. Opinion
   polls were perceived as misleading in suggesting that the referendum was
   going to pass. Aiming to address opinion noise, and the polarity
   suggested by opinion polls, we conducted an online study of subjectivity
   in the week before polling. Using Q-methodology and the stream of public
   opinion generated during the campaign, we identified three main
   perspectives on the issue of Seanad abolition. One perspective was in
   favour of abolition, two opposed the proposal. We conclude that
   Q-methodology could be used to support opinion polling and political
   communication by providing a supporting context of the range of social
   perspectives on the issue at hand.},

Journal = {DEMOCRATIZATION},

Volume = {25},

Pages = {1251-1269},
Abstract = {In the past decade, Latin America has emerged as the epicentre of
   participatory democracy innovations. Proponents argue that participation
   should lead to more equitable access to public goods and a greater sense
   of political efficacy. There has been considerable debate in the
   academic literature and in the public sphere over the extent to which
   participation can produce these benefits. Yet, while Latin America has
   witnessed an explosion of participatory mechanisms and related academic
   attention, the literature has focused on socioeconomic dimensions. There
   has been little attention paid to the experiences of racialized groups,
   such as indigenous peoples and Latin Americans of African descent.
   Research suggests that in order for participatory mechanisms to produce
   positive outcomes, they must be inclusive and offer participants a forum
   for real deliberation, but how do groups that have faced barriers
   related to racism and discrimination engage in these initiatives?
   Drawing on evidence from indigenous Ecuadorian and Afro-Venezuelan
   citizen participants, this article argues that participatory mechanisms
   may reproduce the very types of inequalities that representative
   institutions are criticized for. Comparing cases across and within
   different jurisdictions reveals that certain conditions enhance the
   ability of ethnic minorities to benefit from involvement in
   participatory mechanisms.},

Journal = {WEST EUROPEAN POLITICS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {41},
Number = {2},
Pages = {517-539},
Abstract = {Although committee assignments have been researched in various
   parliaments, findings are inconclusive. This article contributes to the
   debate by analysing the allocations to specialised committees in the
   Bundestag, a legislature that establishes strong committees despite
   having strong parliamentary party groups. Studying assignments in this
   legislature can, therefore, help us to solve the present disjunction
   between European' and American' experiences regarding committee
   research. The study uses the congressional theories of legislative
   organisation as heuristic devices but explicitly highlights the strong
   involvement of parliamentary party groups. The hypotheses are tested
   with a multiple membership multilevel model across several legislative
   periods (19902013) and backed up with evidence from 51 interviews with
   German legislators. The results show that next to constituency demands
   and the influence of regional factions, there is strong evidence for a
   reassignment pattern and that a legislator's occupational background and
   connections to interest groups matter in the assignment process.},

Abstract = {This article compares the actions of two communities that declared
   themselves `peace territory{''} in Colombia: the municipally of
   Samaniego in the southwestern department of Narlik, bordering Ecuador,
   and the town ({''}corregimiento{''}) of LasMercedes in the eastern
   department of Norte de Santander, borderingVenezuela. These communities
   share a similar situation. They were strongly affected by war and became
   places of coca cullivation. In the face of this situation the civilian
   population undertook a process of nonviolent resistance against state
   and non-state armed actors. We use a qualitative methodology,
   includirtginterviews, observation and the analysis of documentary
   sources, to compare the outcomes of these actions in both cases and
   understand the reasons of their success or failure. We found that three
   opes of reasons can explain the distinct outcomes of these actions: i)
   the characteristics of the civil resistance movement, including the
   participation in the movement, its cohesion and its leadership, ii) the
   relationships between the community and armed grotos, and iii) the
   support of external actors. Finally, we argue that peace negotiations at
   the national level can foster local peace initiatives, and that these
   are important for peace in Colombia.},

Pages = {397-417},
Abstract = {A notable shocking development in the advancement of the Boko Haram
   terrorist revolt was the abduction of about 276 Chibok girls in April
   2014. Shortly afterward, while the terrorists made known their extremist
   determination to offer the girls for sale, the Nigerian government vowed
   unconditional rescue of the girls. Notwithstanding the evident
   opposition of both adversaries to nonviolent engagement, some of the
   victims were eventually released through negotiations. What then were
   the rationales that paved the way for negotiations? What are the
   implications of this approach? This article demystifies the rationales
   for negotiation between the Nigerian government and the Boko Haram
   terrorist group over the abducted girls. It argues that nonviolent
   engagement in this context arose out of intersecting interests but, more
   important, reinforced the ``vulnerability{''} of the ``new{''} religious
   terrorists to negotiation when violence proved futile in accomplishing
   some of their vital objectives.},

Abstract = {Certain issues in American politics have become racialized by virtue of
   elite rhetoric and media coverage. When considering these issues, many
   Americans find themselves, either consciously or unconsciously, relying
   on their sentiments toward and stereotypes of implicated groups to form
   opinions. This project seeks to extend research in this domain by
   considering the extent to which racialized thinking may be offset, or
   enhanced, due to the presence of other cues. While citizens typically
   support successful programs while opposing unsuccessful ones, do these
   patterns persist when program outcomes and sentiments toward program
   targets conflict? Results from a lab experiment and two survey
   experiments suggest that when while policy cues appear to have a strong
   and consistent impact on opinion, group stereotypes activated by group
   cues moderate the effect of policy cues.},

Abstract = {In the last decades, Social and Solidarity Economy (SSE) has become an
   everyday practice for an increasing number of citizens, and the SSE
   sector has been constantly expanding. Particularly, during hard economic
   times, SSE has acted as a viable economic alternative and as a means to
   support vulnerable social groups, hit by the recession. However, SSE
   does not merely act as an emergency actor during harsh economic times,
   but also as a form of resistance to neoliberal dominance and as a tool
   of empowerment, transformation and social change. This paper, using
   quantitative data from the LIVEWHAT project, explores SSE organisations
   in Greece, as one of the European countries most severely affected
   during the recent global financial crisis. The results, which are
   indicative of the Greek SSE sector during the period under study, shed
   light on the role of the recession as one of the main triggers for the
   recent expansion of SSE organisations that are often less formally
   organised, and primarily act as coping mechanisms, which aim to meet the
   uncovered, urgent socioeconomic needs of citizens. The findings also
   demonstrate that the Greek SSE sector, under study, acts as an economic
   alternative, promoting collective action and new social movements.},

Abstract = {Belgium has seen more foreign fighters leave for the ISIS `caliphate'
   than any other western European country in per capita figures. But among
   Belgian foreign fighters, as well as among Belgian terrorists who did
   not travel abroad, a stunning majority have been Belgian-Moroccan. What
   factors can explain this phenomenon? Both groups live in relatively
   similar socio-economic settings, experience stigmatization and
   discrimination, and both are, relative to broader Belgian society,
   poorly integrated. However, in investigating this question, an
   interesting caveat emerges vis-a-vis the `integration deficit' theory:
   Belgian-Turks, who are found to be comparatively less integrated than
   the Belgian-Moroccans, are underrepresented in extremist milieus. This
   paper argues that the insularity of the Belgian-Turkish population, a
   phenomenon not found to the same extent among Belgian-Moroccans despite
   also being poorly integrated (with some outliers), has protected the
   population from negative environmental elements, both criminal and
   extremist. That there are seen to be local factors that contribute to a
   `vulnerability' to the pull of crime and extremism, means that such
   conditions are likely to remain even if a group like ISIS fades into
   irrelevance.},

Abstract = {This paper is divided into two parts. In the first section, I describe a
   project that we have underway at University of Western Cape, to rethink
   Political Theory and Philosophy. It is a project partly responsive to
   the questions that have been raised over the last two years in South
   African universities, about rethinking the curriculum and decolonizing
   knowledge'. The second part of this paper will offer a description of a
   course that I have been teaching at Honours and Masters level on
   Political Violence and the Modern State. In recounting these two
   projects I wish to contribute to possible ways we might reconstitute the
   genealogy of the modern state from an African vantage point, and
   therefore to think about how this might be done in a way that is not
   Eurocentric.},

Title = {Urban regeneration. Strategy to get an emerging country?},
Journal = {PROVINCIA},
Year = {2018},
Number = {39, SI},
Pages = {57-70},
Abstract = {Cities are as complex as the society to which they belong to, that is
   the reason why their growth models require revision and implementation
   of sustainable urban strategies. It is necessary to keep in mind, that
   the capacity for renewal implies accepting inevitable changes,
   unpredictable events and considering the importance of the citizen
   participation in a representative democracy. in Venezuela, where these
   principles have been almost eliminated, it is worth asking: what kind of
   urban plans are adequate to get involved in that kind of complex spaces?
   What is necessary to stop being a country in emergency and become an
   emerging country? Taking into consideration these questions, the
   objective of this text is to analyze through a literature review, until
   which degree the institutional framework considers the necessity of a
   design and specific attention of the urban forms and their growth.
   Dissertations about the concept of urban regeneration and its growth are
   approached relating them with the Venezuelan context. Eventually, an
   analysis is presented on the elements that seek changes in the hatches
   of human behavior and the exercise of citizenship, as a direct
   consequence of the relevance of participatory urban design, in certain
   regeneration practices. The case of Venezuelan cities is different from
   other countries in the continent, due to political, social and economic
   conditions. In a country like Venezuela, it is necessary to reconsider
   the idea of ``popular power{''} and ensure the generation and
   application of urban actions as humanized territories.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF ELECTIONS PUBLIC OPINION AND PARTIES},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {28},
Number = {2, SI},
Pages = {173-189},
Abstract = {Theories of discrete emotions distinguish contempt from other negative
   emotions, and recent evidence shows that contempt toward candidates
   played a major role in two US Senate races in 2014. Contempt felt by
   respondents was the most significant emotion predicting voting against
   three of the four major party candidates, and had effects independent of
   other emotions, such as anger, anxiety, and hope. In the present paper,
   the 2016 Republican Iowa Caucus provides the opportunity to examine
   contempt in a different context: an intra-party primary campaign, where
   candidates share the important characteristic of party affiliation. We
   find that while voters perceived all leading GOP candidates as
   expressing at least some contempt, Donald Trump was seen as expressing
   the most contempt by far. Voters also felt contempt for at least some
   candidates of their own party. When they did so, it predicts
   significantly lowered probabilities of voting for Cruz, Trump, and
   Rubio, and increased probabilities of voting for one or more of their
   opponents. Implications of these findings for theory and research on the
   role of contempt and other specific emotions in voting behavior are
   discussed.},

Abstract = {The following pages summarize the analysis of agrarian and environmental
   discourses and social representations in the Ebro Delta and the Albufera
   of Valencia. The first part of the article tries to synthesize in a
   theoretical way the evolution and perspectives of family agriculture. We
   intend to analyze the essential changes that have taken place in
   agriculture and have made it survive, despite the theoretical prognosis
   that announced the end of the familiar agriculture. The second part
   addresses the methodological question of our research. We have conducted
   58 interviews and two discussion groups in which different social
   profiles have participated. The analysis of social discourses was
   complemented by the exploitation of data from agrarian censuses, as well
   as from databases related to the rice market. The conclusions summarize
   how the discourses of the peasantry point out the impossibility of
   shying away from the subalternity of agricultural activity that has been
   ostracized by economic development and bound to be polluting if it wants
   to be economically viable.},

Abstract = {An underappreciated way members of Congress represent interests is by
   pursuing policy goals through their communication with the bureaucracy.
   I argue that the bureaucracy provides an alternative, covert way for
   cross-pressured legislators, who face diverging pressures from party
   leaders, interest groups, and subconstituencies, to satisfy conflicting
   interests. Using original data of senators' communication with the US
   Department of Labor from 2005 to 2012 (109th through 112th Congresses),
   I show that, when faced with cross-pressures from party and
   constituency, senators strategically choose less visible, back-channel
   means for pursuing policy goals. These findings provide a new
   perspective on representation by demonstrating that legislators pursue
   policy goals outside of the legislative process in an effort to evade
   accountability.},

Abstract = {This paper presents the implementation of public policies regarding
   marine renewable energy in Nouvelle-Aquitaine-Euskadi-Navarre as part of
   the implementation of Smart Specialization (RIS3). The purpose is to
   understand the collective action development dynamics which include
   territorial resource valorisation strategies and strategic convergence
   between regional actors. In short, we retrace a territorial innovation
   policy process on the basis of direct observations. Under what
   conditions can specialization engender a rethinking of Euroregional
   cross-border strategies?},

Abstract = {The desire shown by the British to establish the ``rule of law{''} in
   the provinces conquered by the East India Company in the late eighteenth
   century was part of a paradoxical modernization project, distinct from
   the rhetoric of the civilizing mission that prevailed in the nineteenth
   century. They sought to govern the Indians according to their own laws
   better than they themselves were able to do. Through the analysis of a
   crucial case for the history of the imperial judicial system, the Patna
   case, this article highlights the bankruptcy of the mechanisms set up by
   the colonial power to control the administration of Muslim law in the
   courts of Bengal with British judges. In doing so, my aim is not only to
   illustrate the deadlocks encountered by the British in the exercise of a
   mode of power whose importance has passed unnoticed so far, i.e.
   supervision, in an empire where several heterogeneous forms of law
   coexisted. It is also to sketch a genealogy of Orientalism on the basis
   of the situated forms of reflexivity deployed by the colonial
   administrators, showing how and why a knowledge capable of objectifying
   the legal systems specific to the colonized peoples, in their difference
   with that of the colonizers, became necessary for the exercise of
   imperial governmentality.},

Abstract = {Going beyond the local and national scopes of anti-austerity
   mobilizations, we contribute to this special issue by focusing on
   counter-hegemonic protest at the pan-European level. In the context of
   the current austerity regimes, this emerging and precarious social
   formation enacts resistance against neoliberal hegemony and invokes the
   re-construction of European institutional arrangements and policy from
   below in explicit opposition to the dominance of austerity. We employ a
   neo-Gramscian approach complemented by framing theory to scrutinize the
   development of a pan-European counter-hegemonic bloc, focusing
   empirically on two key current pan-European initiatives: the Alter
   Summit platform and the Blockupy alliance. Our analysis unravels the
   process by which different progressive social movement frames become
   increasingly aligned through reference to an anti-austerity master frame
   with three key elements: (a) the rejection of austerity measures, (b)
   coordinated transnational solidarity, and (c) the defense of democracy
   and popular sovereignty. This master frame has the potential of
   supporting stronger pan-European counter-hegemonic mobilization and
   thereby facilitating a counter-hegemonic bloc opposing neoliberal
   hegemony. However, our analysis also reveals three challenges for our
   counter-hegemonic initiatives. First, concrete institutional
   alternatives are still weakly elaborated and articulated, which gives
   the force of rejection of the austerity master frame little direction
   and testifies to deeper structural disagreement within anti-austerity
   movements. Second, insofar as concrete institutional counter-proposals
   are made, they still remain entrenched in national frameworks. And,
   third, counter-hegemonic movements aspiring to be truly pan-European
   need to reconcile conflicting tendencies between those who want to
   re-found and those who want to exit from the European integration
   project.},

Abstract = {In the Dominican Republic, the right to nationality of individuals that
   are born in that country and that are of Haitian origin is treated with
   discrimination. By means of a large reinterpretation of the expression
   aliens ``in transit{''}, the Constitutional Court judgment in case
   TC/0168/13 deprived arbitrarily a great number of persons of Haitian
   origin from their nationality, that they acquired by the principle of
   ius soli. They did so just because their parents did not have a legal
   migratory status. Considered incompatible with the standards of the
   international human rights law, this decision makes prevail the state
   sovereignty over the right to nationality. As a result, it gave rise to
   a crisis that is very difficult to solve.},

Abstract = {This article discusses factors of political perception of post-Soviet
   countries on the basis of the recent study. Authors trace the influence
   of factors that determine images of post-Soviet countries in Russian
   society. Analysis of empirical data made it possible to identify the
   relevant objective, subjective, temporal, territorial, communicative,
   and cultural factors. Results of the study allow to conclude about
   varying degree of influence of individual factors on the rational and
   unconscious levels of perception. Object of perception had the most
   serious impact on the images of neighboring countries. Strong is the
   influence of political culture that contributes to the perception of
   post-Soviet countries as ``we{''}. Sociodemographic factors
   differentiate in their influence on the images of post-Soviet countries:
   education and gender have low influence, while age is quite important.
   Psychological condition of our own society appeared to be one of the
   most important factors. In the images of Ukraine and Belarus the
   influence of mass media is strong, while in the images of Kazakhstan,
   Tajikistan, a great role is played by the historical and cultural factor
   and personal experience. The images of all neighboring countries have
   positive emotional characteristics. This is especially noticeable in
   those Russian regions that are close to the boundaries and in which
   respondents have personal experience of communicating with the peoples
   of these countries.},

   Reconsidered, 1868-1974},

Pages = {305-326},
Abstract = {This article sheds new light on the development of concentration camps
   in colonial warfare in the longue duree from 1868 to 1974. Introducing
   different examples of forced removal and deportation in the Spanish and
   Portuguese empires, the analysis emphasizes their interrelation,
   highlighting possible transfers of knowledge that have been neglected in
   comparative discussions. Specifically, the article reassesses the Cuban
   experience of concentrating civilians in times of war (1868-98); it
   critically evaluates Spain's forgotten concentration camps on the Canary
   Islands, which emerged during the Ifni-Sahara war of 1957-58; and it
   focuses on both the theory of revolutionary warfare and the practice of
   so-called strategic resettlement in the long and protracted Portuguese
   colonial wars in Africa (1961-74). In particular, the camps on the
   Canary Islands suggest the need for an analytical distinction between
   the function of forced removals in counter-guerrilla warfare and
   administrative internment; they are related but essentially different
   policies. Based on hitherto ignored archival material, this empirically
   supported analysis challenges common assumptions about the ``origins{''}
   of camps, and questions traditional temporal boundaries in the
   development of (anti-)guerrilla warfare.},

Abstract = {The main purpose of this paper is to examine Rainer Forst's account of
   `noumenal power'. Forst's proposal for a revised `critical theory of
   power' is firmly embedded in his philosophical understanding of
   `theright to justification'. Whereas the latter has been extensively
   discussed in the secondary literature, the former has - with the
   exception of various exchanges that have taken place between Forst and
   his critics at academic conferences - received little attention. This
   paper is an attempt to fill this gap in the literature. Given the
   increasing influence of Forst's scholarly writings on paradigmatic
   developments in contemporary critical theory, it is imperative to
   scrutinize the key assumptions underlying his conception of `noumenal
   power' and to assess its usefulness for overcoming the shortcomings of
   alternative explanatory frameworks. In order to accomplish this, the
   analysis is divided into four parts. The first part provides some
   introductory definitional reflections on the concept of power. The
   second part focuses on several dichotomous meanings attached to the
   concept of power - notably, `soft power' vs. `hard power', `power to'
   vs. `power over', and `power for' vs. `power against'. The third part
   elucidates the principal features of Forst's interpretation of `noumenal
   power', in addition to drawing attention to his typological distinction
   between `power', `rule', `domination', and `violence'. The final part
   offers an assessment of Forst's account of `noumenal power', arguing
   that, although it succeeds in avoiding the drawbacks of rival
   approaches, it suffers from significant limitations. The paper concludes
   by giving a synopsis of the vital insights that can be obtained from the
   preceding inquiry.},

Abstract = {This study examines whether different editions of college introductory
   American government/politics textbooks have increased coverage of Asian
   Pacific Americans (APAs) over time. Using content analysis, I analyze
   the percentage of coverage of APAs in the same textbooks' editions
   published during 1998-1999, 2005-2006, and 2011-2012. I find that the
   coverage of APAs has increased gradually, although its magnitude is not
   very large. Mentions of APAs are found most often on the chapters of
   civil rights, demography/political culture, public opinion, and
   elections/voting/participation. Textbooks vary as to how they raised or
   dropped ranks of coverage compared to the previous period. Some
   textbooks created a new section to discuss APA history. One textbook
   used the Korematsu case in one period but discontinued it in a later
   edition. These analyses show that if textbook authors have a will to do
   so, they can increase coverage of APAs. Indeed, McClain and Tauber's
   introductory textbook (2017) discusses in detail how American politics
   affect racial and ethnic minority groups. Other authors should make
   similar efforts and make racial and ethnic groups one of the central
   themes of textbooks.},

Journal = {CITIZENSHIP STUDIES},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {22},

Pages = {633-649},
Abstract = {A key issue confronting African Christianity in the 21(st) century is
   the way to negotiate the discourses and practices surrounding same-sex
   relationships against the context of increased advocacy for the rights
   to sexual expression. Same-sex relationships have found their most
   scathing criticisms and opposition from within African Protestant
   communities, particularly Anglican and Pentecostal organisations, where
   prominent religious leaders have voiced strong opinions in support of
   legal prohibitions and heavy imprisonment terms for those convicted of
   homosexual practices. Gay rights activists have repeatedly accused
   proponents and supporters of legal prohibition of homosexuality of hate
   speech and homophobic intentions. Drawing examples from the plural,
   multi-religious Nigerian society, this essay analyses the palpable
   tension in the debates around claimed rights to free sexual expression
   and rights to manifest and propagate belief and how these intimately
   intersect with contested citizenship rights.},

Abstract = {Modern democracy is based on the expression of political opinions;
   however, in democratic societies where political violence exists, it
   decreases. Once violence is over, the recovery of free speech and the
   exchange of opinions become a key area for peace studies. This
   exploratory study investigates the expression of opinions about the
   violence suffered once it has ended. We focus on the Basque Country
   where the Euskadi Ta Askatasuna group (ETA, Basque Homeland and Freedom)
   had been using political violence from 1959 to 2011. Using survey data
   (N = 257), we investigate how (1) the fear of being in a minority
   position, (2) the closeness to the reference groups, and (3) the
   interaction between both variables affect opinion expression. Results
   show that fear of being in a minority position about violence in the
   Basque Country decreases opinion expression and that closeness to the
   reference groups has direct and indirect effect on opinion expression.
   This study contributes, firstly, to the limited research on the
   political opinion expression about the violence experienced in the
   Basque Country, secondly, to the limited research on its peace process,
   and thirdly, by adopting as reference groups those resulting from the
   use of violence.},

Abstract = {Economic performance has a well-known relationship to political trust.
   If the economy is perceived as performing well, the levels of political
   trust are likely to improve. During the 2008 economic crash in Iceland,
   this relationship seemed vindicated once more. Political trust in
   Iceland fell from very high to medium levels. Paradoxically, strong
   indicators of good economic performance after the crash have not been
   reflected in similarly strong indicators of greater political trust.
   Thus, while the economy has recovered, political trust has not followed
   suit to a comparable degree. To account for this discrepancy, we analyse
   the data on political trust in Iceland before and after the crash. Our
   findings indicate that while the economy is important in generating
   political trust, improved economic performance does not account for the
   whole scenario. The political impact of the crisis remains an obstacle
   to re-establishing political trust to previous levels, as identifying
   with a party in the government fails to contribute to political trust in
   the previous manner. Similarly, personal experience of the crisis may
   have created a sense of alienation among age cohorts that were
   particularly affected by the crash and the subsequent economic
   recession.},

Abstract = {China's economy ended 2017 with 6.9\% strong growth, having successfully
   stabilised its gradual growth deceleration from 2012. The rebound was
   partly the successful outcome of macroeconomic rebalancing towards
   domestic demand-driven growth based on rising consumption. The general
   policy tone for 2018 is not so pro-growth as higher quality economic
   growth is preferred. To fulfil his ``China Dream{''}, Xi Jinping has a
   three-stage economic roadmap for the long-term development of China's
   economy. For this, China needs to cultivate new sources of economic
   growth and make innovation and technological progress along with
   furthering structural reforms.},

Abstract = {Partisan theory is one of the major explanations in policy analysis. In
   this setting, how policy positions affect policy outcomes has usually
   been captured by individual parties' government participation or by
   their seat share. From our perspective, this approach is (increasingly)
   inadequate because the German parties' regional branches are very
   heterogeneous and because coalitions are increasingly complex and
   atypical. We argue that new methods for text analysis can provide an
   alternative strategy for data collection and showusing agricultural
   policy in the German states as an examplehow they can be utilized by
   policy analysis.},

Abstract = {Albeit with little reference to Woodrow Wilson, Yanaihara Tadao, the
   Chair of Colonial Policy at Tokyo Imperial University in the 1920s and
   1930s, and a pious Christian, adapted the core ideas of Wilsonian
   liberalism such as national self-determination, multilateralism, and
   democracy to the political and legal framework of imperial Japan.
   Yanaihara advocated the principle of autonomy for the Japanese empire to
   transform itself into the core of a liberal international order. He
   articulated that the combination of colonialism and unfettered
   capitalism had detrimental effects on the colonized and advocated for a
   Japanese empire that reflected the voice of its colonized people.
   However, having seen little improvement in the status of the colonized,
   Yanaihara increasingly regarded Japanese pan-Asianist ideas in the 1930s
   as a cover-up of Japanese expansionism. Almost abandoning his earlier
   ideas about empire as a multiethnic society, he criticized Japan's
   military venture as economically unprofitable, and policies toward
   Manchuria as stoking the rise of Chinese nationalism. He advocated for
   the normative framework advanced by the Mandate System of the League of
   Nations as a way toward the universalization of sovereignty, and
   protection of stateless populations. The failure of the Wilsonian moment
   in Japan forced Yanaihara out of Tokyo Imperial University but also
   strengthened his inclination towards liberal internationalism.},

Abstract = {Is the Organization of American States a ``club of presidents?{''} A
   review of democratic crises from 1990 to 2016 lends support to the
   argument that the organization can be considered as such. This article
   adds to the literature by noting that the severity of democratic crises
   in Latin America is a key factor in the response. When there is a severe
   threat to democracy, there is likely to be a response, regardless of the
   origin of the crisis. The origin matters more during low-level threats;
   the organization is more likely to respond to low-level threats to
   presidents. Meanwhile, when the threat is from the president, it is less
   likely there will be a response. The findings from this article provide
   support for continued evaluations of the defense-of-democracy regimes in
   the Americas and show the potential for executives to erode democracy
   slowly and over time without significant responses from the Organization
   of American States, leading to low-quality democracies in the region.},

Abstract = {We exploit a rare natural experiment, a recent reform of local elections
   in Poland, to study an extension of Duverger's laws. We analyse party
   system fragmentation under single-member plurality rule vis-a-vis a
   proportional representation formula accompanied by a legal threshold. We
   demonstrate that the presence of a threshold alters Duverger's
   `psychological' effect. Proportional representation with a threshold
   tends to be on a par with single-member plurality as regards restricting
   the effective number of electoral parties, largely due to the absence of
   smaller groupings with spatially concentrated support. At the same time,
   Duverger's `mechanical' effect takes a rather standard form,
   single-member plurality being relatively powerful at constraining the
   effective number of legislative parties.},

Abstract = {Scholarship on oversight of the bureaucracy typically conceives of
   legislatures as unitary actors. But most oversight is conducted by
   individual legislators who contact agencies directly. I acquire the
   correspondence logs of 16 bureaucratic agencies and re-evaluate the
   conventional proposition that ideological disagreement drives oversight.
   I identify the effect of this disagreement by exploiting the transition
   from George Bush to Barack Obama, which shifted the ideological
   orientation of agencies through turnover in agency personnel. Contrary
   to existing research, I find ideological conflict has a negligible
   effect on oversight, whereas committee roles and narrow district
   interests are primary drivers. The findings may indicate that absent
   incentives induced by public auditing, legislator behavior is driven by
   policy valence concerns rather than ideology. The results further
   suggest collective action in Congress may pose greater obstacles to
   bureaucratic oversight than previously thought.},

Abstract = {After the election of Donald Trump to the U.S. presidency, a
   self-defined ``resistance{''} movement arose to block his agenda. This
   movement cut across the normal boundaries of political activism to
   create new forms of advocacy and new models of cooperation. Major
   components of the resistance were ideological interest groups, women's
   organizations, environmentalists, heretofore disengaged Millennials,
   racial and ethnic groups, community nonprofits, and, ostensibly,
   foundations and leading philanthropists-those we term ``patrons.{''} We
   systematically examine the behavior of patrons to determine what role
   they played at this unique time in American history. We place this
   research in the context of interest group behavior, asking how patrons
   may have facilitated representation, altered strategic plans, reoriented
   advocacy, and repositioned themselves within policy communities
   supporting similar goals. Our findings undermine the idea that patrons
   played a central role in the developing resistance to the new
   administration, despite the fact that the new president was working
   against their values and the programs they support. However, a
   non-trivial minority of patrons, both institutional and individual, did
   mobilize their voice, institutional resources, and coalitions to resist
   the Trump agenda. These examples allow us to explore how patrons in some
   conditions might fulfill the roles of interest groups conventionally
   understood.},

Abstract = {The strategic concept of the Greater Eurasian Partnership has been the
   greatest achievement of Russia in its prioritization of foreign policy
   and in building effective multilateral institutions in this macroregion.
   This concept, as well as the previously developed strategy of pairing
   the Chinese One Belt One Road Initiative and the Eurasian Economic
   Union, is based on the academic and political belief that multilateral
   institutions, which introduce mutually binding norms for their members,
   are the essential element of international regulation on both global and
   regional levels. For Russia, the idea of the Greater Eurasian
   Partnership is also a part of its national strategy and policy of the
   accelerated development of the Russian Far East and Siberia - both
   natural and necessary parts of Asian and Eurasian space. So far, Eurasia
   has primarily been a geostrategic and philosophical concept, whereas the
   new strategy of Russia aims to revalue Eurasia in terms of rational
   cooperation.},

Abstract = {Whereas there is a substantial body of scholarship assessing the merits
   of student journals, and an equally sizable amount of how-to-publish
   advice for students in higher education, there is little empirical
   research exploring the content of disciplinary student publications. To
   gain a sense of what political science students are publishing, this
   study examines articles in three peer-reviewed student journals of
   politics between 2005 and 2015: The Pi Sigma Alpha Undergraduate Journal
   of Politics, Critique, and Politikon. Content analysis reveals the
   nature of published student work by subfield, methodology, and topic,
   with findings discussed in the context of research trends in the
   profession and the debate about advantages and disadvantages of student
   journal publishing.},

Abstract = {Cooperation among local governments has been encouraged to enable the
   aggregation of resources and improved public sector efficiency. The
   objective of this article is to contribute to the emerging literature on
   the factors driving intermunicipal cooperation. Using a unique panel
   dataset of 36,000 French municipalities for 1995-2002, we estimate the
   relationship between cooperation decision and the fiscal revenues raised
   to provide local public goods. We find that the cooperation choice of
   neighboring municipalities is extremely relevant for the cooperation
   decision. A municipality will be more inclined to join an existing
   community if its neighbors have already joined an intermunicipal
   jurisdiction. We also find evidence that, ceteris paribus, a positive
   difference between the expected fiscal revenues of a cooperating
   locality and the actual revenues realized by an isolated locality is
   required to set up the agreement.},

Abstract = {Google Scholar (GS) is an important tool that faculty, administrators,
   and external reviewers use to evaluate the scholarly impact of
   candidates for jobs, tenure, and promotion. This article highlights both
   the benefits of GS-including the reliability and consistency of its
   citation counts and its platform for disseminating scholarship and
   facilitating networking-and its pitfalls. GS has biases because citation
   is a social and political process that disadvantages certain groups,
   including women, younger scholars, scholars in smaller research
   communities, and scholars opting for risky and innovative work. GS
   counts also reflect practices of strategic citation that exacerbate
   existing hierarchies and inequalities. As a result, it is imperative
   that political scientists incorporate other data sources, especially
   independent scholarly judgment, when making decisions that are crucial
   for careers. External reviewers have a unique obligation to offer a
   reasoned, rigorous, and qualitative assessment of a scholar's
   contributions and therefore should not use GS.},

Abstract = {On the occasion of the fiftieth anniversary of the concept of
   anti-system party it is time to ask whether it enjoys good health in
   addition to longevity. Reflecting on what constitutes an anti-system
   party appears to be of unprecedented relevance, particularly in the
   light of the electoral success of populist parties such as the French
   Front National, the Five Star Movement in Italy and Syriza in Greece.
   This article highlights two crucial questions that remain unsolved if we
   follow existing conceptualizations: What are the boundaries of the
   concept? When does a party cease to be anti-system and how can it be
   reclassified thereafter? In order to overcome such limitations, this
   article develops a revisited concept of anti-system party and provides a
   set of guidelines for its empirical application. Furthermore, a novel
   typology capable of investigating the evolution of anti-system parties
   and classifying political parties in general is presented.},

Abstract = {When constituent opinion and district conditions point in two different
   directions, which factor is most influential for representatives who
   face important legislative roll calls? To address this question, we
   combine four types of data for the period from 2000 to 2012: key
   congressional roll call votes, district-level survey data, objective
   measures of district conditions, and other district demographics. We
   show (1) that material conditions in a district have an effect on
   legislative behavior independent of constituents' opinions; (2) that
   opinions are not always a better predictor of lawmaker decisions,
   compared to conditions; and (3) that whether lawmakers tend to reflect
   constituent opinions or district conditions is a function of the
   demographic makeup of their districts.},

Abstract = {Non-governmental organizations (NGOs) have the potential to contribute
   to a vibrant civil society and build social capital within countries,
   but the potential for social media to support these connections is
   unclear, particularly in the developing world. Building social capital
   requires constructing relationships between people, and social media
   will be most likely to accomplish this when it is used in an interactive
   way. Previous research has considered the issue of interactivity and
   social media usage in Western countries like the USA, but no research
   has focused on these issues within the developing world. Our paper
   explores the degree to which Nigerian NGOs are utilizing social media
   tools, such as Facebook and Twitter, in ways that are more interactive
   in nature, and thus in ways that are more likely to build robust and
   reciprocal relations. Utilizing a new coding scheme created by the
   authors and data on the use of Facebook and Twitter by 1988 Nigerian
   NGOs and the level of interactivity of tweets from 151 of these NGOs, we
   find that while few NGOs in Nigeria appear to utilize social media,
   those that do are more interactive in their usage than expected.},

   implications for research funding, motivation and quality},

Abstract = {There is growing interest in demonstrating the societal and economic
   value of research around the world with the UK and Australia at the
   forefront of these developments. Characterised as an `impact agenda',
   impact policies have incited debate amongst the academic community and
   beyond. On the one hand, the edifying and reinforcing effects of impact
   can be seen to provide greater visibility about the use of public
   investment in research, whilst, on the other concerns about the
   subsequent and unintended effects on the nature and quality of research
   and research cultures, have contributed to a discourse which was (in the
   very beginning at least) one dominated by resistance. We draw on a
   qualitative analysis of interviews with UK and Australian mid-senior
   career academics (n = 51) which explored academic perceptions for
   resisting an impact agenda, to describe a range of perceived effects on
   research funding, motivation and quality. We find a persistent
   perception that impact favours and prioritises `types' of research,
   leading to a concern that this will reduce funding for certain
   disciplines. We also note how academics perceived deleterious effects on
   motivation, culture, capacity and the quality of research. Where impact
   was seen to `direct' or `drive' research, we discuss how some academics
   suggested they would re-orientate their work, often at the expense of
   quality. Indeed, misconceptions about the very meaning of `impact'
   appear to persist alongside varied intepretations of impact policies and
   mixed perceptions about how impact is considered in practice with
   respect to funding decisions. In motivations of academics, altering
   perceptions of self-determination. This is further compounded by the
   growing politicisation of knowledge which in turn creates an ideological
   barrier to engagement. If impact is to be embraced and sustained at
   scale, institutions must target and harness a wider range of intrinsic
   motivations and epistemic responsibilities, improving academics'
   abilities to respond to the impact agenda in addition to working with,
   not against those who create policy.},

Abstract = {This article looks at the effect of ideology on delegate participation
   at the Federal Convention of 1787. Making use of an original data set on
   delegate verbosity and delegate speeches at the Constitutional
   Convention, analysis reveals that ideologically extreme Convention
   delegates were more likely to participate at the Convention. This leads
   to two conclusions. First, ideology affected delegate participation in a
   meaningful way. Second, claims made about the intent of the writers of
   the Constitution based on Convention records are biased in favor of
   ideologically extreme Convention delegates, as extreme delegates were
   more likely to be recorded.},

Abstract = {In spite of the fact that Iceland accepts fewer refugees then other
   European countries, the number of young refugees in Iceland has grown as
   a result of international and forced migration. While there is a growing
   body of Icelandic research on multicultural and inclusive education the
   focus has yet to concern itself with refugee youth and their educational
   or social challenges. Multiculturalism and matters of integration are
   increasingly being contested as refugee youth reception and education
   are perceived to be in a state of crisis. This study examined the forms
   of policy in place related to young refugees in Iceland and how it
   impacts their educational and social inclusion. Drawing on the field of
   critical education policy analysis, we analyzed official policy
   documents as well as narratives of fourteen lower and upper secondary
   teachers. Findings indicate that the current policies are limited in
   scope and emphasis equality on the basis of sameness and access to
   education rather than equity, social justice and quality of education.
   The policy, as it appears both in the form of texts and discourse, is
   shaped by neo-assimilative ideology that highlights individual
   responsibility for educational outcomes through choice policy, active
   participation and Icelandic language skills based on national discourse
   of inclusion. Teachers described themselves as ``moving in the dark{''}
   without institutional policy guidance or support making it it difficult
   for them to make ethical and political choices that challenge the
   normative view of education and integration in what they describe as new
   and challenging situations.},

Abstract = {As a populist leader, Hugo Chavez famously used emotionally charged
   populist rhetoric to appeal to a broad base of poor and working-class
   Venezuelans. Was his choice of linguistic discourse a tool of popular
   control, response to public opinion, or both? Answering this question
   sheds light on the effectiveness of classical democratic conceptions of
   vertical accountability for populist leaders. Using a theoretical
   framework incorporating macro implications of Zaller's
   receive-accept-sample (RAS) model, the concept of Erikson, Mackuen, and
   Stimson's mood, and latent public opinion, we develop several competing
   expectations regarding rhetoric and presidential approval in Venezuela.
   Using computational sentiment analysis on a unique dataset of
   transcripts from Chavez's Alo Presidente broadcasts, we evaluate
   Chavez's quarterly public approval ratings with vector autoregression
   (VAR) and Koyck models. Results indicate presidential approval levels
   are causally linked to not only exogenous economic factors but also
   leader discourse. Results also indicate that leader language is not
   shaped by approval levels, illustrating the power of messaging and media
   control for populist leaders and the potential limits of democratic
   accountability.},

Abstract = {Existing research does not offer conclusive evidence on which electoral
   management body (EMB) model is best for having confidence in electoral
   processes. While some scholars favour partisan autonomy in election
   administration, others argue for a multiparty-based election management.
   Others provide mixed evidence. This article focuses on the importance of
   including political parties in EMBs, measured by a scale with four
   levels of participation of parties in the appointment of EMB members.
   Results show that although it may be advantageous to include political
   parties in the appointment process of the EMB members, not all forms of
   inclusion yield the same level of benefits in terms of confidence in
   elections. This is demonstrated through logistic and multilevel
   regression of results from the Parliamentary Elites of Latin America
   survey.},

Abstract = {Much of our understanding of social influence in individual political
   behavior stems from representative surveys asking respondents to
   identify characteristics of a small number of people they talk to most
   frequently. By focusing only on these few close contacts, we have
   implicitly assumed that less-intimate associates and features of network
   structure hold little influence over others' attitudes and behavior. We
   test these assumptions with a survey that attempted to interview all
   students at a small university during a highly-salient municipal
   election. By focusing on a small, well-defined community, we are able to
   explore the relationship between individuals, their close associates,
   and also less-immediate associates. We are also able to explore features
   of network structure unobtainable in representative samples. We
   demonstrate that these less-immediate associates and network features
   have the potential to exert important influence that conventional survey
   approaches would miss.},

Abstract = {As more and more of the world's states devolve power and resources to
   sub-national governments, decentralization has emerged as one of the
   most important global trends of the new century. Yet, there is still no
   consensus as to the benefits of decentralization and how to design
   institutions that can realize these benefits. We investigate the
   political conditions under which the decentralization of authority will
   improve the delivery of public goods. Building off Oates
   decentralization theorem{''} to include inter-jurisdictional spillovers,
   we develop a new theory suggesting that the interaction of democratic
   decentralization (the popular election of sub-national governments) and
   party centralization (the power of national party leaders over
   sub-national office-seekers) will produce the best service delivery
   outcomes. To test this argument empirically, we develop a new dataset of
   sub-national political institutions. Our analyses, which examine
   educational and health service delivery in 135 countries across thirty
   years, provide support for our theoretical expectations.},

Abstract = {The issue yield model introduced a theory of the herestethic use of
   policy issues as strategic resources in multidimensional party
   competition. We extend the model by systematically addressing the
   specificities of issue yield dynamics in multiparty systems, with
   special regard to parties' issue yield rankings (relative position) and
   issue yield heterogeneity (differentiation) on each issue. Second, we
   introduce a novel research design for original data collection that
   allows for a more systematic testing of the model, by featuring (a) a
   large number of policy issues, (b) the use of Twitter content for coding
   parties' issue emphasis, and (c) an appropriate time sequence for
   measuring issue yield configurations and issue emphasis. We finally
   present findings from a pilot implementation of such design, performed
   on the occasion of the 2014 European Parliament election in Italy.
   Findings confirm the soundness of the design and provide support for the
   newly introduced hypotheses about multiparty competition.},

   labour markets in Oman},

Abstract = {This article examines global social policy formation in the area of
   skilled migration, with a focus on the Gulf Arab region. Across the
   globe, migration governance presents challenges to multiple levels of
   authority; its complexity crosses many scales and involves a multitude
   of actors with diverse interests. Despite this jurisdictional
   complexity, migration remains one of the most staunchly defended realms
   of sovereign policy control. Building on global social policy
   literature, this article examines how domestic' labour migration
   policies reflect the entanglement of multiple states' and agencies'
   interests. Such entanglements result in what we characterize as a
   multiplex system', where skilled-migration policies are formed within,
   and shaped by, globalized policy spaces. To illustrate, we examine
   policies that shape the nursing labour market in Oman during a period
   when the state aims to transition from dependence on an expatriate to an
   increasingly nationalized labour force. Engaging a case-study
   methodology including a survey of migrant healthcare workers,
   semi-structured interviews and data analysis, we find that nursing
   labour markets in Oman represent an example of global policy formation
   due to the interaction of domestic and expatriate labour policies and
   provisioning systems. The transnational structuring of policy making
   that emerges reflects a contingent process marked by conflicting
   outcomes. We contend that Oman's nursing labour market is an example of
   new spaces where global social policies emerge from the tension of
   competing national state and market interests.},

Abstract = {A handful of recent studies have investigated the causal effect of
   incumbency on dynasty formation in candidate-centered electoral
   contexts. We use candidate-level data and a regression discontinuity
   design to estimate the incumbency advantage and its relation to dynasty
   formation in the party-centered, closed-list,
   proportional-representation setting of Norway. The results indicate that
   the incumbency advantage exists even in this party-centered environment;
   however, in contrast to recent findings for the United States and the
   Philippines, we find no evidence that incumbency is important to the
   formation of dynasties. This finding underscores the need for more
   research into the role of internal party organizational networks in the
   perpetuation of political dynasties.},

Title = {Public support for Latin American presidents: The cyclical model in
   comparative perspective},
Journal = {RESEARCH \& POLITICS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {5},

Month = {JUL 26},
Abstract = {What characterizes the dynamics of presidential popularity? Research
   based on the United States of America finds popularity exhibits an
   almost law-like cyclicality over a president's term: high post-election
   honeymoon approval rates deteriorate before experiencing an end-of-term
   boost as new elections approach. We contend that cyclical approval
   dynamics are not specific to the USA, but rather characteristic of
   presidential systems more generally, despite heterogeneity in their
   socio-economic and political contexts. Testing this proposition requires
   overcoming a key empirical problem: lack of comparable data. We do so by
   employing time-series inputs from 324 opinion surveys from a new
   publicly available databasethe Executive Approval Database 1.0to craft
   quarterly measures of popularity across 18 Latin American contemporary
   presidential democracies. Our analysis strongly confirms the cyclical
   approval model for the region. The conclusion identifies avenues for
   future research on the relationships across approval, presidentialism,
   and electoral, institutional, and socio-economic factors afforded by the
   new data resource we present here.},

Abstract = {Nearly all research on the political impact of Americans' religious and
   secular orientations assumes that such orientations are exogenous to
   politics. Using multiwave panel and experimental data, we find that
   religious and secular orientations are endogenous to political
   orientations. In other words, religion and secularism are a consequence
   as well as a cause of politics. In showing this, we make three major
   contributions. First, we conceptualize and measure secular orientations
   in a new way-not just as the absence of religion, but also as an
   affirmative secular identity and positive commitment to secular
   principles. Second, our panel and experimental data allow for the most
   definitive test to date of whether political orientations exert a causal
   effect on religious and secular orientations. Third, we isolate the
   conditions under which politics affects religious-secular perspectives,
   thus identifying the mechanism that underlies political orientations.},

Abstract = {Recent research on political discussion has focused on whether aspects
   of interaction create a `democratic dilemma' for the mass public in
   which people face a choice between political participation and political
   tolerance. This article argues that there are important variations in
   how people react to their immediate social contacts. It explores this
   idea by studying how social disagreement and expertise interact with
   gender to explain variance in political participation. First, it shows
   that there are conflicting expectations in the literature about how such
   dynamics should manifest, despite agreement that men and women should
   experience different kinds and degrees of social influence. Secondly, it
   examines these expectations by revisiting prominent, network-based
   explanations of political participation; it finds that these
   relationships do not display consistency across sex differences. The
   results point to the existence of varied `social logics' for men and
   women, and suggest the need to reconsider how to think about the
   efficacy of discussion and disagreement in a democratic society.},

Abstract = {This paper critically examines recent responses by and interactions
   between stakeholders in negotiating the acceptability of aircraft noise
   standards in Australia in order to help inform debate in Britain. It
   investigates the interplay of the politics of noise with the broader
   land use planning context focusing on the role of government, airports,
   community interests, and the development sector. Different local
   environments inevitably frame diverse contexts, but the pervasive
   challenge is in securing the acceptable trade-off between the economic
   dividends promised by airports and local quality of life. Discussion is
   structured around four main issues: an introduction to the Australian
   politics of airport noise, an historical timeline of key contextual
   events, identification of the major actors in the noise governance
   framework, and a focus on an issue of increasing political significance,
   namely the different positions of airports and developers in the
   increasing intensification of urban development.},

Abstract = {Many policies that appear to violate WTO rules remain unchallenged, even
   as they have a significant economic impact. Why is this? We argue that
   the likelihood that a country challenges a protectionist policy is
   linked to how concentrated or diffuse that policy is. When it is
   concentrated, litigation is a private good. But when a policy is
   diffuse, affecting many states, litigation is a public good and
   countries face a collective action problem: each country seeks to free
   ride on others' litigation. The resulting selection effect has two
   consequences. First, we see a longer enforcement delay for diffuse trade
   violations. Second, states require higher odds of success to overcome
   the collective action problem, meaning that conditional on being filed,
   cases that challenge concentrated policies are less likely to succeed.
   Examining all WTO disputes, we leverage selection effects to test our
   argument using data on the timing and outcomes of trade disputes.},

Abstract = {This article describes the design and implementation of a redistricting
   simulation in two classes at a large university. Simulations often
   include a high degree of abstraction and, as a result, may not inform
   and develop an understanding of how the world operates. We developed a
   binding-arbitration game, based on the New Jersey model of a bipartisan
   commission, in which groups of students used US Census data and a set of
   mandatory and discretionary criteria to design congressional districts
   in Louisiana as well as advocate for their plan at an open hearing. In
   so doing, they learned about the complexities of redistricting and were
   introduced to geographical information systems (GIS). The student-drawn
   maps, on average, were more compact and preserved a larger proportion of
   places and parishes in a single district than the legislature-drawn map.
   The article discusses other features of the students' maps and concludes
   with comments on the general decision-game design.},

Abstract = {Critical-liberal desires for democracy indicate that citizens' critical
   assessments of the political system are inspired by their expectations
   to live under a regime that guarantees democratic rights and freedoms.
   This study analyzes the critical-liberal desires for democracy in
   Mexico, a case where the performance of an emerging democracy has
   motivated widespread political dissatisfaction. By using data from the
   World Values Survey (wvs), this article shows that critical-liberal
   desires for democracy are weaker than initially expected, and they
   perform a limited role in enlightening democratic aspirations. The
   results suggest that in emerging and deficient democracies, even when
   political dissatisfaction with the performance of the regime is
   extensive, weak critical-liberal desires may fail to motivate the
   collective demands to improve the regime's guarantee of political
   freedoms and rights.},

Abstract = {Political scientists often find themselves analyzing data sets with a
   large number of observations, a large number of variables, or both. Yet,
   traditional statistical techniques fail to take full advantage of the
   opportunities inherent in big data, as they are too rigid to recover
   nonlinearities and do not facilitate the easy exploration of
   interactions in high-dimensional data sets. In this article, we
   introduce a family of tree-based nonparametric techniques that may, in
   some circumstances, be more appropriate than traditional methods for
   confronting these data challenges. In particular, tree models are very
   effective for detecting nonlinearities and interactions, even in data
   sets with many (potentially irrelevant) covariates. We introduce the
   basic logic of tree-based models, provide an overview of the most
   prominent methods in the literature, and conduct three analyses that
   illustrate how the methods can be implemented while highlighting both
   their advantages and limitations.},

Abstract = {Political theorists are increasingly interested in understanding how
   firms are analogous to, or extensions of, government and the kinds of
   normative standards this implies. This is a welcome development. These
   theorists, however, have not appreciated how indispensable ``transaction
   cost economics{''} is for understanding the firm. While transaction cost
   economics helps us see how a political theory of the firm can still be
   consistent with a concern for allocative efficiency, it also suggests
   that efficiency cannot be ignored when articulating a political theory
   of the firm. For firms to be viable they must facilitate economic
   activity more efficiently than the market can; efficiency is therefore a
   constitutional value of firms, which implies a significant discontinuity
   and disanalogy between firms and government. In light of this, I specify
   the kinds of questions political theories of the firm ought to address
   and the realm within which such theorists ought to stake their claims.},

Abstract = {Over the past few years, Turkey's EU membership prospects have further
   deteriorated amid intensive political crisis between Brussels and
   Ankara. The Turkish government and the European Commission have agreed
   to upgrade the two-decade-old Customs Union between Turkey and the EU,
   with negotiations likely to begin in 2018. This paper explores the
   European Commission's CU upgrade scenarios in tandem with European
   proposals to form a ``Privileged Partnership{''} between the two parties
   as an alternative to Turkey's membership in the Union. An upgraded
   agreement would be a significant step toward Privileged Partnership,
   maximizing Europeans' political and economic benefits from Turkey and
   eroding any remaining motives for the EU to welcome Turkey as a full
   member.},

Abstract = {People frequently face uncertain income and the threat of loss can
   inhibit economic investments. Government redistribution can insure
   citizens against economic losses, but its effect on people's investment
   decisions depends on how they react to redistributive rules. We apply
   methods from experimental economics to study how a redistributive
   institution affects people's investment decisions. Experiment 1 tests
   whether redistribution can increase economic efficiency when people face
   risk problems-investment opportunities that are profitable on average
   but could result in a loss. In a between-subject design, participants
   decide whether to make a risky investment either individually or under
   an institution that redistributes earnings equally among four group
   members. We find greater investment and profits when participants are
   required to share their earnings. In Experiment 2, we examine
   free-riding by comparing an institution that allows non-investors to
   exploit investors to an assortment institution that matches investors
   with investors. We find that vulnerability to free-riding suppresses
   investment, whereas an assortment mechanism increases investment by
   preventing free-riding and thereby facilitating risk pooling.},

Abstract = {The U.S. apportions congressional districts both across states and
   within states based upon population. Scholars have long focused on the
   electoral implications of redistricting within states, but there has
   been less consideration of the electoral implications of apportionment
   across states. In this paper, I analyze congressional elections from
   2002 to 2014 and theorize that the limited number of political
   opportunities in states with few congressional districts will lead to
   higher levels of quality candidate emergence and electoral competition
   in these states. I find support for this theory; specifically, as the
   number of political opportunities in a state increases, the number of
   quality candidates running for office decreases.},

Abstract = {With the aid of a new data set, this study tracks the travels of the
   U.S. secretary of state in the Cold War and post-Cold War periods.
   Drawing from realist arguments, it maintains that U.S. diplomacy
   eventually bows to U.S. strategic interests, whatever the aspirations
   and beliefs that U.S. presidents bring to office. The findings, which
   show a second-term shift in the secretarial travel schedule favoring
   countries of security importance to the United States, lend support to
   realist arguments that states prioritize interests. They also reveal,
   however, that administrations have acted with significant latitude,
   especially in a presidential first term.},

Abstract = {The article focuses on current problems of human rights constitutional
   provision, protection and implementation in Ukraine in the context of
   the reforms aimed at Eurointegration. The aim is to brief in the
   historical aspects of the development of ideas and concepts of human
   rights in Ukraine, focus on the human rights provision of the active
   Constitution projected through the ongoing reforms and to expose the
   correlation between the rights enshrined and their actual
   implementation. The existing and possible future problems related to the
   regulation and realization of human rights in Ukraine's reform process
   are considered. The article reflects the problem of the value approach
   to human rights, which is directly related to the low level of legal
   culture and the insufficient level of development of civil society
   Ukraine. The work also analyses the amendments that have been made to
   the Constitution since the independence. While presenting the latest
   developments and drafts regarding the addressed issues, we try to look
   deeper into the problem, far beyond the formal and procedural concerns,
   addressing social and cultural barriers in understanding the importance
   and necessity of the problems under consideration not only by the
   leadership of the state but also by ordinary Ukrainians.},

Abstract = {This study examines determinants of leftist violence at the municipal
   level in Colombia from 2000 through 2010. A multilevel GLMM model with a
   negative binomial distribution is used to take advantage of the
   information available at the municipal and department level.
   Surprisingly, inequality was not a significant covariate of violence,
   and agricultural GDP tended to reduce, instead of increase, guerrilla
   violence. The main risk factors identified include physical
   characteristics such as rugged topography and prior violence, but also
   factors that are candidates for policy action, such as unemployment,
   incorporation of the poor into public services, repression, and the
   energy and mining sector. These findings suggest interventions to
   decrease risks of guerrilla violence beyond merely strengthening the
   state. While repression tends to escalate violence, targeted policies to
   provide health benefits to those currently underserved, and securing
   mining and oil operations can effectively reduce the risk of violence.},

Abstract = {The huge quantitative literature on postwar social spending almost
   entirely neglected war as a possible explanatory factor of social
   spending dynamics. Given the mass carnage and the enormous social needs
   caused by the Second World War, this is quite astonishing. This article
   examines for the first time, whether, and in what ways, the Second World
   War affected cross-national differences in public social spending of 18
   Western welfare states over the course of the Golden Age. Using panel
   regressions, it is found that the war strongly affected social spending
   until the late 1960s. The evidence demonstrates that the Second World
   War is not simply a temporal watershed structuring different phases of
   welfare state development, but rather a crucial factor for understanding
   cross-national differences in welfare efforts and social expenditure
   dynamics in the postwar period.},

Abstract = {Electoral systems are typically faced with the problem of being asked to
   provide both proportional representation and party system concentration
   leading to accountable government. Which electoral system designs are
   able to successfully deliver on both these challenges and thus optimize
   the representativeness - accountability trade-off? This paper
   investigates the performance of different general electoral system
   designs as well as their specific technical details (such as legal
   threshold, tier linkages, and compensation mechanisms) based on a data
   set of 590 elections in 57 countries. The key results are that both
   proportional representation systems with moderate district magnitudes
   and mixed-member proportional systems are able to optimize performance.
   Going to the level of details confirms these results and deepens our
   understanding further: while different technical changes are able to
   improve the chances of reaching the best of both worlds, some of these
   (e.g. raising the legal threshold) also increase the risk of ending up
   with the worst.},

Journal = {AMERICAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW},

Abstract = {This article reports evidence of misspecification of the measurement
   model for the index of emancipative values, a value construct used as a
   key explanatory variable in many important contributions to political
   science. It shows that the scale on which the index is measured is
   noninvariant across cultural zones and countries in the World Values
   Survey. In addition, it demonstrates that the current index composition
   mixes different value dimensions and their actual associations with
   various political outcomes, in particular the index of effective
   democracy. However, an analysis using a novel approximate Bayesian
   approach shows that at least one specific subdimension of emancipative
   values, known as pro-choice values, truly exists and may be validly
   measured and compared cross-nationally. The article also contributes to
   the recent discussion on whether emancipative values are a reflective or
   a formative construct by providing thought experiments and empirical
   evidence supporting the former interpretation.},

Abstract = {The use of self-reported contextual factors is prominent in political
   science. While recent research demonstrates that perceptions of
   contextual factors positively associate with census measured factors, it
   is less clear for whom and under what conditions this relationship
   holds. In this paper, I examine the relationship between census measured
   racial and ethnic composition and perceived racial and ethnic
   neighborhood composition. I use the 2008 and 2012 Collaborative
   Multi-Racial Post-Election Study (CMPS) datasets and append US Census
   data to test how well respondents understand the racial and ethnic
   composition of their neighborhood. Leveraging the non-White oversamples
   in the CMPS, I am able to test this relationship among Latinos, Blacks,
   and Whites. I find a positive relationship between perceived
   neighborhood composition and census measured composition. Respondents
   who live in areas with higher proportions of a racial/ethnic group are
   more likely to perceive that their neighborhood is composed of that
   group. These findings hold across Black, Latino, and White sub-samples.
   These findings complement and extend recent work about how well
   respondents understand their local environment.},

Abstract = {Income inequality has risen dramatically in the United States, with
   potentially negative social, economic, and political consequences.
   Governments can use redistributive taxes to combat inequality, but doing
   so requires public support. When will voters support redistributive
   taxes? Using the dual-process framework, we make predictions about the
   conditions under which party cues and information about rising
   inequality affect support for redistributive taxes. We test these
   predictions by conducting survey experiments in a real-world electoral
   context. We find that although citizens are misinformed about the extent
   of inequality, information that corrects their misperceptions helps them
   express tax policy opinions that are consistent with their preferences
   for lower levels of inequality. We also find that citizens who are
   motivated to process inequality information systematically respond to it
   even when it conflicts with their party's position. These results
   identify conditions under which efforts to inform the electorate about
   inequality can increase support for taxes.},

Abstract = {The Bolivarian Alliance for our America (ALBA) and its additional TCP
   (Trade Treaty of the People), driven by Cuba and Venezuela, emerged as
   an alternative to US hegemony and the proposal to create a Free Trade
   Area of the Americas (FTAA). Since 2014, the initiative has faced a
   double crisis: the critical political and economic situation in
   Venezuela that limits the financing of ALBA; and the uncertainties of
   post-Castro Cuba that constrains its ideational basis. The article
   addresses three research questions: To which theoretical paradigm does
   ALBA correspond when distinguishing between discourse and reality? What
   are its ideational and material outcomes? Will ALBA survive despite
   financial and political restrictions in Cuba and Venezuela? These
   questions are answered in three sections. The first inscribes ALBA in
   relevant theoretical debates, the second focuses on an empirical
   analysis of its objectives and results, while the final section
   addresses the existential crisis in Venezuela and changes in Cuba. The
   article concludes with a forecast of ALBA's future. The authors maintain
   that the dynamics and results of ALBA respond to a realist soft
   balancing strategy, which contrasts with its regionalism-integration and
   counter-hegemony neo-Marxist discourses. With this background, the two
   empirical sections argue that the viability of ALBA depends on three
   intertwined elements: its counter-hegemonic character of challenging the
   US (soft balancing); the continuity of the Cuban and Venezuelan regimes;
   and the available economic resources.},

Abstract = {Legislative responses to social changes signify how representative
   democracy works. Yet research is still needed to find out whether and
   how representatives in new democratic countries address the
   constituents' interests and demands. We revisit the 18th National
   Assembly in Korea (2008-12) to examine legislative activities
   surrounding the issue of economic inequality. To understand how
   lawmakers in the new democracy like Korea respond to the demands of
   redistributive policies, we turn to representatives' co-sponsorship
   behaviour. We find that Korean lawmakers do respond to constituents'
   preferences. More specifically, Korean lawmakers representing
   conservative districts tend to care less about economic inequality than
   other representatives while controlling their partisanship. This study
   fleshes out the link between the represented and the representatives in
   a new democracy where party discipline at the expense of constituency
   connection has long dominated legislative politics.},

Abstract = {This article describes how in recent years, Iran has joined the top
   ranks of the world powers in cyberspace and has demonstrated the ability
   to leverage cyberwarfare as a significant tool in its arsenal for
   pursuing its national security goals. While this increase in cyber power
   is relatively recent, some of the incidents and events that serve as the
   catalyst for the sudden digital surge go back decades. The reasons for
   these increased capabilities revolve around historic means of power
   projection, defense and preservation of the principles of the Iranian
   Revolution, response to Western aggression and Iranian nationalism. This
   article explores these ideological drivers and events to provide context
   for their trajectory and analysis of their likely implications.},

Abstract = {The alignment between partisan and other social identities has generated
   a rift between Democrats and Republicans that is deeper than any seen in
   recent American history. Without the cross-cutting identities that have
   traditionally stabilized the American two-party system, partisans in the
   American electorate are now seeing each other through prejudiced and
   intolerant eyes. In this article, partisan social divisions are examined
   in the 2016 electorate, with an eye to the co-occurrence between these
   social divisions and contemporaneous resistance to compromise and
   intolerance of social outgroups. In particular, as Republicans and
   Democrats grow more socially distinct, they like outgroups less and
   privilege victory over the national greater good. This effect is
   particularly visible among Republicans, whose social makeup is
   particularly homogeneous, even in comparison with Democrats. Some
   potential solutions are briefly addressed.},

Abstract = {This article presents a simple modular simulation for teaching the
   advantages and limitations of Realist theory in an introductory
   international relations course. The advantages of this simulation
   include low preparation time, minimal resource requirements, and ease of
   integration with existing curricula. The game design is built around
   Kenneth Waltz's three-image framework for analyzing international
   politics, in a way that increases scenario complexity but not game
   difficulty. The article describes the full simulation process, from game
   design and implementation through debriefing and assessment. Two
   historical simulations were conducted: the first helped students to
   understand Realism and the second helped them to see its limitations.
   The article concludes with a discussion of the results of a voluntary,
   anonymous postgame survey that is intended to assess achievement of our
   learning objective.},

Abstract = {We introduce a novel classification of strategies employed by autocrats
   to combat online opposition generally, and opposition on social media in
   particular. Our classification distinguishes both online from offline
   responses and censorship from engaging in opinion formation. For each of
   the three options offline action, technical restrictions on access to
   content, and online engagement we provide a detailed account for the
   evolution of Russian government strategy since 2000. To illustrate the
   feasibility of researching online engagement, we construct and assess
   tools for detecting the activity of political ``bots,{''} or
   algorithmically controlled accounts, on Russian political Twitter, and
   test these methods on a large dataset of politically relevant Twitter
   data from Russia gathered over a year and a half.},

Abstract = {This article examines how violent separatist groups moderate. Using the
   case of Sinn Fein and the IRA in Northern Ireland, it shows that
   moderation is a multidimensional process, entailing a change in
   strategic behaviour but not necessarily in the goals or values of a
   separatist group. For Irish republicans, moderation entailed giving up
   violent revolution and embracing peaceful reformism, but it did not
   require changing long-term goals, accepting the legitimacy of British
   rule in Northern Ireland, or distancing themselves from their history of
   armed struggle. Moderation was possible because both Irish republicans
   and the British state distinguished between republicans' strategic
   behaviour and their political goals, with the British state neither
   expecting nor demanding a change in the goals of republicanism, and
   republicans showing a willingness to change tactics to bring them closer
   to their long-term goal of a united Ireland. This finding has important
   implications for the moderation of other radical separatist groups.},

Abstract = {Electoral volatility as measured by the Pedersen index is probably one
   of the most popular indicators in political science, but its
   interpretation is far from clear. Volatility is produced by a mix of
   party-switching, differential turnout and generational replacement.
   However, there is virtually no empirical research on which, if any, of
   the main mechanisms leading to volatility tends to have the stronger net
   impact on election results. Furthermore, the presence of generational
   replacement and its relative impact on election results have received
   little attention in studies of volatility. This article develops several
   theoretical expectations concerning the strength that each of the three
   components of volatility is expected to exert on the latter.
   Subsequently, it estimates the net impact of each component on the
   results of 73 elections in six West European democracies using survey
   data. According to these estimates, party-switching produced 75 per cent
   of the total amount of volatility, with differential turnout and
   generational replacement producing 17 and 8 per cent, respectively.
   Although the effect of these components may work against each other at
   times, on average only 11 per cent of volatility was cancelled out this
   way. Findings provide, for the first time, a map of the components of
   volatility in established democracies and set the ground for further
   research on the topic.},

Abstract = {The past two decades have witnessed a burgeoning of scholarship on
   perceptions of political corruption and their determinants. Yet despite
   recent advances in understanding these perceptions and their importance
   to political life, surprisingly little attention has been paid to the
   question of how the public understands political corruption. We address
   this gap by reconstructing the conventional conception of political
   corruption and by presenting a new empirical tool designed to measure
   the conceptualizations and conceptions of political corruption held by a
   given population. We present preliminary findings and explore the
   relevance of the new tool for elucidating the public's understanding of
   political corruption.},

Abstract = {This article investigates the subjectivities of working class people in
   Kyrgyzstan, examining their boundary work produced in response to
   neoliberal changes. While working class people are depicted as
   unenterprising and `backward' by the rich and the middle classes, they
   often react with anger and lament the colonisation of life by market
   values, usually invoking non-market norms and nostalgia for the Soviet
   era of labour, solidarity and equality. Most importantly, they draw upon
   alternative cultural resources and discourses, such as traditional
   morality and Islam, to develop alternative `caring' and `pious' selves,
   which dissociate wealth from moral worth and provide other sources of
   self-esteem. But these counter-values can also be problematic, as they
   are ineffective in countering market forces and hardening class
   divisions.},

Abstract = {The central theme of this paper are the specific processes of rupture
   and renewal that arose from the impact of `betrayal Frondizi' in the
   reformist student movement of the National University of La Plata. In
   particular, it explores two ways which the reformist frondizistas took:
   entering the trotskyist Palabra Obrera, and MIRPraxis. It will seek to
   reconstruct those trajectories taking care not only of the reasons that
   gave place to such movements but of the political and organizational
   consequences.},

Abstract = {This article argues that to grasp the reason why so many young people
   choose not to vote in local elections, we must supplement the many
   quantitative studies by asking the youth themselves. This study, then,
   is based on focus group interviews with young people discussing their
   experience of politics and political communication. In this way the
   analysis investigates how democracy and politics are essentially
   contested by young people. Inspired by Niklas Luhmann, the article
   furthermore argues that it is profitable to understand these many `noes'
   to voting as a progressive conflict between non-voting young people and
   the political system.},

   Present universality entails the danger of becoming pure rhetoric or a

   degrees of transparency are required when the exercice of power is
   involved. But at the same time similar grades of opacity are required to
   protect individuals from other's gaze and from the campaign promoting to

Abstract = {The purpose of this article is to analyze, from the perspective of the
   political theory, the role of emotions, passion, and desire in the
   political practice, in order to find some elements that allow the
   construction of citizenship competences, from the cultivation of
   emotions. To this end, the article is divided in three moments: the
   first one, identifying the political projection of the pathos in the
   liberal democracies, based on Nussbaum's political statements; the
   second moment, releasing emotions, passion and desire by understanding
   human sexuality as a political act; and, the third moment, determining
   citizenship competences suggested by the pathos in the political
   exercise. Finally, it is concluded that passion is the involving whole
   of man as synthesis of his instinctive and rational dimensions. That is
   why it is necessary to cultivate emotions that claim the importance of

Journal = {JOURNAL OF POLITICS IN LATIN AMERICA},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {10},
Number = {1},
Pages = {29-68},
Abstract = {Since the return of democracy, party identification has been declining
   sharply among the Chilean public. We seek to understand this process by
   applying an age-period-cohort analysis to survey data from 1994 to 2014.
   In light of the elite-driven and socially uprooted character, or what we
   call the encapsulated nature, of the Chilean party system, we
   hypothesize that cumulative electoral experience has had a negative
   effect on party identification and not the positive effect that
   Converse's (1969) social-learning model would predict. Our findings
   support these expectations but also reveal large period effects that
   have shrunk the overall level of partisan identification and significant
   cohort effects whereby generations born after the 1950s have become less
   partisan. We also uncover important nuances that occur across the
   various mainstream political parties. We conclude that all three sources
   of social change are leading toward the extinction of mass partisanship
   from Chilean society.},

Abstract = {In this article we present the results of an experiment designed to
   disentangle the effects late-night talk show viewership have on
   presidential candidate evaluations. Respondents in one condition viewed
   a short video clip of David Letterman humorously disparaging New Jersey
   Governor Chris Christie, thought by many at the time to be considering a
   run for the presidency in 2016. Those in a second condition saw a short
   clip of Christie engaging in self-deprecating humor while appearing as a
   guest on Letterman's program. Compared with respondents in a control
   condition, those in the other-disparaging humor condition had lower
   evaluations of Christie and reported a lower likelihood of voting for
   him in 2016, while those in the self-deprecating humor condition had
   higher evaluations of him and expressed a greater likelihood of voting
   for him. The research has practical implications for modern campaigns
   and also serves to clarify some of the seemingly contradictory findings
   of earlier political humor effects research.},

Journal = {DEMOCRATIZATION},

Volume = {25},
Number = {8},
Pages = {1481-1499},
Abstract = {Scholarly attention has started to shift from democratization and
   democratic consolidation to trends of democratic deconsolidation,
   backsliding, regression, and erosion. This article examines Hungary as a
   deviant and exemplary case for understanding de-democratization. The
   starting point is the literature on defective democracy, which provides
   a unified framework of analysis for the causes and the outcomes of
   democratization. However, as the case of Hungary shows,
   de-democratization is not simply the mirror of democratization. In
   Hungary, both the outcome and the process of de-democratization defy
   expectations. The democratic defects do not conform to any of the
   standard types, instead resembling a diffusely defective democracy.
   Moreover, existing explanations fail to account for their emergence. The
   case of Hungary indicates that our knowledge of democratization may be a
   poor guide to understanding de-democratization.},

Abstract = {The objective of this article is to analyze the experience of social
   downclassing among undergraduate and postgraduate people, within the
   cohort of thirty-years-old and in the current context of economic
   crisis. The analysis is based on in-depth interviews with three types of
   social profiles, which are distinguished primarily by the level of
   education and the occupation of their parents. The study reveals that
   the experience of downclassing is not univocal, but results in the
   mobilization of a feeling of double downclassing (graduate title and
   social class of the family of origin), the feeling of belonging to a
   ``sacrificed generation{''} and the feeling of disillusionment with
   meritocracy.},

Title = {SENIOR CIVIL SERVANTS AS RUSSIAN POLITICAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE ELITE},

Volume = {88},

Abstract = {The article aims to identify the peculiarities of career paths and
   recruitment channels of Russia's political and administrative elite. The
   author studies federal ministers, their deputies, and directors of the
   departments of federal ministries. He innovatively employs the term
   ``Senior Civil Servants{''} (SCS), which is widely used in the world,
   but not in Russia. The empirical basis of the study is the biographies
   of the senior federal bureaucrats available on official websites. The
   author collected biographical data on senior civil servants from all the
   federal ministries. The sample size is 381 people.
   The research shows that most senior civil servants in Russia are
   career-oriented bureaucrats and technocrats, although the share of the
   political appointees at the ministries is also significant. By their
   socio-demographic characteristics, SCS can be considered part of the
   elite: most of them were born in large cities, they are well-educated,
   and many of them hold academic degrees and state awards. At the same
   time, SCS are a heterogeneous group, which affects the activities of the
   corresponding ministries. Ministries headed by the career-oriented
   bureaucrats tend to be more successful in implementing state programs.
   The sectors headed by the career-oriented bureaucrats show a better
   dynamics of development than those headed by the political appointees.
   According to the author's conclusion, the process of SCS recruitment in
   Russia is opaque and unsystematic. He thinks that the key to solving
   this problem lies in the creation of the Senior Civil Service as in the
   developed count ries, the functions of which will include recruiting and
   evaluating senior civil servants.},

Abstract = {Who and how takes part in a typical Twitter discussion about political
   elections? In what degree? In our study we try to shed some light on
   these questions by examining the case of Italian 2018 national election.
   Starting from the database that we collected during the latest general
   campaign, we analyse all the users who participated in the discussion
   unfolding in the two months preceding the vote. To do that, we exploit
   the concept of super-participants isolating the 1\% of users who
   generate large part of the discussion. We study them identifying the two
   main participation flows in the Twittersphere generated by tweets and
   retweets, discovering that participation curves are very skewed. To
   address issues of centrality and inclusiveness in online communication,
   we look at who the super-participants are in the broader society,
   finding that many of them are citizens. To inquire if participation
   draws attention, we identify a set of super-echoed users discovering
   that, belonging to elite categories is still an advantage given that
   starting popularity is often more important to be shared than
   participation. In fact, citizens' super-participation is not mirrored by
   an equally consistent received attention. Notwithstanding, political
   supporters and satirical blogs emerge to be two very interesting
   categories.},

Abstract = {Heading into the Modernising Defence Programme (MDP) review process, the
   RAF has a force structure composed of assets that on a platform level
   are appropriate and relevant for the high-end state threat posed by
   Russia, while also being effective during overseas interventions.
   However, Justin Bronk argues that the force structure itself is too
   small to sustain attrition on any significant scale without rapidly
   running short of both aircraft and trained aircrew. While the RAF can,
   therefore, demonstrate the continuing relevance of its force structure
   in the new reality where deterrence against Russia is NATO's key focus,
   questions remain about its sustainability in the unlikely but necessary
   planning scenario of a major war.},

Abstract = {The article explores recent developments in the non-electoral
   sociopolitical engagement of society in contemporary Russia. Referring
   to the concepts of political opportunity structure and framing, it
   considers existing coping strategies that represent alternatives to
   disengagement-a shift from higher-level political issues to social or
   local problems and engagement through state-controlled structures-in
   terms of their role in the development of civil society. The analysis,
   embedded in the regional context of Tatarstan and Yaroslavl Oblast,
   points to the limitations and merits of both forms of participation,
   arguing why, despite their inferiority to unrestricted independent
   activism, they should not be dismissed.},

Abstract = {This article examines the alterations in the forms of electoral
   contestation that occurred in Germany due to the Euro Crisis. The Great
   Recession has probably set in motion new windows of opportunity to awake
   the Sleeping Giant of European integration. Indeed, by increasing their
   entrepreneurial efforts on the EU issues, the German parties may have
   rendered this conflict more contentious, changing electoral behavior. To
   understand the nexus between the Euro Crisis and European integration
   politicization, this article analyzes the variations of the EU issue
   entrepreneurship achieved by the German parties between 2010 and 2014.
   Moreover, this work presents voting models, testing the fluctuations in
   the levels of EU issue voting. This two-step empirical research seeks to
   identify whether the Euro Crisis generated new entrepreneurial
   strategies, realigning the voters along the Pro-/-Anti-European issue
   dimension in Germany.},

Journal = {QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE},

Abstract = {Commentators covering recent social movements, such as the Arab Spring,
   commonly claim that cell phones enable protests. Yet, existing empirical
   work does not conclusively support this contention: some studies find
   that these technologies actually reduce collective action; many others
   struggle to overcome the selection problems that dog observational
   research. We propose two mechanisms through which cell phones affect
   protests: (1) by enabling communication among would-be protesters, cell
   phones lower coordination costs; and (2) these technologies broadcast
   information about whether a protest is repressed. Knowing that a larger
   audience now witnesses and may be angered by repression, governments
   refrain from squashing demonstrations, further lowering the cost of
   protesting. We evaluate these mechanisms using high-resolution global
   data on the expansion of cell phone coverage and incidence of protest
   from 2007 to 2014. Our difference-in-differences estimates indicate that
   cell phone coverage increases the probability of protest by over half
   the mean. Consistent with our second mechanism, we also find that
   gaining coverage has a larger effect when it connects a locality to a
   large proportion of other citizens.},

Abstract = {Boundaries are an increasing focus for academics and practitioners
   seeking to understand public policy dynamics. In anti-corruption policy
   how these boundaries are established and by whom has far-reaching
   implications for public trust. Drawing on interview data, this paper
   explores the enduring tensions and administrative conflicts at play in
   three key aspects of the anti-corruption boundary making process:
   behaviour, responses and institutions. The evidence presented
   demonstrates that these boundaries are unstable and unresolved. While
   some tensions, such as those between morality and the law, are enduring,
   many of the administrative conflicts indicate a sensible and purposeful
   balance between the important considerations of accountability and
   responsiveness on the one hand, and efficiency and effectiveness on the
   other, is yet to be achieved.},

Title = {New Managerialism and Austerity in the Spanish and European Academic
   Context. Two Sides of the Same Coin?},
Journal = {POLITICA Y SOCIEDAD},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {55},
Number = {1},
Pages = {257-282},
Abstract = {Academic personnel face situations of vulnerability and precariousness
   in the Spanish and European context. On the one hand, the crisis
   situation provides justification to funding cutbacks in science and
   universities; on other hand, previous to the crisis, the dynamic of
   new-managerialism yields new symbolic and material conditions based on
   competitiveness. This paper provides evidences about the labour
   situation of the Spanish academic staff concerning both dynamics and
   gender differences. Firstly, we examine the new-managerialist dynamic
   and the austerity dynamic in the European and Spanish context. Secondly,
   we display quantitative evolution of the Spanish public universities
   during the last decade, using secondary data from databases
   distinguishing by sex and labour categories. The results show the
   decrease of civil servant personnel (mostly men) and the increase of
   labour personnel, before the implementation of austerity measures.
   Moreover, it remains a high number of assistants who hold teaching
   overload in universities. Women figures increase slowly, narrowing the
   gender gap in early and medium stages of the academic careers. In
   conclusion, austerity policies justify and facilitate quick
   implementation of the neoliberal model of research in Spain.},

Title = {A Potemkin state in the Sahel? The empirical and the fictional in Malian
   state reconstruction},
Journal = {AFRICAN SECURITY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {11},
Number = {1},
Pages = {1-31},
Abstract = {Despite significant reconstruction efforts in the wake of its 2012-2013
   collapse, Mali remains mired in crisis: violence is on the rise,
   institutions are dysfunctional, the military is inefficient, investments
   are few, and corruption is rampant. We suggest that Mali's
   reconstruction's failure is but the latest iteration of a general
   failure at building the Malian state. This failure derives from a sheer
   lack of resources to sustain statehood and from a systematic tendency to
   emulate the French state model despite its incongruence with local
   conditions. As a result, the Malian state is mimicked more than it is
   built and its reconstruction imagined more than it is implemented.
   Conflict plays an important role in this production, as it presents Mali
   with significant opportunities to stage itself, to develop and multiply
   institutions, and to derive outside support. Evocations of Mali's
   precolonial imperial past, meant to provide cover and legitimacy to its
   leadership, further disconnect the state from the realities of modern
   governance. The enactment of reconstruction is not, however, irrational
   for leaders with few short-run alternatives or for international
   partners eager to engage local security threats. There might be other
   alternatives, however, with greater potential for embedding the state
   into local resources, populations, and practices. Exploring
   opportunities for a greater adjunction of Islamic governance and for
   decentralization reforms more genuinely predicated on local institutions
   of collective action might prove fruitful.},

Abstract = {Following a brief review of dissident Marxist art historian T. J.
   Clark's Picasso and Truth, this essay asks whether the techniques
   developed by certain visual artists and writers over the course of the
   last century might be applied in Marxist critique. By returning to
   debates on realism in Europe in the mid 1930s and subsequent work by
   Marxist art historians, the essay makes the case for the use of
   modernist-like deformation in contemporary Marxist critique. Realist
   engagement is seen as compatible with-indeed, as
   necessitating-experimentation with form, something recognized in the
   recent revival of interest in Gyorgy Lukacs.},

Abstract = {Democratic accountability relies on the ability of citizens to reward
   and punish politicians in elections. Electoral institutions, such as the
   timing of elections, may play a powerful role in this process. In this
   article, I assess how on-cycle (concurrent) and off-cycle elections
   affect one facet of accountabilitythe incumbency advantageusing data on
   nearly 10,000 mayoral elections in cities over the past 60 years. Using
   a regression discontinuity design, I find that incumbency carries a
   substantial advantage for individual candidates. Moreover, I find that
   on-cycle elections provide incumbents with a far larger advantage than
   off-cycle elections do. These results show that election timing has
   important implications for electoral politics and demonstrate one
   possible mechanism for the prevalence of the incumbency advantage.},

   Conflicts: A Fuzzy-Set Analysis},
Journal = {CIVIL WARS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {20},
Number = {1},
Pages = {109-133},
Abstract = {Contemporary international mediation is often multiparty and involves a
   number of states and multilateral organisations. What are the conditions
   that account for successful multiparty mediation in conflict resolution?
   To address this question, I use qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA)
   and focus on individual dimensions of mediation, namely internal
   cohesion of the mediating coalition, the use of reward and coercive
   power, and the presence of a `mutually hurting stalemate' (MHS). I posit
   that the presence of a cohesive mediating coalition is a necessary
   condition for conflict resolution, whereas the provision of security
   guarantees, the imposition of sanctions and the presence of an MHS play
   a causal role in conflict resolution only in conjunction with other
   conditions. I test these conditions using a fuzzy-set approach and data
   from 20 mediated agreements over separatist conflicts in the post-cold
   war era. Empirical findings provide support for some of these
   propositions and challenge relevant theories of international mediation.
   More specifically, this research shows that a high convergence of
   interests among mediators is the only necessary - albeit not sufficient
   condition - for conflict resolution. Second, the analysis highlights the
   presence of two main sufficient paths for mediation success.},

Abstract = {The author assesses the feasibility and opportunity for Russia to be
   `un-Moscowed', as well as the opportunity for Moscow to be
   ``de-capitalized{''}, concerning the geo-economic and geopolitical
   realities. The article analyzes the historical trend of forming
   `Moscow-centric' model of the organization of the Russian space. It is
   shown that the post-Soviet rapid growth of socio-economic asymmetry in
   the development of Moscow and ``non-capital{''} regions of the Russian
   Federation leads not only to stagnation and degradation of the
   periphery, but also to the deepening of the crisis of Moscow itself. The
   latter is manifested in the reduction of migration growth of the
   population of the Moscow region, as well as the significant decrease in
   the share of Moscow residents in the money income of the Russian
   population, including the property income. The author emphasizes the
   economic and geopolitical risks of the invariants of ``un-Moscowing{''}
   of Russia. Special attention is paid to the need, on the one hand, to
   re-develop the high-problematic Russian territories ( including the
   border and maritime ones, as well as ones with the active cross-border
   connections), on the other hand - to implement very balanced attitude to
   the prospect of a polycentric development of the country.},

Title = {Is It Always Good to Talk? The Paradoxes of Truth-Telling by Rwandan
   Youth Born of Rape Committed during the Genocide},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF GENOCIDE RESEARCH},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {20},
Number = {3},
Pages = {372-391},
Abstract = {Social scientists have extensively debated the virtues, pitfalls, and
   practical effects of open dialogue and truth-telling versus silence and
   concealment in global post-conflict endeavours for justice and
   reconciliation. This article addresses these debates not by endorsing
   practices of either talk or silence, but by investigating the practical
   dilemmas faced by Rwandan youth born of rape committed during the 1994
   genocide as they find themselves caught in dual cultural imperatives to
   reveal and to conceal the circumstances of their origins. On the one
   hand, the post-genocide moment has seen the rise of truth-telling and
   self-revelation through testimonial practices in settings like
   post-genocide trials and reconciliation or peace-building workshops. On
   the other hand, silence and concealment are accepted and expected modes
   of dealing with hardship in Rwandan cultural practice, and youth
   participants struggled with the stigma of having been born of genocidal
   rape. We argue that the youths' ambivalent and sometimes contradictory
   moral evaluations of talking about versus hiding their origins highlight
   the challenges and complexities of identity and belonging in
   post-genocide Rwanda, since their very existence draws them, their
   mothers, and their perpetrator-fathers into ongoing relationships. These
   youths' lives and experiences speak to larger and powerful conundrums at
   the heart of what it means to live with legacies of violence, including
   what should be said or remain unsaid, and how the very opposition
   between revealing and concealing can be confounded by social and
   cultural variances in the meaning of ``truth.{''}},

   the economic and political power of some social actors, but also to a
   certain symbolic capitals and ideologies (especially the transnational
   ones) that encourage the use of bicycles as a solution of the urban
   transport problems. In order to understand, in a particular case (the
   Santa Margarita cycle path in Zapopan), how the legitimacy process of
   construction was, which were the main actors, what were the powers at

   infrastructures when they do not respond to general collective benefits.},

Abstract = {Russia and Turkey are the European Union's most important neighbours.
   For a long time, the EU pursued the goal of promoting change in the
   politics, economies and societies of Turkey and Russia. The aim was to
   help turn the states into stable democracies and competitive market
   economies that were integrated into the global market and positively
   disposed towards the EU. Turkey was given the status of an accession
   candidate, while Russia was regarded as a `strategic partner'. The goal
   of achieving domestic policy reforms and a foreign policy rapprochement
   with the EU has failed. This is due to domestic policy developments in
   Russia and Turkey and regional events, as well as errors in EU policy.},

Title = {FACTORS OF PARTY SYSTEM NATIONALIZATION IN CONTEMPORARY RUSSIA},
Journal = {POLIS-POLITICHESKIYE ISSLEDOVANIYA},
Year = {2018},
Number = {1},
Pages = {45-61},
Abstract = {The article attempts to identify the major factors of party system
   nationalization in contemporary Russia. The concept of nationalization
   is treated as the nationwide participation in elections and territorial
   voting homogenization, which allows to study the formation of national
   parties participating in the process of political competition within
   nationwide standardized patterns of electoral behavior. The study is
   focused on national (2016) and subnational (2012-2016) parliamentary
   elections (proportional representation). The author introduces the
   national-subnational covering index, which covers election participation
   strategies of political parties at different territorial levels. The
   measuring shows a significant variation in electoral participation of
   the parties across the territory, what can be explained by the level of
   the institutionalization (parliamentary / non-parliamentary) as well as
   their durability. Also, statistical analysis has been carried out with
   data concerning voting homogeneity of the State Duma 2016 elections
   (according to Party Nationalization Score by Jones-Mainwaring) used as
   sample. Principal component analysis has revealed that the voting
   nationalization structure is quite compact and similar to the structure
   of electoral competition where ``United Russia{''} occupies a separate
   position from all other parties in the electoral space (so-called
   ``structural domination{''}). On the other hand, it is also important to
   consider the cleavage between the federal parliamentary parties and the
   non-systemic opposition plus the most successive spoilers. For instance,
   the regression analysis reveals the importance of regional political
   factors like the governors' ability to consolidate regional elites
   delivering votes in high levels of territorial homogenization. At the
   same time the radical opposition remains marginalized, being forced to
   deny participating in regional electoral campaigns.},

   Advisory Network. It is relatively rare in most areas of social science
   that researchers produce (and make public) future forecasts. It is rarer
   still to evaluate their accuracy once the future has arrived. AFP
   five-year forecasts are potentially important for genocide and
   politicide prevention, and have gained attention from policy makers and
   news media, but a systematic assessment of their accuracy has not been
   undertaken previously. Our evaluation of past forecast accuracy, with
   true-positive rates from thirty-three to fifty per cent, true-negative
   rates around ninety per cent, and area under the curve (AUC) statistics
   from .81 to .96, gives an indication of how much confidence should be
   placed in the 2016-20 forecasts.},
