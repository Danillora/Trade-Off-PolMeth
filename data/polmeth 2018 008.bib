Abstract = {The election of President Donald Trump in 2016 ushered in the first
   Republican Congress and White House in a decade. Despite unified party
   control in the 115th Congress (2017-18), House and Senate GOP majorities
   struggled to legislate: GOP fissures and an undisciplined, unpopular
   president frequently undermined the Republican agenda. Most notably,
   clashes within and between the two parties strained old ways of doing
   business. In response, Republicans dodged, bent, or reinterpreted
   several institutional constraints in pursuit of their party's
   legislative priorities. In this article, I explore the conditions that
   drive majority parties to find ways to dodge the rules of the gametaking
   steps to circumvent institutional constraints, short of formally
   changing the rules. I focus in particular on Republican efforts in
   Trump's first Congress to empower majorities in the Senateidentifying
   potential political and institutional forces that propel majorities to
   confront parliamentary constraints in the contemporary Congress.},

Abstract = {Why do Democratic women seek and hold office more frequently than
   Republican women? We use an original survey of donors to party campaign
   committees and women's political action committees to answer this
   question. We theorize that the intense policy demanders in each party
   have built party cultures with substantively different orientations
   toward women's political involvement. These cultures shape party elites'
   behavior and influence responsiveness to a newly defined policy-demander
   groupwomen's representation policy demanders (WRPDs)whose primary goal
   is to increase women's political representation. We reveal that
   Democratic elites' political activity and financial contributions are
   significantly more motivated by WRPD concerns than are Republicans. We
   also show that WRPDs like EMILY's List and Susan B. Anthony List are far
   more integrated into Democratic than Republican party coalitions. Thus,
   we reveal both the continued existence of distinct party cultures and
   the consequences of this distinction for women's representation.},

Abstract = {Does generalized trust lead to democratic transitions? Despite the
   voluminous literature on trust and democracy, very little examines the
   link between trust and democratic regime change. We theorize that
   generalized trust should lead to support for the status quo rather than
   support for regime change. In democracies, this means that citizens in
   effect support the democratic regime. However, in autocracies this
   status quo bias means that trusting individuals support the autocracy.
   We test this argument using data from the Asian Barometer Survey. Our
   simultaneous equation model shows that generalized trust has a negative
   impact on support for regime change regardless of regime type. This
   suggests that generalized trust-if anything-constitutes a headwind
   against democratic regime change rather than a facilitating factor.},

Abstract = {Gerrymandering has long characterised the electoral cartography of the
   United States and a sequence of cases seeking to outlaw the practice
   have all failed before the Supreme Court. Its judgement in a 2006 case
   indicated that although the Court recognised the practice, it could
   identify no formal means of evaluating whether any particular map of
   Congressional or State electoral districts was a gerrymander that
   violated a constitutional provision. This encouraged those who drew up
   new district maps in many states after publication of the 2010 census
   data, most of which favoured the Republican party and were more
   egregious than previous such cartographies. A minority judgement in that
   case did suggest ways in which a gerrymander could be proved, however,
   and these were followed in a case brought regarding new State Assembly
   districts for Wisconsin. A lower court found in favour of the plaintiffs
   but this was over-turned by a unanimous Supreme Court which found that
   the plaintiffs had no standing to challenge a state-wide map. A
   concurrent decision by a minority of the Justices did suggest ways in
   which standing could be established and gerrymanders countered, and this
   may stimulate further cases-although it is uncertain whether a majority
   on the Court will accept such arguments. Meanwhile, America gerrymanders

Abstract = {This essay concludes the symposium by considering Howard J. Wiarda's
   topical scholarship on grand theory, corporatism, democratization, and
   development, in addition to his regional scholarship, which focused on
   Latin American, Caribbean, and Iberian politics but also touched on
   every other major region of the world, including U.S. politics and
   foreign policy making. We seek to makes sense of the tensions in
   Wiarda's work, especially between his critiques of theoretical
   determinism and ethnocentrism on the one hand and his continual emphasis
   on cultural and corporatist explanations of comparative politics, on the
   other. We argue that he made significant contributions to the field
   through his service as a public intellectual, mobilization of multiple
   theoretical perspectives, use of inductive methods, provocative
   interpretations of comparative politics throughout the world, and
   accessibility to students and policy makers.},

Abstract = {Issues are not neutral. This study about the Dutch 2016 referendum on
   the EU-Ukraine association treaty asks which issues dominated the news
   media in the campaign, how the news about these issues influenced the
   saliency of benefits and disadvantages of the treaty, and how the latter
   in turn influenced turnout and the vote. A content analysis of
   newspapers and television news shows that trade and democracy were much
   more prominent in the news than EU support for Ukraine against Russia.
   Linking the content analysis to a long-term panel survey reveals that
   issue news in self-selected media influenced the saliency of benefits
   and disadvantages of the treaty. The latter motivated voters to cast a
   vote, but priming was only partial since the voters' ``Yes{''} or
   ``No{''} was primarily driven by prior dissatisfaction with the EU and
   the national government.},

Abstract = {What explains minority language recognition in dictatorships? In this
   paper, we argue that minority language groups in authoritarian regimes
   are more likely to have their languages recognized when their interests
   are represented by a party in the legislature. Moreover, the level of
   recognition is greater. We test this argument using original group-level
   and time-variant measures of minority party in legislature and minority
   language policies for all Asian dictatorships from 1980 to 2000. The
   results are robust even when we shift the analysis to the country level
   globally and account for possible spurious correlations.},

Abstract = {The, classical realist writings of E.H. Carr and constructivist
   publications of Alexander Wendt are extraordinarily influential. While
   they have provoked a great number of reactions within the discipline of
   International Relations, the ethical dimensions of their works have
   rarely been studied at length. This article seeks to remedy this lack of
   examination by engaging in an in-depth scrutiny of the moral concerns of
   these two mainstream International Relations scholars. On investigation,
   it is revealed that Carr demonstrates a strong commitment to the ethical

Abstract = {The new policies on children and the internet reflect a paradoxical
   construction of children as right holders and users in virtual
   environments. This article offers an analysis of how children's rights
   are integrated into children and internet policy. It explores the
   collective emotions behind public narratives on children and internet,
   taking into account global discourses on children's rights and the
   Spanish national context. In order to understand how emotions operate in
   public narratives and politics, it analyses discursively international
   and national policy documents (legal text, political debates, official
   reports, programmes and guides) about children and internet, produced
   between 2000 and 2018. It shows that although internet has been
   presented as space where children are able to participate in a global
   citizenship, there is a strong tendency to criminalize this
   participation and emphasizing the potential risks to which children are
   exposed as users. This is the results of a regulatory framework where
   collective emotions play an important role to portray childhood as a
   social group with lack of competence rather than children as subjects
   with rights to participate.},

Title = {Lessons from exits foreclosed: An exilic interpretation of the Mexican
   and Russian Revolutions, 1910-1924},
Journal = {CAPITAL AND CLASS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {42},
Number = {3},

Abstract = {We apply a typology of exile to factions involved in the Mexican and
   Russian Revolutions of the early 20th century. Our typology is based on
   Grubacic and O'Hearn's theory of exile, which seeks to explain how
   alternative social institutions based on mutual aid, substantive
   reproduction, and egalitarian, direct democracy come into being and
   sustain themselves. We argue for exile as a determinant of revolutionary
   outcomes and the state (de)formation process and that we must understand
   exile-in-rupture as a moment when structures are at maximal flux due to
   the existence of exilic factions. By doing so, we offer a novel approach
   to understanding revolutions and state (de)formation based upon the
   alliances between exilic and incorporative factions. Through
   descriptions of loyalty bargains made, maintained, and broken during the
   Mexican and Russian Revolutions, we demonstrate how factions
   representing autonomy and exit are excluded from the resulting
   political-economic order post-Revolution, while their energy and power
   are leveraged during revolution itself. Based on this, we argue that
   exile is a key component of radical strategy, but that it is often
   precariously based on loyalty bargains that underpin it. Due to exile's
   precarity, revolutions are foreclosed by reincorporation into the
   capitalist world-system as states are (re)formed by incorporative
   factions. Therefore, exile is both a necessary and contingent component
   of revolution and state (de)formation.},

Abstract = {Do researchers share their quantitative data and are the quantitative
   results that are published in political science journals replicable? We
   attempt to answer these questions by analyzing all articles published in
   the 2015 issues of three political behaviorist journals (i.e., Electoral
   Studies, Party Politics, and Journal of Elections, Public Opinion \&
   Parties)-all of which did not have a binding data-sharing and
   replication policy as of 2015. We found that authors are still reluctant
   to share their data; only slightly more than half of the authors in
   these journals do so. For those who share their data, we mainly
   confirmed the initial results reported in the respective articles in
   roughly 70\% of the times. Only roughly 5\% of the articles yielded
   significantly different results from those reported in the publication.
   However, we also found that roughly 25\% of the articles organized the
   data and/or code so poorly that replication was impossible.},

Journal = {INTEREST GROUPS \& ADVOCACY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {7},
Number = {3},
Pages = {206-232},

Abstract = {Foundations are much more than disinterested philanthropic institutions
   that award grants to service-providing nonprofits. Foundations are
   political actors that seek to produce social change, not only by
   donating resources to nonprofits that promote causes but also by
   supporting policy reform in a more direct manner. We investigate
   engagement in advocacy among community foundations in the USA, which we
   define as the effort to influence public policy by proposing or
   endorsing ideas and by mobilizing stakeholders for social change.
   Drawing primarily on organizational sociology, we posit that the
   environmental context in which community foundations are situated and
   particular structural characteristics or operational features of
   community foundations (institutional logics, identity and embeddedness,
   and managerialism) will be associated with advocacy. We utilize machine
   learning techniques to establish an outcome measure of advocacy
   discourse on community foundation websites and ordinary least squares
   regression to model that outcome with a cross-sectional dataset compiled
   from multiple sources. We find considerable support for our conceptual
   frame, and we conclude by offering an agenda for future research on
   foundations as interest groups.},

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {39},
Number = {4},
Pages = {473-486},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {This article attempts to analyze the process of selective history and
   hegemony-making in Singapore, and makes the following arguments.
   Firstly, the birth of the nation-state led the political elites to rely
   on several hegemonic ideologies as founding myths, chief of which is the
   idea of survival'. Secondly, to create and sustain these ideologies, two
   things needed to be done concurrently: de-emphasize the Malay-ness of
   the nation's past; and accentuate the racial/religious nature of sources
   to instability. Finally, the article makes the claim that these
   ideologies have been successfully perpetuated, and outlines the contours
   of this success. In making these arguments, the article hopes to argue
   against Singapore exceptionalism' in studies on democratization, and
   further contends that the link between ideas, history and
   authoritarianism needs to be considered more seriously.},

Abstract = {This study focuses on technological media as a source of criminal
   procedural research, looking at three sources of digital evidence in
   particular: emails, WhatsApp and social networks. With the primary aim
   of analysing how the evidence is weighed up and the specific features of
   this technological media, the study is based on the insufficient legal
   regulation until the reform of 2015, and the current doubts as to
   whether or not the latter is suitable. The detailed exam of the doctrine
   and the precedent set for the sources of digital evidence lead us to
   consider the need to adjust the legislation to constitutional and
   European guarantees, simultaneously dealing with the difficulties of
   some constantly evolving digital techniques when it comes to complying
   with evidentiary guarantees.},

Abstract = {Twenty-five years after the notorious genocide of Rwanda's Tutsi, heated
   arguments still prevail about key aspects of the event. At the moment,
   the greatest dispute concerns the behavior of the Rwanda Patriotic
   Front, the mostly-Tutsi rebel group that drove the genocidaires from the
   country and ended up ruling Rwanda to this day. The prevailing school of
   historiography, one embraced by a majority of scholars and promoted
   ceaselessly by the RPF government under President Paul Kagame, sees the
   RPF army as an exemplary, well-trained, and highly disciplined force,
   the very antithesis of the genocidaires. But a growing group of scholars
   and journalists now insist that the RPF were in every way as cruel,
   vicious, and murderous as were the anti-Tutsi conspirators themselves.
   This paper examines these arguments and makes some recommendations.},

Title = {When Do the Dispossessed Protest? Informal Leadership and Mobilization
   in Syrian Refugee Camps},
Journal = {PERSPECTIVES ON POLITICS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {16},
Number = {3},
Pages = {617-633},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Refugees arc often considered to be among the world's most powerless
   groups; they face significant structural barriers to political
   mobilization, often including extreme poverty and exposure to
   repression. Yet despite these odds refugee groups do occasionally
   mobilize to demand better services and greater rights. In this paper I
   examine varying levels of mobilization among Syrian refugees living in
   camps and informal settlements in Turkey, Lebanon, and Jordan in order
   to explain how marginalized and dispossessed groups manage to develop
   autonomous political strength. I explain the surprisingly high levels of
   mobilization in Jordan's Za'atari Camp compared to the relative
   quiescence of refugees in Turkish camps and Lebanese informal
   settlements as the product of a set of strong informal leadership
   networks. These networks emerged due to two unique facets of the refugee
   management regime in Jordan: the concentration of refugees in the camp,
   and a fragmented governance system. In Turkey and Lebanon, where these
   two conditions were absent, refugees did not develop the strong
   leadership networks necessary to support mobilization. I develop this
   argument through structured comparison of three cases and within-case
   process tracing, using primary source documents from humanitarian
   agencies, contentious event data, and 87 original interviews conducted
   in the summer of 2015.},

Abstract = {Come election time, many localities in Africa seem to speak with one
   voice. Vote totals often suggest near-unanimity within villages and
   neighborhoods, even when national-level results demonstrate greater
   competitiveness. However, there is substantial variation in the
   electoral solidarity of local communities, with some demonstrating
   significantly less cohesion than others. Few if any scholars have tried
   to explain this variation. I theorize that solidarity levels are largely
   a function of community members' abilities to act autonomously. Namely,
   communities will be more likely to vote en bloc when residents are less
   able to resist pressures from local elites, who often act as brokers for
   national politicians, due to elite-empowering land-tenure regimes,
   poverty, and information scarcity. I test this theory with data from
   Uganda, which displays significant variation in local-level electoral
   solidarity. I find that electoral solidarity is lower in communities
   where freehold land arrangements are more common, living standards are
   higher, and mass media (i.e., radio signals) are more accessible.},

Abstract = {The article explores how parties influence legal change in federal
   systems. Analysing 310 initiatives to change German legislation
   concerning minors' rights (which fall into federal and land
   jurisdiction) for the period from 1990 to 2014, the study opens up
   empirically a new legislative domain which has been largely ignored by
   political science so far. It investigates the initiating parties,
   issues, positions, timing, and cross-level government constellation and
   corroborates that parties in Germany coordinate their legislative
   initiatives across lands and levels. At the same time, the data indicate
   that German land parties are not mere agents of the federal parties and
   do not utilize the lander level for law-making against federal
   majorities. The many federal and lander initiatives instead give room
   for discourse and provide incentives for (re)adjusting party positions
   which in the long run fosters legal changes.},

Abstract = {In elections around the world, voters are influenced not only by
   positive offers of gifts and favors but also by the threat of negative
   sanctions for their individual electoral choices. Preelectoral
   entitlements such as jobs, assets, and welfare create expectations of
   future access that brokers can use as powerful negative inducements at
   the moment of the vote. We argue that in conditions where ballot secrecy
   makes it difficult to monitor vote choices, brokers are likely to target
   core supporters with both preelectoral entitlements and election-time
   threats. We refer to this counterintuitive logic as the core voters'
   curse. We find evidence for this argument using an original household
   survey of 1,860 Hungarian citizens in 93 rural communities fielded
   shortly after the 2014 parliamentary election.},

Abstract = {The article seeks to assess policy options of the Eastern Partnership
   Policy in stimulating long-term change in the partner countries. It
   argues that the policy has limited power to directly promote
   consolidation of democratic and market economy institutions or
   implementation of sectoral reforms. This is due to the embeddedness and
   mutual reinforcement of existing institutions in the partner countries.
   Instead, the Eastern Partnership Policy can create new dynamics of
   change by altering the outcomes of day-to-day interactions of a large
   number of individuals and organisations. In this regard, removal of
   barriers to travel, trade and participation in the EU programmes is an
   overdue (albeit too small) step in the right direction.},

Abstract = {What is the link between socioeconomic disadvantage and vote choice? The
   literature on this question is fragmented and points to motivations
   based on welfare policy, immigration policy or anti-establishment
   sentiments. To test which of these motives explains differences in
   voting behaviour between classes, a conjoint experiment in which
   fictitious candidates present randomly assigned positions was designed.
   The experiment evaluated the relative importance of the position on
   welfare, immigration and anti-establishment as well as candidates'
   occupational background. By splitting the analyses into lower, middle-
   and upper class voters, it was found that lower class voters are most
   distinct from other voters in their preferences for anti-establishment
   candidates. Strikingly, lower class voters even support welfare
   retrenchment, as long as it is an anti-establishment candidate proposing
   it. The experiment also found a general tendency to vote against career
   politicians across classes and remarkably few differences regarding
   immigration preferences.},

Abstract = {This paper presents empirical evidence for nonlinear relationship
   between education attainment and participation in political violence.
   The results are based on unweighted and weighted Probit estimations
   using a consolidated dataset of 200 militants and representative sample
   of over 13,000 Pakistanis. The results reveal that likelihood of
   participation in political violence increases with education attainment.
   However, the response of education attainment to political violence is
   diverse and those with education around high school are more likely to
   engage in political violence than any other level of education. At no
   level of education, the likelihood for participation in political
   violence is found to be negative. Hence, while political violence seems
   to be associated with literacy, there are noteworthy variations in the
   extent to which literacy affects political violence.},

Abstract = {In this article, I argue that Westminster parliamentary systems
   encourage large opposition parties to replace their leaders between
   elections. Parliamentary system structures how parties compete over
   legislative outcomes. In Westminster systems, the government's dominance
   in the legislative process promotes an adversarial government-opposition
   relationship. Subsequently, large opposition parties' electoral
   prospects are tied to their ability to discredit the government's policy
   agenda. Since this responsibility falls to party leaders, leaders of
   large opposition parties directly affect their parties' electoral
   prospects, and parties are more motivated to replace those who are
   ineffective in damaging the government's credibility. Therefore, leaders
   of large opposition parties in Westminster systems carry a higher risk
   of replacement than their counterparts in other parliamentary systems. I
   construct an original data set on party leadership turnover in 14
   established parliamentary democracies. Results from Cox proportional
   hazard models support my claim and suggest that institution influences
   intraparty dynamics.},

Title = {Who sees an hourglass? Assessing citizens' perception of local economic
   inequality},
Journal = {RESEARCH \& POLITICS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {5},
Number = {3},
Month = {AUG 24},
Abstract = {The scholarly literature is observing a slow but steady growth in
   research exploring the effects of subnational economic inequality on
   political attitudes and behavior. Germane to this work is the assumption
   that citizens are aware of the level of inequality in their local
   residential context. At present, however, the evidence in support of
   this assumption is mixed. This article attempts to offer the literature
   improved tests of citizens' awareness of local inequality by addressing
   a key limitation in past workthe discordance between the geographic unit
   underlying measures of the independent and dependent variables.
   Analyzing two national surveys employing a measure of perceived
   inequality scaled to the local level, the results suggest that citizens
   are indeed aware of the level of income inequality in their local
   environment and that the link between objective and perceived local
   inequality is most pronounced among lower income citizens.},

Abstract = {Governing contemporary public services across industrialized countries
   typically draws on a mix of different modes of governance. The
   literature on governance has raised the issue of the specific
   coexistences between different modes of governance. The focus is on fits
   and clashes, whereas there is less attention on situations, where
   different modes of governance do not connect. The contribution of the
   present article is to more systematically account for the what and why
   of such gaps. What are their specific characteristics? How can their
   existence be explained? Based on a critical case study of supporting
   coordination in public health services in Quebec, the article argues:
   that gaps in the coexistence between different modes of governance can
   be thought of as disconnects in the management of public services; and
   that this reflects a de facto lack of governance capacity to connect
   different modes of governance to each other.},

Abstract = {As a secularising nation in Northern Europe, Scotland has, over the last
   few decades, experienced a steep decline in religious belonging, church
   attendance, and beliefs. Ritual participation, which is arguably an
   understudied dimension of secularisation, follows a similar pattern of
   decline, with a significant majority of Scottish marriage rituals now
   being conducted in secular ceremonies. Using data from semi-structured
   in-depth interviews with 17 married couples, this study examines the
   decisions that secular Scots make when planning their wedding. Moreover,
   it places a particular focus on humanist marriage ceremonies, which have
   seen a noteworthy increase in popularity since they became legally
   recognised in Scotland in 2005. The secular participants emphasised the
   role of personal convictions and family expectations in choosing a
   particular type of marriage ceremony. The narratives also revealed how
   positive attitudes toward humanist ceremonies, in contrast with civil
   ceremonies, are centred around their ability to create personalised,
   nonreligious, celebrations that nevertheless give attention to culture
   and heritage. Ultimately, the findings suggest that repeating history
   through cultural traditions are an important aspect of both secular and
   religious rites of passage.},

Abstract = {Existing literature has analysed the relationship between electoral
   systems and either corruption or satisfaction with democracy (SWD)
   focussing on the traditional distinction between majoritarian and
   proportional systems. This paper, instead, investigates if and how
   specific aspects of electoral systems moderate the negative effects of
   corruption perceptions on SWD. We argue that two mechanisms act
   simultaneously but at different levels. The first mechanism is the
   relationship between voters and the national government, while the
   second links single representatives to their constituents. We advance
   conditional hypotheses that postulate an attenuating effect of
   disproportionality and a reinforcing impact of personal vote. Empirical
   results from 35 elections in 33 democracies, using both individual and
   aggregate-level data, confirm the research hypotheses. More
   disproportional electoral systems weaken the impact of citizens'
   perceived corruption on their democratic satisfaction, while this is
   strengthened by systems in which the ballot control is mostly in the
   hand of the voters.},

Abstract = {This article looks at what good and bad governments do when performing
   one of their most central functions, namely public procurement. Some 1.5
   million public contracts from across Europe are analyzed through
   statistical models that compare contracting patterns between good- and
   poor-governance regions. At the most basic level, the results can be
   interpreted as a rejection of a conventional view of the relation
   between governance and institutional choices and outcomes. It is not the
   case that poorly governed jurisdictions allow more discretion to public
   officials, that they impose more limits on access to markets, or that
   they clearly feature more competition, and in fact the opposite often
   holds. Going beyond this negative finding, the article argues that an
   alternative view of institutional choice and its connection with
   governance, in which some discretion and flexibility is desirable, can
   provide a better explanation of observed patterns, and can have
   important implications for institutional design.},

Title = {Can deliberation neutralise power?},
Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL THEORY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {17},
Number = {3},
Pages = {257-279},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Most democratic theorists agree that concentrations of wealth and power
   tend to distort the functioning of democracy and ought to be countered
   wherever possible. Deliberative democrats are no exception: though not
   its only potential value, the capacity of deliberation to `neutralise
   power' is often regarded as `fundamental' to deliberative theory. Power
   may be neutralised, according to many deliberative democrats, if
   citizens can be induced to commit more fully to the deliberative
   resolution of common problems. If they do, they will be unable to get
   away with inconsistencies and bad or private reasons, thereby mitigating
   the illegitimate influence of power. I argue, however, that the means by
   which power inflects political disagreement is far more subtle than this
   model suggests and cannot be countered so simply. As a wealth of recent
   research in political psychology demonstrates, human beings persistently
   exhibit `motivated reasoning', meaning that even when we are sincerely
   committed to the deliberative resolution of common problems, and even
   when we are exposed to the same reasons and evidence, we still disagree
   strongly about what `fair cooperation' entails. Motivated reasoning can
   be counteracted, but only under exceptional circumstances such as those
   that enable modern science, which cannot be reliably replicated in our
   society at large. My analysis suggests that in democratic politics -
   which rules out the kind of anti-democratic practices available to
   scientists - we should not expect deliberation to reliably neutralise
   power.},

Abstract = {We establish a link between multiwinner elections and apportionment
   problems by showing how approval-based multiwinner election rules can be
   interpreted as methods of apportionment. We consider several multiwinner
   rules and observe that some, but not all, of them induce apportionment
   methods that are well-established in the literature and in the actual
   practice of representation, be it proportional or non-proportional. For
   instance, we show that proportional approval voting induces the D'Hondt
   method and that Monroe's rule induces the largest remainder method. Our
   approach also yields apportionment methods implementing degressive
   proportionality. Furthermore, we consider properties of apportionment
   methods and exhibit multiwinner rules that induce apportionment methods
   satisfying these properties.},

Abstract = {This article examines findings of a panel study of more than 1,000
   students enrolled in introductory political science courses at a
   flagship public university. The survey assessed whether completing an
   introductory course had a positive effect on political efficacy,
   focusing on gender and race. We found that, at the aggregate level,
   completing an introductory political science course had little or no
   impact on self-reported measures of political efficacy. However, we
   found evidence of significant differences in external political efficacy
   between black and white students, even when controlling for factors such
   as background characteristics and course performance (i.e., grades). Our
   findings raise important questions about the civic function of the
   undergraduate political science curriculum, particularly regarding
   racial political inequalities.},

Abstract = {Hoping to insulate their contests from national politics, thirty-six
   states hold their gubernatorial elections in national midterm election
   years. Many scholars have assessed whether presidential evaluations
   nevertheless have an effect on these races, though findings have varied.
   We offer a new approach to examining this question, relying on
   underutilized state-level presidential approval data preceding 143
   gubernatorial races across six national midterm election cycles.
   Accounting for the effects of state ideology, gubernatorial approval,
   campaign spending, state economic performance, and incumbency, we report
   that presidential approval has a positive and significant effect on the
   performance of the presidential party in gubernatorial races. The
   substantive effects are modest, though still potentially meaningful. In
   the primary specification, an additional six points of presidential
   approval is associated with about one additional point of gubernatorial
   vote share.},

Abstract = {This text reveals that the border may be approached as a dispositive of
   power that works through the security and the logic of the global
   market. We understand `dispositive' as presented by Michel Foucault in
   some of works. For Foucault, the dispositive is a combination of links
   of knowledge and exercises of power. Here we present the functioning of
   our dispositive through Michael Foessel's analysis of contemporary
   security. He says that the security do not respond to the sovereign
   State's model anymore, but to the dynamics of neoliberal
   governamentality. The neoliberal governamentality consists, for
   Foucault, in the subjugation of the state power and of the individual
   existence linked to the global economy. That's why we suggest that the
   neoliberal governamentality is a combination of knowledge-power
   relationships that generates security in the border, that's the reason
   why it is a mechanism.},

   has perceived 1,461 million dollars for royalties in the last 25 years.
   In this paper, the importance of highlighting the reparation to victims
   of displacement due to economic interests is raised. For this reason,
   the paper will have the following subtopics: first, a account of the
   discovery of coal in the region is made and the arrival of multinational
   companies (BHP, Anglo American and Xstrata) is described; second, it is
   contextualized in what situation the inhabitants of Tabaco were, before,
   during and after the displacement (2002-2010); third, the impact on the
   inhabitants of Tabaco of displacement, uprooting, rupture of the social
   fabric and environmental damage is analyzed; Finally, the conclusions of
   the investigation are presented.},

Abstract = {This paper analyzes the relationship between the violence against
   journalists in Mexico and the structural context of the state order that
   allows this violence and the impunity of crimes. We explain how in the
   Mexican state system, beyond institutional reforms that aim to improve
   processes of democratization with mechanisms of accountability, another
   set of extralegal mechanisms operate, which function as containment of
   reforms and preserve power relations based on concentration, opacity,
   hoarding of opportunities and freedoms. In this context, the practice of
   vigilant journalism, as a social accountability of governmental actions,
   constitutes a dangerous practice insofar as it threatens the established
   de facto order, being the object of persecution and violence.},

Abstract = {Schmitt applied the method of political theology to demonstrate how
   romanticism moved the structure of the Kantian aesthetic judgment to all
   practical spheres, which enhances the role of the imagination as a
   creator of reality. This develops a kind of ironic subjectivity that is
   not committed with no ethical, moral or political value, for this
   reason, it distorts speeches in terms of truth and enduring commitments
   of ``truly{''} political subjectivity, which seeks through volitional
   affective membership a value, to transform the concrete reality. This
   ironic subjectivity is the prefiguration of a political activity
   associated with individualism, creativity, rejection of the whole fixed
   rule and institutional rigidity.},

Abstract = {Studies on female legislative behavior suggest that women
   parliamentarians may challenge party cohesion by allying across party
   lines. In this paper we analyze a specific parliamentary activity - bill
   co-sponsorship - in the Italian lower Chamber, between 1979 and 2016, as
   a source of information about MPs' original preferences to study how
   gender affects party cohesion. Do women form a separated group in the
   Italian parliament? On average, are they more or less distant from the
   center of their parties than men? Does gender affect systematically
   party cohesion? A principal component analysis of co-sponsorship data
   allows us to identify the ideal points of all MPs in a multidimensional
   space for each legislature. Based on these data we estimate the impact
   of gender on party cohesion at the individual level while controlling
   for the impact of several other variables of different kind (individual,
   partisan, and institutional). We find that: (1) on average, women show
   lower cohesion as a group inside different parties and higher party
   cohesion than men; (2) the influence of gender on party cohesion is not
   conditional upon individual characteristics, upon the size and
   organization of parliamentary parties, and upon the share of women in
   their parliamentary groups; (3) the different behavior of women MPs may
   depend on the different patterns of recruitment in the parties.},

Abstract = {Over the last three decades a great deal of research has been carried
   out in an attempt to explain the electoral performance of radical right
   parties in Europe. Most approaches concentrate on demand-side
   determinants and have some limitations. We compensate for these
   shortcomings and focus on the context of party competition and
   supply-side determinants (consistency of ideological discourse,
   functioning party propaganda, the continuity of the leader in office and
   strong party organization) to explain the electoral success of radical
   right parties in post-communist Europe. We conducted our analysis at
   party level in nine radical right parties in four countries from Central
   and Eastern Europe (Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Hungary and Romania)
   between 1990 and 2014. The bivariate and multivariate (ordinal logistic
   regression) analyses draw on unique data collected from primary and
   secondary sources.},

Abstract = {Many parliamentary democracies feature a president alongside a prime
   minister. While these presidents have a nonpartisan status as head of
   state, they often have had long political careers with partisan
   affiliations before assuming office. How do voters react when such
   actors make issue statements to shape public opinion? Are such
   statements filtered through voters' partisan lenses, provoked by the
   partisan background of these actors? Or perhaps partisan reactions are
   not invoked, owing to the nonpartisan status of the office? We argue
   that voters' reactions depend on the issue domain. Partisan reactions
   will be invoked only when the statements are about issues outside the
   president's prerogatives. We provide evidence for our argument from a
   population-based survey experiment in Turkey.},

Abstract = {Strike activity in Britain continues at its historically low ebb. The
   level of strikes is likely to remain low or even fall further as a
   result of the introduction of the Tory Trade Union Act 2016 on 1 March
   2017. This raises the issue of whether other means of the expression and
   resolution of workplace grievances are being used instead when strike
   action is not or cannot be used. An examination of the available data on
   the frequency of these other means indicates such displacement has not
   occurred to any great extent, in part because we have also seen
   successive attempts by government to suppress the level of individual
   disputes over the last three to four decades.},

Abstract = {How do natural resources influence the duration of civil wars? Previous
   studies argue that resource wealth increases rebels' motivation for
   private gain (motivation mechanism) and provides rebel leaders with
   sufficient funding opportunities to continue their insurrectionary
   activities (feasibility mechanism), thereby increasing the likelihood of
   prolonged conflict. While these two mechanisms are very important
   arguments for explaining the role of natural resources in the
   continuation of civil wars, there are not enough existing studies that
   analyze these two mechanisms separately. To examine the two mechanisms,
   this article introduces three important factors to the analysis: the
   lootability of natural resources, types of conflict termination, and
   power balance between government and rebels. Empirically, this article
   examines the effect of natural resources on conflict duration for the
   period of 1946-2003, using a competing risk modeling approach. Findings
   from the quantitative analysis reveal that lootable resources (onshore
   oil production) are negatively related to the duration of a civil war
   that ends in rebel victory and positively related to the duration of a
   civil war that ends in peace agreement when rebels have enough military
   capability. On the other hand, empirical analysis shows that
   non-lootable resources (offshore oil production) tend to reduce the
   duration of a civil war that ends in government victory.},

Abstract = {Although Sri Lanka made attempts to adopt policies of decentralization
   and democratic governance to enhance citizens' trust, the efforts had
   yielded very little success. As such, this study attempts to assess the
   level of citizens' trust in public institutions in the eastern province
   of Sri Lanka and explores the factors contributing to the decline of
   citizens' trust in public institutions. Both qualitative and
   quantitative methods consisting of questionnaire survey,
   in-depth-interview and focus group discussion as data collection
   techniques were employed in this study. Overall, it was found that the
   people have little trust in the public institutions due to lack of
   awareness, discrimination in terms of ethnicity, undue delay, lack of
   modern facilities and political influence. Thus, it is paramount on the
   part of government to address these challenges to restore the trust
   among the citizens on these public institutions.},

Abstract = {Literature claims that scientific evidence makes better democracies.
   This paper analyses whether and which voters choose empirical evidence
   in the form of policy evaluation results when informing themselves about
   issue-specific votes. The analysis is based on a split-ballot survey
   where participants chose media items with different content to make a
   decision on a specific issue. Results show that voters do indeed choose
   evidence-based information, especially if their involvement with the
   issue is high and if they are well educated and that they choose a
   higher amount of such information if they are also politically engaged.
   In a setting that fosters political engagement and provides
   policy-relevant information, the findings imply that voters want to be
   informed when making a democratic issue choice. Involved and engaged
   voters might be a solution to sceptics against direct democracy out of
   fear of uninformed decisions and post-factual populism.},

Abstract = {Over the past decades, most countries have witnessed an increase in
   collaborative arrangements for engaging stakeholders in collective
   decision-making processes. Despite the fact that the role of the state
   in the collaborative structures has been one of the highly debated
   issues, there is still a need for a more comprehensive understanding of
   how governmental agencies affect the performance of collaborative
   actions. This article develops a framework for systematic analyses of
   collaborative effects on policy performance. Using PROCESS OLS
   regression, the authors apply the framework to project-level Cohesion
   Policy implementation in Finland - that is, to collaborative
   arrangements embedded in a rather fragmented and complex administrative
   context. The typical state characteristics of a Nordic country make
   Finland an interesting case for studying the interaction in
   collaborative arrangements between the administration and external
   agencies in a modern welfare state. The results presented in this
   article show that government agencies have a considerable moderating
   impact on the relationships between collaborative qualities and
   performance. The impact is, however, dependent on the responsiveness of
   the external agent to the bureaucratic rationale. The results underline
   the importance of more holistic approaches for analyzing complex
   collaborative constellations, focusing particularly on interaction
   effects between potential explanatory factors.},

Abstract = {Was the outcome of the United Kingdom's Brexit' referendum to leave the
   European Union a visible and consequential manifestation of right-wing
   populism? After all, skepticism in the UK towards the EU predates the
   recent rise of European right wing populism. Original survey data show,
   however, that the interaction of nativist sentiment and anti-elitist
   attitudes, the cocktail of right-wing populism, led to widespread
   support for Brexit, even while controlling for other factors. Although
   hostility to immigrants was an important factor, nativists were
   particularly prone to vote leave'; if they also did not trust political
   elites, a crucial element of populism. Further underscoring this
   explanation is the conditional effect of anti-elite sentiment. The
   relationship between anti-elite sentiment and support for leaving the EU
   only exists among those with high nativist sentiment; among those low in
   nativist sentiment, anti-elite feelings did not increase support for
   Brexit.},

Abstract = {Many citizens across the liberal democratic world are highly critical of
   their elected representatives' conduct. Drawing on original survey data
   from Britain, France and Germany, this paper offers a unique insight
   into prevailing attitudes across Europe's three largest democracies. It
   finds remarkable consistencies in the ethical priorities of British,
   French and German citizens: although there is some individual-level
   variation, respondents in all three countries overwhelmingly prioritise
   having honest representatives. It also finds differences in the types of
   behaviour that cause most concern in each country. The paper then
   examines how individuals' preferences shape their concerns about
   prevailing standards. The findings are consistent with the idea that
   citizens' predispositions have an `anchoring' effect on perceptions of
   political integrity. Finally, the paper considers whether established
   democracies are susceptible to an `expectations gap' between citizens'
   expectations of conduct and what `normal' politics can realistically
   deliver.},

Abstract = {In this article, I draw on Judith Shklar to provide an alternative to
   the liberal model of military intervention proposed in the last few
   years by intellectuals such as Michael Ignatieff. I suggest that
   Ignatieff misunderstands Shklar's liberalism of fear when he
   appropriates it as a foundation for military intervention on behalf of
   human rights. Through a reading of his Tanner Lectures Human Rights as
   Politics. Human Rights as Idolatry on one hand, and drawing on Shklar's
   entire body of work on the other, I highlight the profound differences
   separating these authors with regard to: their stance on natural law;
   the question of foundations and moral universals; the question of voice
   (Who speaks on behalf of the oppressed?); and their general stance with
   respect to the legacy of colonialism. I pit what I call Shklar's
   activism against Ignatieff's interventionism, and put forward a reading
   of ``putting cruelty first{''} as opening a forum for contestation
   across nations and cultures.},

Title = {How to continue and develop a ``reflective critique{''}, by learning
   from ``postcritique{''}: Apropos of Latour and Felski},
Journal = {POLITICA \& SOCIETA},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {7},

Month = {MAY-AUG},
Abstract = {This essay discusses Felski's and Latour's postcritical proposals, casts
   light on the non-negligible differences between them, but also their
   shared argumentative strategy, which consists in assuming as an
   exclusive evaluation criterion for a theory its practical fecundity,
   that is, its performative efficacy. My main intent is to show how, by
   drawing and elaborating on the 20th linguistic turn or better the
   distinguishable role of language in the diverse construction and
   self-construction of natural and historical-social worlds, only the
   retrieval and transformation of a critical-reflective framework allows
   valorising important postcritical intuitions and suggestions, such as
   the one relating to the impact of the living or inanimate things within
   the historical-social world or also relating to the role of the
   subjects, study objects, in the elaboration and attestation of a social
   theory, yet without lapsing into reductive conceptions of action and
   subjectivity, but rather gesturing towards a more adequate

   the Argentinean author Nora Strejilevich. The starting point in this
   story is, precisely, Arendt's idea about art, which Strejilevich
   materializes in three important abodes that makes us live: our body, our
   house and our country. Our research question is about how the author
   deals with this idea about art, and how it corresponds to Arendt's idea.},

Abstract = {An emerging narrative contends that 2016 was significant for bridging
   identity politics and American party conflict. This narrative misses a
   fundamental truth: for ordinary Americans, partisan identity has always
   been grounded in their orientations toward groups in society. The group
   theory of parties holds that citizens evaluate political parties
   according to their social stereotypes of Democrats and Republicans,
   ultimately identifying (or not) with a party that jives with their own
   self-image. In this essay, I review existing research and summarize
   several original studies suggesting that citizens' beliefs about party
   composition affect their feelings toward Democrats and Republicans.
   Americans tend to hold shockingly erroneous beliefs about the degree to
   which stereotypical groups compose the parties - for example, that 38\%
   of Republicans belong to the economic ``1\%{''} - and correcting social
   stereotypes about the out-party reduces polarization between
   rank-and-file party supporters. Most studies discussed in this essay
   were conducted before Donald Trump became a candidate, suggesting that
   2016 was not the year that identity politics hijacked the parties, but
   rather the year in which the implicit group basis for mass partisanship
   became baldly explicit.},

Abstract = {What explains variation in individual attitudes toward government
   deficits? Although macroeconomic stance is of paramount importance for
   contemporary governments, our understanding of its popular politics is
   limited. We argue that popular attitudes regarding austerity are
   influenced by media (and wider elite) framing. Information necessary to
   form preferences on the deficit is not provided neutrally, and its
   provision shapes how voters understand their interests. A wide range of
   evidence from Britain between 2010 and 2015 supports this claim. In the
   British Election Study, deficit attitudes vary systematically with the
   source of news consumption, even controlling for party identification. A
   structural topic model of two major newspapers' reporting shows that
   content varies systematically with respect to coverage of public

Abstract = {The political power of labor unions is a contentious issue in the social
   sciences. Departing from the dominant focus on membership size, we argue
   that unions' influence on national law making is based to an important
   degree on their local organization. We delineate the novel hypothesis
   that the horizontal concentration of union members within electoral
   districts matters. To test it, we draw on administrative records and map
   the membership size and concentration of local unions to districts of
   the US House of Representatives, 2003-12. We find that, controlling for
   membership size, representatives from districts with less concentrated
   unions have more liberal voting records than their peers. This
   concentration effect survives numerous district controls and relaxing
   OLS assumptions. While surprising for several theoretical perspectives,
   it is consistent with theories based on social incentives. These results
   have implications for our broader understanding of political
   representation and the role of groups in democratic politics.},

Title = {Understanding Power-Sharing within Political Parties: Stratarchy as
   Mutual Interdependence between the Party in the Centre and the Party on

Abstract = {Recent literature has renewed interest in the stratarchical model of
   intraparty decision-making. In this version of party organization, the
   functions performed by parties are distributed among their discrete
   levels. The result is a power-sharing arrangement in which no group has
   control over all aspects of party life. Thus, the model potentially
   provides an antidote to the hierarchical version of organization. This
   article examines the principal parties in Australia, Canada, Ireland and
   New Zealand to test whether there is empirical evidence of stratarchy.
   An examination of candidate nomination, leadership selection and policy
   development finds strong evidence of shared authority between both
   levels of the party in key areas of intraparty democracy. Both levels
   accept that they cannot achieve their goals without the support of the
   other and so a fine balancing act ensues, resulting in constant
   recalibration of power relations. There is, however, little evidence of
   the commonly presented model of stratarchy as mutual autonomy for each
   level within discrete areas of competency. Instead, both the party on
   the ground and in the centre share authority within all three areas,
   resulting in a pattern of mutual interdependence rather than mutual
   autonomy.},

Abstract = {This article investigates the extent to which independence referenda
   that do not lead to independence affect the politics of national
   minority communities and the larger multinational states that contain
   them. Using the cases of Quebec, Scotland, and Catalonia, the article
   analyzes the consequences of independence referenda for the nationalist
   party that initiated them, for popular support for the independence
   option, and for the state's practices for managing nationalist
   movements. The article concludes that the party promoting independence
   in a referendum is not harmed, at least in the short term, by its
   defeat; that independence referenda do not generate significant
   long-term support for the independence option, although they help to
   legitimize that option; and that referenda do not prompt governments to
   move toward more accommodation of nationalist movements, unless they
   formally commit to a specific change during the campaign. The nature and
   extent of the impact of independence referenda on the politics of
   national minority communities and the multinational states are largely
   determined by the dynamics of referendum campaigns, where the
   competition between nationalist and unionist forces plays out.},

Volume = {13},
Number = {1, SI},
Pages = {79-89},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {This paper examines one key aspect of Brexit, the link between Brexit
   and anti-politics. I shall argue that anti-politics led, in large part,
   to Brexit, but, crucially, that the latter will increase the former. In
   my view, anti-politics is rooted in distrust of the political elite and
   an almost total rejection of the idea, which, historically, was at the
   core of the British democratic settlement, that `government knows best'.
   This rejection was obviously, to a significant extent, based on
   successive governments' failures to deal with complex contemporary
   problems; for example, climate change and immigration. However, the key
   point is that, while these issues are very complex, too often, for
   electoral reasons, governments claim to have `answers'. In this sense,
   they don't, for various reasons, tell citizens `the truth'. In this
   context, Brexit is likely to make the situation much worse because it
   was offered as a simple solution to complex problems, problems which
   clearly it is unlikely to solve (immigration being a prime example). As
   such, an increase in anti-politics is very likely and this will pose a
   major threat for the future of democracy in the UK. The first step to
   address the problem is to recognise its nature, but in the last section
   of the article I explore possible ways forward.},

Volume = {80},

Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Social discourse about morality often features appeals to
   identity-grounding commitments. Individuals who wish to justify their
   conduct to others frequently portray certain actions they pursue as
   stemming from commitments that are central to their identity and portray
   actions they reject as incompatible with their identity. Such familiar
   appeals to identity-grounding commitments are frequently put in terms of
   integrity. Yet many moral philosophers have been skeptical of the idea
   that an agent's integrity can have independent normative significance.
   My main aim in this essay is to respond to such skepticism from the
   perspective of political philosophy. I argue that polities, at least of
   a liberal-democratic kind, can have their own normatively significant
   integrity. More specificallyand more dramaticallyI contend that it is
   actually easier to defend the normative significance of this political
   integrity than it is to defend the normative significance of individual
   integrity.},

Abstract = {Understanding how coalition parties in multiparty governments divide
   office and policy payoffs is one of the greatest challenges in political
   science. Gamson's Law predicts that ministries are allocated
   proportionally with the coalition members' legislative seat holding.
   However, doubts remain about how differences in the valuation of
   portfolios affect their distribution. The challenge is not only to
   determine whether government parties receive their fair share of cabinet
   payoffs once the importance of individual ministerial posts is taken
   into consideration, but also to develop a measure of portfolio
   importance that takes time and context into account. This article
   proposes a new method of measuring portfolio salience using official
   records of cabinet appointments in the Fifth French Republic that list
   ministerial posts hierarchically. The result is a more nuanced measure
   of portfolio importance, which is context sensitive and varies with
   time. The article argues that the new measure is able to reduce
   artificial deviations from the one-to-one linkage of seat shares and
   portfolio shares and that it can travel beyond the French case.},

Abstract = {Many fear that with Trump taking the helm, the United States will scale
   back its international leadership role in global governance, leaving a
   void that is too big for any single country to fill. Others are hopeful
   that emerging powers such as China will be able to step in and provide
   international leadership to solve global governance challenges, from
   climate change to nuclear nonproliferation. In this study, we explore
   the Chinese and American publics' perceptions and views on international
   leadership in the Trump era. Results from two parallel surveys conducted
   in China and the United States shed light on how ordinary citizens in
   these two countries conceptualize international leadership and how their
   views contrast with conventional wisdom and with each other. Given the
   increasingly larger role played by public opinion in the foreign
   policies of both democratic and authoritarian countries, the findings of
   this study will have important policy implications.},

Abstract = {Based on the analytical framework of securitization, this article argues
   that cooperation between China and the United States on climate change
   will not lose momentum despite President Trump's seemingly passive
   stance. A securitization process on the climate issue has been ongoing
   in China since President Xi Jinping took office and proposed the Overall
   National Security Outlook (ONSO). Climate security was thus integrated
   into China's political discourse as a key component of ecological and
   common security, leading to a period of China-U.S. cooperation during
   the Obama administration. Similarly, in the United States, climate
   policy has been cemented in security planning and assessment of various
   federal agencies. The U.S. security sector seems to be largely
   unaffected by the White House decision to withdraw from the Paris
   Agreement. A growing number of Americans treat climate change as a
   security threat and many U.S. states and cities, in collaboration with
   business leaders, have taken on a role in international climate
   diplomacy. Combined with existing intergovernmental collaborative
   projects, robust market forces and innovative local initiatives will
   continue to push China-U.S. climate cooperation forward. As a necessary
   step to sustain its ties with the United States on climate issues, the
   Chinese government needs to propose a renewed bilateral framework on
   energy and environment cooperation under the China-U.S. Comprehensive
   Economic Dialogue.},

Abstract = {This article assesses the effect of naturalization and inclusive
   citizenship regimes on immigrants' conventional and unconventional
   political participation in 26 European countries. I argue that both
   naturalization and inclusive citizenship regimes increase immigrants'
   sense of belonging to the country of residence and hence their political
   engagement. Using data from the European Social Survey and applying
   matching techniques in order to tackle endogeneity between
   naturalization and participation, I show that in countries with
   inclusive citizenship regimes the positive acquisition effect for
   naturalized immigrants is less pronounced than in more restrictive
   citizenship regimes. These results indicate that the effect of
   naturalization is highly dependent on the context of the citizenship
   regimes, a finding previously unnoticed due to the methodological
   challenges involved in the highly endogenous process of applying for and
   acquiring citizenship.},

Abstract = {The Old Swiss Confederation stood as a contentious point of reference in
   the ratification debate of 1787-88. While Federalists disdained the
   loosely banded cantons as a template of dysfunction, Anti-Federalists
   commended their regionalized constitution and variable systems of
   government. One Anti-Federalist, writing a series of essays for the
   Maryland Gazette under the name A Farmer, went as far as to hold up the
   Landsgemeinde, an apparatus of direct democracy found in the rural
   cantons of Uri, Schwyz, and Unterwalden, as a model for governance in
   the United States. Renouncing representative government, the Maryland
   Farmer's Essays pose a stark counterpoint to the liberal shift in
   American founding thought, positioning the ratification debate more
   squarely within the modern discourse on democracy.},

Abstract = {The rise of congressional polarization has led presidents to seek
   alternative ways to pursue their agendas through staffing. I argue
   presidents use excepted appointments, which are excepted both from
   advice and consent and competitive hiring processes, when ideological
   conflict within the Senate is high. I also argue that Schedule C
   appointments specifically are concentrated in agencies ideologically
   similar to the president due to their advisory nature. I find
   preliminary support for these hypotheses using Office of Personnel
   Management data on Schedule C appointees from 1998 to 2013. In sum, this
   study shows that excepted appointments are an important yet understudied
   tool in the president's administrative toolbox.},

Abstract = {President Trump differed significantly from other recent presidents in
   his management of the White House staff, domestic cabinet appointments,
   and relations with his national security team. This article traces the
   roots of White House dysfunction, particularly the lack of a strong
   chief of staff, the absence of a regular policy process, and the
   factions that fought for control of policy. It then examines President
   Trump's unusual approach of appointing domestic cabinet secretaries
   hostile to the traditional missions of their departments. Finally, it
   analyzes the fractious relations between President Trump and his
   national security cabinet secretaries.},

Abstract = {Studies of foreign direct investment's (FDI's) determinants focus on
   irreversibility as the main source of governments' credibility problems.
   Here, we highlight an underexplored source of time-inconsistency
   dilemmas: geographic agglomeration within a country. FDI's tendency to
   agglomerate creates visible inequalities in the country and generates
   demands for geographic income redistribution. Unchecked, such
   redistributive pressures can dissuade investors from entering the
   country altogether. Not all political systems are equally vulnerable,
   however. Countries with regionalized party systems are relatively
   unattractive to investors because regionalism increases the probability
   that investment returns from one region will be appropriated by the
   national government and used for geographic-based income redistribution.
   Countries with national parties, however, are less likely to engage in
   such behavior. Thus, we predict higher FDI inflows in countries with
   nationalized party systems and lower inflows in countries characterized
   by regional parties. Evidence from democracies between 1975 and 2007
   supports our argument and its posited causal mechanisms.},

Abstract = {The analysis compares voters' preferences in economic policy to
   political parties' economic written parliamentary questions during the
   2009-2014 term of the European Parliament. The corpus of over 55,000
   written questions was ideologically scaled via crowdsourcing. The
   analysis shows that parties are unresponsive to second-order and to
   disengaged voters. The results also suggest that there is no upper class
   bias in European Parliament political representation. The data highlight
   a strong tendency of EP7 political parties to cluster around the
   position of the average European voter, at the expense of their average
   supporter. The democratic deficit is therefore at most a pluralism
   deficit in the European Parliament, since substantive representation in
   the European Parliament is successful as far as the majoritarian norm is
   concerned.},

Abstract = {As of late, political theory, research, and practice have taken a
   deliberative turn, extolling the benefits of idealized public discourse.
   This paper explores how mass polarization impacts the preconditions for
   such discourse. Drawing from social identity theory, partisanship is
   conceptualized as having distinct, yet interrelated social and
   ideological dimensions. Through both online and telephone-based survey
   experiments, the paper then examines how these two dimensions affect
   attitudes toward discussion that theorists prioritize. Strong social
   attachments to one's party consistently drive antideliberative attitudes
   toward disagreement; ideological partisan attachment, however, does not
   have this effect. The results suggest that the rise of social identity
   polarization has driven the public away from discursive norms that would
   support a deliberative democratic system.},

Abstract = {This article examines the conditions under which dictators hold
   competitive elections, and looks specifically at the role played by a
   dictator's age. Drawing on previous studies arguing that uncertainty
   increases the likelihood of competitive elections, I argue that as a
   dictator ages, uncertainty over the future increases within the regime,
   because government insiders' expected payoffs for supporting the
   incumbent decline as s/he ages. As a result, I argue that older
   dictators are more likely to hold competitive elections in order to
   reduce uncertainty. The article also tests an implication of the
   argument: if uncertainty over the future drives elections, then it
   should be mitigated in regimes with a clear successor. Using a large-N,
   cross-national dataset on autocrats and competitive elections between
   1960 and 2012, this article examines the argument and finds that as
   dictators age, they are more likely to hold competitive elections, all
   else equal. The analysis also finds that the effect of autocrats' age on
   competitive elections is mitigated in one-party regimes where there
   exists an established succession rule, while the effect is more apparent
   in personalist regimes without such a system.},

   from the Buganda Kingdom},
Journal = {RESEARCH \& POLITICS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {5},
Number = {1},
Month = {FEB 7},
Abstract = {Recent studies show that traditional institutions and their
   representatives-such as chiefs or elders-are influential political
   forces in Sub-Saharan Africa and elsewhere. In this paper, we explore
   the causal mechanism through which traditional institutions increase
   cooperation and mobilization. We employ a lab-in-the-field experiment
   using modified public goods games involving the Buganda Kingdom of
   Uganda. We incorporate references to traditional authority to measure
   whether participants contribute more when traditional institutions are
   involved. We explicate and test two possible mechanisms through which
   traditional institutions might affect cooperation and mobilization: a
   horizontal mechanism driven by peer-to-peer effects; and a vertical
   mechanism driven by access to social hierarchies. We find evidence for
   the latter. This suggests that traditional institutions increase
   cooperation, because individuals expect that their cooperation and
   investment will be rewarded by traditional social elites.},

Abstract = {We study a core question of interest in political science: Do candidates
   position themselves differently under different electoral systems and is
   their positioning in line with the expectations of spatial theories? We
   use validated estimates of candidate ideological positions derived from
   quantitative scaling of 7,497 Japanese-language election manifestos
   written by the near universe of candidates who competed in the eight
   House of Representatives elections held on either side of Japan's 1994
   electoral reform. Leveraging variation before and after Japan's
   electoral reform, as well as within each electoral system, we find that
   candidates converge in single-member districts and diverge in
   multimember districts, and converge on copartisans when not faced with
   intraparty competition and diverge when they do. Our study helps to
   clarify debates about the effects of electoral systems on ideological
   polarization and party cohesion in Japan and more generally.},

Abstract = {The article reconstructs the political practices and speeches of the
   Revolutionary Armed Forces during the electoral conjuncture of 1972-1973
   in Argentina. It analyzes the meanings attributed to its participation
   in the electoral campaign of Peronism, the political strategy in which
   this commitment took place and the changes that the strategy implied in
   relation to the previous positions of the organization. The work appeals
   to a qualitative methodological strategy based on written and oral
   sources.},

Journal = {CAPITAL AND CLASS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {42},
Number = {1},
Pages = {133-160},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {In light of the 2015 Paris Climate Agreement, this project synthesizes
   and advances critiques of the possibility of a sustainable capitalism by
   adopting an explicit `negative' theory of ideology, understood as ideas
   that conceal contradictions through the reification and/or legitimation
   of the existing social order. Prominent climate change policy frameworks
   - the `greening' of markets (market-corrective measures), technology
   (alternative energy, energy efficiency, and geoengineering), and growth
   (the green growth strategy) - are shown to conceal one or both of the
   two systemic socio-ecological contradictions inherent in the current
   social formation: (1) a contradiction between capital's
   growth-dependence and the latter's degrading impact on the climate (the
   `capital-climate contradiction') and (2) a contradiction between the
   potential of using technological infrastructure that aids in emissions
   reductions and the institutionalized social relations that obstruct this
   technical potential (the `technical potential-productive relations
   contradiction'). Attempts to reform the very techniques and institutions
   that brought about the climate crisis will remain ineffective and
   reproduce the social order that results in climate change. After
   proposing a way in which societies might move out of the ideological
   trappings of green markets, technology, and growth, two alternatives are
   proposed: economic degrowth coupled with Marcuse's conception of a `new
   technology'.},

Abstract = {Shaming is an increasingly common practice. However, empirical evidence
   suggest that it does not always induce human rights (HR) reforms, and
   its effect is conditioned by intervening factors. This article
   hypothesizes that the combination of shaming and incentives induces
   policy changes in targeted countries. The hypothesis is tested using
   newly coded data that include 15 countries from Europe, Asia, and Africa
   that have been subject to the combination of shaming and incentives, as
   part of the European Neighborhood Policy. The article analyzes changes
   in the studied countries' HR policies. The results confirm the
   hypothesis that shaming and incentives enhance one another's effects on
   HR policies and induce policy reforms in targeted countries.},

Abstract = {Are democratic states permitted to denationalize citizens, in particular
   those whom they believe pose dangers to the physical safety of others?
   In this article, I argue that they are not. The power to denationalize
   citizensthat is, to revoke citizenshipis one that many states have
   historically claimed for themselves, but which has largely been in
   disuse in the last several decades. Recent terrorist events have,
   however, prompted scholars and political actors to reconsider the role
   that denationalization can and perhaps should play in democratic states,
   in particular with respect to its role in protecting national security
   and in supporting the global fight against terror more generally. In
   this article, my objective is to show that denationalization laws have
   no place in democratic states. To understand why, I propose examining
   the foundations of the right of citizenship, which lie, I shall argue,
   in the very strong interests that individuals have in security of
   residence. I use this formulation of the right to respond to two broad
   clusters of arguments: (1) those that claim that it is justifiable to
   denationalize citizens who threaten to undermine the safety of citizens
   in a democratic state or the ability of a democratic state to function
   as a democratic state, and (2) those that claim that it is justifiable
   to denationalize dual citizens because they possess citizenship status
   in a second country that is also able to protect their rights.},

Abstract = {Paul Warwick () argues that much of the research on ideological
   congruence leaves the erroneous impression that a close match of median
   left-right voter opinions and government ideological positions usually
   emerges from elections. I propose further clarifications. I offer a
   natural metric based on the average distances from the median voter of
   the most distant and the closest parties competing in all these
   countries' elections. I suggest that by these standards average
   ideological congruence in the Western liberal democracies in the last 20
   years has been fairly successful, but not as successful as it could be.},

   unpredictable candidates},
Journal = {ELECTORAL STUDIES},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {51},
Pages = {83-92},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Candidates and parties often face a choice between endorsing policies
   that appeal to their core constituencies or generate support from more
   diverse groups of voters. While the latter strategy may make overtures
   to a wider set of citizens, existing literature says little about how
   the overall mix of issue positions affects electoral support. We argue
   that candidates who endorse diverse sets of policy positions appear
   unpredictable to voters and incur subsequent electoral penalties. Using
   data from the 2006 congressional elections, we find that ideological
   predictability substantially increases electoral support at both the
   individual and aggregate levels and that voters perceive greater
   ideological congruence from more predictable candidates. Our results
   have important implications for candidate and party strategies and
   suggest that voters are responsive to the mean and the variance of
   candidates' policy stances.},

Abstract = {Freedom has no univocal meaning in Locke's work, despite its centrality.
   It is understood as a duty and right, but also as a power, or, as we
   will hold here, as a state. The successive modifications of the idea of
   freedom between An Essay concerning Human Understanding (1690) and Two
   Treatises of Government (1690), between the editions and in relation to
   early or later texts, such as The Reasonableness of Christianity(1695),
   allow us to think of freedom as a problem (above all, a political one),
   rather than as an evidence. Freedom affirms itself as the most sublime
   characteristic of human nature, as well as the symptom of her
   precariousness and corruption. Freedom could be compared with reason, as
   Locke intends to investigate the limits of both, without ever thinking
   them as franchisable.},

Abstract = {Transnational information sharing among security agencies in the
   European Union and beyond has grown considerably more important over the
   past decades. Centralised databases and numerous formal and informal
   networks now facilitate cooperation and information sharing. However,
   sharing intelligence may not only conflict with the protection of
   fundamental rights (data protection/privacy; presumption of innocence),
   but also with the organisational culture of institutions that are built
   upon secrecy. Police agencies often keep knowledge about individual
   cases and their strategies secret as long as possible. Intelligence
   services build their work and strategies upon secrecy even more. This
   paper analyses the variations of secrecy that can be observed for police
   agencies and secret services, and the relationship between information
   sharing among security agencies, secrecy, trust, transparency and
   accountability. In a normative perspective, the paper explores answers
   to the questions of how secret the work of security agencies should be
   in democratic rule of law systems and how accountability can be improved
   without making these institutions work less effectively.},

Abstract = {This article examines the autobiographical works of Sir Douglas Savory,
   M.P., an Ulster unionist politician in the pre-Troubles period,
   primarily from the 1940s through the 1960s. Savory used these writings
   to disseminate a unionist perspective on Northern Irish history and to
   construct unionist identity. The article particularly focuses on the
   intersection between his engagement with European minorities and Ulster
   unionism, arguing that his autobiographical accounts of his advocacy for
   marginalised groups helped to justify his portrayal of unionism as a
   threatened group. His work further helped to shape post-war narratives
   of unionism. These narratives elided nationalist grievances and
   encouraged an inflexible response to such issues on the part of unionist
   policy-makers, which would have far-reaching consequences in later
   periods. This article will conclude that Savory's autobiographical works
   were used in deeply political ways, drawing on his involvement with
   European minorities and Ulster unionism to idealise the unionist
   community and justify its political position in Northern Ireland.},

Abstract = {Does it matter which electoral districts Members of Parliament (MPs)
   represent when participating in parliamentary debates? We suggest that
   the party leadership, in particular in governing parties, will try to
   keep MPs off the floor if they come from regions with economic problems,
   because such MPs are more likely to deviate from the party line. This
   should be especially likely when MPs are directly elected and have
   incentives to create a personal platform. The characteristics of the
   German electoral system allow for evaluating this argument. By analysing
   9824 speeches in Bundestag debates focusing on economic issues and 8357
   speeches held in debates on societal, foreign and education policy, we
   find support for our hypotheses that directly elected MPs deliver
   significantly fewer speeches in economic debates the worse the economic
   situation is in the district they represent. However, there is no clear
   pattern when differentiating between MPs from the government or
   opposition camp in terms of the number of delivered speeches in
   parliamentary debates.},

Journal = {DEMOCRATIZATION},

Abstract = {Recent developments have raised new concerns regarding the prospects of
   democracy in Latin America, particularly in what are often defined,
   although not unanimously, as cases of competitive authoritarianism,
   including Bolivia, Ecuador, Venezuela, and Nicaragua. In light of their
   significance and diffusion on a global level, understanding how these
   regimes emerge is important, especially when they replace democratic or
   imperfectly democratic regimes such as in the cases examined in this
   study. What explains the emergence of competitive authoritarian regimes
   (CARs), particularly when the starting point is democratic or
   imperfectly democratic? What are the region's democratic prospects after
   the emergence of various CARs in the last two decades? Through the
   comparative analysis of competitive authoritarian attempts in Bolivia,
   Ecuador, Honduras, Nicaragua, and Venezuela, I argue that the same
   passages and challenges required to transform a democratic regime into a
   CAR makes incumbents' features and strategies particularly important,
   especially the ability to weather potentially lethal institutional
   crises and limit the legitimacy costs associated with competitive
   authoritarian manipulations. Incumbents have proved more successful in
   these challenges and hence in their competitive authoritarian attempts
   when combining charisma and the elaboration of a democratic discourse
   including the diffusion of new democratic values.},

Abstract = {The article analyzes the socio-economic, political, institutional and
   sociocultural factors that are the most significant, based on the
   results of in-depth interviews with experts from Moldova and Romania,
   the resultant of which was the actual registration of these territories
   as ``territories of underdevelopment{''} and which will play a decisive
   role in the future preservation of either change of this status. The
   historical features of nation-building and identity politics in Romania
   and Moldova and their actual contexts, patterns of identity and
   self-realization of citizens, the nature of public delimitation, the
   state of the communicative field of society and power, interaction with
   supranational entities are examined. According to the authors, the key
   factors contributing to the preservation of the territories of
   underdevelopment are the ever-widening gap between society and the
   authorities against the backdrop of systemic corruption of the latter,
   the lack of a consistent policy of building and consolidating the civil
   nation and in general, building and co-operating with the society an
   original political national project, and also ineffective use of the
   internal development potential, coupled with the preservation of a
   complex of unresolved socio-economic problems.},

Abstract = {Hobbes's political anthropology is grounded on a concept of liberty
   whose elaboration was influenced by the development of his project for a
   materialist philosophical system. Hobbes's attempt to provide a
   definitive foundation for civil science led him to re-elaborate the
   concept of liberty after De eive, and eventually conflate its
   descriptive and normative components in Leviathan. Some of Leviathan's
   conceptual innovations can thus be related to Hobbes's attempt to absorb
   the natural liberties of individuals in the body politic's artificial
   functioning.},

   primitive accumulation. Marx saw that the transition from feudalism to
   capitalism was accomplished not only by enclosures and the enslavement
   of peoples of the Americas and Africa; it required an ensemble of ideas
   and stories that justified these actions. Today's expropriation by debt
   also requires public discourses and cultural productions that work in
   concert with the coercive mechanisms of the state to protect the
   interests of the rentier class and shift accountability for financial
   malfeasance to others. It examines the ascendency of neoliberal economic
   policies in the United States, and then it examines the narratives that
   accompanied it through three feature films about finance. These films
   construct dual images of masculinity that portray men as either the
   ``bad boys{''} of Wall Street, or their obverse, sober and responsible
   guardians of the financial order. They contribute to a public discourse
   in which insider trading and stock market manipulations are not, in and
   of themselves, blameworthy. What is blameworthy is a particular type of
   failure, and it is this discursive move that allows both the moral
   culpability and economic consequences of debt to be shifted from the
   elites to others.},

Abstract = {At our predominantly white university, students often shy away from
   controversial conversations. How can the classroom encourage students to
   value and engage in potentially explosive conversations? We develop a
   concept of ``empathic scaffolding{''} to articulate an approach that
   integrates diversity and inclusion into the classroom. Empathic
   scaffolding structures content and pedagogy in a way that strategically
   expands students' zones of comfort, starting with very personal
   experiences with the material and expanding to include broader groups of
   people and course concepts. Understanding and engaging with these
   concentric circles of students' relationships to the course material is
   crucial if students are to hear and engage with voices to which they may
   have limited exposure. This article documents the best practices of
   implementing empathic scaffolding in the realms of content and pedagogy,
   offering a toolkit for professors to critically engage conversations
   about race and social justice.},

Abstract = {Malapportionment doubly penalizes people from relatively large electoral
   districts or constituencies by under-representing them in the
   legislature and in the political executive or cabinet. The latter effect
   has not been studied. This article develops theoretical reasons for
   large constituency disadvantage in the cabinet formation process, and
   tests them using a new repeated cross-sectional dataset on elections and
   cabinet formation in India's states, from 1977-2007. A
   one-standard-deviation increase in relative constituency size is
   associated with a 22 per cent fall in the probability of a
   constituency's representative being in the cabinet. Malapportionment
   affects cabinet inclusion by causing large parties to focus on winning
   relatively small constituencies. These effects are likely to hold in
   parliamentary systems, and in other contexts where the legislature
   influences cabinet inclusion.},

Abstract = {Often considered in connection to evolutionism and sometimes accused of
   maintaining neocolonial domination, the field of studies on modernity
   and the processes of modernization has been progressively discredited in
   the social sciences over the last forty years. However, for some time
   now, a number of historians and sociologists have sought to reinvest
   this field on new bases. Rejecting both the miserabilist and populist
   approaches that have held modernity in their grip for too long, their
   work outlines a research program, whose consistency and main arguments
   are brought out by this article. We show that this program proposes a
   properly methodological definition of modernity-as the present of
   humanity-and imposes on researchers four major shifts: the refusal of
   stato-centrism; an attention to the practical foundations of different
   conceptions of ``modernity{''}; an adherence to the principle of
   contemporaneity; and finally, situating the generalizing ambition of
   social sciences within a rigorous search of processual analogies.},

Abstract = {In Winnipeg there is a bridge over the railroad tracks. Those tracks are
   a dividing line between the North and South Ends of the City:
   historically they were a dividing line between rich and poor, between
   settlers, and Aboriginals and immigrants. At the foot of the bridge was
   a car repair shop famous for the writing on its roof visible as you
   crossed the bridge heading North. The sign read: ``Welcome to the North
   End People Before Profit.{''} Growing up in the North End, heading home
   from downtown, I saw the sign so often that I almost stopped seeing it.
   Now that it is gone, I see it better. I still cross that bridge often,
   even though I no longer live North. I cross it more often lately to work
   on the Healing Forest Project.},

   content started immediately upon its adoption in December 1948. This
   article is an exploration into how an early UNESCO initiative for what
   later was termed human rights education was central to dissemination
   efforts in Norway in the years 1948 to 1952. An underlying argument is
   that by shifting the scale of observation from the international level
   and onto the individual, we can gain new insights into early efforts to
   spread knowledge about human rights during the early Cold War. Based on
   archival material and open sources, it provides a glance into a rather
   understudied field of research for historians.},

Abstract = {Following the Gulf oil spill and US housing meltdown, policy-makers
   revamped the associated administrative infrastructure in an effort to
   sharpen each agency's focus, based on the perspective that asking an
   organization to fulfill competing missions undermines performance. Using
   a formal model, I demonstrate that priority goal ambiguity introduced
   when an agency balances multiple roles does have detrimental effects.
   Yet, assigning competing missions to one organization can be better than
   separating them, as the underlying tasks supporting the goals may
   require coordination. In fact, it is precisely when ambiguity becomes
   more debilitating that the importance of coordination intensifies.
   Moreover, if the bureau is misinformed about which goals are more valued
   politically, fostering uncertainty in agencies charged with multiple
   goals can even be beneficial. The article thus describes how such
   organizations function and why these arrangements persist, demonstrating
   that structural choices impact behavior even when agencies and overseers
   agree on policy objectives.},

Abstract = {This article analyses the case of the Barcelona Anti-Rumour Network, an
   initiative promoted by the City Council and social organizations, in
   order to deal with the uncontrolled proliferation of rumours, prejudices
   and stereotypes about immigration. Rumours convey false information with
   the aim of exploiting the fears of citizens often disconcerted in the
   face of the changes brought about the arrival of a considerable number
   of foreign immigrants. The article analyses, through policy analysis and
   in-depth interviews, the role of communication in immigration policies
   and the concept of citizenship that exists behind this strategy. Such
   policies can run the risk of focusing too much on the denial of rumours
   rather than on the affirmation of rights, as this may question the
   eligibility of the immigrant population to obtain the status of
   citizenship.},

Pages = {208-223},
Abstract = {Islamic renewal is having a considerable impact on politics and society
   in Indonesia. This article discusses the way in which Islamic movements
   shape the nature and interpretation of citizenship by focusing on Wahdah
   Islamiyah, a Salafi organisation with over 120 branches nationwide. By
   examining how Wahdah Islamiyah promotes an idea of citizenship amongst
   followers and the community, it seeks to show how Islamic and national
   identities can overlap. Wahdah Islamiyah does not see Indonesian
   nationalism as anathema to adherence to strict Islamic faith; instead
   they have been actively synthesising Islamic identity with national
   pride, often using the secular' terminology of state, citizenship and
   security to do so. Yet, Wahdah Islamiyah's interpretation of citizenship
   differentiates between Muslim and non-Muslim Indonesians. They
   inevitably aim to foreground the position of Sunni Muslims by calling on
   the state and civil society to regulate public spaces to free them from
   non-Muslim elements.},

Abstract = {The wave of strikes in the logistics sector since 2008 is by far the
   most important struggle that has developed in Italy in the wake of the
   global economic crisis. In this article we reflect on its potential for
   the renewal of the labour movement. We ground our discussion in an
   analysis of global production transformations and migration as a factor
   of working class re-composition. We show that in Italy the crisis is
   determining an acute process of deindustrialisation, while austerity and
   harshening immigration restrictions are reinforcing the deregulation and
   racialisation of employment relation. Deindustrialisation, however, is
   matched by the growth of the logistics sector and its reorganisation
   along the lines of Just-in-Time production, which actually strengthens
   workers' bargaining power at the point of production. After describing
   working conditions in the sector, we present the main characteristics of
   logistics struggles. The mainly immigrant logistics workers have been
   able to exercise their power through blockades and strikes, obtaining
   improved agreements with some of the main logistics companies. In a
   context of increasingly generalised precarity, these struggles can
   inspire workers in other sectors and promote a process of international
   class re-composition.},

Abstract = {According to Jean Arthuis, Brexit is a chance for Europe. It casts a
   cruel light on the institutional fragility of the European Union, whose
   functioning is hardly defensible to public opinion. Beyond the EU's
   significant achievementspeace on the Continent, freedom of movement, the
   single market, the eurothe deficits in democracy and governance are
   enormous. The time has come to identify the public goods that EU Member
   States can effectively assume at the national level, on the one hand,
   and those that must now be collectively supported within the Union, on
   the other. More than ever, Europeans need public goods, some of which
   can be made available to them only by Europe. A Europe with sovereign
   powers (money, economy and finance, diplomacy, armed defense, digital,
   energy, etc.) that is governed accordingly so as to boost its economy,
   ensure full employment, control migratory flows, combat terrorism,
   ensure security, and fight against tax fraud. A Europe that speaks to
   Europeans. This is why Brexit gives Europe a chance to set itself the
   goal of becoming a world power. After all, the United States of America
   was born of a divorce from the English crown; let us hope that our
   English friends will repeat the feat and that Brexit will be the
   catalyst of a United States of Europe. According to Henry Farrell, for
   decades, the European Union has sought to increase its democratic
   legitimacy in the eyes of citizens, by making good policy, by enhancing
   the powers of the European Parliament, and by providing greater power to
   national parliaments. None of this has worked particularly well, and
   some measures have had the perverse consequence of enabling populist
   nationalists like Britain's UK Independence Party. The European Union
   would be better served by accepting the inevitability of political
   disagreement, and indeed harnessing it, by providing individuals with
   the real opportunity to vote on which kind of Europe they wanted. The
   lessons of Ernest Gellner and other scholars are that legitimacy is an
   effect rather than a cause, and that structured contention provides the
   best means towards stability and effectiveness.},

Journal = {POLITICS GROUPS AND IDENTITIES},

Volume = {6},
Number = {2},
Pages = {181-198},
Abstract = {Recent research in political science has demonstrated the effects of
   implicit racism on whites' political preferences and judgments. One
   startling finding from this research is that even white people who think
   of themselves as racially egalitarian can be influenced by implicit
   racism without intention or awareness. While this research has been
   useful for identifying the ways in which whites' unconscious biases
   influence political decision-making, it leaves open the questions of how
   and why unconscious, yet racially motivated political cognition takes
   place. In this paper, I offer a theoretical model of white racial
   reasoning, during which whites think through their racial identity,
   interpreting and evaluating phenomena in the social environment in ways
   that allow them to protect a positive sense of self and racial group. I
   argue that well-meaning whites' identity investments, and not antipathy
   toward outgroup members, drives cognitive processing and the political
   judgments that result. I conclude the paper with research-based
   strategies for political actors hoping to help whites resist racially
   coded appeals and encourage more egalitarian political judgments.},

Abstract = {During the 20th century until today the world spend, as primary
   energetic resources (with priority), fossil fuels such as oil, coal and
   natural gas. However, the effects on the environment which led to
   climatic change, have been generated a growing tendency to replace such
   forms of energy with cleaner ones like wind, solar and geothermal
   energy. Yet many people plan radical actions which implies a drastic
   reduction of energy consumption, in order to avoid a massive global
   catastrophe. This process has been denominated ``energetic
   transition{''} and it's developed almost in every part of the ``first
   world{''} contries. This article analyzes the situation within the
   Colombian energetic matrix and the country's policies to face this
   transition process towards clean energies.},

Abstract = {In the intellectual tradition of Europe, there is the core of the desire
   to be recognized as a human being in an idea of dignity, freedom and
   moral will, supported by the power of human reason. The abovementioned
   characteristics limit and at the same time allow the reflection of
   steady conceptual structures in the evolution of liberalism. The present
   study deals with the civilization trajectory of human reality in the
   evolution of liberalism, where the individualistic ethos constantly
   oscillates about the attempts to accept social, moral and collective
   identity transcending the individual dimension of existence. From our
   point of view, the perspective of awareness of ambiguity and paradoxical
   content of individual parameters of liberalism, is a mirror image of how
   those conditions differ from the standard assumptions formulated in
   theory.},

Journal = {CRITICAL REVIEW},

Volume = {30},
Number = {3-4},
Pages = {219-255},
Abstract = {The normative and metanormative pluralism that figure among core
   self-descriptions of democratic theory, which seem incompatible with
   democratic theorists' practical ambitions, may stem from the internal
   logic of research traditions in the social sciences and humanities and
   from the conceptual structure of political theory itself. One way to
   deal productively with intradisciplinary diversity is to appeal to the
   idea of a meta-consensus; another is to appeal to the argument from
   cognitive diversity that fuels recent work on epistemic democracy. For
   different reasons, both strategies fail, such that a metatheoretical
   step-aside may be desirable, one that entails modeling democratic theory
   after the public justification approach.},

Journal = {STUDIES IN SOCIAL JUSTICE},

Abstract = {This article draws from a case study exploring the link between girls'
   citizenship education and identity-based violence. The research was
   conducted in a girls' government secondary school in Islamabad,
   Pakistan. The data was collected through participant observation,
   qualitative interviews and a participatory workshop with 23 school staff
   as well as focus groups with 33 students. The focus of this paper is on
   how school practice - the day-to-day activities that happen in and out
   of the classroom - reproduces a gendered and classed notion of
   citizenship. Drawing on Gahung's (1969; 1990) violence triangle, I then
   link the findings to the implications for violence against women.
   The findings indicate that for the urban middle-class girls of the case
   study school, citizenship is entwined with historical constructions of
   nationalist and religious notions of womanhood. Citizenship education
   teaches girls that their duty to the state is located in the private
   sphere of the home, as mothers and wives, while excluding them from the
   rights associated with citizenship that are located in the male
   dominated public sphere. These notions of unequal citizenship were
   evident in the responses from both teachers and students about the roles
   of women in creating a more peaceful Pakistan. Most of the teachers (all
   of whom are women) and students indicated that they had limited agency
   to affect change outside of an ability to influence their children and
   husbands. I argue that citizenship education in this school serves as a
   form of gendered cultural violence as it discourages girls from
   affecting change on the social structures that disempower them.},

Abstract = {A decade ago, Hungary's domestic economy was mired in deep crisis. The
   country was on the brink of insolvency. However, the gross national
   product has been growing for years, and other indicators are also
   showing a positive development. However, the comparison with Poland and
   the Czech Republic shows, that Hungary is mainly benefiting from the
   strong development in the global economy. The country is also profiting
   from EU funding. At the same time, structural weaknesses have not been
   overcome and state debt remains high, making the country susceptible to
   crises. The unpredictable nature of the government is damaging the
   investment climate, and Hungary is becoming less competitive.},

Journal = {CITIZENSHIP STUDIES},

Pages = {705-724},
Abstract = {This article sheds light on what citizenship means for individuals'
   experiences of belonging. Through 41 interviews conducted in Oslo,
   Norway, we trace understandings of how, when and why citizenship matters
   (or not) for belonging. Our interviewees fall into one of four
   categories: born citizens; naturalized citizens; dual citizens and
   non-Norwegian citizens who would qualify for naturalization, thus mixing
   participants with and without immigrant backgrounds. We interpret
   individuals' experiences evaluating whether formal citizenship is
   explicitly or implicitly salient and whether it is associated with
   secure or insecure belonging. We find that citizenship matters for
   security and recognition, both linked to belonging, in expected and
   unexpected ways. Our findings point to how, when and why citizenship
   matters (or not) for belonging, constituting the citizenship-belonging
   nexus. Here, race continues to matter, as does the materiality of the
   passport document, in how the citizenship-belonging nexus interacts with
   the nation as locus of membership for citizens.},

Abstract = {Challenging conventional wisdom, previous research in South Asia and the
   Middle East has shown that poverty and exposure to violence are
   negatively correlated with support for militant organizations. Existing
   studies, however, provide evidence consistent with two potential
   mechanisms underlying these relationships: (1) the direct effects of
   poverty and violence on attitudes toward militant groups and (2) the
   psychological effects of perceptions of poverty and violence on
   attitudes. Isolating whether the psychological mechanism is an important
   one is critical for building theories of mass responses to political
   violence. We conducted a series of original, large-scale survey
   experiments in Pakistan (n=16,279) in which we randomly manipulated
   perceptions of both poverty and violence before measuring support for
   militant organizations. We find evidence that psychological perceptions
   do in part explain why the poor seem to be less supportive of militant
   political groups.},

Abstract = {The existing literature on ideological congruence has typically looked
   at congruence immediately after elections when governments are formed.
   This article goes beyond that comparative static approach by examining
   changes in citizen-government ideological congruence between two fixed
   points in time, namely at the beginning and end of government mandates.
   Building on a veto player approach and dynamics of party competition
   under majoritarian and proportional representation (PR) electoral
   systems, the results indicate, first, that government positions are more
   stable in between elections, as the number of parties and their
   ideological distance increase in cabinet. Second, it appears that
   single-party and homogeneous coalition governments decrease ideological
   congruence between elections under low levels of polarisation, while
   they increase congruence under very high levels of polarisation. Third,
   it was found that governments under majoritarian systems slightly
   decrease congruence between elections while congruence stays stable on
   average under PR systems. The different levels of party system
   polarisation across majoritarian and PR electoral systems mostly explain
   this difference.},

Pages = {156-169},
Abstract = {The article focuses on the specifics of the origin and stages of
   development of the institution of electoral commissions as the most
   common bodies of electoral management.
   The author critically analyzes the range of the meanings of the term
   ``electoral commission{''} and formulates his own definition -
   independent collegial bodies responsible for holding elections. Such a
   definition allows him to capture the essential characteristics of an
   institution, as well as to clarify the spatial and chronological
   boundaries of its origin. On the basis of the set of historical sources
   published in recent years, he shows that the first central electoral
   commissions appeared in the last quarter of the 19th century (in
   Colombia and Peru), which is more than half a century earlier of what
   the conventional wisdom holds.
   Electoral commissions have long been associated primarily with the
   developing countries. However, since the end of the 20th century they
   began to spread rapidly in the developed democracies. Today, this
   institution is in high demand in the countries with very different
   political regimes and levels of centralization of the electoral
   management. According to the author's conclusion, the potential of
   electoral commissions is far from exhausted. It is highly plausible that
   the institution of independent collegial bodies of electoral management,
   while retaining its basic features, will continue to evolve, and its
   certain modifications will play an important role in the electoral
   management system.},

Abstract = {Scotland's media has traditionally provided one of the central aspects
   of Scottish distinctiveness, autonomy and identity. This has often
   historically been viewed unproblematically and uncritically, but in
   recent times, the selective discourses of the mainstream media have come
   under increasing scrutiny and challenge, particularly in the recent
   independence referendum. This article examines the changing output of
   BBC and STV, considering in detail the evening news and current affairs
   programmes of both channels, and charting how they have evolved in media
   content and output. It also examines wider output and representation by
   BBC and STV, and concludes by addressing the evolving political and
   media environment.},

Journal = {WEST EUROPEAN POLITICS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {41},

Pages = {448-471},
Abstract = {Existing studies on electoral turnout in times of economic crisis have
   predominantly focused on disadvantaged voters. However, during the
   recent economic crisis, turnout among highly educated citizens has
   strongly declined as well. Existing resource-based theories of political
   participation cannot account for this. This article suggests that the
   anticipation of government inefficacy is an important driver of
   abstention among highly educated. Where governments are severely
   constrained, these citizens anticipate that the hands of future
   governments will be tied. Hence they are more likely to abstain out of
   frustration or rational calculations. The study uses the recent economic
   crisis as test case, as it entails particularly acute constraints on
   several European governments. The cross-sectional and longitudinal
   evidence - based on ESS survey data and different measures of government
   constraint in 28 European countries - provides ample support for the
   argument.},

Title = {Does ethnic voting harm democracy?},
Journal = {DEMOCRATIZATION},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {25},

Pages = {824-842},
Abstract = {A large literature argues that ethnic voting is detrimental to
   democracy. Ethnic voting may have at least three effects: (1) it can
   reduce uncertainty over electoral results; (2) it may increase the
   winner-take-all character of elections; and (3) it can lead to a process
   of ethnic outbidding. However, few studies have tested the effect of
   ethnic voting on democracy using large-N quantitative analysis. Previous
   tests instead look at whether ethnic fractionalization hinders
   democracy. Yet, ethnic diversity does not necessarily lead to the
   politicization of ethnicity, and it is only when ethnicity is activated
   as a vehicle of political mobilization that it can destabilize
   democracy. This article tests the effect of ethnic voting in 58
   democracies worldwide between 1992 and 2015. On balance, the evidence
   suggests that democracies with high ethnic voting levels tend to see the
   quality of their democracy reduce over time relative to those with less
   ethnic voting. Ethnic and religious fractionalization, however, have
   little effect.},

Abstract = {This article focuses on the arrangements and interactions between
   political and social positions of universal standards and those with a
   conservative character referring to religion. In other words, our
   concern is to dwell on the manifestation of impact, on the dynamics of
   gender in Morocco, the confrontation between politico-social
   institutions referring to religion and those believing in universal
   principles. Proponents of the secularist view practically conceive of
   local development far from any discrimination based on social gender.
   They are thus more open to the public space and to universal values than
   their Islamist adversaries generally chained by a sometimes radical
   conservative representation of religious texts. Indeed, social
   representations, the interpretation of religion, the social imaginary
   without forgetting the power relations, all this contributed well,
   within a patriarchal system, to a hierarchy of social relations while
   determining roles and precise statutes for men and women. A historical
   approach stopping on some stations of the struggle of the Moroccan
   feminist movement since independence, especially around the issue of
   legal status and the family code, will certainly inform us about the new
   situation of women's rights and the challenges envisioned by the wakes
   of the patriarchal system. In the same way, the descriptive analytical
   approach appears indispensable in these conditions.},

Abstract = {Do public officials respond unequally to requests for career advice?
   Through a correspondence experiment with 8,189 officials, we examine
   whether (hypothetical) male and female students who express interest in
   political careers receive differential responses from public officials.
   We report three striking findings. First, emails sent by female students
   were more likely to receive a response than those sent by male students,
   especially when the official was male. Second, the responses that women
   received were as likely to be long, thoughtful, and contain an offer of
   help as those to men. Third, there were no partisan differences in
   responsiveness to male or female senders. Examining senders with
   Hispanic last names bolsters the results: Hispanic senders, especially
   men, were less likely to receive a quality response than non-Hispanic
   senders. Thus, politicians may condition responsiveness and helpfulness
   on the ethnicity of constituents, but women who are self-starters in
   search of advice receive equal treatment.},

Abstract = {A key part of the ecomodern discourse of a `Good Anthropocene' is the
   vision of a `high-energy planet' characterized by universal access to
   modern energy. Recognizing the crucial historical role that rising
   energy consumption has played in driving social transformations,
   ecomodernists imagine a future with substantial global equality of
   opportunity powered by clean and abundant energy. Whereas traditional
   environmental thinking has advocated land-intensive distributed forms of
   renewable energy, ecomodernists have argued that such technologies are
   fundamentally incompatible with a world in which 7-10 billion people can
   live modern lives. Instead, ecomodernists believe that only breakthrough
   innovation can overcome the current political and cultural polarization
   surrounding climate change and provide a unifying pathway towards
   climate stability. Yet, resurging populism and nationalism, but also the
   statist frame of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate
   Change process, make such a future unlikely as rich countries remain
   focused on meeting their own domestic emissions targets rather than
   decarbonizing the global economy as a whole. As a consequence, overall
   political polarization is bound to increase as radical environmental
   voices will call for ever harsher demand-side reductions while
   technocratic elites may come to see solar radiation management as the
   only feasible way of preventing an irreversible destabilization of the
   climate system.},

Journal = {REGIONAL AND FEDERAL STUDIES},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {28},
Number = {5},
Pages = {617-644},
Abstract = {This article takes up recent work on path dependence and dynamism in
   federal systems. It argues that historical institutionalist suppositions
   derived from tightly coupled federations cannot be extended to loosely
   coupled federal systems, as are found in Latin America. Loose coupling
   means that interaction between actors and state levels is contentious
   and informal. Loosely coupled federations are less prone to path
   dependence and exhibit a strong propensity to institutional dynamics,
   especially after decentralization. In this article, the focus is on the
   relationship between party system and federal structure to show how the
   interaction between both components in the context of loose coupling can
   lead to swift shifts towards centralization or decentralization. By
   examining two cases, Argentina and Venezuela, the relevant mechanisms of
   institutional interaction are carved out and the resulting dynamics are
   reconstructed.},

Abstract = {After a century of confrontation with Zionist settler colonialism, the
   triumph of capitalism and unfettered marketization without justice and
   national rights for Palestine appears an irresistible and assured
   process. The Palestinian ruling class and Arab, international, and
   Israeli forces have sustained belief in a peace process that for a
   generation has persuaded or coerced Palestinians living in exile and
   within Israeli colonial dominion to delay or abandon the collective
   national goals of liberation, independence, and return. The market
   promises but can hardly deliver individual prosperity, quality services,
   and civic rights. But in the standoff between the interests of nation
   and of class, material conditions are being created for a generation of
   Palestinian liberation that may challenge settler-colonial exclusion and
   domination. A redefined notion of liberation would demand the people's
   systematically denied social, economic, and political rights, which the
   people's own political and economic leadership cannot indefinitely
   subordinate to a lost national struggle.},

Abstract = {Korea is a country with strict anticorruption legislation. However, this
   cannot the only guarantee for the eradication of various types of
   corruption. Analyzing retrospectively the reasons for its functioning
   and its combating in the Republic of Korea, there is a traditional
   system of social organization that in many ways provokes corruption. In
   different periods the presidents of Korea engaged in ``personnel
   cleansing{''} in the civil service and conducted a strict
   anti-corruption policy. However, each of the heads of Korea was a victim
   of corruption scandals, although South Korean society is one of the most
   respectable and decent societies in the world. The use of harsh measures
   in this area makes it possible to identify the facts of participation in
   the corruption schemes of former and current assistants to the head of
   state, deputies from the ruling and opposition parties, representatives
   of business structures. As a result, the anti-corruption measures of the
   Korean government have a positive impact on the country's international
   image.},

Title = {Bring back the party: personalisation, the media and coalition politics},
Journal = {WEST EUROPEAN POLITICS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {41},
Number = {2},
Pages = {472-495},
Abstract = {What effect, if any, does a change in type of government have on the
   degree of media personalisation? This article argues that the different
   incentives that single- and multi-party governments provide to
   individual politicians and parties affect the level of media
   personalisation. Where the parties are more involved (i.e. multi-party
   coalitions) there will be less media personalisation. In contrast, where
   a single individual can command the party, there will be more media
   personalisation. The article tests these assumptions with a novel
   dataset created from over 1 million newspaper articles covering a
   continuous 24-year period in the UK. It finds that the switch to a
   coalition government in 2010 indeed changed the dynamics of media
   personalisation. These findings not only provide key insights into the
   phenomenon of personalisation but also enable us to better understand
   some of the potential consequences of changes in government types for
   power dynamics and democratic accountability.},

   broadly stimulated a competition of narratives regarding the capacity of
   loyalism and its contributions to a post-conflict social setting. The
   impact of satire on marginalised groups creates new spaces for those
   groups to offer alternative perspectives and to resist negative
   stereotyping from without. In response to the ritual derision which
   loyalists faced following the flag protests, some engaged in the
   production of grassroots media which attempted to transform the
   recognition relations of the group. In examining the relationships
   between groups in contested societies, particularly those emerging from
   conflict, theories of respect and esteem offer innovate insights into
   the role of status and social equality. The deliberative and moral
   capacities of `others' can be undermined in processes of stereotyping
   and intra-group esteem generation is a counter to such slights.},

Abstract = {This paper engages with Mudimbe's concept of the colonial library' with
   the aim of using this engagement to contribute to current debates about
   decolonising South African university curricula. The term colonial
   library' refers to the body of texts and epistemological order which
   construct Africa as a symbol of otherness and inferiority. Mudimbe shows
   that even the most determined attempts to resist the colonial library
   draw on this same epistemological order. This presents a profound
   challenge for attempts to decolonise university curricula as it suggests
   that the colonial library's reach extends into attempts to dismantle it.
   In response to this challenge, I discuss ways in which we can oppose
   epistemological ethnocentrism and argue that we need to be open to the
   possibility of the emancipatory reappropriation of aspects of the
   colonial library. The paper concludes by relating the foregoing
   discussion to the South African political studies classroom.},

Title = {Measuring subnational democracy: toward improved regime typologies and

Journal = {DEMOCRATIZATION},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {25},
Number = {1},
Pages = {19-37},
Abstract = {Social scientists have been limited in their work by the paucity of
   global time series data about subnational institutions and practices.
   Such data could help scholars refine regime typologies, improve theories
   of democratization and regime change, better understand subnational
   democracy, and illuminate issues of development, conflict, and
   governance. This article addresses the lack of data by introducing 22
   subnational measures from a new dataset, Varieties of Democracy.
   Validity tests demonstrate that the measures' strengths outweigh their
   weaknesses. The measures excel in covering all subnational levels for
   most countries, capturing different elements of subnational elections,
   and including a variety of dimensions of elections and civil liberties.
   The measures also offer unmatched global and temporal coverage. The
   article demonstrates how these strengths can provide scholars with the
   benefits described above.},

Abstract = {The article analyzes the contribution of populism, as a phenomenon of
   public sentiments, to the dynamics of the recent constitutional
   transformations in Eastern Europe, post-Soviet space and Russia. The
   research shows that in all countries from the above mentioned regions
   populism gave impetus to the processes of constitutional
   retraditionalization, which affected different areas such as
   international and national law, constitutional identity, sovereignty,
   forms of government, and constitutional justice.
   Everywhere the mechanisms of constitutional retraditionalization invoked
   by populism are associated with the denial of the principles of
   ideological pluralism and political neutrality of constitutional
   justice. However, the methods used in different countries vary
   considerably and cover the entire gamut of technologies of
   constitutional revision, ranging from the ``conservative revolution{''}
   through convoking a constituent assembly or holding a national
   referendum to changing preambles of constitutions, introducing
   constitutional amendments, judicial interpretation, as well as a wide
   range of extra-constitutional mechanisms. The choice of a particular
   technology or a combination of technologies is determined by the level
   of public support for populist forces and the degree of their control
   over government institutions.
   Populism in Eastern Europe, post-Soviet space and Russia performs
   different functions. In the first case populism represents a way of
   accumulating protest against imperfect institutions; in the second case
   populism is a form of a struggle for establishing rules of the game; in
   the third case populism performs a function of mobilizing support for
   the current political regime, or a means of legitimizing it. In Eastern
   Europe constitutional populism serves as an instrument for achieving
   power, in the post-Soviet region - for its redistribution, and in Russia
   - for its preservation. On the basis of these differences, the author
   identifies three versions of constitutional populism - ``democratic{''}
   (Eastern Europe), ``oligarchic{''} (post-Soviet region), and
   ``plebiscite{''}, controlled and directed by power holders themselves
   (Russia).},

Abstract = {Christopher Achen and Larry Bartels's Democracy for Realists makes a
   persuasive case that standard theories of democracy rest on shaky
   empirical ground, and that optimistically interpreted empirical findings
   about public competence do not save the day. However, I argue that the
   solution does not lie with theories of elite competition or
   accountability to other institutions. Instead, I turn to theories of
   symbolic politics. These theories capture the empirical reality of how
   voters engage with politics and make decisions. While they tend to
   emphasize human irrationality, they also contain the potential for a
   symbolic kind of rationality that could provide a solid foundation for
   democratic politics.},

Abstract = {The objective of this article is to analyze the international power of
   Argentina through the foreign policy of kirchneristas governments
   (2003-2015) by focusing on the concepts of autonomy and influence. The
   study was done by considering, on the one hand, the bilateral relations
   of Argentina with Brazil, China and the United States. and on the other
   its participation in the summits of the G-20 and deal with crises
   institutional and diplomatic of Latin American countries. It notes that
   the above-mentioned governments look independence of decision-making and
   tended to adapt the country to the constraints of international
   dynamics. However, the analysis suggests that foreign policy actions do
   not materialize the sustained autonomy from the rhetoric building power
   for cutting units, nor deployed influence through persuasion for power
   projection.},

Abstract = {Since the establishment of the independent Slovak Republic, the share of
   the armed forces in the fulfillment of the tasks of the national crisis
   management has been permanently changed and re-evaluated. Focusing the
   attention of the top management of the Ministry of Defense only on the
   issue of defending against the external environment caused the problem
   by what forces and means to replace the departments that had been
   designated for the protection of the population. The allocation of a
   share of the forces and resources of almost all units of the armed
   forces in their current geographical deployment has not been and is not
   a relevant solution in relation to the current security challenges. In
   the present study, the Department of Defense proposed a reorganization
   and redisposal of selected forces of the armed forces that have a major
   impact on national crisis management operations. The effectiveness of
   the participation of the armed forces in the structure of the Integrated
   Rescue System of the Slovak Republic was examined in its quantitative
   and qualitative scope. The results of the analyzes confirm that under
   the conditions of the Ministry of Defense it is necessary to take
   fundamental measures in the dislocation of the units and facilities
   depending on the location of the potential threats and risks for the
   population. In the study, the share of the armed forces in national
   crisis management operations is based on a proposal to effectively
   deploy only a portion of the force and resources of the Ministry of
   Defense, and other departments and facilities allow it to concentrate
   fully on defense against military threats from the external environment
   of the state. By implementing the dislocation changes of selected units
   of the armed forces, according to the present proposal, the efficiency
   and effectiveness of not only the armed forces itself but also of the
   integrated rescue system as a whole is greatly enhanced.},

Pages = {236-246},
Abstract = {Within his own lifetime, Mussolini did everything in his power to cast
   so long a shadow over the memory of the Italian people that he could not
   fail to become an imaginary figure. He himself foresaw that his destiny
   would not end with his death. The vicissitudes suffered by his remains
   only served to confirm his prediction. The incoherencies and
   contradictions surrounding his death, which occurred on 28 April 1945,
   have subsequently fuelled an uninterrupted narrative which has become an
   integral part of his personal myth. The exact circumstances of his
   death, the ordeal of having his corpse publicly displayed in the
   piazzale Loreto in Milan, followed by the spiriting away of his remains
   from the city's Musocco cemetery by young neo-fascists, all helped
   facilitate his political resurrection.},

Number = {6},
Pages = {83+},
Abstract = {At the end of 2017, the Lithuanian general public was rocked by a fierce
   debate, which was triggered after claims were made by the publicist Rata
   Vanagaite that the partisan leader Adolfas Ramanauskas had been involved
   in the murder of Lithuanian Jews and had later worked for the Soviet
   secret service. These claims proved to be untenable, yet the intensity
   of the discussions surrounding the issue is indicative of how strongly
   the partisan fight is anchored in the national myth. Anyone who casts
   doubt on this myth is perceived to be attacking the heroic Lithuanian
   self-image of a nation fighting for its freedom.},

Abstract = {Svetlana Alexievich is sometimes linked to oral history. However, her
   work not only belongs to this discipline. It is as a writer that
   Alexievich processes and presents the interviews she has conducted.
   However, as is the case with oral history, she gives a voice to those
   individuals whose experiences are not included in the official
   historical narratives. Alexievich's work offers numerous impulses for
   historical studies and the humanities to examine aspects of socialist
   and post-socialist society that have otherwise been neglected. These
   include the handling of the consequences of the Stalinist terror and how
   people experienced the radical changes in the late 1980s and early
   1990s, which frequently led to losses on a material and psychological
   level.},

Abstract = {This study considers the social media visual messaging of four
   candidates in the 2012 U.S. Republican presidential primary campaign.
   The analysis is guided by symbolic convergence theory, its method of
   fantasy theme analysis, and visual rhetoric theory. Using a schema of
   visual attributes, this study analyzes a rhetorical strategy of
   candidates' campaigns: the pictorial ``public diary'' found on their
   official Facebook and Twitter pages. It reveals how the credibility
   character traits of trustworthiness and expertise appear in the
   candidates' visual narratives, what messages dominate, and how
   candidates differ in succeeding or failing to visually communicate
   credibility. This study has important implications for how political
   management can use images in crafting and assessing messaging strategies
   in a competitive environment.},

Abstract = {This article explores the intersections of gender, sexuality and
   citizenship in the context of one prominent neo-Pentecostal movement in
   Kenya, the Ministry of Repentance and Holiness (MRH) led by the
   charismatic Prophet David Owuor. Employing the concept of intimate
   citizenship, the article analyses, first, how MRH engages in a
   contestation of intimate citizenship in the contemporary Kenyan public
   sphere, especially in relation to women's bodies. Second, it examines
   how MRH simultaneously configures, through a range of highly intimate
   beliefs, practices and techniques, an alternative form of intimate
   citizenship defined by moral purity and concerned with a political
   project of moral regeneration. Coining the notion of Pentecostal
   intimacies', the article provides insight into the reasons why so many
   people, especially women, are attracted to MRH, and hence it
   interrogates the liberal frame in which intimate citizenship is usually
   conceptualised.},

Abstract = {In the period between the creation and the crisis of the bourgeois
   liberal state, between the French Revolution and World War I, the figure
   of the Poet-Prophet, who accompanied the process of national unification
   with his song and committed to elaborating a shared identity, became
   prominent in Italy. ``Inventing the tradition{''} and constituting a
   patriotic canon (the repository of the Italian past), the poets, who saw
   themselves as lay spiritual guides, voiced collective hopes and
   channeled them into political projects. The mission of poets involved in
   political change, however, contradicted the atemporal universalism of
   ``pure{''} poetry that underlay the classical poetics still followed by
   the major Italian authors of the period -a poetics they also used to
   react against their marginalization in a nascent capitalistic society.},

Title = {Political Unity and the ``Existential Meaning{''} of Conflict. On Carl
   Schmitt's The Concept of the Political (with some remarks on The
   Dreyfus Affair in Hannah Arendt's The Origins of Totalitarianism)},
Journal = {POLITICKA MISAO-CROATIAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {55},
Number = {4},
Pages = {59-72},
Abstract = {The article deals with the conflict as an indispensable element of
   democracy and politics from the perspective of Carl Schmitt's concept of
   the political. According to Schmitt, the specific criterion of the
   political is to be found in the friend-enemy distinction. Denoting the
   utmost degree of association and dissociation, it corresponds to other
   antitheses (good-evil, beautiful-ugly, profitablenon-profitable, etc.),
   but is independent of them and should not be mistaken for them.
   Understood in this way, the political for Schmitt has an existential
   meaning, as it characterizes human life as such and as conflict cannot
   be solved in advance through some general nom or by a neutral third
   party. Although Schmitt's definition seems to limit the proper
   phenomenon of the political to the state - which as political unity
   monopolizes the friend-enemy relationship and excludes enmity from its
   domestic affairs - the author finds in Schmitt's ``secondary concepts of
   the political{''} the possibility to think the conflict as the principle
   of domestic politics as well. This would mean to accept antagonism as
   inevitable and legitimate, without moral or other disqualification of
   the opponent, and to subdue conflict to the rules of political quarrel
   and debate. In the second part of the article, the author discusses
   Schmitt's critique of liberalism. Although at first sight liberalism
   seems to be a negation of the political, in the last instance it not
   only fails to elude the political, but exacerbates and intensifies the
   conflict. By presenting its claims as universal, it disavows its
   adversaries as ``enemies of humanity{''}, falling in this way victim to
   political hypocrisies. In the last part of the article, the author
   considers some similarities between Schmitt's and Hannah Arendt's
   understanding of the political. Despite all differences between them,
   these can be noticed in Arendt's treatment of the Dreyfus Affair in the
   Origins of Totalitarianism, where she makes clear that conflict is not
   only a threat to the ``political entity{''}, but can also be the way in
   which that entity is saved.},

Volume = {90},

Abstract = {The article is devoted to the analysis of the combination of utopian and
   realistic components in the ideology of the European social democracy.
   The author demonstrates that during the 20th century social democracy
   abandoned many utopian ideas and illusions. In the end of the 19th-first
   half of the 20th century the European social democratic parties (except
   for the British Labour Party) utilized Marxism as their dominant
   ideology, in that dogmatized form that it received from F. Engels, K.
   Kautsky and G. Plekhanov, although even at that time a number of
   provisions of Marxist doctrine were called into question by the
   representatives of the revisionist forces led by E. Bernstein. During
   the subsequent de-radicalization, social democrats in fact switched to
   the positions of social reformism. In the 1950s, they abandoned many of
   the Marxist postulates and proclaimed their commitment to ethical
   socialism within mixed economy. In the late 1970s, the fact that the
   Keynesian socio-economic model that they created sailed into the crisis
   aggravated the trend towards de-radicalization of social democratic
   parties, which manifested itself in the strengthening of the pro-market
   wing. The most active processes of ideological modernization unfolded in
   the British Labour Party and the Social Democratic Party of Germany,
   resulting in the emergence of a ``new{''} social democracy (T. Blair's
   ``New Labour{''}, G. Schroder's ``Neue Mitte{''}). However, the 2008
   global financial-economic crisis interrupted the movement of the
   European social democracy towards social liberalism, and in the 2010s
   social democratic parties again largely returned to their traditional
   agenda. According to the author's assessment, the recent ``left turn{''}
   of the social democracy indicates that it is not able to fully switch to
   market pragmatism and still needs ``Utopia-Hope{''}.},

Abstract = {This article reviews the vast literature on Russia's transformation into
   a ``militocracy{''}-a state in which individuals with career experience
   in Russia's various force structures occupy important positions
   throughout the polity and economy-during the reign of former KGB
   lieutenant colonel Vladimir Putin. We show that (1) elite militarization
   has been extensively utilized both to describe and explain core features
   of Russian foreign and domestic policy; and (2) notwithstanding its
   widespread usage, the militocracy framework rests on a rather thin, and
   in some cases flawed, body of empirical research. We close by discussing
   the remaining research agenda on this subject and listing several
   alternative theoretical frameworks to which journalists and policymakers
   arguably should pay equal or greater attention.},

Abstract = {How is the category immigrant background (IB) politically made? Which
   meanings do political actors ascribe to the term IB and to which extent
   do these meanings include both connotations of ethnic, religious and
   cultural otherness and migration-related social and economic
   experiences? This paper deals with the politics of categorization within
   the field of political representation of ethnic minorities. It
   empirically examines the making of the IB category in public discourse
   about candidates for the 2013 Austrian general elections. Our analytical
   framework takes its cue from Rogers Brubaker's category pair, analysis
   and practice, as well as Dvora Yanow's account of categorization. The
   findings indicate that the politics of categorization along IB is
   characterized by a boundary contraction of origin and a gender-specific
   boundary expansion of the IB category to include religion. Regarding the
   discursive filling IB is used to stigmatize candidates as ``the
   others{''}, but also refers to migration-related experiences, thereby
   ``taming{''} othering. Still, the IB category rather appears as a burden
   than as a benefit ascribing cultural difference and signaling ``they are
   not from here{''}.},

Abstract = {This paper investigates whether five English political parties are
   differentiating themselves based on the brand personality they are
   communicating through their websites. The relative brand positions of
   five English political parties are analyzed using Aaker's brand
   personality scale. The text from each party website is analyzed using
   content analysis and a dictionary-based tool. The results are plotted in
   relation to one another on a correspondence analysis map. We find that
   the two main dimensions on which parties' brand personalities differ
   relate to the trade-offs between communicating competence and
   communicating sincerity and between communicating sophistication and
   communicating ruggedness. We find that parties' brand personalities are
   distinctive, with the exception of the Green Party, and that the
   position of one party, the United Kingdom Independence Party, is
   particularly distinctive. Our research uses Aaker's existing framework
   for thinking about brand personalities, rather than creating a new
   framework for politics. By using an existing framework, we are able to
   use tools developed in other disciplines and show their usefulness for
   the study of political marketing.},

   AND SECURITY},
Series = {Reform and Transition in the Mediterranean},

Pages = {1-12},
Abstract = {The chapter concentrates on the organized hypocrisy of domestic
   sovereignty by analyzing different shapes and formats of areas of
   limited statehood (ALS) in post-2011 Tunisia, both on a geographical and
   functional or sectoral level. In ALS, the capacity to implement and
   enforce central decisions is lacking and there is no monopoly on the use
   of force (Risse, T. Governance Without a State? Policies and Politics in
   Areas of Limited Statehood. New York: Columbia University Press, 2013).
   The restriction of statehood can be sectoral (only in some policy
   areas), territorial (only on some parts of the territory), temporal
   (only for a certain amount of time), and social (only with regard to
   specific parts of the population). By `organised hypocrisy', Krasner
   (Sovereignty: Organized Hypocrisy. Princeton: Princeton University
   Press, 1999) and Lipson (European Journal of International Relations,
   13(1), 5-34, 2007) refer to the inconsistency between rhetoric and
   action resulting from conflicting material and ideational pressures, in
   particular those derived from the clash between the logic of
   consequences and the logic of appropriateness. This chapter aims to set
   the stage for a dynamic reading of post-revolutionary state-society
   relations, in the tradition set by Migdal (Strong Societies and Weak
   States: State-Society Relations and State Capabilities in the Third
   World. Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1988) and others of
   overcoming the binary opposition between the state and societal forces
   and look at the state in society. By investigating how, within areas of
   limited statehood, dynamics of hybrid governance emerge and manifest
   themselves, the chapter will attempt at start illustrating the
   contentious and complex, both domestic and external, political dynamics
   observed in the post-2011 Tunisian trajectory.},

Journal = {PROBLEMS OF POST-COMMUNISM},

Volume = {65},

Pages = {253-270},
Abstract = {Analysts have frequently discussed ``cadre rotation{''} in post-Soviet
   Kazakhstan, or the tendency of President Nusaltan Nazarbayev to transfer
   high-level personnel across regions. Some see it as an element of clan
   politics, while others consider it to be an element of center-periphery
   politics. Nearly everyone agrees, though, that it is a mechanism of
   authoritarian rule. Here I argue that cadre rotation has a deeper logic
   and is tied more to state formation than to regime politics. After
   describing cadre rotation in historical context, I offer a comparative
   analysis of its implementation in Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan since 1991
   to highlight divergent processes and outcomes of state formation.},

Abstract = {This article calls attention to some designs in survey experiments that
   give new leverage in hypothesis testing and validation. The premise of
   this review is the modesty of survey experiments-modesty of treatment,
   modesty of scale, modesty of measurement. The focus of this review,
   accordingly, is the compensating virtues of modesty. With respect to
   hypothesis testing, I spotlight (a) cross-category comparisons, (b)
   null-by-design experiments, (c) explication, (d) conjoint designs, and
   (e) sequential factorials. With respect to validation regimes, I discuss
   (a) parallel studies, (b) paired designs, and (c) splicing. Throughout,
   the emphasis is on moving from experiment in the singular to experiments
   in the plural, learning as you go.},

Abstract = {While there is broad consensus that non-governmental organizations
   (NGOs) sometimes succeed in influencing policy making within
   international organizations (IOs), there is much less agreement on the
   factors that make NGO lobbying effective. This article makes two
   contributions to this debate. First, the determinants of influence among
   NGOs active in different IOs, issue areas and policy phases are
   examined. The analysis builds on original survey data of more than 400
   NGOs involved in five different IOs, complemented by elite interviews
   with IO and state officials. Secondly, the article advances a specific
   argument about how the strategic exchange of information and access
   between NGOs and IOs increases NGO influence in IOs. This argument,
   derived from theories of lobbying in American and European politics, is
   contrasted with three alternative explanations of NGO influence,
   privileging material resources, transnational networks and public
   opinion mobilization, and the broader implications of these results for
   research on NGOs in global governance are explored.},

Abstract = {The different pilot projects of Universal Basic Income (UBI) that have
   been implemented all over the world have raised an intense interest in
   Europe, both for the data they gathered and for their theoretical
   implications. This article analyzes the empirical evidence and the
   different models of experimentation that have been at work in UBI
   policies, with the aim to measure to what extent they are capable of
   offering a certain amount of predictability on UBI social impact. In
   order to do it, the intention, design and results obtained from
   different pilot projects and experimental models over time and in
   different countries are thouroughly analysed. In broad terms, we find
   that none of these experiments is capable to furnish evidence that would
   make it possible to anticipate the joint impact of all the variables
   involved in the development of UBI in the long-term and in specific
   contexts. Nevertheless, this same evidence can also be used to unload
   the burden of proof to the detractors of UBI, as empirical analysis does
   not show any sure negative effects, either. In conclusion, it can be
   stated that the heterogeneity of effects brought forward by the
   implementation of UBI should be viewed as an unavoidable reference in
   order to reduce the uncertainty about its impact, and the effort should
   he made to incorporate new relevant variables into the analysis or to
   improve the design of its implementation.},

Abstract = {This article studies the relationship between nationalistic discourse
   and Hungary's `illiberal turn' from the election of Viktor Orban's
   Fidesz party in the 2010 Hungarian elections up until 2015. It begins by
   examining the arguments of authors such as Jeffrey Alexander, Quentin
   Skinner, and Tapio Juntunen in order to establish a theoretical
   framework for how political actors construct and manipulate historical
   myths for their own political purposes. It then goes on to examine how
   Orban specifically uses and constructs narratives surrounding the Treaty
   of Trianon and Miklos Horthy, the interwar leader of Hungary. This
   article argues that in addition to allowing Orban to build a defensive
   shield against criticism from international and domestic actors, these
   interpretations of Hungarian history restore to prominence the
   interwar-era `populist-urbanist' cleavage, and allow Orban to create an
   exclusionary image of Hungarian nationalism. Thus, this serves to
   legitimize Orban and Fidesz, while denying opposition parties from both
   the right and the left the opportunity to stake claims to being true
   representatives of the Hungarian people.},

Abstract = {In times of perception politics, the credibility of electoral candidates
   is a crucial asset in political marketing. This raises the question to
   which political leaders citizens attribute credibility and how political
   credibility is gained and lost through media performance. We analyze and
   compare two contrasting cases during the Dutch parliamentary election
   campaign of 2010. Whereas in this campaign Mark Rutte-leader of the
   liberal party VVD-gained credibility, the credibility of Job Cohen-at
   the time, leader of the social-democratic PvdA-waned substantially. To
   understand this we extend the source credibility approach with a
   dramaturgical approach, and as such we shed light on what happens in the
   dynamic, interactive process between leaders and audiences in which
   credibility is constructed.},

Abstract = {The present reflection refers to the challenges of Ibero-American cities
   in the context of globalization, sustainable development and the 2030
   Agenda. The issue is approached based on the importance of the city for
   Ibero-American societies, how they advance on the path of being
   intelligent, resilient and sustainable, and also what is their behavior
   in the face of the most important environmental problem of this century,
   such as climate change. In the end, a projection on the future scenarios
   for 2030 of these cities is presented. All this reflection is framed in
   the documents and technical reports of the regional and international
   organizations for Latin America, and especially in the report ``LA
   RABIDA{''} on ``Climate change and sustainable development in Latin
   America{''}, the first result of the Observatory of Sustainable

Abstract = {Fraudulent elections can reduce citizen trust in elections and other
   political institutions. But what about the impact of contentious
   elections that resolve successfully, leading to democratizing change? Do
   national movements toward democracy trump individual experiences with
   electoral manipulation? Using public opinion survey data collected
   before and after the 2004 Orange Revolution in Ukraine, we evaluate
   changes in voter confidence in electoral practices, political
   institutions, and democracy. Although national trends show increased
   voter confidence overall, subnational variation suggests pervasive
   partisan differences in opinions about election quality and
   institutional confidence. Remarkably, we find that direct exposure to
   fraud matters far less than anticipated; voters who were personally
   exposed to fraud felt no more or less confident than their co-partisans.
   We show that partisanship and the national electoral context may
   interact in ways that complicate the effects of democratizing elections,
   suggesting important avenues for future research.},

Abstract = {In the time following the 2016 presidential election, much has been
   written about the spread of false information on social media websites.
   Given the potential influence false information has had on American
   politics, it is more important than ever for people to critically
   evaluate the content they view and share on social media. This article
   describes an activity that encourages students to develop evidence based
   arguments and think critically about content shared on social media. In
   the activity, students are asked to generate an internet meme related to
   U.S. politics and write a short essay defending the position they have
   taken in the meme. This article explains how the activity can promote
   critical thinking and includes suggestions for future implementation.},

Title = {From Family Values to Religious Freedom: Conservative Discourse and the
   Politics of Gay Rights},
Journal = {NEW POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {40},
Number = {2},
Pages = {246-263},
Abstract = {On the issue of gay rights, today's social conservatives are more likely
   to describe their opposition as a matter of religious freedom or
   personal conscience as opposed to a belief that gays and lesbians
   represent an existential threat to the traditional family. But how new
   is this contemporary argument, and how different is it from the family
   values politics of the previous era? This article develops what Victoria
   Hattam and Joseph Lowndes call ``associative chains{''} from two
   important moments in anti-gay politics: Anita Bryant's Save Our Children
   campaign and Kim Davis's decision to not issue gay marriage licenses in
   Rowan County, KY. On one level, these moments reveal competing roles of
   the state in the lives of its citizens. Family values politics
   authorized an interventionist state for the protection of children,
   while religious freedom defenders promote a zone of personal conscience
   impervious to the state. On another level, however, these moments reveal
   the mutability of social conservative opposition to gay rights. Calls
   for protecting religious freedom preserve a heterosexism derived from
   antecedent family values politics. The novelty of religious freedom as a
   defense for homophobia obscures a persistent social conservative
   commitment to using the state to enshrine the heteronuclear family.},

Abstract = {This study examines the evolution of the movement for transparency
   towards redressing grievances and holding public servants accountable to
   the people. It explains how three legislations-Right to Information Act
   (RTI, India, 2005), Rajasthan Guaranteed Delivery of Public Services Act
   (RGDPS, 2011) and the Right to Hearing Act (RTH, Rajasthan, 2012)-form
   part of a continuum in the people's struggle for transparency. The
   analysis of the three acts as a continuum is significant because
   together these are gradually changing the administration-centric Indian
   polity into a citizen-centric one. If the RTI Act ensured an informed
   citizenry, the RGDPS Act recognized the government's duty to provide
   public services and the RTH Act guaranteed that the people were heard by
   the government. This right to hearing may be traced back to the Jan
   Sunwai, which was a pivotal forum in the struggle for transparency
   because it functioned as a dialogical space between the people and the
   state, as well as a forum for social auditing and civic engagement. Of
   late however, the Jan Sunwai is being transformed by digital technology.
   This transformation poses the challenge of converting a participatory
   polity alive with people's voices into a transactional state regimented
   by technology.},

Abstract = {Disaffection of youth from politics is a well-documented phenomenon in
   many countries. In this article, we consider whether the social networks
   of young people have the same influence on political engagement as they
   have been found to have for older adults. We use a single dataset to
   test the effects of discussion and disagreement on the political
   engagement of young people (30 and under) and older adults. We find that
   social network discussion has a stronger effect on the engagement of
   young people but that disagreement has no clear differential effect.

Abstract = {This paper critiques the deployment of the term identity politics in
   Canadian political science. Through a critical discourse analysis (CDA)
   of research articles in leading English language academic journals in
   the Canadian social sciences, we examine whose politics are labelled
   identity politics and what intellectual work transpires through this
   label. Identity politics tends to be applied to scholarship that
   foregrounds analyses of ethnicity, race and gender, but with a lack of
   analytical rigour, indicating a degree of conceptual looseness.
   Moreover, the designation identity politics is not neutral; it is often
   mobilized as a rhetorical device to distance authors from scholarship
   that foregrounds analyses of ethnicity, race and gender, and to inscribe
   a materialist/culturalist divide in claims-making. We argue that the
   effect of this demarcation of identity from politics is to control the
   boundaries of political discourse, limiting who and what gains entry
   into the political. This serves to reassert an exclusionary conception
   of Canadian identity. ResumeLe present article critique le deploiement
   du terme << politique identitaire >> en science politique canadienne. Au
   moyen d'une analyse critique du discours (ACD) d'articles de recherche
   publies dans les principales revues universitaires de langue anglaise en
   sciences sociales canadiennes, nous examinons quelles politiques sont
   ainsi etiquetees et le travail intellectuel que cette etiquette laisse
   entrevoir. Une << politique identitaire >> tend a s'appliquer a la
   litterature qui met en avant les analyses de l'ethnicite, de la race et
   des sexospecificites, mais avec un manque de rigueur analytique
   indiquant un degre de laxisme conceptuel. De plus, la designation <<
   politique identitaire >> n'est pas neutre : elle est souvent mobilisee
   comme un dispositif rhetorique pour eloigner les auteurs qui analysent
   l'ethnicite, la race et la sexospecifite, et pour inscrire un clivage
   materialiste/culturaliste dans les revendications formulees. Nous
   soutenons que cette demarcation entre l'identite, d'une part, et les
   politiques, de l'autre, a pour effet de baliser les frontieres du
   discours politique en limitant les acteurs et les facteurs admis dans la
   sphere politique. Cela sert a reaffirmer une conception exclusionnaire
   de l'identite canadienne.},

Abstract = {Talk about a refugee crisis' dominated Germany's political discourse in
   2015/2016. The arrival of hundreds of thousands of foreigners desiring
   protection shaped public and private debates. However, rather than
   taking the term refugee crisis for granted, this article suggests that
   critical experiences in Germany, and responses to them, were shaped by
   the failure of state institutions. In the same year, as further
   austerity measures were imposed on Greece, German citizens questioned
   the state of their own public infrastructure. Following privatisation
   and cuts to social services, national, regional, and local authorities
   lacked the capacity to respond adequately to newcomers' needs. The sight
   of failing state institutions contributed to a sense of crisis.
   Simultaneously, however, the apparent state incapacityparticularly also
   in Berlin, the focus of this articleopened up spaces for emergent civil
   society actors, including minority groups. Muslims organised in
   associations could perform relevance as reliable citizens and raise
   their public profile. Different groups also put forward alternative
   visions of society. At the same time, government support for asylum
   seekers and the greater visibility of actors in a pluralist society
   pushed some conservatives towards a new far-right force: the Alternative
   for Germany party (AfD). The gaps in public administration that were
   revealed in 2015/2016 resulted in social polarisation left and right of
   centrist politics: nationalist conservatives rejected an increasingly
   multicultural country and found a new political home in the AfD, whereas
   left wingers and minority groups challenged austerity and claimed
   greater political representation for their views.},

Abstract = {In the introductory article for this special issue, we argue that
   studying territorial politics through comparative-historical analysis
   (CHA) offers valuable insights in understanding the changing territorial
   distribution of authority in federal, regional, and decentralized
   countries. We point to limitations that have beset the analysis of
   territorial politics and suggest how recent advances in CHA offer a
   promising approach to avoid and overcome existing shortcomings. We also
   demonstrate and illustrate the ways that vertical and horizontal
   dimensions of territorial structures evolve over time, from the moment
   they are created to subsequent episodes of reform. Our aim is to show
   that time has causal relevance in connecting past and present patterns
   of change and continuity, and thus in capturing the formative and
   developmental pathways of changes in territorial authority.},

Abstract = {Moral suasion played an important role in the abolition and temperance
   movements, yet scholarship provides no guidance on how to systematically
   evaluate its place in nineteenth- and early twentieth-century reform
   efforts. Here this is addressed by studying moral suasion's use in
   justifying social and political actions. By using the perspectives of
   prominent groups and leaders in the two movements to illuminate the
   nonpolitical and political motivations behind moral suasion, this
   article displays how its application varied from an end in itself, with
   no political goal, to a political tool, used in various ways to justify
   political reforms. Overall, this article places moral suasion squarely
   amid these two movements, revealing its variegated use by activists and
   how these different uses of it reflect liberal and republican thinking
   in the American polity.},

Abstract = {Teaching normative political theory at university level may require
   teachers to make explicit normative judgements if concrete political
   issues are addressed: The article claims that amajor challenge lies in
   combining these teaching-settings and the moral dilemmas posed by them
   with discursive settings that allow students to form independent
   judgments. To propose asolution for this conflict, the article outlines
   aseminar concept which makes teachers and students exchange roles and
   thereby brings students into aposition in which they are challenged to
   make normative judgements by themselves. Five recommendations aim at
   integrating the proposed concept with more general considerations for

Volume = {9},
Number = {2},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Since the 2009 coup d'etat, Honduras' energy sector has experienced
   radical changes. The Honduran electricity market was liberalized, and
   electricity distribution was granted. The installation of photovoltaic
   projects in the country's electricity grid was stimulated via incentives
   and increased investment in renewable energy projects. Additionally, the
   Energy Secretary was recently created by decree, but the sector still
   suffers from scattered, biased legislation, and institutional weakness.
   An important new issue related mainly to the high investment in
   renewables in isolated areas is the social effect, leading to social
   unrest, because many of the areas where these projects are being carried
   out are inhabited by indigenous communities. Moreover, the effects of
   climate change have not been included in studies on the nation's energy
   policy. This article analyzes the most-relevant factors that should be
   included in an update of Honduras' energy policy, considering a
   post-coup reality. The Long Energy Alternatives Planning software is
   used to model energy scenarios.},

Abstract = {Using archival data of a North Zhejiang village (Taiping), we examine
   two important issues of land reform in China in the early 1950s, namely
   the determinants of class status and the criteria of land
   redistribution. Our analysis based on the bootstrap estimation of the
   ordered logit models and tobit models yields two important findings.
   First, despite the emphasis on preserving the Rich Peasant Economy,
   class status was determined by whether a household had committed
   exploitationspecifically whether it had rented out land to other
   householdsand by the amount of land which a household owned. Second, not
   every household classified as belonging to the underclass benefited from
   land redistribution. In addition to considering the amount of land
   owned, the beneficiaries had to be those who rented in land from only
   the landlords and rich peasants; those who rented land from other social
   classes were unable to benefit. These findings suggest that land reform
   was a complex social process, with the Marxian concept of exploitation
   figured importantly both in class determination and land redistribution.},

Abstract = {One of the most important questions in the study of democratic politics
   centers on how citizens consider issues and candidate positions when
   choosing whom to support in an election. The proximity and directional
   theories make fundamentally different predictions about voter behavior
   and imply different optimal strategies for candidates, but a
   longstanding literature to empirically adjudicate between the theories
   has yielded mixed results. We use a survey experiment to show that the
   way that candidates' issue positions are described can cue citizens to
   choose a candidate that is preferred under the expectations of either
   the proximity or the directional theory. We find that directional voting
   is more likely when the issue scale is understood to represent degrees
   of intensity with which either the liberal or the conservative side of
   the issue is expressed and that proximity voting is more likely when an
   issue scale is understood to be a range of policies.},

Abstract = {How has the global social policy agenda evolved since the global
   economic crisis? To shed light on this question, this article looks at
   the discourses in European Union (EU) social policy. It draws on two
   rival theoretical approaches from the literature on globalisation and
   the welfare state, the efficiency and compensation hypotheses, and links
   these approaches to two fundamental rationales underlying the discourse
   in EU social policy. Based on an analysis of key documents from two Open
   Methods of Coordination (OMCs), the article shows that the logic
   underlying the efficiency hypothesis can be extended to discourses in EU
   social policy. While policy debates in one OMC remained largely
   unchanged, the discourse significantly shifted towards the economic
   rationale during and after the crisis in the other OMC. This suggests
   that the crisis at least partly strengthened the view that social policy
   should be geared towards economic efficiency, growth, and the creation
   of jobs.},

Abstract = {This article examines what McKnight (2018) refers to as ``progressive
   populism{''} and argues that the rise of progressive populism in
   contemporary western democratic societies is directly related to the
   emergence of neoliberal governance regimes and the rise of global
   corporate power. Utilizing insights from both scholarly literature and
   popular commentary it outlines the rising counter assault by global
   corporations and governments since the 1960s to reverse and impede the
   increase of democratic rights for previously marginalized sections of
   many western democratic societies. It is crucial not to dismiss the
   power of global corporations and the rise of neoliberalism at the
   expense of the collective security of societies as just another form of
   elitism attacked by ordinary people. Corporations want freedom from
   democracy by usurping capitalist economic systems. They represent a
   disfiguration of representative democratic principles that culminates in

Abstract = {Drawing on original fieldwork data, this research examines the
   effectiveness of the Party's more open and institutionalized but often
   ignored anticorruption mechanismthe Performance Evaluation System. I
   argue that its effectiveness is a mixed bag: on one hand, three
   prominent features of the current PES show great promise to curb cadre
   corrupt behavioranticorruption work's increasing evaluation weight, its
   newly assigned status of priority targets with veto power, and its
   highly quantified evaluation method; on the other hand, the ability of
   the PES to deter cadre corruption is weakened by challenges that
   constrain the power of its three embedded incentivizing methods.},

Title = {Friends of the Court? Why EU governments file observations before the
   Court of Justice},
Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL RESEARCH},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {57},
Number = {4},
Pages = {867-882},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {The preliminary reference procedure under which the Court of Justice of
   the European Union (CJEU) responds to questions from national courts
   regarding the interpretation of EU law is a key mechanism in many
   accounts of the development of European integration and law. While the
   significance of the procedure has been broadly acknowledged, one aspect
   has been largely omitted: The opportunity for member state governments
   to submit their views (observations') to the Court in ongoing cases.
   Previous research has shown that these observations matter for the
   Court's decisions, and thus that they are likely to have a significant
   impact on the course of European integration. Still, little is known
   about when and why member states decide to engage in the preliminary
   reference procedure by submitting observations. This article shows that
   there is significant variation, both between cases and between member
   states, in the number of observations filed. A theoretical argument is
   developed to explain this variation. Most importantly, a distinction is
   made between legal and political reasons for governments to get involved
   in the preliminary reference cases, and it is argued that both types of
   factors should be relevant. By matching empirical data from
   inter-governmental negotiations on legislative acts in the Council of
   the EU with member states' subsequent participation in the Court
   procedures, a research design is developed to test these arguments. It
   is found that the decision to submit observations can be tied both to
   concerns with the doctrinal development of EU law and to more immediate
   political preferences. The conclusion is that the legal (the CJEU) and
   political (the Council) arenas of the EU system are more interconnected
   than some of the previous literature would lead us to believe.},

Title = {Political differentiation and the problem of dominance: Segmentation and

Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL RESEARCH},

Abstract = {At first glance, one might view the political differentiation in the
   European Union as a reflection of the autonomy of its member states,
   signifying flexibility and the dispersion of democratic control.
   However, under conditions of complex interdependence and economic
   integration, political differentiation can undermine the fundamental
   conditions for democratic self-rule. Political differentiation may cause
   dominance. It is argued in this article that we must move beyond Philip
   Pettit's conception of dominance as the capacity to interfere with
   others on an arbitrary basis, in order to properly identify the
   undemocratic consequences of differentiation. Political freedom is also
   a question of institutional provisions to co-determine laws. From this
   vantage point, differentiation raises the spectre of dominance in the
   form of decisional exclusion and the pre-emption of political autonomy.
   Drawing on a re-conceptualisation of dominance, the effects of
   differentiation on the possibility of self-rule are examined, and two
   systematic effects of political differentiation are identified. It is
   argued that segmentation is the systemic effect of differentiation in
   the vertical dimension of integration. Here, dominance occurs in the
   form of exclusion from decision-making bodies and the denial of choice
   opportunities. In the external horizontal dimension, the systemic effect
   of differentiation is hegemony. Some states are vulnerable to arbitrary
   interference and the pre-emption of public autonomy. The article
   discusses developments within the Eurozone as a case of segmentation and
   the statues of associated non-members as a case of hegemony. With regard
   to the latter, we are faced with the phenomenon of self-incurred
   dominance.},

Abstract = {The article shows how the main regionalist parties in Scotland and
   Wales-the Scottish National Party and Plaid Cymru-have engaged with a
   populist discourse in the wake of the Great Recession. Based on a
   qualitative analysis of party manifestos and party-elite interviews, the
   article shows that the two parties have adopted a left-wing populist
   discourse, based on a critique of austerity policies. In this way,
   albeit from distinctively regionalist perspective, they performed roles
   very similar to that of other contemporary left-wing populist parties,
   particularly in Southern Europe. The Scottish National Party and Plaid
   Cymru were able to frame their anti-austerity stances within a populist
   discourse because all three traditional British parties shared a
   preference for pro-austerity economic policies. Therefore, in Laclau's
   terms, the two `Celtic' parties' attack on austerity constituted an open
   challenge to the hegemonic discourse of the British `power bloc'.
   Analogous to the expansion of a right-wing anti-establishment protest in
   British politics (monopolized by the UKIP), the two parties
   (particularly the Scottish one) capitalized on the expansion of a
   left-wing populist area. This strategy has lately become less viable
   because Jeremy Corbyn's Labour party broke with the pro-austerity
   consensus among British elites.},

Abstract = {We study how ballot completion levels in Colorado responded to the
   adoption of universal vote by mail elections (VBM). VBM systems are
   among the most widespread and significant election reforms that states
   have adopted in modern elections. VBM elections provide voters more time
   to become informed about ballot choices and opportunities to research
   their choices at the same time as they fill out their ballots. By
   creating a more information-rich voting environment, VBM should increase
   ballot completion, especially among peripheral voters. The empirical
   results show that VBM elections lead to greater ballot completion, but
   that this effect is only substantial in presidential elections.},

Abstract = {Many voices and stories have been systematically silenced in
   interpersonal conversations, political deliberations and historical
   narratives. Recalcitrant and interrelated patterns of epistemic,
   political, cultural and economic marginalisation exclude individuals as
   knowers, citizens, agents. Two questions lie at the centre of this
   article, which focuses on the epistemically - but also politically,
   culturally and economically - dominant: How can we sabotage the
   dominant's investment in their own ignorance of unjust silencing? How
   can they be seduced to become acute perceivers of others' experiences of
   oppression and reckon with their own participation in it? Situated at
   the intersection between political theory, aesthetics and epistemology,
   this article contributes a so-far-unexplored suggestion: that certain
   literary works create epistemic friction between shared, entrenched
   prejudices on the one hand, and representations of epistemic exclusion
   or authority, on the other. Their power to illuminate ideational, moral
   and experiential limitations makes them valuable tools in
   problematising, rendering visible and dislocating epistemic injustice,
   as well as other marginalisations it intersects with. To advance this
   argument, the article relies on insights from aesthetics, unpacking
   fiction's multidimensional epistemic potential. Audre Lorde exemplifies
   literary works' ability to seductively sabotage bias and provide
   audiences with prosthetic visions of unfamiliar experiences of
   marginalisation.},

Abstract = {Normative democratic theory requires political actors in parliament and
   government to represent not only the citizens' policy preferences, but
   also their issue priorities. This article investigates Italian dynamic
   agenda representation - the transmission of public priorities into the
   policy priorities of the Italian political system. To assess the
   public's policy priorities, data on the Most Important Problem from the
   Eurobarometer polls are used, while the legislative agendas of the
   members of parliament (MPs) and government are built following the rules
   of the Comparative Agendas Project. The results of longitudinal analyses
   across 10 policy areas and 20 semesters (2003-13) suggest a persistent
   link between the public's agenda and the prioritization of legislation
   by the Italian parliament, majority MPs, and government. Contrary to
   expectations, the opposition does not seem to be responsive to public
   opinion policy problems when introducing bills.},

Abstract = {Politicians react to administrative policy making by developing systems
   of oversight. Existing studies largely emphasize the advantages of
   reactive oversight, where politicians wait for interest groups to pull a
   fire alarm on noncompliant activity. Less attention has been paid to
   proactive oversight, where politicians police administrators directly.
   To evaluate the effectiveness of police patrol oversight, I look to the
   White House, which has been policing regulatory proposals since the
   Nixon administration. I show how policing, or regulatory review, has
   made agencies more responsive to the president, both by singling out
   noncompliant proposals and, critically, by shaping agency behavior in
   anticipation of review. My findings suggest that police patrol oversight
   is more efficient than previously acknowledged, notably because the
   associated deterrence effects yield low-cost compliance. I conclude with
   a discussion of why Congress, despite having similar incentives to
   control administrators, has not adopted a parallel system of policing.},

Abstract = {On the basis of a game-theoretic model, this paper argues that
   governments typically manage crises more effectively in systems where
   political power is concentrated in a single party, but they are more
   likely to make investments in future welfare in systems where political
   power is shared among several parties. The paper makes two
   contributions. First of all, it shows that both crisis-management
   failures and investment failures can be explained by a common mechanism:
   an inter-temporal commitment problem that arises from the inability of
   political agents to commit to future policy choices. Second, it shows
   that power-sharing institutions are often associated with more effective
   government than power-concentration institutions, in contrast to much of
   the normative literature in comparative politics, in which power-sharing
   institutions are often justified on other grounds, such as
   representativeness, responsiveness, or social cohesion. In a world where
   crises dominate, power-concentration institutions typically perform
   better; in a world where investment problems dominate, power-sharing
   institutions typically perform better.},

Abstract = {Throughout his academic career, Howard J. Wiarda maintained a
   near-permanent association with prominent institutions of policy
   analysis, during which he generated several skeptical assessments of
   U.S. democracy policy. These constitute an underestimated contribution
   to the literature. He was comfortable with the idea that the United
   States stood for democracy but came to worry about the dangers of
   U.S.-branded democracy promotion. He erred in his characterization of
   democracy policy, but his critique previewed the dangers of an
   increasingly expansive definition of U.S. democracy policy. Despite his
   ties to think tanks, Wiarda remained essentially an outsider to policy
   circles, an academic whose writing about democratization was informed by
   closeness to policy makers but who was never a practitioner of democracy
   assistance.},

Abstract = {This article investigates the deliberative abilities of ordinary
   citizens in the context of EuroPolis', a transnational deliberative
   poll. Drawing upon a philosophically grounded instrument, an updated
   version of the Discourse Quality Index (DQI), it explores how capable
   European citizens are of meeting deliberative ideals; whether
   socio-economic, cultural and psychological biases affect the ability to
   deliberate; and whether opinion change results from the exchange of
   arguments. On the positive side, EuroPolis shows that the ideal
   deliberator scoring high on all deliberative standards does actually
   exist, and that participants change their opinions more often when
   rational justification is used in the discussions. On the negative side,
   deliberative abilities are unequally distributed: in particular,
   working-class members are less likely to contribute to a high standard
   of deliberation.},

Abstract = {When women in Congress solve a high-profile problem, their colleagues
   and the media praise their ability to get Washington's business done by
   collaborating and compromising in a way that men do not. The problem
   with this popularly held view is that it is entirely anecdotal. In
   assembling several new data sets to test this proposition
   systematically, we find that women are more likely than men to
   participate in the kinds of activities that foster collegiality. But we
   uncover almost no evidence that women's legislative behavior on fact
   finding abroad, cosponsoring legislation, or engaging the legislative
   process differs from men's. The partisan divide that now characterizes
   the legislative process creates strong disincentives for women (and men)
   to engage in bipartisan problem solving. To be sure, women's presence in
   Congress promotes democratic legitimacy, but it does little to reduce
   gridlock and stalemate on Capitol Hill.},

Abstract = {Since 2016, China has officially regarded blockchain technology as a
   subversive innovation that will fundamentally transform major
   industries. Current blockchain projects in China are dominated by
   private or consortium blockchains that have their accessibility firmly
   controlled; for public blockchains such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, access
   is free for all. Not surprisingly, by weakening state control of digital
   data, public blockchains may neutralise China's decades of efforts in
   building internet filtering systems. The existing development trajectory
   of private and consortium blockchains is likely to advance steadfastly,
   and citizens and companies in China may be required to use
   state-controlled blockchains.},

Abstract = {The following article aims to analyze the process that led the Socialist
   Workers Party to hegemonize the labor movement in the city of Vina del
   Mar, becoming one of the most relevant political actors of that town.
   For this, we will focus on three relevant elements of the socialist
   political action: the propaganda action, the syndical action of the POS
   and the municipal elections. The foregoing through the analysis of
   journalistic sources, especially a little treated by historiography,
   such as the newspaper La Comuna, we propose to qualify both the views
   that have focused on the nitrate north the exceptional space of the
   workers' organization, as well as the influence of anarchism in the
   central zone of the country.},

Volume = {89},
Number = {4},
Pages = {553-559},
Month = {OCT-DEC},
Abstract = {The 2016 referendum marks the start of a new era of euroscepticism in
   the UK, as the basic parameters of debate have shifted from EU
   membership to non-membership as the central working assumption of the
   political system. This shift radically alters the political opportunity
   structure for those groups and elements that have developed in the
   period since the Maastricht treaty, removing the unifying and rallying
   calls of withdrawal and/or radical change to the EU. The achievement of
   Brexit thus poses an existential challenge, as individuals either
   demobilise or divert their political energies into other issues. While a
   core of activists is likely to remain, their scope for influencing
   public policy or even public debate will be further weakened by the
   centrality of creating and managing the UK's relationship with the EU to
   party political debate for the next decade: precisely because it is so
   important, we would expect many more voices to lobby government and
   opposition parties. This all points towards a sharp contraction in the
   organised base of eurosceptic groups, as well as continuing tensions
   about what still needs to be done in the grand project of opposing
   European integration.},

Abstract = {Howard J. Wiarda placed the clash of grand theories at the center of
   comparative politics. In his view, they drive politics forward, guide
   policy, and, not least, make political science interesting. Although his
   contributions were largely to cultural theory, Wiarda resisted claiming
   exclusivity for cultural explanations, and he explicitly allowed for the
   possibility that alternative grand theories could hold a piece of the

Abstract = {Research demonstrates the multi-dimensional nature of American identity
   arguing that the normative content of American identity relates to
   political ideologies in the United States, but the sense of belonging to
   the nation does not. This paper replicates that analysis and extends it
   to the German and British cases. Exploratory structural equation
   modeling attests to cross-cultural validity of measures of the sense of
   belonging and norms of uncritical loyalty and engagement for positive
   change. In the 2010s, we find partisanship and ideology in all three
   nations explains levels of belonging and the two content dimensions.
   Interestingly, those identifying with major parties of the left and
   right in all three countries have a higher sense of belonging and
   uncritical loyalty than their moderate counterparts. The relationship
   between partisanship, ideology, and national identity seems to wax and
   wane over time, presumably because elite political discourse linking
   party or ideology to identity varies from one political moment to the
   next.},

Abstract = {Turkey has undergone a major transition in its energy market between
   2002 and 2017. During this period, the government focused on regulation
   and policymaking and made great strides in market reforms and
   investments in the renewable energy sector. After 16 years, the
   government announced a new transition period by presenting the National
   Energy and Mining Policy (NEMP). This policy is a set of objectives and
   goals based on three main pillars: security of supply, localization, and
   predictability in the markets. Through NEMP Turkey aims to achieve
   energy self-sufficiency, regional supply security, and facilitate
   stronger international collaborations. This new era in energy policy is
   expected to elevate Turkey from a powerful regional actor to a global
   one.},

Abstract = {State and local politics have dominated the first year of Donald Trump's
   presidency. Despite promises to reinvigorate states' rights both before
   and after his campaign, Trump has used the administrative powers of the
   modern presidency to pursue his policy agenda at the subnational level.
   From waiving certain provisions of federal programs, to filing lawsuits
   against states and localities, Trump has taken advantage of the
   opportunities crafted by his predecessors to use subnational politics
   for the presidency's own ends. We place these nascent developments in
   historical and theoretical context to suggest that presidential
   federalism at once signifies the continued strength and relevance of
   subnational governance, while providing occasions for further
   administrative aggrandizement. Trump, despite remaining highly
   unconventional in a number of ways, might further reinforce the
   presidency's centrality to modern American federalism.},

Abstract = {This article analyzes the voting patterns in the current 8th European
   Parliament (EP) and addresses two research questions. First, which
   dimensions structure the voting behavior in the EP? Second, how do the
   legislators of the AfD position themselves in this political space and
   how was their position affected by the internal split of the party?
   Based on spatial models, we find that the 8th EP is mainly structured by
   a divide on European Integration preferences and to a lesser extent by
   the left-right dimension. Legislators of the AfD clearly moved towards a
   more right-wing populist position over time, but this change mainly took
   place after the EPG change in 2016 and not after the internal split in
   May 2015. We discuss this finding.},

Abstract = {What explains the emergence of organized private enforcement in the
   United States? We study the formation of vigilance committees-that is,
   coercive groups organized in a manner not officially sanctioned by state
   law and with the purpose of establishing legal and moral claims. We
   argue that these committees were primarily intended to help create civic
   political identities in contexts of social ambiguity and institutional
   instability, what we call social frontiers. Relying on quantitative and
   qualitative analysis, we find that these committees were more likely to
   form in contexts where levels of ethno-nationalist heterogeneity were
   high and where political institutions had recently changed. Contrary to
   common wisdom, vigilance committees were much more than functionalist
   alternatives to an absent state, or local orders established by
   bargaining, or responses to social or economic conflict. They
   constituted flexible instruments to counteract environments
   characterized by social and political uncertainty.},

Abstract = {This paper engages in a comparative analysis of the economic positions
   of radical right-wing populist parties in Western Europe. Following
   Ennser-Jedenastik (), we argue that those parties' political economy is
   best captured in terms of the nativist, populist and authoritarian
   features of their core ideology, each of which produces a specific set
   of economic policies independent from the issue of government
   intervention in the economy. On basis of an analysis of the election
   manifestos of seven radical right-wing populist parties in Western
   Europe in the period 2005-2015, we argue that those parties share
   similarities in their economic nativism, authoritarianism and populism,
   whilst their positions on the traditional role of the state in the
   economy are more diverse. The findings indicate also a unified nativist'
   response to the global financial crisis both in terms of welfare
   chauvinism and economic protectionism. We discuss the role of internal
   and external factors in explaining the economic profile of radical
   right-wing populist parties.},

   stating that there is a plan to revoke all .eu domains owned by the
   United Kingdom's individuals and entities due to Britain's exit from the
   European Union. The article highlights issues related to the process of
   the UK leaving the EU, gives examples from other fields of the Union law
   and the national law of the Member States which have experienced similar
   situations and also points out the fundamental rights that the
   Commission needs to comply with. The basics of domain names are also
   partially covered to inform the reader about what domain names are based
   on and of existing regulations in the field.},

Abstract = {This contribution studies the effect of populist conceptions of
   democracy on voting for populist parties drawing on the case of the
   ``Alternative fur Deutschland{''} (AfD). Building on dominant
   definitions of populism, we conceptualize a populist orientation towards
   democracy via three elements-the privilege of the majority will over
   minority rights, the demand for absolute responsiveness from
   representatives to the majority will and negative views of political
   pluralism-and propose a corresponding measurement model. Our empirical
   analysis shows that such populist conceptions of democracy are
   particularly strong among AfD supporters. Moreover, they exhibit
   significant and substantial effects on voting intentions for the AfD in
   multivariate analyses and, leveraging the panel structure of the data,
   are able to predict changes in party preferences towards the AfD over
   time.},

Abstract = {Previous research has found evidence of an almost universal public
   desire for democracy, even in autocratic regimes. However, a single word
   may evoke different associations for different people. As such, the term
   democracy is unlikely to trigger the same or equivalent associations
   between different people. Inspired by the Anchoring Vignettes Approach,
   I qualify people's stated desire for democracy with their
   representative, direct, social, or authoritarian perception of
   democracy. Using the Analytical Hierarchy Process, I obtain idealized
   priorities of institutional configurations to determine the membership a
   specific perception has with regard to a procedural-liberal,
   participatory-liberal, or social-liberal normative benchmark. I perform
   a mixed-model analysis on World Values Survey Wave 5 data to test the
   empirical consequences of my conceptual calibration concerning
   explanatory factors for people's democratic desires. Popular support for
   representative democracy has been consistently overstated, particularly
   in nondemocratic countries. The design of political institutions is the
   most important factor in predicting a person's actual desire for
   democracy.},

Abstract = {This article analyzes the news frame given to the environmental and
   social crisis linked to the red tide bloom that occurred in Chiloe,
   during 2016, from the framing theory, and its tension with the social
   movement's frame. The way in which the elite media covered this
   socio-environmental crisis is compared with the way in which the social
   movement of fishermen and citizens framed the crisis. The results
   indicate that the movement focuses on a framework of socio-environmental
   conflict, emphasizing the origin of the crisis in the productive model
   of the area. On the other hand, the elite media build two frames. The
   first, focused on emphasizing that the crisis has its origin in a
   cyclical natural phenomenon, while the second highlights the conflictive
   aspects of social protest and the crisis as a public security problem.},

Abstract = {States often violate international agreements, both accidentally and
   intentionally. To process complaints efficiently, states can create
   formal, pretrial procedures in which governments can negotiate with
   litigants before a case ever goes to court. If disputes are resolved
   during pretrial negotiations, it can be very difficult to tell what has
   happened. Are governments coming into compliance? If so, are they only
   doing so when they have accidentally committed a violation or even when
   they are intentionally resisting? Or are challenges simply being
   dropped? This paper presents a formal model to address these questions.
   We develop our theory in the context of the European Union (EU). To test
   our model, we collect a new dataset of over 13,000 Commission
   infringement cases against EU member states (2003-2013). Our results
   suggest that accidental and intentional noncompliance both occur, but
   that intentional noncompliance is more common in the EU. We find that
   the Commission is an effective, if imperfect, monitor and enforcer of
   international law. The Commission can correct intentional noncompliance,
   but not always. It strategically drops cases that it believes it is
   unlikely to win.},

Abstract = {Leaders and members of parliament serve as a political party's public
   face. Their image casts a shadow in which observers interpret policy
   statements. It is hypothesized in this article that media cover and
   voters understand policy messages through the lens of prominent party
   members' characteristics. Easy-to-observe descriptive traits, such as
   gender or ethnicity, cue parties' policy priorities. Media are more
   likely to emphasise party messages on issues historically related to
   these groups when they are visible in the party's public image.
   Hypotheses from this theory are tested using data on prominent party
   members' descriptive characteristics, policy statements and media
   coverage of statements from the European Election Studies. Data from the
   1999, 2004 and 2009 European elections evidence support for the theory.
   Parties with more female representatives signal stronger emphasis on
   gendered issues in media reports. The results hold implications for
   understanding the ways in which parties deliver and voters receive
   campaign messages. This research offers an explanation for voters'
   limited knowledge of parties' policy positions; media reinforce existing
   gender stereotypes and voters' predispositions by selectively reporting
   policy statements.},

Abstract = {Does sexual orientation and gender identity matter at election time?
   While previous literature has explored the effect of candidate gender
   and ethnicity on electoral results, this is the first study to
   quantitatively investigate the impact of sexual orientation. We build an
   original dataset combining individual-level data on more than 3,000
   candidates in the 2015 UK election with sociodemographic indicators at
   the constituency level. In addition to sexual orientation and other
   demographic characteristics, we include candidate education, political
   experience, and campaign spending. We find that LGBT candidates
   generally do not have a negative impact on party vote share. Even in
   more conservative environments, LGBT candidates perform at least as well
   as their straight counterparts. This work is important to understand the
   consequences of descriptive representation and, relatedly, how rapid
   social change happens.},

Title = {Socio-environmental conflicts towards power plants projects in Chile
   (2005-2016): A configurational analysis},
Journal = {AMERICA LATINA HOY-REVISTA DE CIENCIAS SOCIALES},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {79},
Pages = {125-149},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Last decades have witnessed increasing occurrences of
   socio-environmental conflicts towards the installation of power plants
   of all kinds. Depending on the cases, these conflicts led either to the
   construction or the abortion of the project. Most of the literature used
   to treat these occurrences individually, without evaluating
   systematically the incidence of conflicts in the construction -or not-
   of power plants. Therefore, this article proposes an analytical
   framework to find out under what conditions an environmental conflict
   achieves its objective to stop the construction of the power plant, or
   fails. To do so, we proceed to configurational analysis, using QCA
   methodology for 26 cases of conflicts in Chile. The results points out a
   complex causality, in which no single condition is neither sufficient
   nor necessary to produce the outcome. Additional analysis highlights the
   only relative importance of articulation between social movements and
   traditional political actors in producing succesful outcomes. These
   findings lead to a better understanding of the dynamics of
   socio-environmental conflicts, offering thus a significant contribution
   to the growing literature on the consequences of social mobilizations.},

Abstract = {Do voters' assessments of the government's foreign policy performance
   influence their vote intentions? Does the clarity of responsibility' in
   government moderate this relationship? Existing research on the United
   States demonstrates that the electorate's foreign policy evaluations
   influence voting behaviour. Whether a similar relationship exists across
   the advanced democracies in Europe remains understudied, as does the
   role of domestic political institutions that might generate
   responsibility diffusion and dampen the effect of foreign policy
   evaluations on vote choice. Using the attitudinal measures of
   performance from the 2011 Transatlantic Trends survey collected across
   13 European countries, these questions are answered in this study
   through testing on incumbent vote the diffusion-inducing effects of five
   key domestic factors frequently used in the foreign policy analysis
   literature. Multilevel regression analyses conclude that the
   electorate's ability to assign punishment decreases at higher levels of
   responsibility diffusion, allowing policy makers to circumvent the
   electoral costs of unpopular foreign policy. Specifically, coalition
   governments, semi-presidential systems, ideological dispersion among the
   governing parties and the diverse allocation of the prime ministerial
   and foreign policy portfolios generate diffusion, dampening the negative
   effects of foreign policy disapproval on vote choice. This article
   contributes not only to the debate on the role of foreign policy in
   electoral politics, but also illustrates the consequential effects of
   domestic institutions on this relationship.},

Abstract = {In this article, the effects of regional autocratic linkage on the
   survival of autocratic regimes are analysed. Scholars have suggested
   that regional factors shape regime survival through processes of
   diffusion. However, in most accounts, diffusion is simply derived from
   characteristics of the region, such as the number or proportion of
   regional autocracies. In contrast, it is argued here that it is the
   actual linkages between countries that must be examined. Regional
   political, economic and social ties between autocratic regimes create
   domestic and external stakes in the regime, counterweigh democratisation
   pressure and facilitate autocratic learning. The study employs the
   average volume of trade, migration and diplomatic exchanges between
   autocratic regimes within a region as proxies for regional autocratic
   linkage, and asserts that regional autocratic linkage is on the rise.
   Applying Cox survival models on a dataset of regional autocratic linkage
   and regime survival between 1946 and 2009, it is found that regional
   autocratic linkage significantly reduces the likelihood of autocratic
   regime breakdown. These effects hold when the proportion of autocratic
   regimes within a region is controlled for, suggesting that one must look
   beyond the characteristics of the countries within a region and focus on
   the ties and linkages between them.},

Abstract = {While there is a strong correlation between district magnitudes and
   electoral fragmentation, studies of national level electoral system
   reforms provide mixed evidence that such reforms actually change levels
   of party system fragmentation because reforms are often endogenous to
   the outcomes they purport to explain. We propose that the reallocation
   of seats at the district level in PR systems (which hold geographic
   boundaries constant) provide better leverage to test how the electoral
   system affects the party system because these reforms are not
   politically manipulated in the way that national-level reforms are. We
   look at the effect of changing district magnitude on the effective
   number of parties winning seats, the number of parties running for
   office, and the effective number of parties winning votes in 20
   countries. Adding seats increases the number of parties that run for
   office, the number of parties who win votes, and the number of parties
   who win seats in the subsequent election. The effects on electoral
   fragmentation is especially large in ethnically and politically divided
   countries. While the mechanical effect of adding seats is larger than is
   the psychological effects on parties or voters, these data provide
   strong evidence that electoral system reforms directly affect election
   outcomes.},

Abstract = {Recent research has shown that Amazon MTurk workers exhibit
   substantially more effort and attention than respondents in student
   samples when participating in survey experiments. In this paper, I
   examine when and why low-cost online survey participants provide
   effortful responses to survey experiments in political science. I
   compare novice and veteran MTurk workers to participants in Qualtrics's
   qBus, a comparable online omnibus program. The results show that MTurk
   platform participation is associated with substantially greater effort
   across a variety of indicators of effort relative to
   demographically-matched peers. This effect endures even when
   compensating for the amount of survey experience accumulated by
   respondents, suggesting that MTurk workers may be especially motivated
   due to an understudied self-selection mechanism. Together, the findings
   suggest that novice and veteran MTurk workers alike are preferable to
   comparable convenience sample participants when performing complex
   tasks.},

Abstract = {Terrorism has contributed significantly to the unstable and unavoidable
   conflict and threat to security to many countries in the twenty-first
   century globally. In this qualitative case study, the author explores
   the causes and devastating effects of terrorism on the continent of
   Africa. The study used purposive sampling method to select and interview
   eight executive police officers from the Kofi Annan International Peace
   Training Centre (KAIPTC) and the Criminal Investigation Department (CID)
   of the Ghana Police Service (GPS). The researcher also assessed issues
   of policing in Africa relating to terrorism using archival records kept
   at criminal investigations departments, empirical studies, and other
   records on the menace published by renowned experts. The study reveals
   that socialization and radicalism through some interventions are the
   major causes of terrorism in Africa. The study recommends that
   international bodies led by the United Nations should support the
   policing efforts to curb the menace of terrorism in Africa.},

Abstract = {Arbitrary state and corporate powers are helping to turn the Internet
   into a global surveillance dragnet. Responses to this novel form of
   power have been tepid and ineffective. Liberal critiques of surveillance
   are constrained by their focus on privacy, security and the underlying
   presupposition that freedom consists only of freedom from interference.
   By contrast, (post)Foucauldian critiques rejecting liberalism have been
   well rewarded analytically, but have proven incapable of addressing
   normative questions regarding the relationship between surveillance and
   freedom. Quite apart from these debates, neorepublicans have excavated a
   third concept of freedom, understood as non-domination. Could
   neorepublicanism overcome the limitations of liberal and (
   post)Foucauldian critiques of surveillance? We argue, positively, that
   neorepublicanism can accommodate much of the (post)Foucauldian analyses
   while also incorporating a normative critique of surveillance vis-a-vis
   freedom. We further argue, negatively, that surveillance power has
   outstripped the capacities of traditional republican institutional
   responses to domination. We conclude by considering ways in which
   neorepublicanism can be recalibrated to address the novelty of
   surveillance power while adhering to the ideal of non-domination. Two
   ways of addressing the problem are proposed: an offensive, dedicated
   surveillance antipower and a defensive republican amplification of
   privacy.},

Abstract = {Identification with a social group can operate as a powerful heuristic,
   allowing an individual to easily make political judgments. But, a person
   can identify with multiple groups, which may be mobilized toward
   different political ends. How do opinions and behaviors change when a
   person's identities are in competition with each other, creating
   cross-pressures? The Evangelical Immigration Table (EIT)a broad
   coalition of evangelical Christian leaders supporting liberal
   immigration policieshas been working to mobilize evangelical Christians
   on immigration; however, many evangelical Christians also hold competing
   partisan identities that push them to maintain their existing
   conservative immigration opinions. Using both panel and experimental
   data, I show that while the EIT can influence evangelicals' immigration
   attitudes, these changes in opinion do not correspond to an increased
   willingness to act politically in support of reform. Instead, I find the
   that EIT has been more successful at demobilizing evangelical opponents
   of immigration reform.},

Abstract = {For decades US senators have maximized their limited resources to juggle
   policy, party politics, and constituents, but the rise of social media
   sheds new light on how they make these strategic choices. David Mayhew's
   seminal study of Congress (1974) argues that lawmakers engage in three
   types of activities - credit claiming, advertising, and position taking,
   but equally important is understanding how lawmakers make strategic
   choices among these activities. Senators' limited resources and
   attention forces them to prioritize and make trade-offs among these
   activities, and new media platforms, like Twitter, offer a window into
   that decision-making process. This article examines what influences
   senators' decisions to publicly communicate these activities on Twitter.
   By using senators' daily Twitter activity in 2013 and 2015 as a measure
   of their individual agenda, I find that senators are most likely to
   prioritize position-taking activities. Women and committee leaders
   allocate the most attention to policy positions, but attention to policy
   may come at a cost. When senators do choose to prioritize policy through
   position taking, they often make trade-offs that lead to decreased
   attention to advertising and credit claiming. These activities and the
   choices among them not only have implications for lawmakers' behavior in
   Congress, but also the type of representation and information
   constituents can expect from their elected leaders.},

Abstract = {Can development aid empower women? We randomly assigned 1,250 Congolese
   communities to a development program that distributed development funds
   and included women in project selection and implementation, with the
   goal of empowering women. In 2010 and 2011, we revisited 816 treatment
   and control communities to collect survey data. Furthermore, in 413
   communities we implemented a \$1,000 unconditional cash transfer program
   to assess behavioral change. We find only weak evidence that the program
   influenced the role of women in the community and policy outcomes and no
   evidence that the program had an impact on the role of women within the
   household or attitudes toward them.},

Title = {Forced to vote, but not for women. The effect of compulsory voting on
   voting for women},
Journal = {ACTA POLITICA},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {53},
Number = {3},
Pages = {469-487},

Abstract = {Compulsory voting is an underexposed factor of the electoral system that
   possibly influences women's descriptive representation. Studlar and
   McAllister (Eur J Polit Res 41(2): 233-253, 2002) found a negative
   effect, but no theoretical explanations were given. We develop two
   possible explanations: voters who only vote because they have to are
   less politically sophisticated, and therefore vote less sophisticatedly,
   and/or they have different attitudes about women in political life. From
   our study, we are able to detect a gendered effect of compulsory voting
   in Belgium's flexible-list PR system, but only the vote sophistication
   explanation is confirmed. Voters who would no longer vote without
   compulsory voting significantly vote more for top candidates (mostly
   men) and give significantly less preference votes for candidates lower
   down the list. This points us to the complexity of the ballot structure
   as an important new dimension that could help explain gendered voting
   effects of compulsory voting systems. Finally, since different effects
   for formal and descriptive representation appear, we posit that
   compulsory voting constitutes a dilemma for women activists.},

Abstract = {This article shows how mobilized sectors' degree of integration to
   global value chains can account for variation in the European Union's
   responses to litigation at the World Trade Organization (WTO). The
   behavior of the EU demonstrates a puzzling picture in bringing about
   compliance following WTO disputes, sometimes meeting its trade partners'
   demands in a timely manner, while resisting resolving the disputes in
   others. In order to account for this variance, I aim to answer the
   research question: under which conditions does the EU meet its trade
   partners' demands in a timely manner, rather than resist compliance, in
   the WTO dispute settlement mechanism? Combining comparative analysis
   with case studies, I find that the EU's behavior in bringing timely
   compliance to disputes can be explained by mobilized targeted sectors'
   level of integration to global value chains (GVCs). As disputes target
   certain measures that tend to benefit-specific sectors, the level of
   integration of these targeted sectors shapes the EU's preference toward
   pro or against liberalization. The results of the study corroborate the
   finding that trade policy is shaped by the interests of domestic
   economic actors and that those engaged in GVCs foster liberalization
   multilaterally.},

Abstract = {Orthodox Western environmental practice and its associated discourse
   posits a positive causal link between levels of participation and
   effective environmental governance and regards participatory practices
   as a normatively desirable element in the building of a more sustainable
   society. However, recent discussions around theories of authoritarian
   environmentalism have challenged some basic assumptions of orthodox
   environmentalism. However, these discussions still lack sufficient
   discussion of real-world policy making and implementation and this
   article addresses that gap by exploring China's policy of green
   urbanization, deemed a top priority by Chinese policy elites. We argue
   that the shifting strategies of governance associated with green
   urbanization are evidence of the emergence of a distinct paradigm of
   authoritarian environmentalism, characterized by a re-centralization of
   state power and a reduction of local autonomy, in environmental policy
   making in China.},

Abstract = {Conservative Indian political thought, in addition to being alive and
   well in contemporary discourse, has a long lineage. We explore the
   intellectual roots of this tradition by examining older and more
   contemporary writings ranging from the Manusmriti and the Ramayana to
   those of Gandhi and Maududi and place them in contrast to those of more
   liberal thinkers like Ambedkar and Nehru. We find that, in particular,
   the conservative idea of the `limited state' has an extensive history
   embedded in sub-continental religions, religious practices and social
   norms. Central to the concept of the limited state is the belief that
   the state is subservient to society, the belief that dharma is
   ontological prior to the state, the belief that the king or leader must
   preserve the social order and the belief that individual reform is the
   primary source of social change. An understanding of this set of
   beliefs, and the idea of the limited state more generally, is important
   not only for understanding India's past, but also for insight into
   contemporary politics. We demonstrate the continued vitality of these
   concepts through an examination of recent National Election Studies
   (NES) and World Values Survey (WVS) data.},

Abstract = {This study tests the links between economic performance, democratic
   quality and satisfaction with democracy (SWD) at multiple levels. By
   analysing a time-series cross-sectional (TSCS) dataset of 57 democracies
   between 1990 and 2014, it finds the two types of performance matter
   almost equally: countries with good democratic and economic records tend
   to show higher levels of SWD than countries without them. Over time, an
   improvement in `objective' democratic and economic conditions is shown
   to be related to increasing levels of national SWD. The second part of
   the study reconfirms these relationships at the individual level by
   analysing survey data from the ``Europeans' understandings and
   evaluations of democracy{''} special module of the sixth round of the
   European Social Survey. It shows that respondents' evaluations of the
   economy and democracy are strongly related to their SWD. Finally, it
   demonstrates that the effect of objective democratic and economic
   performances on SWD is mediated by peoples' evaluations of them.},

Abstract = {Hostages have become an important political and security issue in the
   context of conflicts in the Middle East and in Africa. The work of
   Marcel Mauss helps us to shed a new light on this phenomenon, which
   today is portrayed in negative terms as a major violation of fundamental
   universal rights such as the right to liberty. In The Gift, however,
   Mauss refers to the granting of hostages as ``acts of generosity.{''} In
   line with Mauss' approach, I consider hostageship as a ``total social
   phenomenon,{''} combining politics, law, and economics, in both domestic
   and global settings, which reveals structural political and social
   questions that need to be addressed. The article highlights the role
   that hostages fulfilled as ``gifts{''} in premodern international
   relations when hostages were granted and not taken as they are today. I
   underline the role they notably performed as elements of
   proto-diplomacy. I show the reasons why the function of hostages has
   changed over time by underlining the importance of the later Middle Ages
   as a transitional moment. Finally, I discuss the issue of contemporary
   hostageship from a normative perspective, arguing along with Mauss,
   against an interest-based utilitarian vision of hostageship and in favor
   of a solidarist approach to hostage crises.},

Abstract = {There has been considerable discussion about whether and how China's
   political economy will change with economic growth and development. The
   debate has focused for the most part on the possibilities for either
   market transition or continued path dependence, and in particular,
   research has centred on the emergence of business activities and the
   changing role of local business elites. The results of interviews with
   469 members of the new economic elites in five cities suggest that while
   local politics may indeed have adjusted to the new environment, in elite
   formation, the market plays a role alongside and sometimes secondary to
   status and political power. There is a significant pattern of elite
   privilege that reaches back into the era of state socialism, with
   further origins for some to be found in the pre-1949 local elites. Even
   where there are reasons to be sceptical about long-term status claims,
   there can be no gainsaying the strength of such narratives as
   motivational forces in business and elite behaviour.},

Abstract = {This article introduces a new method for testing asymmetric,
   reference-point-dependent behaviour in economic voting. Specifically,
   prospect theory suggests that people exhibit loss aversion, which
   crucially depends on a reference point. In practice, this reference
   point is often unknown. This article proposes a procedure to estimate
   reference points from the data using threshold models, and then test
   whether above- and below reference point effects are equivalent, or
   whether negative changes have stronger effects - as predicted by
   prospect theory. This method is applied to the relationship between
   economic performance and government popularity in the United Kingdom,
   using monthly time series data over the last thirty years. The results
   show that there is asymmetric, reference-point-dependent behaviour, most
   notably in the relationship between unemployment and government
   popularity.},

Abstract = {This article revises the theoretical and empirical implications
   regarding the concept of failed state, examining its relationship with
   the postulates proposed by classic as well as critical geopolitics. From
   classical geopolitics traditional elements such as State, territory and
   resources are revised, and the way they converge in the configuration
   and valuation of a failed State. From critical geopolitics, the failure
   or death of a state is not a simple process, but elements such as
   identity and culture should be taken into account. In the same way, the
   discourse, being an essential element in critical geopolitics, plays a
   central role in the process of categorization of this type of State. In
   conclusion: a holistic analysis of the phenomenon of failed States could
   contribute to a better understanding of it.},

Abstract = {The jurisprudence of Justice Holmes is often equated with the political
   philosophy of Thomas Hobbes, the former jurist's thought usually
   understood in light of the latter philosopher. It would seem that while
   not of the same intellectual caliber as Hobbes, Holmes's political and
   thus legal thinking is substantively the same. Careful study reveals
   that while both men shared an Epicurean understanding of human nature,
   Hobbes believed that a natural right teaching could be derived from it,
   whereas Holmes rejected natural right altogether. This divergence on
   natural right led to two distinct political doctrines. Hobbes's
   political philosophy equates an actual good with an alleviation of the
   fear of death, which is most conveniently sought within an artificial
   political community. Holmes's jurisprudence equates a perceived good
   with the legal and the legal with the arbitrary decrees of an arbitrary
   sovereign. This legal positivism pervades Holmes's jurisprudence,
   including his renowned free speech jurisprudence.},

Abstract = {The Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) operates under the names of the
   Democratic Union Party and the People's Protection Units in Syria. The
   PKK is registered as a terrorist group by most western governments, the
   European Union and Turkey, where it originated as a separatist
   organization. Nonetheless, the YPG has been the partner of the United
   Statesled coalition in Syria against the ISIS. The strengthening of the
   YPG/PKK and its political messaging has brought in a flow of western
   foreign fighters. Some of these fighters are now returning to their
   homelands with indications that they are bringing security problems with
   them.},

Abstract = {Contestation over war memorialization can help democratic theory respond
   to the current attenuation of citizenship in war in liberal democratic
   states, especially the United States. As war involves more advanced
   technologies and fewer soldiers, the relation of citizenship to war
   changes. In this context war memorialization plays a particular role in
   refiguring the relation. Current practices of remembering and
   memorializing war in contemporary neoliberal states respond to a
   dilemma: the state needs to justify and garner support for continual
   wars while distancing citizenship from participation. The result is a
   consumer culture of memorialization that seeks to effect a unity of the
   political community while it fights wars with few citizens and devalues
   the public. Neoliberal wars fought with few soldiers and an economic
   logic reveals the vulnerability to otherness that leads to more active
   and critical democratic citizenship.},

Abstract = {This article analyzes the case of compassionate conservatism with regard
   to the development of conservative thought and governance. Through the
   use of Rogers Smith's spiral of politics framework, I argue that
   compassionate conservatism extended modern conservative thought by
   building on the principles of neoconservatism and the religious Right
   while maintaining appeals to traditionalism and small-government
   libertarianism. This ideational development contributed to coalition
   building within the Republican Party and was translated into a limited
   but meaningful policy legacy that outlasted the George W. Bush
   presidency. This variant of conservatism may yet prove meaningful in
   future developments of conservative politics.},

Abstract = {Pre-election polls are increasingly being used to forecast and study
   elections in new and weak democracies yet the tension that surrounds
   elections in less liberal regimes may make data from such surveys
   particularly prone to measurement error. Polls conducted before and
   after the 2011 Ugandan election and data gathered at various points of
   the election cycles in 34 African countries are compared to show that,
   before elections, survey respondents become increasingly wary of the
   interview and its purpose, especially in less liberal regimes. Those who
   are wary report more support for the incumbent, the incumbent's policies
   and the state and effect of wariness on attitudes is significantly
   higher on surveys that take place immediately before elections.
   Misreporting increases the estimated level of support for the incumbent,
   and may also significantly change the apparent correlates of regime
   support across the election cycle. Ironically, it was found that
   pre-election polls may be particularly poorly suited to forecasting
   elections or capturing the effects of campaigns on political attitudes.},

Abstract = {The issue of the political role of knowledge is a fundamental issue in
   contemporary debates on political theory. All sources of authority and
   certainty called into question in our Time, knowledge becomes
   problematic and a traditional question re-emerges: What are the possible
   links between philosophy, science or academia, and public debate or
   politics in general? This paper analyzes Leo Strauss' understanding of
   the development of this question in Modernity and seeks to demonstrate
   that the author's work points out a pendular movement, an oscillation
   between omnipotence and impotence, between excessive confidence on the
   usefulness of science for political communities, and relativism, or the
   affirmation of the absolute incapacity of reason to produce any good for
   humanity.},

   literature{''}. In this paper the question is raised if, despite the
   absence of any explicit discourse on ``national popular philosophy{''},
   this category needs to be introduced in order to think the ``philosophy
   of praxis{''} in a coherent manner. It is argued that the reason for the
   absence of this notion is the risk of the nationalization of philosophy,
   as it occurred during WWI. Such nationalization revealed, in any case,
   some features of philosophy which are central to the philosophy of
   praxis as well: its link to a specific ideological milieu and, in last
   instance, the unity of theory and praxis. Hence, the indispensability of
   the notion of ``national popular philosophy{''}.},

Abstract = {Modern materialism distinguishes itself from metaphysical materialism of
   XVIII century by the constitutive relation with the dialectical process.
   This article claims to rethink radically the concepts of matter and
   processes of materialization through the analisys of two different
   theoretical perspectives. These are arisen from the critic to the
   determinate negation and from the crisis of the classical and
   dialectical model of reason: first, T.W. Adorno's negative dialectic;
   second, the new materialisms inspired by the philosophy of Gilles
   Deleuze. The article ends with a brief tentative to elaborate the
   political implication of these two materialistic approaches.},

Abstract = {How do citizens evaluate democracy? Previous literature trying to
   address this question has often relied on single indicators to assess
   citizens' assessment of democracy. This article contributes to this
   debate by using multiple indicators measuring different attributes to
   find a summary measure of citizens' evaluations of democracy. Using the
   special module of the sixth round of the European Social Survey
   Europeans' understandings and evaluations of democracy' and applying
   Bayesian factor analysis with country random effects, this article tests
   whether multiple indicators form an underlying trait measuring citizens'
   evaluations of democracy. It finds the scores of this measure at the
   individual and country levels and validates this measure against other
   measures built at the system level, including the satisfaction with
   democracy' indicator, also illustrating its functioning as a dependent
   and an independent variable.},

Abstract = {How and when do presidents influence the government formation process in
   semi-presidential systems? Presidents have both a formal role and vested
   interest in the formation of the cabinet, yet their influence has been
   overlooked in studies of the duration of government formation. In this
   article, it is argued that the president's influence over government
   formation can be explained by his or her perceived legitimacy to act in
   the bargaining process and their partisanship. In this first case, it is
   argued that the legitimacy to act derives from a president's
   constitutional powers and more powerful presidents simplify cabinet
   bargaining, leading to shorter government formation periods. In the
   second case, it is proposed that presidents and their parties have
   overlapping preferences. Therefore, when the president's party holds
   greater bargaining power in government formation negotiations, the
   bargaining process is less uncertain and less complex. Thus, government
   formation processes will be shorter. Using survival models and data from
   26 European democracies, both propositions are confirmed by the
   analysis. The results enhance our understanding of the dynamics of
   cabinet bargaining processes and contribute to the wider study of
   semi-presidentialism and executive-legislative relations. One broader
   implication of these results is that the president's party affiliation
   is an important motivation for them as political actors; this contrasts
   with some previous studies which conceive of presidents as non-partisan
   actors.},

Abstract = {Many European presidents have extensive constitutional powers to affect
   the timing of early parliamentary elections, which enables them to
   influence when incumbent governments must face the electorate. This
   article examines whether presidents use their assembly dissolution
   powers for partisan benefit. To date, presidential activism in the
   electoral arena of parliamentary and semipresidential democracies
   remains poorly understood. We hypothesize that presidents use their
   powers to influence election calling for the advantage of their
   political allies in government. To test this argument, we use data on
   190 elections in 18 European democracies. Our results suggest that
   presidents with significant dissolution powers are able to shape the
   electoral success of incumbents. Prime ministers whose governments are
   allied to such presidents realize a vote and seat share bonus of around
   5\%. These findings have implications for our understanding of
   presidential activism, strategic parliamentary dissolution, and
   electoral accountability.},

Abstract = {This article assesses the policy influence of the House of Commons
   Justice Select Committee, established to oversee the work of the
   Ministry of Justice following its creation a decade ago. The committee
   has, from the outset, overseen many contentious policy and legislative
   developments in the penal field, although none so extensive as those
   introduced following the formation of the Conservative-Liberal Democrat
   coalition government in 2010. Despite the newsworthy nature of its
   business, the committee has, to some extent, operated in the shadows of
   its high-profile sister, the Home Affairs Select Committee, and has
   received surprisingly limited attention from criminologists and
   political scientists alike. Forming part of a wider investigation into
   the work of the committee, this article examines the extent to which it
   was able to influence penal developments during the coalition years.
   This period is of particular interest given that it heralded the end of
   the New Labour administration and welcomed the fresh thinking' of a
   coalition leadership keen to emphasise its progressive attitude towards
   law and order. While the committee was able to influence the direction
   of penal policy on several occasions, this mostly occurred as a result
   of its proactive or niche inquiries. The committee had less impact when
   conducting inquiries that assessed the government's flagship policy
   agenda, however. Such findings brought into question the ability of the
   committee to influence the most significant justice transformations in
   this era of new penal governance.},

Abstract = {As part of its arbitration case on the South China Sea, the Philippines
   requested the arbitral tribunal to determine the status of certain
   features of the Spratly Islands under Article 121 of the 1982 United
   Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. The Tribunal first clarified
   the meaning of the article, then subsequently applied it to the features
   in question, before concluding that no feature in this area is capable
   of generating an exclusive economic zone or continental shelf, for the
   reason that the features failed to satisfy the two criteria set forth in
   Article 121(3)human habitation and economic life of their own. This
   article examines the historical evidence that was used to determine
   whether the maritime features in question satisfy these two criteria. It
   finds that there were existing evidence and additional materials that
   were overlooked by the Tribunal, with implications which could
   potentially have led to an alternative outcome.},

   the nineteenth century and the decade of 1930. In particular, it focuses
   on how each position in debate conceived the connection between
   capitalist economic development and the revolutionary action of the

Abstract = {There is an ongoing debate in the public opinion and voting behaviour
   literature on whether policy content or party cues determine voters'
   opinions and electoral behaviour. This study focuses on the issue of the
   integration of immigrants, and assesses to what extent the policy
   content and a radical right party label relate to voters' likelihood of
   agreeing with the policy and of voting for the candidate introducing the
   policy. The analysis, using experimental video data with hypothetical
   political candidates embedded in a representative Dutch survey (LISS) (N
   = 3249), reveals that the influence of the radical right label is
   limited. It only negatively affects the likelihood of supporting a
   candidate and agreeing with the policy among voters who do not support a
   mainstream right or radical right party. The content of the policy plays
   a major role. In particular, a radical right compared with mainstream
   right policy towards the integration of immigrants decreases the
   likelihood of agreeing with the policy and supporting the candidate
   presenting such a policy among non-radical right voters. Radical right
   voters are substantially more likely to agree with a restrictive
   migration policy and to support a candidate presenting such a policy
   than voters of all other parties.},

Abstract = {Section 5 of the 1965 Voting Rights Act required covered
   jurisdictionsthose deemed perniciously politically discriminatory to
   minoritiesto preclear changes to their voting practices with the
   Department of Justice. By exploiting the use of a federally imposed
   threshold for how Section 5 coverage was applied in North Carolina, this
   article estimates the effect of coverage using a
   difference-in-differences design. This article finds that Section 5
   coverage increased black voter registration by 14-19 percentage points,
   white registration by 10-13 percentage points, and overall voter turnout
   by 10-19 percentage points. Additional results for Democratic vote share
   suggest that some of this overall increase in turnout may have come from
   reactionary whites. This article finds that Section 5 coverage had a
   statistically and substantively meaningful effect on enfranchisement,
   although an effect consistent with the more modest of extant estimates
   in the literature.},

Volume = {50},

Abstract = {Contingent events, including the initiation of conflicts that trigger
   ``rallying-'round-the-flag,{''} can generate long-lasting public support
   and hence stability for authoritarian regimes, yet such effects remain
   poorly understood. The present study builds on the core logic of leading
   explanations of rallying in democracies to develop theory on how
   rallying works in authoritarian contexts. Unpacking the surge in
   President Vladimir Putin's popularity after Russia annexed Crimea, an
   original survey experiment finds that authoritarian rallying obtains
   partly through the activation of patriotic sentiment, but that,
   counterintuitively, the strongest rallying effects occur among those who
   watch the least television news. Potential sources of private
   information on the Crimea annexation's costs including negative personal
   economic experiences and usage of social media significantly dampen its
   positive effect on support for Putin.},

Abstract = {One of heatlh policies implemented by the hospital is the minimum
   service standards (MSS). MSS is a benchmark of hospital service quality
   in providing services to the public. Talking about health service
   quality problem, it was found out as the field fact that the achievement
   of MSS indicator in General Hospital of Dr. H. Koesnadi Bondowoso,
   Indonesia in 2016 still did not fulfill target of standard hospital
   service (type B) and minimum service standard (MSS) of hospital. This
   fact shows that the quality of health services in general hospital of
   dr. H. Koesnadi Bondowoso is still low. So, this research aims to
   describe the policy implementation of minimum service standard and to
   analyze the obstacles in the implementation of MSS policy at general
   hospital of dr. H. Koesnadi Bondowoso. So, this research would discuss
   the policy implementation of minimum service standards by using Edward
   III concept as a tool to analyze it. This research employed qualitative
   research with phenomenological approach. The results showed that the
   implementation of MSS policy of dr. H. Koesnadi Bondowoso general
   hospital still did not run well. This was due to several factors such as
   communication, bureaucratic structure, sources, dispositions (attitude)
   and leadership in sectoral ego control. Sectoral ego can be shaped from
   educational background of specialist doctors who still adhered seniority
   and lack of individual role of implementor in building interpersonal
   communication and conflict management.},

Abstract = {It is widely assumed that a representative democracy requires an
   enlightened citizenry in order to function properly. The competence of
   citizens has been studied extensively and the sociodemographic
   determinants of political sophistication are particularly well known.
   Much less is known about whether and how citizen competence affects
   electoral behaviour and outcomes. This article reviews the existing
   literature on these topics. Despite the widespread consensus that,
   generally speaking, citizen competence matters for electoral outcomes,
   the review produced a mixed result: some studies suggest that the
   political left would benefit from a better-informed electorate, while
   other studies suggest the opposite. Although the majoritarian electoral
   context is overrepresented in the evidence, the review shows that at the
   individual level, political knowledge greatly increases a person's
   ability to match personal preferences with the right candidate or party
   in an election. The article also identifies several gaps in existing
   knowledge, thereby suggesting future research questions.},

Abstract = {The Select Committees of the House of Commons have, in the past, been
   perceived as a parliamentary backwater, supporting debate but lacking
   real influence in the Chamber. Over the course of the past two decades,
   however, some Select Committees have distinguished themselves as more
   than authors of advisory reports. The Treasury Select Committee
   (Treasury Committee) has been at the forefront of this development. The
   article follows the Treasury Committee's progress from an awkward and
   rarely heard backbench Committee, moving beyond its original remit to
   become a high-profile public platform where Government, quangos and even
   the private industry are scrutinised and brought to account on their
   actions.},

Abstract = {The Canadian government and military struggled to control its media
   framing of the war in Afghanistan between 2006 and 2009. This content
   analysis (n = 900) critically investigates the mediated dynamic of
   framing Canada's military mission in Afghanistan. This study found that
   while journalists overwhelmingly indexed their stories to elite sources,
   they frequently impeached the frames sponsored by government and
   military leaders. Journalists used elite criteria to fact check the
   frames of military and government leaders. Most of the coverage was
   episodic and event-oriented rather than thematic and contextual. While
   Canadian journalists challenged official claims of improving security,
   for instance, their coverage lacked context and critical appraisal of
   Canada's military mission in Afghanistan, raising questions about
   journalism's normative role in Canadian democracy.},

Abstract = {During the Cold War, the Truman doctrine guided America towards
   extensive involvement throughout Latin America. Today, American private
   security companies recruit heavily from this region, drawing some of the
   same men who the CIA had covertly trained in the 1970s-1980s to fight in
   the modern manifestation of other Cold War conflicts in Iraq and
   Afghanistan. Currently, both American and foreign proxy conflicts
   continue to expand while relying heavily on Latin American mercenaries,
   raising important questions on the status of Latin American fighters in
   the world and their influence on the character of modern warfare.},

Volume = {16},

Abstract = {We provide new theory and evidence of the role of domestic women's
   coalitions in the adoption of gender quotas. Previous research has shown
   the importance of women's movements to policy change. We show that
   specific types of mobilization, often multiethnic in character, are a
   more precise way of describing these influences. Using a new dataset of
   coalitions in 50 countries in Africa (1989-2014), we first examine where
   coalitions are likely to emerge. Controlling for factors that correlate
   with their formation, we find that when domestic women's organizations
   form a coalition for quotas, governments are more likely to adopt them
   and do so more quickly. This correlation holds when controlling for
   international aid, involvement of international women's movements, and
   whether countries recently emerged out of major armed conflict,
   complementing recent scholarship that highlights global influences. A
   comparative case study of the adoption of a gender quota in Senegal and
   non-adoption in Benin helps illustrate the nuances of the theory.},

Abstract = {While human trafficking often conjures up images of victims being taken
   by force, in reality, a minority of today's slave population are
   physically abducted. Rather, a significant share of human trafficking
   victims are ``pushed{''} (e.g., trying to escape crisis conditions) or
   ``pulled{''} (e.g., pursuing the prospect of economic opportunities)
   into situations of high risk. This study focuses on those who are
   ``pulled{''} into risky scenarios, assessing when individuals make
   decisions that may put themselves at risk. I assume that individuals are
   boundedly rational, and propose an aspiration-based model of
   decision-making, which predicts that increased salience in relative
   deprivation can lead individuals to be more risk-seeking, putting
   themselves and their children at greater risk for exploitation. Using
   both an original survey experiment and nationally-representative data in
   Nepal, I find that consistent with the theoretical model, perceptions of
   relative deprivation induce more risk-seeking behavior. This result
   speaks to the interaction between inequality and risk tolerance, and how
   economic and social forces that alter perceived relative deprivation can
   increase vulnerability to exploitation.},

Abstract = {As new technologies upend traditional power structures grounded in an
   information asymmetry between the state and its populace, governments
   are finding new ways to entrench state secrecy and inhibit individual
   secrecy. The global migration of everyday activities to the online realm
   is being met by surveillance technologies and techniques which have
   turned the Internet into a virtual panopticon. As states seek to
   legitimize the extension of surveillance into almost every realm of
   public and private lives, they are constructing legal frameworks that
   embed technical capabilities in layers of secrecy and opacity, rolling
   back hard-won legal protections and removing surveillance from the
   jurisdiction of accountability and redress mechanisms. This article
   focuses on the multiple layers of human rights violations inflicted by
   modern state spycraft. First, the inhibition of the enjoyment of rights
   such as privacy, free association, speech and opinion, and second, the
   deprivation of citizens from access to information, redress},

Abstract = {During the congressional fight over the Affordable Care Act (ACA),
   interest groups spent record sums on television issue advertising in
   targeted efforts to influence members of Congress, but did the money
   make any difference? We use the literatures on outside lobbying and
   legislative behavior to develop two hypotheses about issue advertising's
   effects on members' voting decisions. We test the hypotheses using
   population-weighted, station-level advertising data mapped into
   congressional districts. We find negligible evidence that issue
   advertising had a causal effect on either House committee or floor votes
   on the ACA, even applying forgiving statistical standards. Neither do we
   find evidence when we ignore the endogeneity bias that should inflate
   advertising's effects, employ alternative measures and specifications,
   or limit the analysis to legislators for whom the probability of vote
   change was highest. The results justify skepticism that the millions of
   advertising dollars spent on the ACA had a net effect on members' voting
   decisions. In conclusion, we consider several reasons why our hypotheses
   are not borne out and suggest several avenues for future research.},

Abstract = {Against the legal recognition of same-sex marriage, many advocates of
   religious liberty argue that those who adhere to ``traditional{''}
   understandings of marriage should not be forced to ``recognize{''}
   same-sex marriages. This includes exempting individual business owners
   engaged in commercial activity from anti-discrimination laws. I argue
   that such exemptions overreach. Equal access to the commercial arena is
   an essential feature of life in America's commercial republic, which
   means that public accommodations should not be given exemptions on
   religious grounds. Yet this does not require business owners to morally
   approve of same-sex marriage; nor does it require them to grant same-sex
   marriages ``equal concern and respect.{''} Rather, it requires simple
   toleration, which is compatible with moral disapproval. Indeed, I argue
   that this is the very sort of toleration at the foundation of religious
   liberty in America. Efforts to grant religious exemptions to
   anti-discrimination laws invite the return of religious conflict and
   discrimination. Prohibiting discrimination on the basis of sexual
   orientation in public accommodations is necessary not only for equal
   citizenship, but to maintain the regime of toleration that undergirds
   religious liberty in a pluralistic democracy.},

Abstract = {In 1889, following ideological tussles with his Anarchist comrades,
   William Morris was stripped of his role as editor of Commonweal, the
   Socialist League's propagandist paper. In 1891, having withdrawn from
   the League, he immersed himself in the production of decorative books at
   his newly formed workshop, the Kelmscott Press. This turn from
   ``official{''} activism to intensive aesthetic activity has fascinated
   countless scholars, in particular those who have viewed Morris as a
   revolutionary socialist. To them, the Kelmscott venture has seemed
   inscrutable. How could his apparently aestheticist post-{''}militant{''}
   phase crown his years of unflagging activism?
   In addressing this question, I read the Kelmscott project dialectically:
   both as Morris's rejection of Socialist-League-style propaganda and as
   the creative offspring of his intensifying discontent with the League's
   fractiousness. Discernible in this accruing disenchantment is Morris's
   source material for consummating a radically new form of socialist
   education, concretized in the praxis of the Kelmscott Press.},

Abstract = {As Republican candidate for president and later 45th President of the
   United States, Donald Trump has claimed repeatedly and vociferously that
   the 2016 General Election was tainted by massive voter fraud. Here we
   use aggregate election statistics to study Trump's claims and focus on
   non-citizen populations across the country, state-specific allegations
   directed at California, New Hampshire, and Virginia, and the timing of
   election results. Consistent with existing literature, we do not uncover
   any evidence supportive of Trump's assertions about systematic voter
   fraud in 2016. Our results imply neither that there was no fraud at all
   in the 2016 General Election nor that this election's administration was
   error-free. They do strongly suggest, however, that the expansive voter
   fraud concerns espoused by Donald Trump and those allied with him are
   not grounded in any observable features of the 2016 election. (C) 2017

Journal = {EUROPEAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW},

Volume = {10},

Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Traditional research on preferences for redistributive social policy
   suggest increasingly complex models of public opinion formation that
   envision individuals balancing normative concerns against sophisticated
   calculations of economic self-interest. This research largely ignores
   the large body of evidence demonstrating significant differences in
   levels of political awareness across the population that strongly
   influence the quality, structure, and determinants of political
   preferences. Analyzing public opinion data for 14 European countries
   reveals that large sections of the population do not appear to hold or
   express social policy preferences that are internally consistent or
   well-grounded in either their self-interests or ideological
   predispositions. At low levels of political awareness, little
   discernible connection exists between seemingly related preferences for
   redistribution, levels of social spending, left-right positioning,
   tolerance for inequality, or overall support for the welfare state.
   Moreover, income, a theoretically central causal variable, has no effect
   on attitudes toward redistribution when political awareness is low.
   These results pose a significant challenge to existing models of social
   policy preferences.},

Abstract = {This article studies Marini's view on the `overexploitation of the
   labour power' and it reviews the contributions of this concept to the
   understanding of the Latin American capitalism. The concept of
   `super-exploitation' is interesting to explain the exploitation of the
   working class in Latin America amid the shift of global economy since
   the 1970s onwards. However, Marini has a `stagnationist' interpretation
   about overexploitation and this idea does not grasp accurately the
   current dynamic of capitalism. The debate about the contributions and
   shortcomings of Marini's view is framed in the work of contemporary
   authors from the Marxist dependency theory.},

Abstract = {In an election characterized by countless headlines, the refusal of
   Republicans to support their party's nominee was a constant topic of
   discussion in 2016. Our paper looks to explain why Republican members of
   Congress joined the so-called \#NeverTrump movement. In the first part,
   we document the varied-and often contradictory-explanations of the
   \#NeverTrump movement offered by journalists, pundits, and politicians
   during the campaign. We then categorize these popular explanations into
   four theoretical categories: policy preferences, identity, electoral
   motivations, and establishment dynamics. In the second part, we test the
   varied claims. We believe two findings stand out and have broader
   implications for American politics. First, despite the popular belief
   that members of Congress are single-minded in their pursuit of
   reelection, we found that a lawmaker's religion and sex-both in the
   identity category-had the largest effects on the decision to join the
   \#NeverTrump movement. Second, the results show that establishment
   Republicans were more likely to support Donald Trump's candidacy.
   Notably, the direction of this effect is inconsistent with popular
   explanations of the \#NeverTrump movement but consistent with a range of
   academic studies.},

Abstract = {How can one explain the recent fascination with sport as a tool of
   government policy in Russia? This paper argues that sports policy in
   Russia is an essential part of policies to encourage nationalism and one
   which borrows heavily from the Soviet past. Based on the analysis of
   meeting transcripts available on the Kremlin website and other
   materials, this paper argues that there are five key mechanisms by which
   the Kremlin uses the Soviet sport legacy to promote nationalism. This
   use of sport has implications for the popular reception of Putin's

Abstract = {Citizenship tests are arguably intended as moments of hailing, or
   interpellation, through which norms are internalized and
   citizen-subjects produced. We analyse the multiple political subjects
   revealed through migrants' narratives of the citizenship test process,
   drawing on 158 interviews with migrants in Leicester and London who are
   at different stages in the UK citizenship test process. In dialogue with
   three counter-figures in the critical naturalization literature - the
   neoliberal citizen'; the anxious citizen'; and the heroic citizen' - we
   propose the figure of the citizen-negotiator', a socially situated actor
   who attempts to assert control over their life as they navigate the test
   process and state power. Through the focus on negotiation, we see
   migrants navigating a process of differentiation founded on pre-existing
   inequalities rather than a journey toward transformation.},

Abstract = {The adoption of bicameralism in the world is increasingly an
   authoritarian phenomenon: while the percentage of bicameral democracies
   is in decline, there has been a steady increase in bicameral
   non-democracies. What makes non-democracies turn to bicameralism? We
   argue that bicameralism may serve as a means of post-conflict
   reconciliation or control of the legislature when the opposition gains
   seats in the lower chamber. We also propose a novel explanation whereby
   the introduction of bicameralism helps to mask a set of more
   controversial constitutional reforms. Drawing on a new dataset on second
   chambers from 1945 to 2016, we find that bicameralism is more likely to
   be adopted during years when formal presidential term limits are in
   place or when leaders are in their last term. This is because
   bicameralism is often a by-product of broad institutional reform that
   assists in justifying and legitimating the need for constitutional
   revision and in masking the extension of presidential term limits. The
   findings improve our understanding of institutions and institutional
   origins in dictatorships.},

Title = {ZOMIA ON THE AMUR, OR STATE ORDER AGAINST THE ORDER OUTSIDE OF STATE},
Journal = {POLITEIA-JOURNAL OF POLITICAL THEORY POLITICAL PHILOSOPHY AND SOCIOLOGY
   OF POLITICS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {88},
Number = {1},
Pages = {148-171},
Abstract = {In the article the authors utilize the term ``Zomia{''} coined by Willem
   van Schendel, the Dutch researcher, to refer to a giant ``mountainous
   country{''} located at the junction of a number of states in South-East
   Asia, in order to derive a concept, which reflects a specific form of
   social self-organization, a special type of everyday life that does not
   require the usual structures of the state of Modernity - it coexists
   with them and defends its right to be different. The authors study such
   form of self-organization using the example of the community of the
   resettled peasants that developed in the east of Russia in the second
   half of the 19th - early 20th centuries. Having analyzed the factors
   that led to the emergence of Zomia on the Amur, they come to the
   conclusion that the main factor was the big size of the territory, which
   killed any administrative efforts. The control over the giant
   territories with a relatively poor network of roads was too costly,
   which rendered it meaningless. The situation inevitably triggered the
   mechanism of social self-organization, which made the usual political
   forms superfluous and hostile to the people. They developed specific
   practices of distancing themselves from the state and using the latter
   in their own interests. The article describes these practices, as well
   as the resistance of the resettled peasants to the attempts made by the
   power structures to ``domesticate{''} the disobedient territory that
   increased as the state strengthened. Although Zomia lost its fight
   against Leviathan, its defeat, as shown by the authors, was a mere
   transition to a different form of existence. Zomia continued to exist so
   that at a time when the Leviathan, exhausted by the vast void space,
   retreats, Zomia will appear out of nowhere and once again save the Far
   East.},

Abstract = {The term ``populism{''} fails to adequately describe the contours of the
   new illiberal conservatism. Russia is of particular importance for this
   movement against (neo-)liberalism. Long before President Putin's swing
   towards conservatism in 2011-2013, a conservative intellectual field was
   formed that gained in influence in several bursts. This essay outlines
   this process and analyses how development and tradition are connected as
   key conservative concepts in Russia, and why the new Russian
   conservatives, despite their declared loyalty to Putin, continue to have
   a strained relationship with those in power.},

   efforts were confronted by several forms of violence, ranging from civil
   war to a high level of politically motivated violence. In this article,
   we ask how and why administrations in French Cameroon, New Guinea,
   Kosovo and Timor-Leste implementing (de)securitised such violence - by
   addressing it as a serious threat and imple-menting policies of
   protection, by portraying it as something manageable or even by ignoring

Abstract = {Fissures between the ruling Partido Socialista Unido de Venezuela (PSUV)
   and its grassroots base widened amid disaffection with the dismal
   economic performance of President Nicolas Maduro's government and the
   trend of militarization in his administration. Economic crisis and
   chronic insecurity accelerated migration. Opposition strategies of
   violent protest resumed as the executive continued to bypass the
   opposition-controlled legislature. Long-term divisions within the Mesa
   de la Unidad Democratica (MUD) alliance over strategies for removing the
   government prevented the opposition from capitalizing on social
   discontent. The rift between parties supporting electoral approaches and
   more radical perspectives pressing for the overthrow of the government
   were replicated among external actors, whose interventions aggravated
   rather than alleviated political tensions.},

Abstract = {Many individuals learn about politics from other people instead of
   directly from the media. While this could be a good way to reduce
   information costs, highly controlled lab experiments reveal that the
   information exchanged can be biased. These important lab experiments are
   so controlled, however, that they ignore the complexities of language
   inherent in real-world information transmission. In an effort to improve
   our understanding of how political information changes as it propagates
   from the media to one person to another, I conduct a novel online
   experiment in which I track information diffusion through individuals in
   communication chains. I then use content analysis to examine how the
   information is actually changing, finding that the amount of political
   information communicated decreases as the number of people in the chain
   increases. Furthermore, the information is increasingly distorted as the
   length of the chain increases.},

Abstract = {The year 2017 was marked by growing uncertainty about the future as Evo
   Morales continued to prepare for yet another presidential campaign
   despite growing resistance and a 2016 referendum in which voters
   rejected a constitutional amendment that would allow Morales to seek a
   fourth term. The year was also dominated by plans for the December
   judicial elections, which were just as problematic as they had been in
   2011. While economic indicators remained generally positive, there was
   also growing concern about the future of the economy. 2017 was also the
   first year that the quality of Bolivian democracy declined
   significantly, suggesting that 2018 could be a defining year for the
   country.},

Journal = {ASIAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {26},
Number = {3, SI},
Pages = {352-370},
Abstract = {Postcolonial scholarship on nuclear weapons has demonstrated that
   mainstream literature perpetuates a set of orientalist discourses about
   `Enlightenment' and `civilization' which legitimizes global hierarchies.
   What has been less studied is the role of non-Western countries in
   challenging or perpetuating these discourses. This article focuses on
   the discourse of `nuclear responsibility' as it has been deployed by
   Indian official to challenge Western discourses of nuclear
   responsibility that are linked to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty
   (NPT). Using Judith Butler's concept of resignification, we argue that
   India has sought to resignify the Western discourse of nuclear
   responsibility such that it is linked to nuclear disarmament and
   equality rather than nuclear nonproliferation and hierarchy. In its
   discourse on nuclear responsibility, India's status as a responsible
   nuclear power is based, not on its compliance with international regimes
   or norms, but on its `civilizational exceptionalism'. We argue that
   resignification is a form of non-western agency but is highly
   circumscribed. Its success has been dependent upon the broader global
   political context and has been limited to moving India up the global
   nuclear hierarchy rather than challenging the hierarchy itself.},

Abstract = {Within the literature, there is an ongoing debate on how to understand
   the broader implications of the process of electoral dealignment. While
   some authors argue that dealignment leads to a more `open' electorate
   that ponders the options offered by the party system, other authors have
   argued that dealignment leads to a general alienation from the party
   system. In this article, we investigate the relation between
   partisanship, indifference towards political parties, and alienation
   from the party system, on the basis of an analysis of the voter surveys
   of the European Election Studies project, 1989-2014. The results
   indicate not only that dealignment is associated with indifference as
   well as with alienation but also that the relation with alienation is
   much stronger, both on an aggregate and on an individual level. We
   conclude, therefore, that dealignment could pose a challenge for the
   legitimacy of the party system as a whole.},

Abstract = {The theory and practice of urban governance in recent years has
   undergone both a collaborative and participatory turn. The strong
   connection between collaboration and participation has meant that
   citizen participation in urban governance has been conceived in a very
   particular way: as varying levels of partnership between state actors
   and citizens. This over-focus on collaboration has led to: 1) a dearth
   of proposals in theory and practice for citizens to engage
   oppositionally with institutions; 2) the miscasting of agonistic
   opportunities for participation as forms of collaboration; 3) an
   inability to recognise the irruption of agonistic practices into
   participatory procedures. This article attempts to expand the conception
   of participatory urban governance by adapting Rosanvallon's (2008) three
   democratic counter-powers-prevention, oversight and judgement-to
   consider options for institutionalising agonistic participatory
   practices. It argues that these counter-governance processes would more
   fully realise the inclusion agenda that underpins the participatory
   governance project.},

Abstract = {The article explores and explains Germany's pre-emptive ``No' to the war
   in Iraq and argues that the ``No' was not a structural break in the
   relationship with the US, although for many its dramatic consequences
   appeared as a parting of ways' of two close allies. With the European
   Union deeply divided and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization split
   into two camps, the result was a profound disunity of the West. After
   the war in Kosovo and the German military contribution to the war on
   terror' in Afghanistan, there was no chance that the SPD/Green coalition
   would have been able to put together its own majority for an additional
   war effort in Iraq. Opposing a perceived US unilateralism was popular
   and an opportunity to stand up to the Bush administration. On a more
   fundamental level, Germany reclaimed the right to national sovereignty
   in spite of its commitment to multilateralism. This self-assertion was a
   new development for German foreign policy and it will also characterise
   Germany's actions in the future. With the arrival of the Trump
   administration in Washington and its challenge to the liberal world
   order America created after World War II, the US and Germany could end
   up on an even more profound collision course.},

Abstract = {Marx's humanism haunts the 1844 Economic and Philosophic Manuscripts,
   which reserves species-being for humans alone, with the capacity for
   free conscious life activity. This is problematic and seemingly does not
   represent what we know about the lives of other species. This essay
   departs from the humanist tradition and argues that Marx's relational
   ontology and concept of species-being can be extended to the nonhuman
   world, bringing Marx up to speed with evolutionary biology and animal
   studies. Nonhumans possess the capacity to change our material world and
   live subjective lives, and many times they are the better examples of
   Marx's ideal species-being. Enlarging Marx's concept of species-being
   provides space for the consideration of nonhuman animals by enlarging
   the scope of the polis. This situates nonhumans as vital members of
   political and ecological communities capable of enacting material change
   while acknowledging the agency of diverse organisms and their dependence
   on one another in creating their communal lives.},

Abstract = {Timor-Leste chose semi-presidentialism as its government system to steer
   the country towards a democratic state. This government system became
   popular in the course of the Third Wave' of democratization, but has no
   other example in Southeast Asia. The Timorese Constituent Assembly was
   guided not by an appraisal of the virtues and pitfalls of competing
   systems, but by historical and political factors that led it to craft an
   institutional solution in line with significant features of Timorese
   society. Yet the specific form of semi-presidentialism adopted in
   Timor-Leste (president-parliamentarism') is regarded in the literature
   as prone to instability. However, in spite of episodes of instability,
   the conclusion emerging from three consecutive presidencies is one of
   positive steps in democracy-building and consolidation. This is mainly
   due to the emergence of independent' presidents who have sought
   power-sharing arrangements and promoted inclusive governance.},

Abstract = {The objective of this article is to reflect about the analytical
   possibilities that the notion of ``institutionalization{''} gives us,
   inquiring if possible to open up new perspectives that - being in a
   pragmatic conception-allow us to orient ourselves other uses of the
   concept of institutionalization. In the first part, we will present an
   experience that, emerging in one of the cases worked in our doctoral
   thesis in progress, it constituted the shot from which we ask and
   reflect on the analytical possibilities that gives us the notion of
   ``institutionalization{''}. In the second part, we will expose the
   notion of institutionalization made by O'Donnell (1996) and propose its
   complementation - and interpretation-with the theoretical contributions
   of Wittgenstein, Giddens and Nun. In the third part, we draw some points
   of contact between the theoretical construct elaborated and the
   experience that worked as a shot, using the case as an example of
   reference. Finally, we'll reflect on the potential of the proposed
   analysis.},

Pages = {277-303},
Abstract = {The movement of proletarian women of the Social Democratic Party of
   Germany, and by extension of the Second International (18891914), was
   structured by Clara Zetkin around the principle of a ``clean break{''}
   between the women of the exploiting and exploited classes, which laid
   the programmatic foundations for the development of a mass movement of
   socialist working women that eventually grew to have 174,754 members in
   1914. This movement, whose central axis was the magazine Die Gleichheit
   edited by Zetkin, had as its central organizational proposition the idea
   that Marxism, as a working-class political tendency, and feminism, as a
   multi-class movement, were incompatible, and that therefore
   working-class women had to have their own organizations within socialist
   parties which also included working-class men. The International
   Socialist Women's Movement, which celebrated its first conference in
   Stuttgart in 1907 and adopted universal female suffrage as its central
   transitional slogan, was responsible for the proclamation of
   International Women's Day by the Second International Socialist Women's
   Conference held in Copenhagen in 1910. The Russian Revolution started
   with demonstrations organized by the working women of Petrograd to
   celebrate International Women's Day. The article closes with a brief
   assessment of the legacy of the proletarian women's movements.},

Abstract = {This essay draws on Antonio Gramsci's theoretical and philosophical
   insights to provide an alternative approach to mainstream Latino
   politics research that also introduces students to Gramsci. It contends
   that Gramsci provides a framework both for rigorously thinking about the
   challenges facing Latinos living in the United States and also for
   advancing an oppositional democratic politics in the face of the
   authoritarian turn in contemporary neoliberalism. Gramscian thought
   provides a theory and method for studying politics that can account for
   the structural conditions in which Latinos engage in politics,
   permitting the identification of dominant groups' methods of building
   consensus for authoritarian rule. Moreover, Gramscian theory provides
   analytical tools for conceptualizing an alternative approach to Latino
   politics research that is oppositional, theoretically driven, and
   grounded in a praxis focused explicitly on the empowerment of subaltern
   Latinos, such as the undocumented, refugees, indigenous ``Latinos{''},
   Afro-Latinos, and LGBT Latinos, among others.},

Abstract = {There has been a significant proliferation of voluntary philanthropic
   organizations to deliver basic services in the current context of
   anti-welfare neoliberal policies pursued by the state. While there are
   numerous studies and publications on these voluntary organizations, the
   nature of their relationship with the state remains relatively
   under-researched. This article attempts to explore this issue in the
   case Singapore where, in the absence of an active welfare state, the
   voluntary philanthropic organizations -especially the Voluntary Welfare
   Organizations (VWOs)-have played a crucial role in serving citizens'
   welfare needs. In evaluating the nature and determinants of this
   state-VWO relationship, the article examines some relevant theoretical
   models and applies them to the Singapore case.},

Abstract = {How to organize citizen participation in planning is continuously
   debated. The amount of Online Participatory Tools (OPTs) to facilitate
   inclusive and efficient participation has increased. While studies have
   assessed their functionality, usability and effectiveness in planning,
   they have rarely analyzed OPTs beyond single-cases, targeted tools that
   are widely used or assessed how OPTs affect broader values of
   participation. Targeting this absence, this study analyzes how ten
   applications of a widely used OPT, CityPlanner (TM), affect the
   normative, substantive and instrumental values of citizen participatory
   planning in Swedish cities. By analyzing 1,354 citizen proposals and
   interviewing urban planners, we find that citizens more extensively
   submit proposals and initiate debates on planning when using the OPT.
   Results suggest a more even age and gender distribution among proposal
   users than with conventional methods, facilitating normative values of
   participation. The OPT was generally applied early in planning and
   generated high-quality inputs. Our results, however, nuance previous
   analyses by also emphasizing the importance of place-specificity of OPT
   applications and of joint participation strategies among departments.
   Key for OPT development includes the need to improve their ability to
   analyze overarching trends among inputs.},

Abstract = {Political institutions in the U.S. continue to be dominated by men.
   Media and scholarly accounts often focus on how demand factors, such as
   political parties and elite networks, and supply factors, such as
   women's self-confidence and political interest, combine to depress
   women's representation. Yet, we know little about whether these
   narratives matter for women's political ambition or how they might
   influence women of color. We demonstrate that blaming women's
   underrepresentation on supply vs. demand causes clear changes in women's
   political ambition. Attributing women's lack of parity to demand factors
   allows white and Asian women to ``discount{''} the possibility that
   failure rests on their own abilities, thus increasing women's political
   ambition. Alternatively, framing women's underrepresentation as due to
   supply factors depresses white and Asian women's political ambition
   possibly because of stereotype threat. Black women respond in an
   opposite manner, with depressed political ambition in demand scenarios,
   while Latinas are unaffected by these narratives. Our findings
   contribute to understanding how frames intersect with racial and ethnic
   identity to influence political ambition.},

Abstract = {This article examines how activism against austerity is organized and
   manifested in London. Given that anti-austerity activists are addressing
   issues related to social welfare, we examine whether there are alliances
   between the activists and voluntary organizations (VOs) that are working
   in that field. Examining the challenges involved in creating and
   sustaining alliances, we argue that the regulatory context alone is an
   insufficient explanation as to why activist-VO alliances are difficult
   to establish and maintain. We contend that more significantly, it is
   VOs' and activists' divergent and at times irreconcilable stances, which
   we refer to as the consensus and dissensus stances, respectively, which
   impede activist-VO alliances, beyond episodic interactions, from
   developing.},

Abstract = {The present article examines the practical effects of the new social
   paradigm of transparency on the Georgian society. While contemporary
   Georgia affirms a clear European, modern orientation, there is a dark
   side to this development which needs to be addressed duly. This study
   examines the challenges that the new social changes bring: it explains
   in what ways the advent of transparency puts the functioning of the
   public sphere under risk. To explore the forms that both: transition and
   transparency assume, a complex set of qualitative methods was used
   including case studies, media analysis, focus group interviews and
   expert interviews.},

Abstract = {Contrary to populist political discourses, in South Africa the ruling
   party's approach to land policy is reproducing paternalistic relations
   that echo apartheid practices and represent the `colonial present'. This
   reality stands in stark contrast to the initial aim of land reform,
   which was conceived as part of a larger project of decolonisation. The
   latest land redistribution strategy, the Proactive Land Acquisition
   Strategy, where the state remains the landowner, is no longer consistent
   with the project of decolonisation. This is because, we argue, land
   redistribution in South Africa has drifted away from the ideal of social
   justice; it increasingly displays symptoms of what the `colonial
   present' and `recolonisation'. Party politics, as well as the emergence
   of a challenge to the ruling party from the left, has prompted a more
   radical rhetoric, but one that co-exists with deeply conservative
   practices. This paper argues that the status quo represents a betrayal
   of the idea of land reform as decolonisation, and that a radical shift
   in policy and practice is needed in order to align it with a project of
   decolonisation in South Africa.},

Title = {COMPLEX PROBLEMS OF MODERN PUBLIC CONSCIOUSNESS},
Journal = {POLIS-POLITICHESKIYE ISSLEDOVANIYA},
Year = {2018},
Number = {3},
Pages = {176-181},
Abstract = {The article is a response of an interested reader to the monograph
   published by the Institute of Sociology of the Russian Academy of
   Sciences ``Public Consciousness in an Era of Change{''}. This book is,
   in a way, a response to the increased importance of sociocultural
   factors in the life of society and to the growing interest in this
   topic. The central concept of the monograph serving as a tool for
   exploration of this sociological shift is the philosophical term
   ``public consciousness{''}, which denotes the reflection of social
   reality in the psychology of society. Though the universality and
   differentiation of this term are inferior to the ones of the concept of
   ``identity{''}, it is still a powerful tool that allows to explore the
   central part of the spiritual sphere. The aim of this article is to
   reveal that integrity, the ``monographic{''} nature of the published
   work, which is not always obvious when reading the collection of
   articles by different authors. The central plot of the book is the
   reaction of the public consciousness and, first of all, its mass forms
   to the diverse and contradictory shifts in objective reality that
   followed the end of the XX century - the beginning of the XXI century.
   The conclusion of the authors that a certain backwardness of public
   consciousness in the face of these shifts is combined with the
   simultaneous origin of the meta-ideology of humanism preserving the
   pluralism of social consciousness deserves attention. This gives hope
   for the consolidation of mankind in the future. Welcoming the fact that
   a significant part of the monograph is devoted to Russian problems, the
   reviewer does not completely agree with all the authors' statements: for
   instance, there is an obvious inconsistency of authors' positions on the
   domestic and foreign policies of Putin's Russia, which affects their
   evaluation of Russian mass consciousness. Still, the team of authors
   made a considerable contribution to the study of the Russian case.},

Abstract = {In the United States, the China Road is a hot research topic. The most
   popular research methods for American scholars studying the China Road
   can be divided into four categories. The method of historical
   interpretation involves presenting the historical context of Chinese
   development trends. Literature research is the method of carefully
   selecting the relevant literature published by the Chinese government or
   authoritative newspaper articles and periodical materials in China. The
   comparative research method involves comparing the various components of
   Chinese thinking on the subject and comparing it with the ruling ideas
   of other countries in the world. Some other American researchers adopt
   the method of field investigation touring cities and rural areas of
   China to conduct in-depth empirical studies.},

Title = {A Baltic Struggle for a ``European Memory{''}: The Militant
   Mnemopolitics of The Soviet Story},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF GENOCIDE RESEARCH},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {20},
Number = {4, SI},
Pages = {530-544},
Abstract = {This article examines the Latvian documentary The Soviet Story (by
   Edvins Snore, 2008) as a militant Baltic memory project which seeks to
   establish the parity of East and West European experiences with
   totalitarian crimes in the pan-European memory narrative of
   twentieth-century wars and genocide. The film offers a useful vantage
   point for investigating the interaction between memory politics and
   identity-building across the post-communist space and beyond. Claiming
   the inner similarity and moral equitability of Soviet communism and
   German National Socialism, The Soviet Story constitutes an epitome of
   the Historikerstreit in the Baltic fashion, debating the uniqueness of
   the Holocaust next to the crimes of communism. The so-called Holocaust
   template has been essential for the makers of the documentary in their
   insisting on the pan-European condemnation of totalitarian communist
   regimes in Europe, along with an invitation to critically review the
   role of the USSR in the Second World War. The Soviet Story is
   particularly critical about the Western discriminative standard of
   remembering the mass killings of Nazi Germany and the USSR, claiming
   such position's unsustainability on intellectual, moral, and political
   grounds. The article investigates The Soviet Story as an example of the
   cultural front in the Baltic-Russian ``memory war{''} over remembering
   the Soviet legacy, reading the film's message in the context of the
   broader East European politics of seeking pan-European condemnation of
   the crimes of totalitarian communist regimes. It further discusses the
   transnational efficacy of such mnemopolitical projects against the
   backdrop of intensified activity on the information operations front in
   the Baltic-Russian relations in recent years.},

   exercised by the prison service in Argentina. Its appears with the
   democratic recovery in 1983 and its consolidates from the negative
   effects caused by prison. In that sense, we will analyze the historical,
   political, legal and institutional variables in the beginning and
   consolidation of religious device, the social order and the pentecostal
   narratives in church-pavilions to recognize their terms, constraints and
   potentialities for the reconfiguration of power relations in prisons

   Effects on International Politics},
Journal = {POLITICA \& SOCIETA},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {7},
Number = {1},
Pages = {61-75},
Month = {JAN-APR},
Abstract = {Cyberspace has become a crucial element for political, social, financial
   and individual activities. The Information and Communication
   Technologies (ICT) have enhanced the human interactions and have
   contributed to ``reinvent{''} classical concepts such as political
   participation, political debate, decision-making. However, their
   all-encompassing, ubiquitous nature and their growing use for political
   and military purposes poses significant risks to international peace,
   stability and security. The low barrier of access to ICT capabilities,
   the speed of technological advances and the complexity of the cyberspace
   environment with regard to traditional legal definitions of borders have
   presented new challenges to States (the main actors of international
   relations) such as the inherent complexity of accurately attributing
   cyber-attacks. It is both this complexity and the frequent insistence of
   parties to attribute cyber-attacks and incidents ``beyond a reasonable
   doubt{''} that gives one the ability to deny responsibility and
   frustrate attempts to build trust and political rapport in cyberspace.
   The purpose of this research is to analyze how cyberspace affects the
   international politics. The nature of the topic dictates the use of
   qualitative analysis of primary and secondary sources such as official
   reports, declarations and policy documents, and academic analysis, in
   order to understand effects and dynamics carried out by the cyber domain
   on classical concepts such as war, peace and international relations.
   The main idea of this research is that the development of Information
   and Communication Technologies (ICTs) and the related (r) evolution of
   warfare have produced relevant effects on the dynamics of the
   contemporary international system highlighting, at the same time, how
   the militarization of the cyber domain has posed consequences on
   international security, peace and stability. However, the lack of
   specific research related to ``cyberspace's effects on international
   politics{''} highlights the need to devote more attention on this topic
   bearing in mind that, more extensive and enduring analysis on
   cyberspace's dynamics might allowed policy makers the opportunity to
   improve awareness related to cyber threats in order to governing
   challenges emerging from the digital sphere.},

Abstract = {This article is the transcription of the Lectio Magistralis that
   professor Oreste Massari pronounced on the occasion of his retirement as
   a university professor and that was held in Rome on October 31, 2017.
   Throughout his intellectual and academic life he has analyzed the
   evolution of Italian parties and its party system as well as the
   evolution of the British parties, especially the Labor Party, the
   Westminster model and, in a more general way, the relevance of political
   leadership, the evolution of party models and the relationship of
   parties with democracy. His intellectual trajectory shows us how the
   Italian political system has changed in the last 40 years as well as the
   evolution and conceptual development of the analysis of parties and
   party systems, the development of the Italian and European political
   science and, finally, the challenges that parties and democracy face in
   the coming years.},

Abstract = {Cybersecurity sits at the intersection of public security concerns about
   critical infrastructure protection and private security concerns around
   the protection of property rights and civil liberties. Public-private
   partnerships have been embraced as the best way to meet the challenge of
   cybersecurity, enabling cooperation between private and public sectors
   to meet shared challenges. While the cybersecurity literature has
   focused on the practical dilemmas of providing a public good, it has
   been less effective in reflecting on the role of cybersecurity in the
   broader constitution of political order. Unpacking three accepted
   conceptual divisions between public and private, state and market, and
   the political and economic, it is possible to locate how this set of
   theoretical assumptions shortcut reflection on these larger issues.
   While public-private partnerships overstep boundaries between public
   authority and private right, in doing so they reconstitute these
   divisions at another level in the organization of political economy of
   liberal democratic societies.},

Abstract = {With growing affective polarization in the United States, partisanship
   is increasingly an impediment to cooperation in political settings. But
   does partisanship also affect behavior in nonpolitical settings? We show
   evidence that it does, demonstrating its effect on economic outcomes
   across a range of experiments in real-world environments. A field
   experiment in an online labor market indicates that workers request
   systematically lower reservation wages when the employer shares their
   political stance, reflecting a preference to work for co-partisans. We
   conduct two field experiments with consumers and find a preference for
   dealing with co-partisans, especially among those with strong partisan
   attachments. Finally, via a population-based, incentivized survey
   experiment, we find that the influence of political considerations on
   economic choices extends also to weaker partisans. Whereas earlier
   studies show the political consequences of polarization in American
   politics, our findings suggest that partisanship spills over beyond the
   political, shaping cooperation in everyday economic behavior.},

Abstract = {The article is devoted to the problem of non-state entities in a
   changing nature of world politics. Hamas and Hezbollah are seen as major
   non-governmental actors in the Middle East with great potential to
   influence regional political processes including the Palestinian-Israeli
   peace talks. The authors made an attempt to conduct comparative analysis
   of those movements' compliance with the benchmarks of an actor (drafted
   by J. Nye, R. Keohane and other prominent political scientists) so as to
   assess its roles and positions in the region. Suggestions on shaping
   foreign policy towards those non-state actors were made and strategies
   of its incorporation in the world order were investigated. The authors
   described negative and positive projections of such an engagement of
   Hamas and Hezbollah in the regional processes and gave their perspective
   on the feasibility of each scenario.},

Abstract = {Pape {[}2005. Dying to win: The strategic logic of suicide terrorism.
   New York: Random House] famously argued that suicide terrorism is
   specifically designed to coerce democracies. However, also several
   autocracies have been targeted. This article argues that suicide attacks
   as a strategy of coercion rely on a general expectation of being able to
   raise the cost of conflict for the target state. Raising costs may
   require attacking different types of targets depending on the regime
   type one seeks to coerce. While the cost of conflict can be raised for
   democracies by attacking civilian targets, it can be raised for
   autocratic regimes if the targets are chosen strategically, for example,
   by focusing on actors that are particularly important for the
   government. The article then analyzes statically the risk of government
   targets being attacked with all incidents of suicide attacks in the
   Global Terrorism Database, 1981-2014. The results corroborate the
   hypothesis that the more autocratic the regime, the more likely are
   suicide terrorists to attack government rather than civilian targets.},

   barriers-use of a case study as a thematic framework for the class. In
   theory, the case study engages students and renders the material less
   abstract. A research methods class recently taught by the author was
   organized around political assassinations, with an initial framing focus
   the assassination of President John F. Kennedy. In an end of semester
   Qualtrics survey, students reported that they liked this approach and
   believe that it kept them interested in the material.},

Abstract = {The article explores reasons and political meaning behind the fact that
   in the modern Russia the government is increasingly using allusions to
   the past. On the basis of the post-fundamentalist tradition in Political
   Philosophy, the author claims that during the third term of Vladimir
   Putin's presidency, history turned into a quasi-transcendence aimed at
   enriching political life with value dimension. In particular, the
   following phenomena are supportive of this statement: securitization of
   historical memory and the use of historical arguments to justify
   important political decisions. Why history was chosen as a major source
   of value legitimization of Russian polity can be explained by the
   seeming objectivity of historical facts and the underdeveloped moral
   discourse in modern Russia, when ethics of virtue trumps ethics of
   principles.
   On the basis of the discourse analysis of Vladimir Putin's speeches in
   2012-2018 the author concludes that state is the main actor of the
   Russian history, and a key political virtue is service to the state.
   Concrete historical events or figures are used to play a role of
   examples of serving the state. The arguments based on history are
   persuasive because first, the past is perceived as objective, and
   second, the images of the heroes who sacrificed their lives for the sake
   of their motherland possess emotional strength. The latter does not only
   explain the prevalence of commemorating military events in the Russian
   history, but also relegation of the topic of political repressions to
   the outskirts of the public space, so that the emotionally strong images
   of victims are not used to justify alternative political values.
   Vladimir Putin, by the means of the performative statements, introduces
   historical topics into different areas of state activity and expands the
   space of the relevant past by emphasizing the pre-revolutionary period.
   The repertoire of the historical past used for political goals comes
   down to the events that precede the beginning of the 1990s i.e., to that
   ``moment of the Political{''}, when the process of the formation of the
   modern Russian polity unfolded. This leads to the increasing
   autonomization of the space of the collective memory. Relating the
   collective ``We{''} to the distant pages of the past requires
   imagination. However, this very imagination often produces its own world
   of meanings, which is completely divorced from the real political
   problems of today.},

Abstract = {This study makes the following contributions to the study of the
   politics of patronage appointments in Latin America: Conceptually it
   adopts Kopecky, Scherlis, and Spirova's (2008) distinction between
   clientelistic and nonclientelistic types of patronage politics and
   widens these authors classification of patrons' motivations for making
   appointments, specifically as a lens for the study of patronage
   practices within Latin America's presidentialist regimes. Analytically,
   it sets up a new taxonomy of patronage appointments based on the roles
   that appointees' play vis-avis the executive, the ruling party, and the
   public administration - one that can be used for the comparative study
   of the politics of patronage. Empirically, it applies this taxonomy to a
   pilot study of the politics of patronage in Argentina and Uruguay under
   two left-of-center administrations. Theoretically, it contributes to
   theory-building by relating the findings of our research to the
   differences in party systems and presidential powers within the two
   countries under study, and to agency factors associated with the
   respective governments' own political projects. The article concludes
   that differences in patronage practices are a manifestation of two
   variant forms of exercising governmental power. a hyper-presidentialist,
   populist one in Argentina and a party-centered, social-democratic one in
   Uruguay.},

   fundamental transformation to address environmental crisis. The article
   contributes to discussions about the importance of indigenous peoples
   and local communities for better and more just policies, or whether a
   more radical approach is necessary. The research uses empirical findings
   to deepen our understanding of `local' participation under the CBD and
   uncovers many meanings. Most describe mechanisms for participation,
   suggesting scope for civic environmentalism. Yet a closer look raises a
   range of questions, leading to suggestions for future action and

Abstract = {Institutions have been mainly understood in a dualistic way: as
   abstract, macro cultural logics, or as inhabited socio-cultural sites.
   This form of dualism divided people into cognitive cultural dopes or
   persons with a heart. Scholars are now trying to overcome dualistic
   modes of thinking about people in institutions, through the
   consideration of the persons as whole human beings. In this new
   theoretical approach, it is crucial to understand how institutions frame
   individual action and how individuals shape institutions. We study this
   duality by considering the lived experience of Colombia's presidential
   transition period from Uribe to Santos in the decade of the 2010s.},

Title = {RUSSIA'S FOREIGN POLICY IN THE EVALUATION OF THE LEADERS OF THE
   NON-SYSTEM OPPOSITION: A COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS},
Journal = {SRAVNITELNAYA POLITIKA-COMPARATIVE POLITICS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {9},

Pages = {108-123},
Abstract = {After the reunification of the Crimea with Russia, the perception of the
   foreign policy course turned into a universal marker, serving to
   identify membership in specific political groups. Differences in
   assessments of Russian foreign policy became one of the reasons for the
   split within the non-system opposition. The positioning of Russian
   foreign policy has become a factor determining the prospects for
   expanding supporters of various opposition structures. The purpose of
   this study is to identify common and specific elements in assessments of
   Russia's foreign policy for the period 2014-2017 by leaders of
   non-system opposition. The empirical basis of the work was formed by
   summarizing the materials of public speeches of 13 politicians belonging
   to different segments of the non-system opposition. The perception of
   the foreign policy of official Moscow is assessed through the prism of
   positioning the situation around the Crimea, Donbass and Syria. Based on
   the findings, it was concluded that within the non-system opposition. as
   well as within its individual groups, a joint assessment of Russia's
   foreign policy was not worked out. Similarly, alternative scenarios of
   foreign policy, offered by the opposition, differ substantially. There
   are certain consensus points. So, with rare exceptions, the
   oppositionists condemn Russia's interference in the Syrian conflict in
   any form, like the idea of the need for an unconditional return of the
   Crimea to Ukraine. The common point in assessing the Kremlin's foreign
   policy is accusations of ignoring the state of the Russian economy and
   seeking to use local conflicts as a means of diverting citizens'
   attention from domestic problems. However, liberals, representatives of
   nationalists and the conditional ``patriotic wing{''} differ
   significantly in the perception of the situation in the Donhass, in many
   respects - in principle. Differences in foreign policy issues may serve
   as an obstacle to the consolidation of both the entire non-system
   opposition and its individual, ideologically close groups. At the same
   time, we can note favorable conditions for creating situational
   alliances between representatives of different ideological nominations.},

Abstract = {What influences the timing of vote choices in mixed-member systems and
   to what extent does this influence split-ticketing voting? Although
   voters cast both ballots in effect simultaneously, they may make their
   decisions on which candidate and party to support sequentially. Using
   Japan's 2012 election as a case study, empirical analyses find that the
   district nominations influence the timing of one's district vote
   intention. Meanwhile the timing of vote choices corresponds with
   ticket-splitting, even after controlling for partisan and socio-economic
   factors.},

Abstract = {Recent political events have exacerbated the tensions between the
   expectation that faculty be neutral arbiters of knowledge and
   information and the reality that many individuals pursue careers in
   political science because of their commitments to social justice,
   political activism, and social change. In particular, the November 2016
   election of Donald Trump as United States President gave New Political
   Science's (NPS) charge to publish scholarship that reflects ``a
   commitment to progressive social change{''} new meaning for many

Abstract = {In recent years, a growing body of literature has started to take up the
   issue of collectivity within the capability approach, by particularly
   examining the notion of collective capabilities, the reasons for using
   this concept, its critiques and limitations. However, a proper
   categorization of collective capabilities aiming at defining which types
   of capabilities actually are, is rarely studied. The goal of this
   contribution is to fill such gap by categorizing collective capabilities
   as well as providing a specific list of collective combined
   capabilities. The list includes two collective capabilities: the
   `resistant capability' and the `resilient capability'. After having
   briefly outlined the most recent contributions of the capability
   theorists for including the issue of the collectivity within the
   Capability Approach (CA), I then proceed as follows. First, I examine
   what collective capabilities are and why they matter for the CA. Second,
   I provide a categorization of collective capabilities based on the
   ontological difference between collective and individual capabilities.
   Third, the resulting extension of Nussbaum's version of the CA is
   carried out by including a specific list for collective combined
   capabilities. Finally, I investigate how this extension affects
   Nussbaum's CA.},

Abstract = {The verdict delivered by voters in the 2015 and 2017 British General
   Elections and the European Union Referendum surprised pollsters,
   pundits, the media, and even the victors. Political choices
   representative of Globalist outlooks saw defeat at the polls. Liberal
   Democratic support was below 10\% and voting to remain in the EU
   underperformed predictions. Empirical analyses demonstrate that there is
   a Nationalist-Globalist policy divide, partially rooted in demographics
   and authoritarian predispositions, which go beyond traditional valence
   factors in explaining the recent choices of the British electorate.
   Moreover, this outlook influences how satisfied citizens are with the
   way democracy works in Britain. Nationalist viewpoints, when juxtaposed
   against Globalist outlooks, are salient in a way they were not during
   the height of Thatcherism, encompass left-right economic concerns and
   may portend a new era in British political culture.},

Abstract = {Incentives are often discussed in the literature on the topic as a way
   to increase response rates. In this article, sample composition and item
   nonresponse are also considered. Using social exchange theory, the
   concept of social inequality is theoretically linked to the effect of
   incentives and is empirically tested using data from a recruitment
   experiment for an online survey in Austria. Since the participants of
   the Austrian micro-census were used as the selection framework, a
   detailed analysis of nonresponse is possible. Based on the four
   different incentives (a brochure, a (sic)2 commemorative coin, a C5
   commemorative coin and a (sic)10 voucher), conclusions can be drawn
   about the different forms incentives take and the values they hold. The
   results underline the potential of incentives to increase response
   rates, but at the same time they reveal potential distortion problems.},

Title = {Transformation of political elite as regime changes in Pakistan},
Journal = {ASIAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {26},
Number = {1},
Pages = {35-52},
Abstract = {Burton and Higely {[}(2001). `The study of political elite
   transformations', International review of sociology/Revue internationale
   de sociologie, 11(2): 181-199] argue that when elites of a society are
   not united this will lead to an unstable political regime. Consensual
   elite cohesion is only created through distinctive elite transformation.
   This essay attempts to elaborate their argument in Pakistan, by
   developing a link among a continuous regime shift from authoritarian to
   democratic governments and the political elites who keep transforming
   their structure accordingly. The technique followed for it is analysing
   the epochal events over time from pre-partition till date which became
   reason for regime transformations. The discussion focuses on the
   collusions and contestations of multiple power elites within given
   social context which are embedded under the international context. It
   concludes that political elites in Pakistan were always embraced by
   multiple other power elites who accordingly hold dual elite identity to
   control the command post in the political arena. Such complex elite
   structure makes it paradoxical to distinguish political elite of
   Pakistan from other power elites of Pakistan.},

Title = {Is the Philippine ``War on Drugs{''} an Act of Genocide?},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF GENOCIDE RESEARCH},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {20},
Number = {1},
Pages = {68-89},
Abstract = {Since the newly elected Philippine president Rodrigo Duterte took office
   in June 2016, more than 7,000 deaths have been linked to his ongoing
   ``war on drugs.{''} Despite international condemnation of extrajudicial
   and vigilante killings, the statistics show no sign of slowing down and
   the administration remains firm in eradicating people engaged in illegal
   drugs. This article inquires whether the Philippine ``war on drugs{''}
   is an act of genocide using Gregory H. Stanton's stages of genocide.
   Based on data drawn from news articles, policy issuances, government
   briefings, public speeches and available drug-related statistics, this
   article argues that Duterte's rhetoric and policies satisfy the stages
   of classification, symbolization, dehumanization, organization,
   polarization, preparation, extermination and denial. The analysis in
   this article hopes to send a message to the international community,
   civil society and the Philippine government that the human rights
   situation related to the ``war on drugs{''} in the Philippines needs to
   be addressed immediately. It also aims to demonstrate the utility of
   Stanton's stages in identifying early warning signs of genocide.},

Abstract = {This article investigates how the infamous terrorist organization
   Islamic State (ISIS) uses branding and political marketing as means to
   increase their intangible value and assets in order to influence their
   tangible (operational) capacities. In order to investigate the logic of
   a terrorist organization as a political actor a perspective of political
   communication is applied as a means to understand more clearly the
   propaganda of the word and the propaganda of the deed. A systematic
   communication approach is used to raise awareness of the ISIS brand in
   order to differentiate the organization and to create a greater sense of
   credibility and authenticity in an increasingly crowded marketplace of
   terrorist organizations seeking for attention, support, and fear.
   Aspects of political marketing are used in order to create sets of
   relationships of attraction and avoidance with different target
   audiences. The 15 issues of the magazine Dabiq are examined and analyzed
   within this approach. However, intangible communication and tangible
   realities do affect each other. This is evident when there is a swing
   from military victories to military defeats, which impacts on the
   quality and quantity of communicational materials produced by ISIS.},

Abstract = {In Georgia, China is rapidly gaining in importance. Trade has risen and
   China is a major investor in Georgia. Georgia's government aims to use
   Beijing's vision of establishing a New Silk Road to make the country a
   part of the southern Eurasian corridor. In 2017, Georgia signed a free
   trade agreement with China. A new infrastructure, including ports and
   railway lines, is intended to facilitate the transit of goods. Wheter
   this hope fulfils remains open. The political consequences of China's
   engagement in Georgia are unknown, too. Georgia's government holds, that
   western integration and intensive trade with the East are compatible
   goals.},

Journal = {CIVIL WARS},

Volume = {20},
Number = {2, SI},
Pages = {193-216},
Abstract = {This article highlights the political consequences of financial measures
   in post-conflict economy formation processes. It focuses on how
   microfinance for women in Bosnia and Herzegovina, even when considered
   successful, affects women's agency, what forms of female subjectivities
   emerge and what forms become excluded or reinforced as a result.
   Juxtaposing the two goals of microfinance for women - improved family
   welfare and gender equality - and the consequences, it shows how
   neoliberal discourses on female economic empowerment through
   microfinance in the context of a disappearing welfare state may enable
   limited individual agency within the household, while circumscribing
   women's agency in the public domain.},

   studies among Slovakia's secondary-school teachers},

Abstract = {This paper focuses on the impact of current nationalism studies on
   national narratives disseminated through secondary education. The paper
   draws on interviews and focus group discussions with 31 teachers in
   Slovakia as a case study and asks to what extent these teachers'
   understandings of national identity reflect primordialism,
   constructivism or ethno-symbolism. It also explores the teachers'
   awareness of these mainstream paradigms. The findings defy the
   straightforward categorisation of the teachers' views into these
   paradigms and suggest that nationalism studies have a limited impact, as
   the teachers' understandings remain unchallenged. The paper concludes
   with the implications for educational research and practice.},

Abstract = {The concept of semi-parliamentarianism provides a parsimonious
   classificatory description of Australian politics as it is really
   practiced. This concept encapsulates the tension in Australia's
   executive-legislative relations: balancing the government's requirement
   to maintain confidence only within the House of Representatives and the
   fact of the Senate's equally legitimate powers. In this way,
   semi-parliamentarianism pin-points the distinction between the
   Australian and other parliamentary systems. This has implications for
   the practice of real-world politics because political actors
   conceptualise and fulfil their roles differently in each chamber.
   Further, the paper argues that the concept of semi-parliamentarianism
   reveals why a powerful upper chamber with equal legitimacy transforms
   politics into a form that is no longer recognisably parliamentary.
   Finally, the concept of semi-parliamentarism may facilitate a more
   comprehensive integration of Australian executive-legislative relations
   into international debates.},

Abstract = {This paper provides a comparative institutionalist critique of New
   Zealand's monetary redress process for survivors of abuse in care. Using
   an Irish comparator, the paper advances an institutionalist critique
   that focusses on how programme operations affect survivors' interests.
   The paper first describes the historic claims processes in New Zealand
   and Ireland and then assesses monetary redress practice against four
   characteristic survivor interests: cost, transparency, support and
   justice.},

Abstract = {Five years on from the Tunisian revolution, Tunisia stands as the sole
   success story of the Arab Spring. The country since then has managed to
   adopt a pluralist and democratic constitution, and held three free and
   fair elections. Accordingly, in the eyes of several observers, Tunisia
   is now in the process of consolidating its new democracy. However, the
   reality on the ground seems much gloomier, as most recent opinion
   surveys suggest that there is a significant degree of dissatisfaction,
   not only with political parties and Parliament but also with the very
   institution of democracy. Nevertheless, what accounts for this change?
   After the collapse of the long-lasting and oppressive Ben Ali regime,
   how, just in five years, has Tunisians' confidence in the democratic
   process changed? This article accounts for this state of affairs from a
   party politics view, arguing that political parties, which are the main
   protagonists of the consolidation process, fail to fulfill their role of
   acquiring legitimacy for the new regime. While party-state relations
   seem to be stabilized due to the inclusiveness of the
   constitution-making process, both inter-party relationships and the
   relationship between parties and society suffer from numerous flaws
   which, in turn, hamper the democratic consolidation process.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF POLITICS AND LAW},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {11},
Number = {4},
Pages = {123-138},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {This study dealt with one of the most important parties to the syndicate
   loan contract which is the agent's bank, which is entrusted with the
   task of managing the daily loan. The task of this bank begins
   immediately after the end of the work of the organized bank and signing
   of the loan contract by its parties. The role of the agent's bank in the
   syndication loan was determined through this study, starting from
   appointing it through the tasks entrusted to it and ending with the
   termination of its powers and throughout the term of the loan, the role
   of this bank is a set of legal relations. The parties to the loan
   contract have certain specificity with respect to the responsibility of
   each party towards executing the contract in accordance with the agreed
   provisions and the required standards. This research requires the legal
   status of this bank in accordance with the different legal principles in
   the countries in which this loan originated, as well as the orientations
   of banks in the international markets. Accordingly, these relations were
   rooted in Jordanian law in the absence of legislation regulating
   syndicated loan contracts and the role of the agent bank. This study
   concluded that this bank is considered a special agent unless the Bank
   makes the same agent expressly - conclusively or factually - in a
   position that renders it liable to one of the parties for the duties of
   the agency for which the confidence of the secretariat is subdivided.},

Abstract = {This paper highlights how machine learning can help explain terrorism.
   We note that even though machine learning has a reputation for black box
   prediction, in fact, it can provide deeply nuanced explanations of
   terrorism. Moreover, machine learning is not sensitive to the sometimes
   heroic statistical assumptions necessary when parametric econometrics is
   applied to the study of terrorism. This increases the reliability of
   explanations while adding contextual nuance that captures the flavor of
   individualized case analysis. Nevertheless, this approach also gives us
   a sense of the replicability of results. We, therefore, suggest that it
   further expands the role of science in terrorism research.},

Title = {TRENDS: How Does Partisanship Influence Policy Diffusion?},
Journal = {POLITICAL RESEARCH QUARTERLY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {71},
Number = {4},
Pages = {801-812},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {We explore the role of partisanship in policy diffusion. Previous
   studies suggest that partisanship may influence the willingness of
   public officials to learn from the experience of their peers. Officials'
   willingness to consider policies endorsed by copartisans can arise
   either because party labels are used as informational cues or simply due
   to copartisan imitation. In the latter case, knowing more about the
   policy trade-offs should have no effects on politicians' preferences.
   Based on two experiments with local public officials where both the
   party endorsing a policy and the type of information provided were
   manipulated, we find consistent partisan bias. When a policy is endorsed
   by copartisans, public officials are more likely to consider pursuing
   it, and additional policy information does not mitigate this bias.
   Exploratory analyses of the information-seeking behavior of officials
   suggest that the partisan bias is not due to differential exposure or
   attention to policy trade-offs.},

Abstract = {The aim of this article is to investigate how the matrix of the
   perception of insecurity has changed from effective criminality to
   immigration of Venezuelans. Thus, we explore and compare, with
   qualitative techniques, the actual perception of insecurity among the
   inhabitants of two neighborhoods in Lima (Peru): Barrio Chamo (San Juan
   de Luringancho) and sector 1 (San Isidro). The article proposes an
   outline on the imaginary construction of the safe spaces, the attackers
   and the construction of the `we' as a community facing migration as the
   implied problem leading insecurity. The results of the comparison
   between the two areas show that migration has become synecdoche of a
   city that, amidst a process of social reassembly, has found in the
   Venezuelan migrant the scape goat of its social crisis.},

Abstract = {The 2018 elections marked a notable increase in the influence
   of-ideological media over both major American parties. Conservative
   media sources, led by Fox News Channel, further solidified their power
   within the Republican Party, maintaining their traditional role of
   informing and mobilizing Republican voters while extending their reach
   to become densely integrated with Republican elites, especially
   President Trump. At the same time, deep antipathy to the Trump
   presidency among Democratic voters produced a surge in popular demand
   for overtly liberal media programming and information about the 2018
   elections, leading to extensive citizen engagement (especially online)
   and record grassroots fundraising totals for Democratic candidates. The
   events of 2018 thus furthered two important long-term trends-the
   ideological polarization of the parties and the nationalization of
   American elections-that continue to define our contemporary political
   era.},

Abstract = {Nowadays, security issues are critically burning for the world
   community, the State and society as well as for an individual. Practical
   activities of states and other structures which ensure national security
   in general and its certain types in particular must be based on a
   comprehensive scientific study of such category as ``national
   security{''} primarily from the philosopho-legal point of view. This is
   particularly reflected in the development of the science of security
   (SoS). This article presents a comprehensive fundamental
   philosopho-legal study of the national security system. The category
   ``national security{''} is multidimensional and includes such types as
   state security, public security, personal security, information
   security, environmental security, transport security and others. In the
   article there is an attempt to reconsider the category of ``national
   security{''} from the point of view of a systematic approach to the
   analysis of the basis of differentiation of certain types in its system.
   The study is aimed at understanding the essence, nature and
   characteristics of national security. The results of this study can be
   used in public administration and legal confirmation of political
   decisions. The author comes to the conclusion that it is possible to
   distinguish national security into types in terms of 1 - a security
   object (interest to be protected) which therefore is divided into
   ``social{''} (primary) and ``non-social{''} (secondary) and in terms of
   2 - a source of a threat.},

Abstract = {Only looking at the Congress Party can obscure the fact that political
   dynasties, in different forms and degrees, exist in a number of
   political parties in India. There are many examples of political
   families ruling the roost across the states but digging deeper shows us
   that the malaise goes to the village level as well. Therefore, to
   completely examine the extent to which Indian politics is dynastic, this
   article investigates strategies and networks of a local political
   dynasty in the Meerut district of Uttar Pradesh (UP). It explores how a
   family, by getting elected its sons into the local political bodies,
   becomes a powerful political dynasty over a period of time and how entry
   of this dynasty into the Indian political system is assisted by
   political parties and caste associations. Furthermore, this article
   shows the ways in which popular notions of leadership and manhood play
   important role in the making of a dynast along with the importance of
   dynastic ties for the marginalized rather than privileged groups.},

   purpose of showing how the internet is regulated by negotiation between
   civil, governmental, and private organizations, but mercantilist
   discourses end up being imposed. Also, from this framework regulated by
   private organizations, we will analyze how control and surveillance are
   exerted in virtual spaces. These virtual platforms are like a sort of
   biopolitics that subject individuals through neoliberal subjectification

Abstract = {Despite having different trajectories and internal dynamics, the
   Colombia/FARC and the Turkey/PKK cases offer an interesting comparative
   lens through which to analyze the critical factors of any successful
   peace process. While the Colombian government and the FARC reached a
   groundbreaking peace agreement in 2016, terminating the country's
   52-year internal conflict, the peace process between the Turkish state
   and the PKK collapsed in 2015, initiating a new cycle in the
   long-running conflict. This article argues that there are three critical
   factors which have spelled success for Colombia: favorable regional
   dynamics, a weakened terrorist organization, and a well-structured
   agenda for negotiation. In contrast, complicated regional dynamics, a
   strengthened terrorist organization, and a lack of fixed agenda in
   negotiations have ultimately stymied Turkey/PKK peace efforts.},

Abstract = {This article analyzes China's foreign policy within the framework of
   debates on the rise of China in the international relations literature
   by focusing on Sino-Turkish relations and the Cyprus question. The main
   drawback of theoretical arguments about the rise of China is the lack of
   concrete evidence they provide when examining the implications of
   China's national power for its foreign policy behavior and diplomatic
   positions in international crises. Therefore this article proposes
   concrete evidence regarding Chinese foreign policy toward Turkey by
   analyzing the Cyprus question.},

Abstract = {Repeated measurements of the same countries, people, or groups over time
   are vital to many fields of political science. These measurements,
   sometimes called time-series cross-sectional (TSCS) data, allow
   researchers to estimate a broad set of causal quantities, including
   contemporaneous effects and direct effects of lagged treatments.
   Unfortunately, popular methods for TSCS data can only produce valid
   inferences for lagged effects under some strong assumptions. In this
   paper, we use potential outcomes to define causal quantities of interest
   in these settings and clarify how standard models like the
   autoregressive distributed lag model can produce biased estimates of
   these quantities due to post-treatment conditioning. We then describe
   two estimation strategies that avoid these post-treatment biasesinverse
   probability weighting and structural nested mean models-and show via
   simulations that they can outperform standard approaches in small sample
   settings. We illustrate these methods in a study of how welfare spending
   affects terrorism.},

Abstract = {Can technological change contribute to political turnover? Influential
   theories suggest that technological change represents a form of creative
   destruction that can weaken incumbents and strengthen outsiders, leading
   to political turnover. This paper investigates a large-scale historical
   natural experiment: the impact of the green revolution on single-party
   dominance in India. Drawing on a theoretical framework based on models
   of contests, this paper argues that high-yielding variety (HYV) crops
   strengthened the incentives and capacity of a politically excluded
   group, in this case agricultural producers, to seek greater political
   representation. Exploiting the timing of the introduction of HYV crops,
   together with district-level variation in suitability for the new crop
   technology, instrumental variables analyses show that the green
   revolution played a pivotal role in the rise of agrarian opposition
   parties and decline of single-party dominance. The findings support
   theories linking technological change to political turnover, with
   important implications for the political economy of democratization.},

Abstract = {In this article, I offer an economic analysis of the characteristics
   that are associated with corruption when it is facilitated through
   social exchange or guanxi as it is called in China. To that end, I
   challenge the framework applied in classic social exchange theories and
   contend that social exchange can be better distinguished from market
   exchange based on whether the intention to exchange is concealed and not
   based on the exchanging parties' subjective reflections on the nature
   and outlook of their exchange relationship. I also identify that
   corruption participants rely on a self-executable operating mechanism to
   facilitate negotiation and enforcement of exchange terms instead of the
   informal reputational system that is used in ordinary social exchange.
   In addition, I explain how the involvement of professional brokers
   democratizes guanxi-based corruption and extends the otherwise
   privileged exchange opportunities to those beyond the guanxi networks
   with lowered cost.},

Abstract = {Since the 1990s, social capital has become a frequent variable in
   various fields of social science research. In general, the theoretical
   contributions have highlighted that this resource is composed of
   dimensions such as networks, trust and social norms. In the literature
   on local participation, social capital has usually been operationalized
   based on the observation of civil associations, with a focus on the
   networks, but leaving the study of trust and social normsaside. This
   article aims to fill this gap by seeking to provide new
   operationalization tools that, based on fields such as community
   studies, urban studies or network theory, will enrich the analytical
   capacity of the social capital variable. Recognizing that social capital
   is a variable that depends on the context that surrounds it and it is
   thus inappropriate to propose a single way of measuring it, this article
   reflects on different methodological possibilities of addressing it;
   particularly on how to operationalize a variable which is both
   fundamental and ambiguous in the studies on local participation.},

Abstract = {This article proposes a genealogical study of the Greek-Roman idea of
   Fortune, recognizing as a starting point its etymological link with
   Tyche, the Greek notion for luck and chance. Through a temporary
   anachronism that will enter the archaic and classical Greek world, this
   study tries to cast light on the semantic arc of this notion, which is
   entrusted by different discourse -historical, literary, philosophical-
   in order to give an account of the diverse field of uses of Tyche. There
   would be, in this sense, two problematic percourses: one, providential,
   that would bound this notion to the legacy of the complex Agathon
   Tychein the process of divinization of Fortuna, and another, that will
   occupy our analysis, linked to the praxis and the work of `preparing
   luck' as key of everyday life. For this task Tyche will join the
   practical intelligence of metis and the critical knowledge of kairos,
   building a subjective practice that, in the classical world, will be
   profited both, by a medical art worried to attenuate hazard, and by
   political art concerned to regulate the multiplicity of actions of the
   pills through an ethic of a minimal amount of chance.},

Abstract = {Democracy greatly benefits from credible courts. If context conditions
   make democratic consolidation unlikely, as in many African countries,
   credible arbitration between political actors can be essential for
   democracy. This article argues that informal judicial networks can
   critically affect a court's credibility. Network analysis of Benin's
   Constitutional Court using original data on major politicians and all 25
   judges who have served between 1993 and 2018 provides evidence that
   biased judicial networks can jeopardize the crucial role of courts for
   democratic consolidation. In Benin, the loss of credibility under the
   Yayi presidency correlates with a clear political representation bias on
   the constitutional bench whereas socio-cultural representation remained
   balanced. Since executive and legislative appointment practices account
   for the network balance or bias, the political creation and privation of
   informal judicial relations emerges as an interesting avenue for studies
   of democratic consolidation.},

Abstract = {The contemporary world is organized into a system of territorial states
   in which rulers exercise authority inside clearly defined boundaries and
   recognize the authority of other rulers outside those boundaries. We
   develop a model to explain how the major economic and military
   developments in Europe starting in the fifteenth century contributed to
   the development of this system. Our model rationalizes the system as an
   economic cartel in which self-interested and forward-looking rulers
   maintain high tax revenues by reducing competition in the ``market for
   governance.{''}},

Abstract = {How do political scientists use online tools as part of their scholarly
   work? Are there systematic differences in how they value these tools by
   field, gender, or other demographics? How important are these tools
   relative to traditional practices of political scientists? The answers
   to these questions will shape how our discipline chooses to reward
   academics who engage with ``new media{''} such as blogs, online seminars
   (i.e., webinars), Twitter, and Facebook. We find that traditional tools
   of scholarship are more highly regarded and used more often than any new
   media, although blogs are considered most important among new media.
   However, we also find evidence that these webinars are used and valued
   at rates comparable to traditional tools when they are provided in ways
   that meet political scientists' needs. Finally, we observe that women
   and graduate students are substantially more likely than men and
   tenure-track academics to report that webinars and online videos are
   important sources of new ideas and findings.},

Abstract = {This paper analyses the cooperation of states in Southeast Asia within
   the framework established by ASEAN, that is ASEAN Ministerial Meeting on
   Transnational Crime (AMMTC) to resolving the illicit trade of Small Arms
   and Light Weapon in the region. Most of existing works on the topic
   being studied put emphasize on the importance of the existence of norms,
   the role of institutions and security cooperation in resolving the
   illicit weapons trade. However, the existing studies have not explained
   why the existing form of cooperation has not been effective. By the
   approaching of international regime theory, this article explains the
   interest based of regime that explain the background of regime formation
   which could influence state behavior to cooperate and successfully
   implement the rules of the international regime itself. The research
   applying qualitative research methods with data sourced from primary and
   secondary data from ASEAN official documents, books, journals, online
   news. This article shows that the effectivity of AMMTC to deal with the
   illicit Small Arms Trade is strongly influenced by the implementation
   commitment of the state members.},

Abstract = {Given the size of their majorities and their level of voting cohesion,
   Republicans in the 115th Congress saw unified government under President
   Trump as a historic opportunity to enact their party's priorities. Yet
   the legislative record of the 115th Congress has been less impressive
   than that of other recent majority parties in control of unified
   government. This article considers why a party that seemed so well
   positioned to deliver on its agenda has struggled to do so. It argues
   that the 115th Congress's modest level of legislative achievement
   reflects a majority party that is much less internally unified on policy
   than its roll-call voting cohesion would suggest. The case of the 115th
   Congress invites scholars to reexamine their reliance on vote-based
   measures of party unity.},

Abstract = {Although Thomas Hobbes's critics have often accused him of espousing a
   form of extreme subjection that differs only in name from outright
   slavery, Hobbes's own striking views about slavery have attracted little
   notice. For Hobbes repeatedly insists that slaves, uniquely among the
   populace, maintain an unlimited right of resistance by force. But how
   seriously should we take this doctrine, particularly in the context of
   the rapidly expanding Atlantic slave trade of Hobbes's time? While there
   are several reasons to doubt whether Hobbes's arguments here should be
   taken at face value, the most serious stems from the highly restricted
   definition that he gives to the term slave, one that would seem to make
   his acceptance of slave resistance entirely hollow in practice. Yet a
   closer examination of Hobbes's theory indicates that his understanding
   of slavery is less narrow than it might initially appearand thus that
   his argument carries a genuine political bite.},

Abstract = {The aim of this article is to contribute to the existing measurements on
   extortions by organized crime and assess the impact of this predatory
   activity on economic growth. Extortions should be evaluated beyond the
   number of reported crimes to understand how much money is drained away
   from the legal economy. To set the stage I first analyze the illegal
   activities carried out by organized crime groups in the Mexican state of
   Michoacan during 2001-14. Within this context this article presents a
   case study of extortions in the avocado legal export market.
   Specifically, this article shows how the criminal organization, the
   Knights Templar (KT), extracted rents from this legal market, what was
   the estimated magnitude of that rent, how tangential was this source of
   revenue to organized crime, and what was the adverse impact of these
   extortions of the KT on the economy of Michoacan by looking at the
   performance of the main macroeconomic variables.},

Abstract = {This article examines what socio-economic factors are conducive to
   changes in the patterns of interparty competition in Sub-Saharan Africa
   (SSA). The literature has in recent years paid considerable attention to
   measuring party system change, to identifying the consequences of party
   system instability for the proper functioning of democratic regimes, and
   to understanding what factors are responsible for the instability of
   party systems. In contrast to previous studies that view political
   change in general and party system change more specifically as the
   result of social transformation, development, modernization and change
   in the cleavage structure, this paper shows instead that poverty is the
   primary driver of party system change in the SSA region. In countries
   with high levels of poverty, political elites do enjoy little to no
   performance-based legitimacy. The lack of performance-based legitimacy
   is the reason why voters in such countries are willing to alter their
   voting habits and parties are unable to preserve their electoral
   fortunes over time-which is precisely why party systems do change. The
   literature showed that stable party systems are good for democracy. This
   paper shows that to enhance the stability of party system in SSA,
   poverty has to be reduced and possibly eradicated.},

Journal = {SCANDINAVIAN POLITICAL STUDIES},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {41},
Number = {3},
Pages = {307-335},

Abstract = {It is hardly an exaggeration to claim that one of the most turbulent
   political areas in recent years has been asylum policy, which has
   disclosed a rapidly increasing inflow of asylum seekers, and, in many
   countries, has been followed by fierce media discussion and political
   controversies. In Sweden, this development has been heated as the
   Swedish self-image is one of providing generous policies, which is also
   reflected in terms of strong refugee policy. The article uses this
   example to explore assumptions about public responsiveness in previous
   policy feedback literature and to examine the link between citizens'
   attitudes towards immigration and changes in asylum policy output,
   measured as asylums granted, over time in the period 1990-2015. It
   focuses especially on the link through which citizens become aware of
   policy output, operationalized as media visualization, and find that
   including media reveals a suppressed relationship between policy output
   and public attitudes. The relationship is negative and thus confirms the
   assumptions of the thermostatic models. Second, the article shows that
   feedback is mediated by political orientation: People defining
   themselves politically as right-oriented respond with negative feedback
   when the number of granted asylums increases, while left-oriented people
   do not change their attitudes. Based on these findings it is concluded,
   first, that analyses of democratic responsiveness need to incorporate a
   clear measure of the link by which exogenous factors become visible.
   Second, the importance needs to be stressed of considering important
   cleavages in the population in order to display responsiveness processes
   fairly.},

Abstract = {This study analyses China's One Belt, One Road (OBOR) initiative for the
   Baltic and South Caucasus countries. Trade, Foreign Direct Investments
   and transit potential are taken as main factors for the cooperation. A
   clash of China and the West in pursuing economic leadership is taken
   into account. The study suggests a new, alternative route for the OBOR
   initiative through the Caucasus, which has all the needed infrastructure
   and readiness for being started. Moreover, Georgia is not new to the EU
   preferences, it has experience of GSP+ and now the unique achievement of
   free trade regimes with the EU and China is also taken as an alternative
   route and an advantage for the Caucasus and the Baltic States.},

Abstract = {Research into the rights of minority groups to preserve their culture
   and identity has tended to focus on claims for cultural recognition made
   by indigenous peoples or other socio-economically disadvantaged groups.
   By contrast, this article examines the political appeals to culture and
   identity made by campaigners in the United Kingdom seeking to defend the
   sport of hunting with hounds in the lead up to the creation of the
   Hunting Act (2004). Opponents of the hunting ban consciously echoed
   arguments about cultural survival and cultural diversity made by
   indigenous hunters with the goal of fighting animal welfare legislation.
   These cultural arguments had little persuasive force when deployed by
   this relatively powerful and affluent group. I argue that the moral
   force of appeals to culture derive not from a vital human need for
   cultural recognition but from the imperative of redressing longstanding
   patterns of social, economic and political disadvantage.},

Title = {Race, Religion, or Culture? Framing slam between Racism and Neo-Racism
   in the Online Network of the French Far Right},

Abstract = {When debates about Islam acquire importance in the public sphere, dots
   the Far right adhere to traditional racist arguments, risking
   marginalization, or does it conform to mainstream values to attain
   legitimacy in the political system? Focusing on the aftermath of the
   2015 terrorist attacks in France, I explore the framing of Islam,
   discussing how the far right's nativist arguments were reformulated to
   engage with available discursive opportunities and dominant conceptions
   of the national identity. By looking at actors in the protest and the
   electoral arenas, I examine the interplay between the choice of
   anti-Islam frames and baseline national values.
   I offer a novel mixed-method approach to study political discourses,
   combining social network analysis of the links between seventy-seven
   far-right websites with a qualitative frame analysis of online material.
   It also includes measures of online visibility of these websites to
   assess their audiences. The results confirm that anti-Islam frames are
   couched along a spectrum of discursive opportunity, where actors can
   either opt to justify opposition to Islam based on interpretations of
   core national values (culture and religion) or mobilize on strictly
   oppositional values (biological racism). The framing strategy providing
   most online visibility is based on neo-racist arguments. While this
   strategy allows distortion of baseline national values of secularity and
   republicanism, without breaching the social contract, it is also a
   danger for organizations that made ``opposition to the system{''} their
   trademark. While the results owe much to the French context, the
   conclusions draw broader implications as to the far right going
   mainstream.},

Abstract = {Existing literature assumes a link between voting and individuals'
   political socialization, but no study has explored how political
   upbringing affects the most important attitudinal predictor of turnout:
   the duty to vote. Following previous research about the formation of
   attitudes related to the electoral process and social norms, this study
   focuses on the socialization agencies and dynamics that might first
   instill the belief during childhood that voting is a duty. The study
   also intends to contribute to political socialization theory by adopting
   a longitudinal perspective, by building upon developmental psychology
   theory and by simultaneously considering the two main childhood
   socialization agencies: family and school. A series of multivariate
   models confirms the role of family's socioeconomic status, parental
   engagement with children's education and non-authoritarian parenting
   styles, a positive effect that appears stronger than the effects on duty
   observed for Catholic schools and schools with democratic governance.},

Abstract = {Experiments demonstrate that elites can influence public opinion through
   framing. Yet outside laboratories or surveys, real-world constraints are
   likely to limit elites' ability to reshape public opinion. Additionally,
   it is difficult to distinguish framing from related processes
   empirically. This paper uses the 2009-2010 health care debate, coupled
   with automated content analyses of elite- and mass-level language, to
   study real-world framing effects. Multiple empirical tests uncover
   limited but real evidence of elite influence. The language Americans use
   to explain their opinions proves generally stable, although there is
   also evidence that the public adopts the language of both parties'
   elites symmetrically. Elite rhetoric does not appear to have strong
   effects on Americans' overall evaluations of health care reform, but it
   can influence the reasons they provide for their evaluations.
   Methodologically, the automated analysis of elite rhetoric and
   open-ended questions shows promise in distinguishing framing from other
   communication effects and illuminating elite-mass interactions.},

Abstract = {Since the Research Excellence Framework of 2014 (REF2014) `impact' has
   created a conceptual conundrum gradually being pieced together by
   academics across the Higher Education sector. Emerging narratives and
   counter-narratives focus upon its role in dictating institutional
   reputation and funding to universities. However, not only does
   literature exploring impact, rather than `REF2014 impact' per se, seldom
   see it as part of a changing sector, but it often also treats it as a
   new phenomenon within the political and social sciences. Here, we draw
   upon academic perceptions of impact set in motion in the UK during the
   1970s, we critique the underlying assumption that impact is new. We
   argue three key points to this end. Firstly, contrary to much of the
   literature examining academic perceptions of impact, it is a
   long-standing idea. Secondly, within such accounts, the effect of
   academic research on policy and society (which is long-standing) and the
   instrumentalisation of impact as a funding requirement (which is
   relatively new) are conflated. Thirdly, this conflation creates a
   novelty effect. In the context of a wider sea change to Higher
   Education, we examine different forms of consent, acceptance,
   endorsement and resistance surrounding the `new' impact agenda to argue
   that this `novelty effect' masks an important transitory process of
   acclimatisation among academics.},

Abstract = {Today the established cooperation between China and Kazakhstan has
   reached the strategic partnership level. Also, the two neighboring
   countries are partners in the international large-scale projects as the
   SCO and the New Silk Road Initiative. This paper claims that these
   projects are mostly lead by China. Moreover, it is argued that the SCO
   is aimed to solve the security issues and the New Silk Road Initiative
   embodies the economic agenda of the bilateral relations. Kazakhstan's
   role and position is significant due to different reasons, while the
   Kazakhstani public remains cautious about the Chinese activity in
   Kazakhstan. The two named mechanisms are eventually focused on
   economical and cultural leadership of China among the secured
   multilateral cooperation in the continent.},

Abstract = {This article interprets David Easton's systems theory as an attempt to
   offer a comprehensive theoretical account of how democracy might
   reconcile pluralism and stabilityone of the primary concerns of
   post-World War II democratic theory. Recognizing the limits of the
   biological and economic perspectives that have often been used to
   analyze Easton's theory, I navigate some of the conceptual ambiguities
   and tensions in his account by turning to two related branches of
   science that became prominent in the postwar era: systems science and
   cybernetics. While Easton highlights a democratic system's diffused
   political structure and its responsiveness to its members' spontaneously
   formed inputs, my investigation suggests that conceiving politics as an
   adaptive system generates and conceals tendencies toward centralized
   decision-making and the regimentation of inputs.},

   Positive Agenda arguably requires a rethink. Over the last decades, gas
   and electricity have represented the main components of this
   cooperation. Albeit highly visible, cooperation in these fields appears
   to be limited in practice. On the contrary, cooperation in other
   fields-such as renewables, energy efficiency, nuclear energy and
   emission trading-could make a real impact on long-term energy, climate,
   and environmental sustainability, and on overall macroeconomic and
   geopolitical stability. This article discusses how this change in
   priorities might be designed.},

Abstract = {This article discusses postcritique as developed in particular by Rita
   Felski, Bruno Latour and Davina Cooper. While postcritique has recently
   become subject of debate also in Italy, the aim of this essay is to show
   the relation between critique and postcritique, which I propose
   considering as a ``betrayal{''}. Critique requires a suspicious attitude
   always prepared to discover and denounce a betrayal. On the contrary,
   postcritique acts like a traitor that is not ashamed of its misconduct,
   but that takes pleasure in following its immoral passions. Indeed, a
   postcritical attitude offers at least four `instruments of pleasure'
   that this article outlines. It deals with a cartography of surface, an
   ontology of relation, a pragmatics of mediation and a politics of
   affection. These instruments allow postcritics to complete a
   metamorphosis of moles (zoopolitical figures suited to the depths) into
   snakes (animals of surface). In this way, postcritique could be
   considered as a new attitude able to make its concepts slither to the
   surface of singular networks and everyday practices.},

   audiovisual politics in the 70's},
Journal = {IZQUIERDAS},

Abstract = {The argentine political-military organization Montoneros developed a
   broad policy of mass communication. Besides searching for visibility
   through actions and publications, this organization promoted other
   strategies of communication related to artistic creation. Although a
   sophisticated ideological propaganda was implemented through official
   spaces during Hector Campora's presidency, the figures that sympathized
   with Montoneros were soon replaced. Then, their cultural projects, like
   the rest of the organization's actions, had to be clandestine. While
   several of these initiatives have been recently studied, we don't know
   much about audiovisual policies. This article explores certain political
   projects related to cinema, such as creating a film library and an
   archive of images and sound, as well as funding films in the exile after
   the coup d'etat of 1976: Montoneros: Chronicle of a War of Liberation
   (Resistance Film Group, 1977, 105 min.) and To resist (Jorge Cedron,
   1978, 78 min.). This paper analyzes these initiatives in order to show
   the communication strategies in their transformation during the new
   historical conjuncture. Texts, songs, images, words, forms and sounds
   are allied to convey a political message, trying to persuade the
   audience to continue fighting and trusting on Montoneros' leaders, no
   matter what it costs.},

Abstract = {Governments face different incentives when they reorganize many
   administrative agencies at one time rather than making infrequent,
   case-by-case changes. This article develops a theory of mass
   administrative reorganizations, which posits that the politics of
   reorganization is focused on government accountability. Viewing mass
   reorganization as a structured decision, it argues that choices about
   independence, agency organization and functional disposition have
   different impacts on the political costs of administrative policy
   making. Analyzing novel data from a recent British reorganization with
   sequential logistic statistical models provides substantial support for
   these claims. The study challenges the focus on organizational survival
   in the existing literature. By eschewing more fundamental political
   questions of democratic accountability, the prevailing approach masks
   essential politics, and in the context of this study, all influence of
   conflict due to party and agency policy positions.},

Volume = {51},

Abstract = {The fact that two senators are elected from each state offers the
   potential for natural paired comparisons. In particular, examining
   historical and geographic patterns in terms of changes in the number of
   divided US Senate delegations (i.e., states whose two senators are of
   different parties) is a useful route to testing competing models of
   American politics, including theories of split-ticket voting, party
   polarization, and realignment. Brunell and Grofman (1998) used divided
   Senate delegations to indirectly examine evidence for realignment. We
   hypothesized that a partisan realignment will necessarily lead to a
   cyclical pattern in the number of divided Senate delegations. We
   predicted that the number of divided Senate delegations at the state
   level would decline after 1996 because we conjectured that there had
   been a realignment cusp around 1980. We tested this prediction with data
   from 1952-2016 and our prediction was confirmed.},

Year = {2018},
Volume = {20},

Abstract = {The present study focuses on the analysis of the notions of memory,
   mourning and forgetfulness as fundamental elements for the construction
   of peace, based on the question of its political dimension. All of these
   from a transdisciplinary conceptual analysis, as well as a
   methodological perspective guided by a dialogue between psychoanalysis,
   philosophy and politics; This cross-linking of discourses makes it
   possible to propose a tension between subjectivity and collectivity as a
   basis for psychosocial intervention, which problematizes the political
   importance of using the past. In this sense, it is important to
   investigate the uses of memory, in order to interrogate its excesses and
   inadequacies, especially when it is intended to serve to special
   interests and its role in the grieving process is ignored, understanding
   the latter notion as a dialectic between forgetfulness and the risk of
   forgiveness.},

   perspective in order to assess the claim that the 2017 electoral series
   marked a partisan realignment. The 2017 campaign rewrote almost all of
   the rules associated with the presidential election. If Macron's
   election provides a window of opportunity to revive the French

Abstract = {This article arises as a result of the need to reflect on the
   implications and impact that the written media had on the Peace Process
   with the Paramilitaries in Colombia, which was implemented with the
   approval of Law 975 of 2005 ``Law of Justice and Peace{''}. In the
   development of this research work, it was intended through the use of
   the content analysis research technique, to answer the question: What
   was the position taken by the written media on the implementation of the
   Law of Justice and Peace in Colombia?
   It must be taken into account that the peace process arose as a
   consequence of the need to achieve better levels of human development
   and by responding to national and international normative frameworks
   regarding peace as a right. This process was considered of great
   importance because in the XX century the escalation of conflict and
   violence had a dramatic impact for the country, reaching alarming
   figures of victimization.
   It was intended to make a thorough description of the thematic agenda
   addressed by the media, having as primary sources the publications made
   by two of the most influential newspapers and with the greatest
   tradition in the country: El Tiempo and El Espectador (digital edition).
   In this sense, the items to which the media gave greater importance and
   covered more widely were identified. The sample selected for the
   analysis covers the period from February 2005 to December 2011.},

Abstract = {The rupture of the nexus between monetary and fiscal policies, which
   derives from the supranational transfer of the monetary sovereignty by
   the states, is the origin of the great macroeconomic imbalances that
   shake today some nations inserted in the EMU. In this paper we try to
   show the so-called Modern Monetary Theory, from which underlies the
   urgency of recovering the monetary-fiscal bond, and consequently, the
   need of conceiving public finances in a functional way. In contrast to
   the orthodox recommendations, which suggest fiscal balance and austerity
   as macroeconomic stabilization measures, the MMT contemplates the
   government and non-governmental sectors balances as one, being
   desirable, therefore, fiscal expansion in recession periods to achieve
   full employment, without neglecting the one related to price stability.},

Abstract = {Legislatures differ in their institutional capacity to draft and enact
   policy. While strong legislatures can increase the congruence of policy
   outcomes to the electorate's preferences, they can also inject
   uncertainty into markets with their ability to alter the political
   economic landscape. We argue that this uncertainty will manifest in a
   state's ability to borrow and hypothesize a negative relationship
   between legislative capacity and creditworthiness. Using ratings of
   general obligation bonds issued by the American states over nearly two
   decades and data on the institutional capacity of state legislative
   assemblies, we find support for the claim that having a legislature that
   is better equipped to affect policy change increases credit risk
   evaluations. The results we present broaden our understanding of the
   importance of legislative institutions, the determinants of credit risk,
   and the economic implications of democratic responsiveness.},

Volume = {13},

Abstract = {Nowadays, it is necessary for organizations to develop a
   transformational leadership style, to have a mission, a sense of
   belonging, long-term goals, shared interests and, above all, a great
   sense of interdependence. In this research, the leadership practices
   existing in the nursing personnel belonging to different public
   hospitals in Mexico were identified, based on the MLQ model (Multifactor
   Leadership Questionnaire) presented by Bass and Avolio, evaluating each
   of its dimensions and relating them to certain variables. The research
   sample consisted of 1500 nurses. The most important findings show an
   inclination towards management practices of a transactional nature,
   which has a greater correlation with the variables ``seniority{''} and
   ``staff turnover{''}.},

Abstract = {The historical neglect of the Colombian State towards Afro-descendants,
   especially women of the municipality of Buenaventura, has generated a
   systematic violation of their fundamental rights, which has resulted
   into high levels of inequality, marginalization and discrimination. The
   last, coupled with a context of armed conflict, has degraded the
   humanitarian situation in this region. The purpose of this article is to
   show how the intertwining of ethnicity, class, gender and the armed
   conflict worsens the situations of discrimination that women experience.
   In the same way, the intersectional approach is positioned as an
   appropriate alternative for the construction of territorial peace in
   regions where Afro-Colombian communities live.},

Abstract = {This study explores whether and how individuals evoke moral
   considerations when discussing their political beliefs. By analyzing
   open-ended responses in the 2012 American National Election Study using
   a previously validated dictionary, I find systematic ideological
   differences in moral reasoning, even when respondents are not explicitly
   asked about morality. The study proceeds to show that the reliance on
   moral considerations in attitude expression is amplified by the moral
   content of individual media environments.},

   Evidence on the Effect of Concurrent Second-Order Elections on Political
   Participation},

Abstract = {Voter turnout in second-order elections is on a dramatic decline in many
   modern democracies. This article investigates how electoral
   participation can be substantially increased by holding multiple of
   these less important elections simultaneously. Leading to a relative
   decrease in voting costs, concurrent elections theoretically have
   economies of scale to the individual voter and thus should see turnout
   levels larger than those obtained in any stand-alone election.
   Leveraging as-if-random variation of local election timing in Germany,
   we estimate the causal effect of concurrent mayoral elections on
   European election turnout at around 10 percentage points. Exploiting
   variation in treatment intensity, we show that the magnitude of the
   concurrency effect is contingent upon district size and the
   competitiveness of the local race.},

   authority that changed its behavior the most as a direct consequence of
   the war on drugs. With this war, the armed forces have extensively
   engaged in crime prevention and prosecution, engaging in the systematic
   and generalized practice of torture as a method of criminal

Abstract = {I respond to George Tsebelis's article that explains how difficult it is
   to amend the Constitution of Chile given the high majority thresholds
   for constitutional reforms, the broad scope of issues covered by those
   high thresholds and the cumbersome process to modify the amendment
   section. I review the history of constitutional change in Chile to show
   that, even though constitutional reform is difficult to achieve, it has
   happened 43 times since democracy was restored. I discuss how the demand
   for constitutional replacement is based on the illegitimacy of origin of
   the 1980 Constitution, but argue that Chileans should take pride in
   having built a full-fledged democracy despite the constraints of a
   constitution design to create a protected democracy under military
   tutelage.},

Abstract = {This research document presents the political participation of women in
   the municipality of uses and customs of San Simon Almolongas Oaxaca,
   with a qualitative approach, based on field work through a
   semi-structured interview guide, aimed at women and men in public
   positions who attend the general assemblies. The discussion of results
   was carried out by triangulating the theory with the arguments of the
   informants. The results show that the political participation of women
   is conditioned by the uses and customs; there is a division of positions
   where men occupy a higher hierarchy than women. It was discovered that
   in this triennium (2017-2019) with the new guidelines established by the
   IEEPCO, there are women in the hierarchy positions without having
   participated in the ladder scheme, causing disagreement, because the
   uses and customs that prevail have been broken.},

Abstract = {Compulsory voting is often linked to pro-democracy orientations in the
   public. However, there is reason to question the strength and
   universality of this link. Engaging research on the effects of coercion
   and punishment, this article argues that forced participation inflates
   the tendency of those with negative orientations towards democracy to
   see the democratic system as illegitimate, and to be dissatisfied with
   democracy. The study finds support for these expectations in analyses of
   three separate cross-national surveys and a natural experiment.
   Compulsory voting heightens dissatisfaction with democracy within key
   segments of the population.},

Abstract = {The U.S. Supreme Court's intervention into the recess appointments
   controversy during the Obama administration demonstrates how an overly
   legalistic conception of the Constitution's separation of powers can
   undermine constitutional politics. The formalistic line drawing by the
   Court, without attention to larger constitutional objectives, not only
   legitimized partisan obstruction of the Senate but also prevented the
   president from ensuring the proper functioning of the government based
   on the duly enacted laws of Congress. This article argues that political
   contestation between the branches-structured by legitimate
   constitutional claims-could have restarted a stalled deliberative
   process whereas legal resolution distorted the political dynamics at
   play, giving the illusion of an imperial presidency while providing
   legal cover for congressional abdication.},

Abstract = {This article analyses the changes in the action and social structure of
   the Chilean working class between 1973 and 1989. First, it reviews the
   background of the formation and development of the working class until
   1973. Second, it analyses the main transformations in the action and
   social structure of the workers and their organizations during
   dictatorship. It is argued that between 1973 and 1977, some of the trade
   unions tried to represent politically the workers before the
   dictatorship. Since 1978, trade unions tried to resist the neoliberal
   reforms and established the basis of an opposition to the military
   regime. Finally, it is concluded that the disarticulation of its social
   bases, particularly of the industrial working class, and the way in
   which the transition is politically solved, made it difficult for them
   to recover it's structure and power achieved until 1973.},

Abstract = {This study estimates the income of individuals in the top part of the
   income distribution in Mexico since 1992. Mexico is the only
   Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development country that does
   not report publicly income from fiscal sources. To circumvent this
   problem, we use income information from household surveys but adjust the
   misrepresentation of top earners using national accounts data. We then
   estimate incomes of the very rich using interpolations based on a Pareto
   distribution. Once we correct for the misrepresentation of top earners
   in the survey, we find that the income share of the top decile has
   increased in the last two decades. Our findings contradict the
   conclusion that is usually obtained solely from household survey
   information. We also find that the income share of top-1\% earners in
   Mexico is close to 25\%, making Mexico one of the countries where the
   rich take the largest share of total income. Moreover, we find that
   inequality among the rich in Mexico is larger than in most countries
   where information is available.},

Abstract = {In 2010 Milja Kurki explained that although scholars recognize that
   democracy is described in a variety of ways, they do not typically
   engage with its many and diverse descriptions. My aim in this
   agenda-setting research note is to tackle this quandary by first
   providing a minimum empirical account of democracy's descriptions (i.e.,
   a catalogue of 2,234 adjectives that have been used to describe
   democracy) and secondly by suggesting what democracy studies may gain by
   compiling this information. I argue that the catalogue of descriptors be
   applied in four ways: (1) drilling down into the meaning of each
   description, (2) making taxonomies, (3) rethinking the phenomenology of
   democracy, and (4) visualizing democracy's big data. Each of the four
   applications and their significance is explained in turn. This research
   note ends by looking back on the catalogue and its four applications.},

Abstract = {This paper applies the concept of post-democracy coined by Crouch to
   shed light on the emerging political dynamics of macroeconomic policy
   coordination in the Eurozone as they applied to France during Hollande's
   presidency. Firstly, the paper explains the nature of EMU reform,
   characterized here as post-democratic by institutional design, before
   analysing its impact on France's budgetary politics. Finally, the French
   case involving Hollande's balancing act between supranational rules and
   domestic spending preferences is used as a way to reflect on the
   stability of this post-democratic arrangement for rescuing the Euro. The
   2017 presidential election pitting Macron against Le Pen showed that
   post-democracy by design is sustainable only if the supply side of
   politics remains supportive of EMU-a condition undermined by the
   institutionalization of austerity, at least in France.},

Abstract = {The article studies the problems of human resources stemming from
   increased mobility, and the emergence of new aspects of migration
   processes. A comparative analysis of the connection between academic
   development in the context of university (and the science system) and
   the process of labour migration taking place in Poland, Latvia,
   Lithuania and Estonia was carried out. The article examines the limits
   of the model through European territorial migration process and
   concludes that the huge migration of high-skilled labour (called the
   ``knowledge workers{''}) has had a very negative impact on the
   innovative and academic potential of Poland, Lithuania, Latvia and a
   negative impact in Estonia. In the final section, the article examines
   increase in the requirements for competence in the Baltic Sea
   macroregion of the European Union and Estonia's university reform of
   2013-2016 as an illustrative experiment to (un) resolved problems. The
   first results of the reform in higher education indicated that it was
   ineffective-for students, the good ideas of the reform proved to be a
   lost experiment and the mobility of knowledge workers, as the future
   academic resource in homeland, turned from Estonia to larger Europe,
   especially to Finland and the UK.},

Abstract = {The disintegration of the Soviet Union is an essential case for the
   study of ethnic politics and identity-based mobilization. However,
   analyses in this article demonstrate that commonly used measures of
   ethnic diversity and politically relevant group concentration show
   little consistent relationship with events of ethnic mobilization in
   Soviet regions during the period 1987-1992. In contrast, the proportion
   of a regional population that did not speak a metropolitan language has
   a consistently strong negative relationship with mobilization across
   these regions. In line with recent work on identity politics, I argue
   that a lack of proficiency in a metropolitan language marks nonspeakers
   as outsiders and hinders their social mobility. Regions with many of
   these individuals thus have a relatively high potential for
   identity-based mobilization. These findings provide further impetus for
   looking beyond ethnic groups in measuring identity-based cleavages, and
   indicate that language can play an important role in political outcomes
   aside from proxying ethnicity.},

Abstract = {Owing to the rapid rise of the Alternative for Germany (AfD), the public
   and academia seldom turn their attention to the National Democratic
   Party of Germany (NPD) anymore. The fact that the NPD has maintained its
   electoral support and continues to be represented at the municipal level
   is frequently neglected, however. This does not apply to the same extent
   to all municipalities, though. Based on a most-similar-case-design, the
   article analyzes the conditions of the NPD's electoral success in Saxon
   municipalities in the 2013 German federal elections. Using macro data on
   438 Saxon municipalities and applying spatial errors models, the
   analysis tests 14 hypotheses. These hypotheses were derived from three
   groups of factors: cultural demand-side, materialistic demand-side and
   internal supply-side variables. The results indicate that cultural
   factors have the strongest impact on the NPD's electoral success in
   Saxon municipalities, whereas the effect size of materialistic factors
   is conditioned by other variables. Overall, the findings illustrate that
   the NPD largely benefits from favorable contextual conditions at the
   municipal level. The party's ability to influence its electoral success
   itself are limited, however.},

Abstract = {Most of the previous studies of power-sharing arrangements (PSAs) find
   the political PSA to be ineffective in stabilizing post-agreement peace.
   These studies argue that the political PSA is a signal that is not
   costly enough to moderate the information asymmetry or commitment
   problem among the signatories. In this article, I develop an alternative
   theory of the political PSA that identifies its ``negative{''} effect on
   post-agreement stability by highlighting two issues that have attracted
   little attention in the previous studies, i.e. distributional effects of
   the political PSA and shifts in the bargaining power among the
   signatories. To assess the validity of the theory, I first conduct a
   logistic regression analysis of inclusion of political PSA provisions in
   peace agreements, and then conduct a survival analysis of post-agreement
   peace duration.},

Journal = {POLITICAL BEHAVIOR},

Volume = {40},
Number = {2},
Pages = {345-370},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Recently, the concept of issue ownership has attracted increasing
   attention by students of electoral behaviour as well as party
   competition. However, both the definition and measurement of issue
   ownership-often drawn from Petrocik's seminal 1996-article-is unclear.
   This constitutes a serious drawback to the further development and
   understanding of issue ownership itself and its purported effects. The
   paper addresses these problems by, first, establishing a definition of
   issue ownership at the individual level. On this basis, the standard
   `which party is best at handling issue X' measure of issue ownership is
   assessed. The analyses using experiments embedded in a nationally
   representative panel survey indicate that the measure lacks validity and
   is partially redundant. Consequently, its replacement with a better
   performing alternative is recommended.},

Abstract = {While ``inclusion{''} has been seen as a central mode of redressing
   ongoing injustices against communities of color in the US, Indigenous
   political experiences feature more complex legacies of contesting US
   citizenship. Turning to an important episode of contestation, this essay
   examines the relation between inclusion and the politics of eliminating
   Indigenous nations that was part of a shared policy shift toward
   ``Termination{''} in the Anglo-settler world of the 1950s and 1960s.
   Through a reading of Indigenous activist-intellectual Vine Deloria Jr.'s
   Custer Died for Your Sins: An Indian Manifesto (1969), it demonstrates
   how the construction of what I call the civic inclusion narrative in
   post-World War II American political discourse disavowed practices of
   empire-formation. Widely considered a foundational text of the
   Indigenous Sovereignty Movement, the work repositioned Indigenous
   peoples not as passive recipients of civil rights and incorporation into
   the nation-state but as colonized peoples actively demanding
   decolonization. Deloria's work provides an exemplary counterpoint to the
   enduring thread of civic inclusion in American political thought and an
   alternative tradition of decolonizationan imperative that continues to
   resonate in today's North American and global Indigenous struggles over
   land, jurisdiction, and sovereignty.},

Title = {Party Institutions and Authoritarian Power-Sharing: Evidence from
   China's Provincial Leader Appointment},
Journal = {JAPANESE JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {19},
Number = {2},
Pages = {173-196},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Recent scholarship of comparative authoritarianism suggests that party
   institutions contribute to regime resilience by facilitating
   power-sharing among the party elites and preventing the paramount
   leaders' abuse of power that undermines political stability. Existing
   studies tend to focus on the empirical association between party
   organizations and regime resilience, whereas the actual effects of
   institutions on elite behavior receive less attention. This paper
   conducts an in-depth study of China's appointment system to examine
   whether the CCP's power-sharing institutions indeed constrain the
   person- nel authority of the party's paramount leader. Using a unique
   dataset of provincial leadership appointment from 1992 to 2014, the
   empirical analysis reveals that the General Secretary enjoys what can be
   described as constrained supremacy' in the making of personnel
   decisions: the leader can boost his own position by providing favorable
   treatment to key supporters, but the formal arrangement of collective
   decision-making constrains rampant reward of patronage that would
   unsettle the balance among the regime's top elites. The findings of the
   paper lay bare the diffculty of capturing the inner workings of
   authoritarian politics with broad, cross-national indicators of regime
   type; they also illustrate the complicated interaction between formal
   institutions and informal, personal logic of exercising power in
   authoritarian regimes.},

Abstract = {We present a novel approach to disentangle the effects of ideology,
   partisanship, and constituency pressures on roll-call voting. First, we
   place voters and legislators on a common ideological space. Next, we use
   roll-call data to identify the partisan influence on legislators'
   behavior. Finally, we use a structural equation model to account for
   these separate effects on legislative voting. We rely on public opinion
   data and a survey of Argentine legislators conducted in 2007-08. Our
   findings indicate that partisanship is the most important determinant of
   legislative voting, leaving little room for personal ideological
   position to affect legislators' behavior.},

Abstract = {In their 2016 American Political Science Review article, Kogelmann and
   Stich argue that public reason fails to provide the assurance reasonable
   citizens require to act justly and that, as a consequence, Rawls's
   account of political stability fails. Convergence discussions, because
   they are a costly signal, provide such assurance. Kogelmann and Stich
   fail to recognize that constituents influence representatives such that
   the costs of convergence discourse are unknown. It thus cannot assure.
   Constituents' influence also undermines convergence's ability to show
   how decision-making processes that follow its norms result in justified
   laws. Far from supporting convergence, then, the stability question
   demands revision of the view. This response develops these objections,
   extends them from Kogelmann and Stich's analysis to other convergence
   theorists and political liberals, and explores what political theorists
   can learn from convergence's difficulties.},

Volume = {24},

Abstract = {The organizational history of the British Labour Party is to a
   significant degree the story of an ongoing struggle over the how' of
   election manifestos, a struggle, partly driven by a broad-based
   agreement over the why' of manifestos. This is a struggle between a
   parliamentary independence' wing and a grass-roots control' wing.
   Because the manifesto is seen as a programme for government action, this
   also means that the answer to the how takes on huge importance, because
   controlling the how means controlling government action. This article
   will show the nature and extent of the disagreement between the two
   wings and argue that it has repeatedly damaged the Labour Party's
   ability to operate effectively. In this struggle, the two opposing sides
   have at various times scored temporary victories'. However, whichever
   argument won' at any given time, the long-term result was damage to the
   party's ability to function properly. The article will also argue that
   after multiple generations of struggle, this issue is essentially still
   unresolved.},

Abstract = {The American woman suffrage movement remade the U.S. Constitution and
   effected the broadest expansion of voting eligibility in the nation's
   history. Yet it did more than change laws and citizenship. It also
   plausibly shaped participatory patterns before and after the winning of
   voting rights for women. Drawing upon the idea of formative practice and
   reporting on a range of historical materialsincluding an original data
   set of 2,157 petitions sent to the U.S. Congress from 1874 to 1920
   concerning women's voting rightswe focus on woman suffrage petitioning
   as both presaging the practice of voting and, in a sense, preparing tens
   of thousands of women for that activity. Our analyses reveal that,
   before 1920, suffrage petitioning activity was heightened in general and
   midterm election years (especially among Republican-leaning
   constituencies), suffrage petitioning both enabled and reflected
   organization in critical western states, and that post-suffrage women's
   turnout was immediately and significantly higher in states with greater
   pre-suffrage petitioning (controlling for a range of political,
   organizational, and demographic variables). In its claims, symbolism,
   habits, and temporality, suffrage petitioning differed from other
   petitioning in American political development and marked a formative
   practice for women on their way to voting.},

Abstract = {In this study, we argue that the perceived polarization of Americans
   along party lines is partially an artifact of the low response rates
   that characterize contemporary surveys. People who agree to participate
   in opinion surveys are more informed, involved, and opinionated about
   the political process and therefore hold stronger, more meaningful, and
   partisan political attitudes. This motivational discrepancy generates a
   bias in survey research that may amplify evidence of party polarization
   in the mass public. We test the association between response rates and
   measures of polarization using individual-level data from Pew surveys
   from 2004 to 2014 and American National Election Studies from 1984 to
   2012. Our empirical evidence demonstrates a significant decline in unit
   response that is associated with an increase in the percentage of
   politically active, partisan, and polarized individuals in these
   surveys. This produces evidence of dissensus that, on some issues, may
   be stronger than exists in reality.},

   had been central allies of the Argentine dictatorial regime (1976-1983),
   especially in their support of the anti-subversive struggle. The purpose
   is to show that in this process of defection, they denounce the
   ``problem of the disappeared{''} and demand answers for the ``illegal
   repression{''} as a way of undermining the military's power, especially
   from 1982.},

Abstract = {In recent years, several oppressive leaders have been arrested and
   extradited to international courts. What are the consequences of this
   global justice cascade? I address this question by examining patterns of
   exile. I show that the justice cascade has a differential effect on
   leaders based on their culpability (whether they presided over atrocity
   crimes). In the past, culpable and nonculpable leaders went into exile
   at virtually identical rates. Today, however, culpable leaders are about
   six times less likely to flee abroad because exile no longer guarantees
   a safe retirement. These findings raise stark implications for existing
   research that debates whether international justice deters atrocities or
   prolongs conflicts. My results about exiled leaders, I explain, imply
   that the justice cascade should deter atrocities and prolong conflicts.
   Thus, instead of debating whether international justice is helpful or
   harmful, future scholarship should carefully consider the trade-offs it
   creates.},

Abstract = {Since the 1970s, national governments across Western Europe have
   decentralized significant powers to subnational authorities. Recent work
   has found that the degree of decentralization affects ethnoterritorial
   party vote in national and subnational elections. This article asks the
   prior question: what effect does decentralization have on a party's
   decision to field candidates? I find that as decentralization reforms
   shift power to the region, ethnoterritorial parties likewise shift their
   electoral strategy away from contesting national elections. An
   examination of regional-level data from nine Western European countries
   reveals ethnoterritorial parties reduce their contestation of national
   elections when a directly elected regional assembly is established and
   significant administrative, fiscal and policymaking competencies are
   transferred to the region. Further supporting the view of
   decentralization as policy appeasement, this exit effect is limited to
   ethnoterritorial parties demanding regional autonomy; secessionist
   parties continue to pursue full contestation strategies regardless of
   the level of decentralization.},

Abstract = {In ``On a Supposed Right to Lie from Philanthropy,{''} Kant holds the
   seemingly untenable position that lying is always prohibited, even if
   the lie is addressed to a murderer in an attempt to save the life of an
   innocent man. This article argues that Kant's position on lying should
   be placed back in its original context, namely a response to Benjamin
   Constant about the responsibility of individual agents toward political
   principles in post-revolutionary times. I show that Constant's theory of
   political responsibility, which sanctions the lie, is not based on
   expediency, but on principled realism, whereas Kant endorses a position
   that I describe as `political juridicism.' This analysis enables us to
   uncover two plausible Republican theories of political responsibility in
   post-revolutionary times behind an apparently strictly ethical debate.},

   particular attention to the role of voter sophistication, we investigate
   which voters mainly decide on the basis of ideology, position and
   valence issues, or party leaders, and how these differences influence
   their party choices. Analyses using mixed logit and a specially-designed
   survey instrument embedded in a high-quality, nationally representative
   survey of Danish voters show that decision criteria heterogeneity has
   substantial influence on the vote. The conclusion discusses the
   normative implications, in particular the question of whether voters'
   reliance on party leaders constitutes a democratic problem.},

Abstract = {The following article analyses the emergence of the mapuche movement in
   the political arena, here we state that the demand for territory does
   not only imply physical space, but also and is in essence a political
   demand. Being in this context, conventional politics also a territory to
   recuperate for the mapuche movement in Chile. The main objective
   consists in analyzing how the struggle from within the institutions and
   for power may have contributed as a way of decolonization, as another
   repertoire among those used by the mapuche movement.},

Abstract = {Teaching about political conflict requires an understanding of the
   multiple perspectives and motivations of the parties to the conflict.
   This is especially true when teaching students who may have strong
   predispositions, such as in classes on the Arab-Israeli conflict.
   Various active-learning techniques address this problem but often at a
   cost of long preparation, substantial class time, and class-size
   limitations. This article offers both quantitative and qualitative
   evidence that a short essay asking students to defend a key action taken
   by one of the actors makes them more understanding and less accusatory
   of that side-even as it does not change their overall attitude toward
   the conflict. Adding a small-group discussion and a written reflection
   further helps students to make more informed and reasoned judgments.
   Importantly, such an assignment is easy to create, implement, and modify
   across various class types, sizes, and constraints.},

   tend to view controversy over judicial federalism through the lens of
   the Jeffersonian and Jacksonian eras, in which this appellate oversight
   functioned to consolidate the power of national institutions against the
   periphery and defenders of states' rights promoted the independence of
   state courts from federal oversight. But the deliberative process that
   attended the formation of the federal judiciary exhibited a more complex
   dynamic that presented the framers of the Constitution and of the first
   judiciary act with a range of possible institutional arrangements. Given
   the available alternatives, the Supreme Court's appellate oversight was
   not so much an aggression on states' rights as a concession to those
   wary of consolidation. Rather than being contested, it in fact formed a
   ground of consensus as a modest means of ensuring federal supremacy.},

Abstract = {This study examines how long the Israeli people support the government
   for an ongoing war. The rally-round-the-flag phenomenon, proclaiming
   that wartime governments can enjoy majority public support at the
   beginning of wars, is a challenging topic in the field of International
   Relations. Although this effect was noticed at the time of the Second
   Lebanon War, it remains unclear which particular condition determined
   the duration of public support in Israel. While the rally effect is a
   universal phenomenon, it is important to keep in mind the particularity
   of Israel. We hold on to an alternative theory, bandwagon effect,
   emphasizing the role of affectivity of individuals on the flow of
   information in crisis, in place of the standard rational expectation
   theory. An original experimental survey was conducted to examine the
   bandwagon effect in the rally phenomenon among Israeli citizens.},
