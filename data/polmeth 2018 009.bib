Abstract = {The main purpose of this article is to trace the debate in Iceland about
   the inclusion of the minister of Iceland in the Danish state council
   from 1874 to 1915. This debate concerned the interpretation of the
   Danish Positional Law and whether the Danish Constitution was in some
   regards also enforceable in Iceland. The state council was included in
   the Icelandic constitution in 1903 and proposed changes hotly debated
   until 1915. To understand this debate the political discourse on the
   state council is analyzed and its role in the wider struggle for
   independence. The Icelandic opposition to the state council was based on
   the definition of specific Icelandic issues apart from Danish ones in
   the Positional law and the proposition that the state council was a
   Danish institution defined by the Danish constitution. It was therefore
   against Icelandic self-rule to discuss and decide on specific Icelandic
   issues in a Danish institution. During the independence struggle
   Icelanders had to decide whether the state council clause was a matter
   of principle and should therefore stand in the way of agreement with
   Denmark or whether a more pragmatic view should be taken. The
   disagreement was therefore not only between Iceland and Denmark but also
   a source of conflict and disagreement within Iceland.},

Abstract = {We test two of the main explanations of the formation of political ties.
   The first states that political actors are more likely to form a
   relationship if they have similar policy preferences. The second
   explanation, from network theory, predicts that the likelihood of a tie
   between two actors depends on the presence of certain relationships with
   other actors. Our data consist of a unique combination of actors' policy
   positions and their network relations over time in the Council of the
   European Union. We find evidence that both types of explanations matter,
   although there seems to be variation in the extent to which preference
   similarity affects network evolution. We consider the implications of
   these findings for understanding the decision-making in the Council.},

Abstract = {The study points out the role of regulatory assessment in developing
   participatory work in Jordan focusing on both civil society
   organizations and Ministry of Political \& Parliamentary Affairs.
   Jordan, nowadays, has a rapidly evolving policy and regulatory
   environment. The problem that is rooted in our societies and national
   institutions manifests in the absence or lack of coordination in order
   to achieve the desired results that are planned to reach, namely the
   efficiency and effectiveness of the institutional performance of all
   sectors, especially the development sectors. The study poses the
   questions dealing with empowering a decentralized RIA System in Jordan,
   mainly: Determining the policies to be achieved to solve the problem,
   identifying the problems to be treated, determining the appropriate
   option for policy enforcement, determining the type of legislation
   required, determining who is responsible for preparing these
   legislations, and identifying the necessary legal and administrative
   mechanisms required. The research used the descriptive analytical,
   methodology. The study proposes an institutional mechanism of the (RIA)
   in Jordan.},

Abstract = {This study argues that moral appeals in political advertising-and
   political rhetoric in general-are a form of emotional appeal that
   political elites use strategically. In particular, the study shows that
   moral appeals in political ads elicit a strong emotional response from
   voters and that it is precisely through an adjustment in their use of
   moral appeals that candidates signal their moderation as they pivot from
   the primary to the general election. To make these arguments, the study
   uses a content analysis of 3462 unique political advertisements from the
   2008 Presidential, Senate, House, and gubernatorial primary and general
   elections, as well as individual-level survey data from the 2012
   YouGov/Vanderbilt Ad Rating Project.},

Abstract = {Economic growth and arms race are interesting phenomena in Southeast
   Asia. Contrary to the view of a majority of scholars that arms race has
   generally negative impact on economic growth, this article argues that
   the arms race between China and the United States in the South China Sea
   helps to create a balance of power, which reinforces regional political
   stability and further drives economic growth. Thus, in an indirect way,
   the arms race aids economic growth in Southeast Asia. Elaborating on a
   discourse that arms race is a natural reality in international politics
   which must be responded to by a positive approach, this study aims to
   open a new space for debate and further research and offers a new
   perspective to understand the phenomenon.},

Abstract = {Zivotofsky v. Kerry (2015) highlighted the constitutional tension
   surrounding the use of executive signing statements, especially with
   regard to the president's power to conduct foreign affairs. Critics
   contend that signing statements come perilously close to having the
   effect of line-item vetoes, which the Supreme Court declared
   unconstitutional in Clinton v. City of New York. I suggest that signing
   statements are simply written manifestations of practices that naturally
   occur in a system of checks and balances and in a system where executive
   branch officials may and must interpret the text of legislation. While
   signing statements may raise the specter of a president who ignores the
   express will of Congress, this also is a manifestation of the workings
   of a constitutional system in which Congress and the president share
   lawmaking power.},

Abstract = {This study explores the extent to which campaign visibility facilitates
   electoral participation, using data from first- and second-order
   elections in Britain. Our contribution to the existing literature is
   threefold. First, we assess whether the effects of campaign effort are
   conditioned by marginality, finding that campaign mobilization gets out
   the vote regardless of the competitiveness of the race. Second, we look
   at the relative ability of different campaign activities to stimulate
   turnout, detecting significant differences. Third, we show that the
   effects of campaign effort on electoral participation are rather similar
   in first- and second-order elections. These findings suggest that a
   greater level of electoral information provided by campaign activities
   does reduce the cost of voting. Local campaigns play a key role in
   bringing voters to the polls in marginal and non-marginal races and at
   general elections as much as at second-order elections.},

Abstract = {Rousseau was arguably one of the most important and influential of
   eighteenth-century republican thinkers. However, contemporary republican
   theorists, most notably Philip Pettit, have written him out of the
   republican canon by describing Rousseau as a populist rather than a
   republican. I argue that this miscasting of Rousseau is not just
   historically incorrect but that it has also led to a weakening of
   contemporary republican political theory. Rousseau was one of the few
   early modern republican thinkers to take seriously the problem of the
   tyranny of the majority and to attempt to formulate a cogent answer to
   that problem. Ignoring his contribution to republican political thought
   therefore cuts off contemporary republicans from an important resource
   for thinking about this problem.},

Abstract = {While the concept of humanity is most often referred to as the moral
   source of the Responsibility to Protect's motivational capacity,
   humanity's normative status and value has continued to be left assumed
   and/or unexplored. Consequently, there remains a considerable lack of
   analysis into humanity's role in supposedly helping to both locate moral
   harm and subsequently provide a motivational cause that can drive
   protection practices in support of the Responsibility to Protect
   principle. In response to this lacuna, this article puts forward three
   hypotheses regarding the motivational role of humanity in this process:
   (a) humanity functioning as a rhetorical tool with no motivational
   qualities, (b) humanity as a concept that works to redefine sovereignty
   in support of the Responsibility to Protect and (c) humanity as a
   motivating principle that ultimately diminishes in influence as the
   Responsibility to Protect principle is diffused into action. Through
   this analysis, the article offers a more rigorous and systematic
   evaluation of humanity's limitations as a moral motivator for generating
   collective response to mass atrocity crimes, highlighting the need to
   further develop understanding of the complex interaction between
   morality and politics in international decision-making.},

Abstract = {Much attention has been paid to government blunders' and policy
   disasters'. National political and administrative systems have been
   frequently blamed for being disproportionately prone to generating
   mishaps. However, little systematic evidence exists on the record of
   failures of policies and major public projects in other political
   systems. Based on a comparative perspective on blunders in government,
   this article suggests that constitutional features do not play a
   prominent role. In order to establish this finding, this article (a)
   develops theory-driven expectations as to the factors that are said to
   encourage blunders, (b) devises a systematic framework for the
   assessment of policy processes and outcomes, and (c) uses fuzzy-set
   qualitative comparative analysis to identify sets of causal conditions
   associated with particular outcomes (i.e., blunders). The article
   applies this novel approach to a set of particular policy domains,
   finding that constitutional features are not a contributory factor to
   blunders in contrast to instrument choice, administrative capacity and
   hyper-excited politics.},

Abstract = {This article examines the use of Twitter during the 2016 Catalan Diada
   (Catalan National Day). We aim at analysing the characteristics of the
   users that employed certain hashtags. To what extent there are
   significant differences across users employing different hashtags?
   Drawing on theories of national identity and polarisation, we look at
   the content of the tweets sent during the Diada. Taking advantage of a
   massive mobilisation event, we examine how Twitter users clustered
   around different hashtags, the content they transmitted or in which
   language they tweeted. The empirical analysis is based on a Twitter
   corpus of about 60,000 unique users and more than 200,000 tweets, which
   allows us to analyse their characteristics, the content they sent, and
   the language in which they did it. Our findings show that users
   clustered around different hashtags and that language is strongly
   correlated with the content of the tweet. In addition, content analysis
   of the messages sent within each of the clusters shows distinguishable
   political views on the independence debate.},

Abstract = {In Democracy for Realists, Christopher Achen and Larry Bartels argue
   that the depressingly well-established fact that people are woefully
   ignorant about politically relevant matters renders democratic ideals
   mere fairy tales. However, this iconoclasm stands in deep tension with
   the prescriptions they themselves end up offering towards the end of the
   book, which coincide to a surprising extent with those that have been
   offered by democrats for decades. This is a problem because, if we take
   seriously the type of data that Achen and Bartels rely on (and add
   to)data that should make us realists in the sense of the book's titleit
   is not clear that democracy in any recognizable sense remains an option
   for the realist.},

Abstract = {In the interwar period, the small town of Rapallo, Italy, was the
   year-round home of Ezra and Dorothy Pound and a seasonal retreat for
   W.B.Yeats and George Yeats. The promise of good company, the hope of
   good weather, and the potential for poetic collaboration drew to Rapallo
   a number of poets who were influential in shaping twentieth-century
   poetry. However, Pound's virulent fascism and the Pact of Friendship and
   Alliance between Germany and Italy (1939) meant that writers were loathe
   to recognise the degree to which Rapallo was instrumental to late
   modernist networks. For the most part, biographers have followed suit.
   This essay attends to memoirs written by Nancy Cunard, H.D., Richard
   Aldington, and Thomas MacGreevy to illustrate post-war aversions to
   acknowledging the importance of Rapallo and to demonstrate how writers
   negotiated their relationship to Pound in constructing their own
   literary biographies in the shadow of the Second World War.},

Title = {The Comparative African Economics of Governance in Fighting Terrorism},
Journal = {AFRICAN SECURITY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {11},

Pages = {296-338},
Abstract = {This study assesses the comparative economics of governance in fighting
   terrorism in fifty-three African countries for period 1996-2012. Four
   terrorism variables are used: domestic, transnational, unclear, and
   total terrorism dynamics. Nine bundled and unbundled governance
   variables are employed: political stability (no violence), voice and
   accountability, political governance, government effectiveness,
   regulation quality, economic governance, corruption control, the rule of
   law, and institutional governance. The empirical evidence is based on
   fixed effects regressions. In the analytical procedure, we first bundle
   governance indicators by means of principal component analysis before
   engaging the empirical exercise with the full sample. In the final step,
   specifications are based on a decomposed full sample in order to
   articulate the fundamental characteristics for comparative purposes. The
   following broad findings are established. First, good governance is an
   appealing tool in fighting terrorism. Second, the relevance of the good
   governance dynamics is as follows in order of increasing relevance:
   economic governance, institutional governance, and political governance.
   The findings are presented in increasing order of magnitude to emphasize
   fundamental features in which governance dynamics have the highest
   effect in mitigating terrorism.},

Title = {An Intellectual Mass-Transformism: Restoration and Postmodern passive
   Revolution in the Neo-liberal Cycle},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL CRITICAL THOUGHT},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {8},
Number = {1},
Pages = {66-78},
Abstract = {In the 1970s, the historical-political cycle that had long characterized
   Western social conflict was reversed, and the rise of the lower classes
   was followed by a massive counter-offensive by the ruling classes. It
   was then that modern democracy began to end, just as a neo-Bonapartistic
   and media-oriented regime took hold that today constantly forms and
   restructures Western public opinion. If the rise of the lower classes
   was made possible through their conscious unification, a necessary
   precondition for the weakest parts of society to be able to act
   effectively in the conflict, the deconstruction of modern democracy, on
   the contrary, has since then inevitably involved the disarticulation of
   the antagonist subject and even the very concept of identity. It was a
   process that took place mainly in the production domain and in the
   capitalistic factories, of course. But it was also a process that would
   not have been possible without a radical parallel transformation of
   forms of consciousness, a transformation that calls into question the
   ideological sphere and its philosophy. Generated primarily within the
   intellectual left, the cultural shift towards postmodernism should
   therefore be understood, in this perspective, as the prevailing
   ideological feature of an enormous historical shift. It is a transition
   in which restoration is intertwined with passive revolution, resulting
   in a process that could be defined as a sort of intellectual
   mass-transformism.},

Title = {FOREIGN AID AND QUALITY OF GOVERNANCE: SHATTERING ILLUSORY CORRELATIONS},
Journal = {POLIS-POLITICHESKIYE ISSLEDOVANIYA},
Year = {2018},
Number = {6},
Pages = {67-79},
Abstract = {This paper examines the current state of academic discourse on linkages
   between foreign aid and quality of governance in developing countries.
   The first section summarizes the arguments of the researchers who claim
   that foreign aid has a generally positive impact on the quality of
   institutional governance in the recipient countries. The second and
   third sections outline the counterarguments of scholars holding the
   opposite view. These counterarguments appeal either to general negative
   consequences of providing any resources in the form of foreign aid or to
   more specific risks related to certain aid modalities. Special attention
   is paid to explaining the cacophony of scholarly interpretations and to
   outlining the most promising trajectories for a future research. The
   conclusion is drawn that the ambivalence of empiric assessments stems
   not from the variations in data samples but from the methodological
   deficiencies generating illusory correlations. The willingness of most
   scholars to build abstract theoretical models of universal applicability
   raises serious concerns because of their inclination towards
   reductionism and the use of aggregated data on gross volumes of official
   development assistance. The latter factor leads to ignoring several
   parameters - first, substantial differences between aid types,
   instruments, modalities and channels; second, the flows of non-ODA
   military and security assistance which has been playing an increasingly
   important role in the international state-building efforts, and third,
   aid flows from emerging donors, particularly China, which neither report
   to the OECD DAC nor use policy conditionality. However, the
   methodological deficiencies should be eliminated not by oversaturating
   the quantitative models with extra variables and running complex
   regressions but by getting the most of qualitative case studies. Such
   studies should apply rather unusual - for reports commissioned by
   development agencies - methodology with making new theory-based
   hypotheses and examining assistance provided by different donors in
   several similar country contexts, while bringing together development
   scholars and area specialists with a deep knowledge of political systems
   and cultures in specific regions.},

Abstract = {This article aims to analyze Mercosur as a regional integration block,
   its possibilities and limits. We argue that Mercosur is a complex
   regional block, which shows hybrid aspects since its creation. On the
   one hand, Mercosur cannot be classified as an open-regionalism
   initiative, despite the fact that it emerged in the 1990s On the other
   hand, the post-hqemonic regionalism definition is not accurate either to
   explain the changes that occurred after 2003. In fact, Mercosur has its
   own dynamics-built on the strategic alliance between Argentina and
   Brazil-which changes only partially through the influence of political
   cycles: With this in mind, we analyze areas such as trade, asymetries,
   and education, in order to highlight changes and continuities that
   constitute the hybrid character of Mercosur and have nurtured its
   survival during the last 27 years.},

Abstract = {This paper assesses how constitutional crowdsourcing can enhance
   legitimacy in processes of constitution-making and amending in stable
   democracies. Constitutional crowdsourcing gives rise to opportunities
   and challenges. It opens-up fresh possibilities for participation by
   individuals and groups previously excluded from constitution-making
   deliberation, expression of political preferences, and decisions. It may
   also increase autonomy, equality, and transparency. However, at the same
   time, these kinds of strategies create the challenge of establishing
   constraints for securing these possibilities and ensuring that the
   relevant agents engage in a meaningful way. Legitimacy qua
   justifiability about constitution-making processes depends on overcoming
   this challenge.},

Abstract = {Thanks to various sources (documents, interviews, and Charles Merieux's
   professional archives), this article analyzes the part played by the
   Merieux Foundation in the development of applied epidemiology in France
   from the 1970s to the 1990s. On the one hand, the foundation contributed
   ``from the bottom,{''} at the margins of the state, to the production
   and the dissemination of new knowledge, thanks to a specific training
   institute. On the other hand, it contributed ``from the top,{''} as its
   president was in touch with high level civil servants and government
   members (even the French presidents), keeping them informed about
   developments. Providing an alternative to government health policies
   whilst interacting with the country's top leaders at the same time, the

Journal = {POLITICKE VEDY},

Abstract = {In the past several years, we could witness a massive mass and social
   media coverage of Muslims and their migration to Europe. This particular
   group is an object of stereotypical views and intensive emotional
   reactions. Despite that, Muslims living in Czech Republic are a
   relatively unknown and so far unexplored cultural group. Therefore, our
   study focused on selected faith-related attitudes toward Czech society
   investigated on a sample of Muslim immigrants living in Czech Republic
   for minimum of one year. We used a shortened and adjusted version of
   questionnaire previously used in WZB study (WZV, 2008) in three language
   mutations - Arabic, Czech, and English. The recruitment of participants
   was conducted via social networks; in total 143 responses were gathered.
   The data analysis is based primarily on descriptive statistics. The
   results show that there is a great variability in the strength of both
   the Muslim identity of the respondents and their religions believes.
   Their attitudes toward various topics related to Islam such as wearing
   headscarfs and other gender-related issues, teaching Islam in schools,
   or building Mosques also highly vary within the sample. Access to
   housing is perceived as the main source of discrimintation. Large-scale
   or longitudinal assessments of Muslim minority are needed to deepen our
   understanding of the attitudes of the Muslim minority in Czech Republic.
   We can assume that this topic will be investigated further in other
   Central European countries.},

Abstract = {Existing studies on the roles and foreign policies of middle powers
   place too much focus on their security policies, while there is a dearth
   of scholarship on their trade policies. Middle powers have used free
   trade agreement (FTA) politics not only to obtain economic benefits
   through trade expansion, but also to achieve broader foreign policy
   goals. Given the U.S.-China FTA competition in East Asia, as a middle
   power, South Korea, has developed double hedging FTA diplomacy by
   supporting both powers' FTA initiatives in order to avoid potential
   conflicts and maintain favourable relationships with both powers.
   Specifically, Korea has tried to maximize its national interest and,
   furthermore, to maintain regional stability by establishing two
   bilateral FTAs, the Korea-U.S. FTA and the Korea-China FTA, and by
   showing interest and participating in larger FTA discussions, such as
   the US-led Trans-Pacific Partnership and the China-led Regional
   Comprehensive Economic Partnership.},

Abstract = {Radicalization is a process of escalation from nonviolent to
   increasingly violent repertoires of action that develops through a
   complex set of interactions unfolding over time. Looking at
   radicalization mainly through the lenses of a relational approach, this
   article suggests that social movement studies allow us to bridge
   structural and agentic explanations in an analysis of the impact of
   political opportunities and organizational resources, as well as
   framing, in explaining forms of action and inaction. Available political
   opportunities influence the reactions of political actors in general to
   movement demands, thus affecting social movements' strategic choices.
   Moreover, the availability (or lack) of material and symbolic resources
   affects the choice of radical repertoire. Finally, organizational
   resources and contextual opportunities are framed differently by social
   movement actors, in some cases facilitating radicalization. At the
   individual level, different paths of radicalization are singled out.},

Abstract = {Social movements in the wake of the financial crisis have shifted from
   the counter-summits and world social forums of the global justice
   movement to the camps of the anti-austerity mobilizations, and from a
   clear focus on building `another Europe' to more domestically embedded
   issues. Among other reasons, this turn away from the EU can be linked to
   contracting political opportunities for social justice movements at the
   European level. This article addresses the closure of opportunities at
   the EU level for the work of social movement groups campaigning on
   specific EU policies. We reflect on the complexity of the EU's political
   opportunity structure prior to the financial crisis, before examining
   changes to the EU's architecture effected through responses to the
   crises and outlining arguments on how EU-level opportunities around
   socio-economic issues in particular have shrunk as a result. We then
   show how the perception of other political opportunities at the EU level
   is affected by the austerity response by drawing on campaigns that
   sought to exploit new opportunities included in the Lisbon Treaty and
   designed to increase citizens' input. Opportunities introduced by
   changes made in the Lisbon Treaty are perceived through the prism of
   contracted opportunities flowing from power shifts caused by the
   response to the financial crisis.},

Title = {Canada 150: exhibiting national memory at the Canadian Museum for Human
   Rights},
Journal = {CITIZENSHIP STUDIES},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {22},
Number = {4, SI},
Pages = {358-380},
Abstract = {This paper features an analysis of the Canadian Museum for Human Rights
   (CMHR) and its showcase for Canada 150', the sesquicentennial
   anniversary of Canadian Confederation. Particular attention is paid to
   how the Museum frames national memory, and its responsiveness (or lack
   thereof) to critiques and re-framings of Canada 150 by Indigenous
   artists, activists, historians and community leaders. Since opening to
   the public in 2014, the CMHR has had a mixed reception, including
   criticism for inadequately addressing Canada's colonial past and
   present, privileging narratives of state benevolence and downplaying
   missteps' when it comes to Canada's own human rights and Indigenous
   rights record. Recognizing that national museums have long served the
   colonial project of state formation and official memory, this paper
   nonetheless tries to notice potential openings for decolonizing or
   unsettling Canada 150 at the CMHR. Shoal Lake 40 First Nation's Museum
   of Canadian Human Rights Violations is taken up as a counter example.},

Abstract = {This article operationalizes the concepts of fantasy, enjoyment and
   symptom from a Lacanian reading and proposes some useful methodological
   strategies to strengthen the empirical-discursive research of hegemony
   from Latin America. It illustrates with some examples of previous
   investigations that used these tools from the study of identities and
   historical-political processes of our region. From the concept of
   enjoyment, it differentiates two modes of political enjoyment
   (linguistic and corporal) and plus enjoyment, it distinguishes two
   sub-types (permissive and restrictive enjoyment), with different
   gradients of structuring, and proposes some methodological strategies
   for social research. From the notion of ghost, it identifies three
   levels of structuring of the unconscious formations (ideological
   fantasies, political myths and universalist and essentialist
   constructions) and proposes an operative approach for Political Analysis
   of Discourse. Through the reading of symptoms by their forms of
   significant materialization it realize a distinction between the type of
   symptom, its content and the ways of dealing with the sinthome. In
   addition, developes some methodological strategies to identify, in a
   comparative way, relative intensities of dislocation and symbolic
   restructuring of the symptoms from the political dynamic. In the final
   section it analyzes some resources of the Lacanian theory that
   contributes to investigate the dimension of hegemonic efficacy. And it
   concludes with some normative (ethical-political) implications of its
   theoretical tools for the construction of a democratic and plural
   socialism, from a post-Marxist left.},

Abstract = {An extensive literature on aversive constitutionalism and elite
   blockages outlines the manner in which embedded political elites will
   generally reject or dilute reform agendas that threaten their privileged
   position within a constitutional configuration. It is for exactly this
   reason that the same seam of scholarship frequently highlights the role
   of crises in terms of providing a `window of opportunity' through which
   a significant or fundamental recalibration of a political system may be
   achieved. `The Palace of Westminster' the Joint Committee on Restoration
   and Renewal (R\&R) concluded in September 2016 `faces an impending
   crisis which we cannot possibly ignore'. Their recommendation was that
   the Palace be completely vacated for five to eight years so that a
   multibillion-pound programme of rebuilding work can be undertaken. This
   article offers the first research-based analysis of the `Scoping \&
   Planning' stage (2012-2016) and reveals the `hidden politics' of R\&R in
   the sense of how it threatens both the British Political Tradition and
   the position of the two main parties. This explains the nature of the
   very closed and secretive decision-making processes that have
   characterised this stage and why a number of formative decision-making
   points that have been deployed to frame and restrict the reform
   parameters.},

Abstract = {Why do some leaders protect their citizens from natural disasters while
   others do not? This paper argues that leaders in large coalition systems
   provide more protection against natural disasters than leaders in small
   coalition systems. Yet, autocrats also provide large-scale disaster
   protection if members of their winning coalition are exposed to natural
   hazards. The paper tests these propositions by examining cross-country
   variation in the number of sea-level stations as a lower bound for
   protection against ocean-originated disasters. Empirical evidence
   indicates that leaders in large coalition systems deploy more sea-level
   stations than their counterparts in small coalition systems. The
   evidence also shows that if the national capital is close to the coast,
   thus exposing members of the ruling coalition to ocean-originated
   hazards, leaders across political systems install more sea-level
   stations.},

   views? During the U.S. war in Vietnam, they asked what were the social
   consequences of that war on the Vietnamese, on the American soldiers,
   and on the American and Vietnamese nations. Such questions persuaded
   Steve to be a courageous part of the antiwar movement even if it made
   him ineligible for an Ivy League career. Steve was a man of principle
   who stood for what he saw was just. He identified with those who are
   exploited and despised lies, pretense, and injustice on a personal,

Journal = {OSTEUROPA},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {68},
Number = {1-2},
Pages = {211-222},
Abstract = {Svetlana Alexievich's work can be read in many different ways: as
   literature or as oral history, but also as a moral philosophical
   reflection on a large scale. The books in her ``red cycle{''} centre
   around experiences of despair and disruption, and in connection with
   these, the issue of the purpose of suffering. The individual texts offer
   different answers to these questions. In the first book, about women in
   the Second World War, suffering is the result of conscious action, while
   in the volumes that follow, the protagonists experience suffering
   passively and often without any greater meaning. In the final volume,
   Secondhand Time, this loss of meaning itself becomes the focus: the end
   of the Soviet Union brings about a ``moral revolution{''} which devalues
   lives lived and sacrifices made, and in so doing, engenders new
   suffering. At the same time, there is an intimation of a shift in the
   search for meaning from the collective to the personal.},

Abstract = {Hungary was a loser in the First World War, while Poland was a winner.
   Yet the devastation left behind by the war meant that both countries
   faced similar challenges. Violence was endemic, and poverty was
   widespread. Most people were indifferent to democracy, which made it
   impossible for it to take root. Anti-Semitism forged a path through to
   the centre of society, while the governments curtailed civil liberties
   to an increasing extent in the name of a `national rebirth' and `purity
   of the nation'. The development of both countries took an authoritarian
   turn.},

Title = {Online petitioning and politics: the development of Change.org in
   Australia},
Journal = {AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {53},

Pages = {428-445},
Abstract = {Online petitions are an important feature of contemporary political
   engagement in advanced democracies. In this paper we report on a unique
   data set - covering a five year period and over 17,000 petitions -
   documenting the development of the Change.org platform in Australia.
   Australia presents an interesting case as, until very recently, there
   was no national government hosted online petition site. Our analysis
   results in three findings that advance scholarship on online petitions.
   First, we find the majority of petitions are in fact targeted at
   government, and that their issue area is of a political nature. Second,
   we find that most signers of petitions sign a single petition - they are
   not serial participants. Finally, we show that super users' of the
   online petition system engage broadly as well as often. Together these
   findings demonstrate that online petition creation and signing - even on
   commercial platforms - is a distinct and important part of citizen
   engagement in politics.},

Title = {Between Scylla and Charybdis: religion, the military and support for
   democracy among Egyptians, 2011-2014},
Journal = {DEMOCRATIZATION},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {25},
Number = {2},
Pages = {273-292},
Abstract = {Democracy as a form of civilian rule must navigate a path between
   clerical and military powers, both of which are highly engaged in the
   politics of post-Mubarak Egypt. The authors ask in this article how mass
   support for democracy changed in Egypt between 2011 and 2014, and how
   this support is connected with views on religion and the role of the
   military. This question is important for understanding the prospects for
   democracy in a major state in the Arab world. It is also of comparative
   interest because of what change in the social and ideological drivers of
   mass attitudes may tell us about the nature of democratic support more
   generally. The authors' analysis is based on nationally representative
   surveys of Egyptians in 2011 after the country's first post-Mubarak
   parliamentary elections and in 2014 after the removal of the Islamist
   President Morsi. The findings indicate that Egyptians in large numbers
   favour both democracy and unfettered military intervention in politics.
   The authors also observe important shifts in the social bases of support
   for democracy away from religion but also from economic aspiration.
   Negative political experience with democratic procedures in 2011-2013
   seems to be the strongest factor behind the observed decrease in
   democratic support.},

   accommodation in a multinational federation},
Journal = {REGIONAL AND FEDERAL STUDIES},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {28},
Number = {4},
Pages = {447-468},
Abstract = {This article examines the politics of State formation in India by taking
   up the case of Telangana. Drawing from the emerging literature on the
   politics of recognition and territorial accommodation in multinational
   federations, I argue that territorial accommodation of Telangana was
   made possible by the convergence of strategic interests and role of
   multiple actors to recognize Telangana's distinctive territorial
   identity and accommodate its Statehood demand when an opportune
   `political opportunity structure' emerged in the late 1990s till 2014.
   It extends the insights of `actor-centred' institutionalism and
   contributes to an emerging literature which emphasizes the
   `multi-centred origins' of border change and State formation in India in
   particular, and in multinational federations in general. By underscoring
   State formation as a complex process, this article cautions against a
   simplistic reading of the politics of State formation in India as an act
   of one-upmanship whereby the Centre can unilaterally make or break State
   borders.},

Abstract = {In Democracy for Realists, Christopher Achen and Larry Bartels argue
   provocatively that the public falls far short of ideals of democratic
   citizenship, and they turn to political psychology to explain the
   empirics of mass political behavior. But their model of group identity
   fails to shed much light on the origins of political behavior and gives
   members of the public less credit than they deserve, for three reasons.
   First, group politics is not a hollow exercise; it depends on the
   identification of a collective grievance that has a potential political
   solution. Second, concerns about group economics, status, and respect
   are more likely than individual economic considerations to animate
   political behavior, yet the former concerns are no less rational than
   the latter. Third, individuals vary in how strongly they identify with
   politically relevant groups, masking considerable variation in the
   degree to which group affiliations shape political behavior. Therefore,
   group identification is not a monolithic, irrational force that affects
   people regardless of their perceptions of political reality.},

Abstract = {Exploring the degrees to which transnational, inter-governmental, and
   trans-governmental forces explain transatlantic behavior (and if a
   ranking is even discernible), this chapter shifts attention to
   historical human flows (of settlers, slaves, and ` courtyard knaves').
   While strengthening an earlier observation of south Atlantic and
   north-south Atlantic flows, the chapter finds the necessary and logical
   colonial needs for human flows sowing the seeds of enormous subsequent
   complications. It also (a) reaffirms the transatlantic-global linkage;
   (b) previews the illegal flows of the twentieth and twenty-first
   centuries, with cash, drugs, and humans as cargo; (c) scrutinizes the
   evolution of the functions of a central agency, such as the state; and
   (d) captures more glimpses of how the old, indigenous order across the
   Americas was completely transformed.},

   venue shopping in the EU},
Journal = {WEST EUROPEAN POLITICS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {41},
Number = {3, SI},
Pages = {754-778},
Abstract = {With deepening European integration, domestic interest groups have
   increasingly engaged in multi-level venue shopping. Regional authorities
   are no different and have represented their interests through both
   intra- and extra-state channels. There is some disagreement, however,
   over which of these channels are most frequently used. Similarly, there
   is little consensus on the ways in which partisan, institutional, and
   identity logics can affect the dynamics of venue shopping. To gain some
   insights into these questions, the article surveys 122 regional
   administrations in their home country. It finds that, when trying to
   influence the EU policy-shaping process from home, European regions use
   extra-state channels more frequently than intra-state ones. Party
   politics, institutions, and identity logics all affect venue selection,
   though differently. The general trend towards extra-state channels is
   indicative of the nature of the EU political system. The findings also
   have implications for questions of representation and democracy within
   such a system.},

   Worrisome Role of the Party VMRO-DPMNE},
Journal = {POLITICS AND GOVERNANCE},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {6},
Number = {3},
Pages = {55-66},
Abstract = {Between 2006 and 2017, the political power in the Republic of Macedonia
   was predominantly held by the Christian-democratic party VMRO-DPMNE. Its
   increasing opposition to gender and sexual equality manifested, inter
   alia, in the imposition of an antidiscrimination law, which did not
   explicitly recognise sexual orientation as a ground of discrimination,
   the replacement of the rather liberal abortion law with a restrictive
   one, and the two attempts to constitutionally define marriage as a
   heterosexual union. Building upon earlier inquiries into the development
   of the LGBT movement in Macedonia and the introduction of the new
   abortion law, I examine here the discourse which the ruling coalitions
   used to justify the removal of the term `sexual orientation' from the
   antidiscrimination law, and the need for a constitutional definition of
   marriage. I explore further how the authorities pushed their
   conservative agenda by undermining democracy through infringement of the
   official legislative procedures and suppression of dissent. In closing,
   I underline the retrograde impact of de-democratisation on the already
   and the yet to be attained progressive legislation and practices in the
   realm of gender and sexual equality.},

   group attachments tied to material or nonmaterial payoffs? What is the
   existing evidence for social identification due to nonmaterial payoffs?
   When do identities matter and for what sorts of behaviors? We highlight
   findings from several literatures in political science, ranging from
   voting and redistribution to violence and conflict, focusing on
   nonmaterial, identity-based motivations for behavior in these domains.
   Doing so allows us to draw out commonalities across research areas that
   are often held in isolation from one another and that frequently employ
   overlapping terminology. We summarize important findings and identify
   open questions; these questions include what the role played by elites
   is in shaping mass mobilization around identities and what the
   relationship is between social identities and social norms.},

Journal = {POLITICKE VEDY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {21},
Number = {2},
Pages = {159-177},
Abstract = {Security as a general and basic human need resonates in recent years in
   European civilisation increasingly. In particular, an ambient of the
   nearby regions by its instability and conflict character and expansion
   of emigrants is causing the definite security concerns of citizens from
   the old continent. The current militant conflicts in the world and
   up-to-date migration of emigrants to Europe encourages the need of a
   deep analysis of the existence and direction of security at the global,
   regional, or also national level. The Schengen area at the turn of a
   half of the second decade of the 21st Century found itself in a
   complicated situation in which its security records serious threat. This
   was mainly due to extreme waves of immigration from the crisis countries
   such as Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan and other by crisisaffected countries.
   The article describes the possibility of the Schengen area disturbance
   by the current war and other militant conflicts in its near and distant
   surroundings. The current migration wave, which mass-hit states of the
   developed countries in Europe, raises heretofore-undefined security
   threats in the social, demographic and political spheres. It is already
   clear that this intolerable situation, by its extensibility can deform
   or destroy the European system of the limitless economic cooperation.},

Title = {Is Divided Government a Cause of Legislative Delay?},
Journal = {QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {13},
Number = {2},
Pages = {173-206},
Abstract = {Despite the compelling theoretical prediction that divided government
   decreases legislative performance, the empirical literature has
   struggled to identify a causal effect. We suspect that a combination of
   methodological challenges and data limitations are to blame. Here, we
   revisit this empirical relationship. Rather than relying on traditional
   measures of legislative productivity, however, we consider whether
   divided government affects the ability of lawmakers to meet critical
   deadlines - specifically, the ability of state lawmakers to adopt an
   on-time budget (as mandated by state law). By focusing on delay instead
   of productivity we avoid measurement problems, particularly the
   challenges inherent in measuring the supply of and demand for
   legislation. To assess the causal effect of divided government, we
   develop and implement a regression discontinuity design (RDD) that
   accounts for the multiple elections that produce unified or divided
   government in separation of powers systems. Our RDD approach yields
   compelling evidence that divided government is a cause of delay. We also
   evaluate and find support for a new hypothesis that divided government
   is more likely to lead to delay when the personal and political costs
   that stalemate imposes on politicians are low.},

Title = {STRATEGIC STABILITY IN A DETERIORATING INTERNATIONAL ENVIRONMENT},
Journal = {POLIS-POLITICHESKIYE ISSLEDOVANIYA},
Year = {2018},
Number = {4},
Pages = {7-21},
Abstract = {The paper examines the challenges of ensuring strategic stability in a
   deteriorating international environment characterized by the
   increasingly conflictual relations between the United States and Russia.
   The U.S. recent policies increased the likelihood of a direct military
   confrontation between the two powers and of highly dangerous and rapidly
   escalating events comparable with the Cuban Missile Crisis. The paper
   emphasizes the significance of nuclear proliferation challenges and
   their negative impact on the U.S.-Russia strategic balance. Global
   strategic stability has been also undermined by a rapid development of
   various disruptive technologies and weapon systems including
   cyberwarfare and space warfare capabilities. The erosion of strategic
   stability takes place against the background of an ongoing complex
   transition from a unipolar world order to multipolarity. In order to
   effectively address multidimensional challenges of ensuring and
   strengthening strategic stability scholars and policymakers alike should
   focus on the U.S.-Russia strategic nuclear balance while taking into
   account the impact of the strategic ballistic missile defense systems,
   strategic non-nuclear weapons and tactical nuclear weapons.},

Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL THEORY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {17},
Number = {1},
Pages = {65-86},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {I demonstrate that a set of well-known objections defeat John Stuart
   Mill's plural voting proposal, but do not defeat plural voting as such.
   I adopt the following as a working definition of political equality: a
   voting system is egalitarian if and only if departures from a baseline
   of equally weighted votes are normatively permissible. I develop an
   alternative proposal, called procedural plural voting, which allocates
   plural votes procedurally, via the free choices of the electorate,
   rather than according to a substantive standard of competence. The
   alternative avoids standards objections to Mill's proposal. Moreover,
   reflection on the alternative plural voting scheme disrupts our
   intuitions about what counts as an egalitarian voting system. Undue
   emphasis on Mill's version of plural voting obscures three important
   reasons to reject plural voting in favor of strictly egalitarian voting
   systems: (1) that certain choices that generate inequalities of
   political power are morally impermissible; (2) that even chosen
   inequalities may undermine the potential epistemic benefits of
   democratic decision-making; and (3) that such choices may undermine
   citizens' commitments to democracy understood as a joint project.},

Pages = {463-479},
Abstract = {Australia has recently witnessed a dramatic reduction in the aid it
   provides to developing countries. Debates often focus on the
   implications for poverty eradication, but also at stake is Australia's
   leadership position in certain international financial institutions. To
   explore this political dimension, we examine the pattern of Australian
   aid to developing countries through the lens of the Bretton Woods
   Institutions: the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank.
   Specifically, we consider countries that elect Australia to the
   executive boards of these institutions. Using aid data from 1960 to 2009
   for 186 countries, we test whether Australia rewards members of its
   voting bloc with more foreign aid. Descriptive data and regression
   analyses support our hypothesis: Australia gives as much as 10 times
   more annual aid to bloc-members than to other developing countries. We
   take the finding as evidence of one of the many ways in which Australian
   aid can advance foreign policy objectives.},

Abstract = {Unexpectedly, during the last thirty years in Brittany, France, the
   criticism of agricultural productivism has led, with regard to intensive
   pig farming, to reinforcing the industrialist ideal and to developing
   more capitalist farms. To explain such a paradox first requires us to
   reconstruct the dynamics that led, at the local level, to turning the
   environmental damage caused by this farming system into the public
   problem that it was not initially considered to be. But this step is not
   enough. This article argues that it should be complemented with an
   analysis in terms of conflict of modernities and of modernization
   processes. The use of both of these notions, provided that they are
   given a proper sociological meaning, makes it possible to fight against
   oversight by researchers of the role played in social life by ideals and
   utopias, on the one hand, and on the other hand, of the movement
   impelled by the long-term evolutions whose dynamics generate
   contradictions and paradoxes in the present.},

Abstract = {The word populism can be confusing because of its polysemy - as well as
   the concept of ``people{''} from which it derives; nevertheless, the
   theoretical and political disputes surrounding the definition of
   populism are aggravating factors of this difficulty: it is therefore a
   polemical notion. In this sense, tracing a genealogy of the concept
   through contexts and temporalities seems to us useful to rethink
   populism, which has become an obligatory passage of contemporary
   political reflection without a minimum agreement on its definition. We
   will then make a critical analysis of the formal theory of populism
   proposed by the Argentine philosopher Ernesto Laclau (1935-2014).
   Although it renews the understanding on the subject, resignifying a term
   that has become essentially negative, we intend to demonstrate that its
   model bears a supposed deficit or normative limit.},

Abstract = {The fiscal sociology literature views the state at the heart of
   development, but in most developing countries, formal taxation is
   limited. Instead, local residents make substantial contributions outside
   the state to the provision of public goods. That is, they engage in what
   we call social extraction rather than state taxation. This article
   conceptualizes social extraction and the social institutions that drive
   extraction. Furthermore, it considers variations in the content of
   social institutions, and it proposes research agendas that allow us to
   understand how social institutions impact resource mobilization and
   development at the community level. It draws lessons from a large,
   cross-disciplinary literature that includes work in anthropology,
   sociology, economics, psychology, and political science.},

Abstract = {This paper provides a critical commentary on the claim advanced by Harry
   Brighouse and Adam Swift in their book Family Values: The Ethics of
   Parent-Child Relationships that there is an ineliminable conflict
   between relationship goods and fair equality of opportunity. I argue
   there need be no conflict between family values and equality of
   opportunity in a suitably non-hierarchical society. I also argue that
   the idea that equality of opportunity might be served by abolishing the
   family is mistaken. Egalitarian justice does not provide an obstacle to
   the realization of family values.},

Journal = {POLITICKE VEDY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {21},
Number = {1},
Pages = {58-76},
Abstract = {The Cyprus Island, located in Eastern part of Mediterranean Sea is known
   for decades of conflict known as ``Cyprus conflict{''}. There are two
   types of actors that attempt to resolve the conflict, firstly, citizens
   of local communities and secondly, various external actors. The main aim
   of this paper is to describe and examine the historical background of
   the activities of external actors, evaluate their input for solution of
   Cyprus conflict and analyse their current position and future interests
   on an issue. In addition to that, the paper contains a critical analysis
   of an influence of external actors in Cyprus conflict in the context of
   their interests and the power struggle in the mentioned region. The UN
   is still considered to be the most neutral element in the conflict. On
   the contrary, the EU's neutrality in the context of Cyprus conflict is
   questioned. The UK is interested in retention British sovereign base
   areas on Cyprus. It is clear that, Cyprus conflict represents an
   important part of Turkey's internal policy, as well as in Greece. All
   this affects the attitudes of the political garnitures of both sides of
   the conflict on the island and fundamentally affects the processes
   between them.},

   politics and media. This paper contributes to this discussion by
   critically evaluating the extent to which the Brexit referendum, the
   UK's vote to exit the European Union, was based on post-truth politics.
   The paper develops the argument that Brexit is a key example of
   post-truth politics, and that two key factors ushered in this new form
   of politics into the UK: 1) technological changes associated with social
   media, which lead to a situation in which a significant portion of the
   population acquire their news online, while anybody can post anything
   online without checks on the accuracy of the claims; 2) a growing
   distrust in democratic institutions, political elites, expertise, and
   traditional media gatekeepers which leads, in turn, to a loss of trust
   in established expert knowledge, leaving the population willing to rely
   on information originating from questionable sources. This combination
   of a decline in trust of politicians and experts with social media
   reliance, drove the British public to emotionally charged, value-based
   decision making to a greater extent than before, which thus supports the
   claim that post-truth politics is indeed a novel phenomenon. Our
   analysis of the Brexit referendum raises the need for scholars to study
   the daily activities of the population and focus on its role as an
   active regime shaper.},

Title = {Administrative reform assistance and democracy promotion: exploring the
   democratic substance of the EU's public administration reform principles
   for the neighbourhood countries},
Journal = {DEMOCRATIZATION},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {25},
Number = {4},
Pages = {673-691},
Abstract = {International donors, particularly the European Union (EU), vehemently
   endorse institution-building and public administration reform (PAR) in
   their work on democracy support. Still, the linkages between externally
   sponsored reform and advancement of democratic governance in beneficiary
   countries constitute a blind spot in our understanding of
   democratization. This article contributes to examining this relationship
   by exploring the democratic substance of the EU's PAR portfolio forthe
   neighbourhood countries. The aim of the article is to focus attention on
   the PA-democracy interface in the study of democracy promotion by
   elaborating a conceptual framework for exploring the nature of
   externally supported administrative reforms and the substantive content
   of democracy being advanced. By using the OECD/SIGMA's (Organization for
   Economic Co-operation and Development/Support for Improvement in
   Governance and Management) PAR framework for the European Neighbourhood
   Policy (ENP) countries as a case study, this article demonstrates how
   the EU's approach to programming PAR accommodates elements from several
   formats of democratic governance while the conceptualization of the
   democratic effects of the PAR principles remains vague. The article
   concludes by highlighting the need for closer examination of the
   potentials and limits of external PAR strategies in democracy support,
   and for attuning the EU's PAR design to its democratic implications.},

Abstract = {Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela, charismatic and iconic, is a product of his
   time and can only be understood within the context of the social
   movements that he belonged to and led. Thus, this article locates
   Mandela within the local and global context in which he emerged while at
   the same time making sense of his instrumental interventions and
   nationalist humanist vision of life, peace and justice. This article
   situates Mandela's political life within the broader context of the
   third humanist revolution, which was a response to the inimical
   processes of racism, enslavement and colonisation. In its centenary
   celebration of Mandela, the article re-articulates how he embodied
   alternative politics founded on the will to live as opposed to the will
   to power; the paradigm of peace as opposed to the paradigm of war;
   political justice as opposed to criminal justice; as well as
   pluriversality as opposed to tragic notions of racial separate
   development known as apartheid. What is fleshed out is a `Mandela
   phenomenon' as founded on strong progressive politics albeit predicated
   on the unstable idea of the potential of advocates and victims of
   apartheid undergoing a radical metamorphosis amenable to the birth of a
   new pluriversal society.},

Abstract = {When legislative term limits were proposed, one expected impact was an
   increase in women's legislative representation. However, researchers
   have found that this logical solution is not as effective as many had
   hoped. Because of findings of a partisan gap in the pipeline of
   potential female candidates, we argue that studies must consider the
   partisanship of the female legislators when analyzing the effect of term
   limits on increasing the number of female state legislators. This study
   utilizes a cross-sectional time-series analysis of 49 states from 1990
   to 2014. Our analyses suggest that Democratic women benefit from term
   limits while Republican women do not.},

Abstract = {Does the ability of newspapers to influence readers' political choices
   extend to third parties? In this paper, I exploit a rare third-party
   endorsement by the Richmond Times-Dispatch in the 2016 US Presidential
   election to evaluate whether voters can be persuaded by the print media
   to vote for an unorthodox alternative. To establish the causal effect of
   this endorsement, I exploit discontinuous access to the newspaper at the
   edges of its delivery area, combined with ZIP Code-level data on
   newspaper readership and vote totals. Estimates suggest that this
   endorsement's persuasion rate was similar to those reported in previous
   research on major-party endorsements, despite the substantial barriers
   faced by third parties and their potential supporters. This suggests
   that newspapers could draw voters away from major parties if they more
   frequently endorsed and covered them and, consequently, that the typical
   pattern of endorsing and covering major parties buttresses the
   Democratic-Republican party system.},

Abstract = {Drawing on Biafra as the most critical project in Igbo nationalism in
   Nigeria, this article examines the interpretations and appropriations of
   the Nigeria-Biafra War. It focuses on the meaning and significance of
   the war, and how contemporary neo-Biafran movements have appropriated
   and transformed the Biafran project into a basis for political action in
   their bid to resuscitate Igbo ambitions for self-determination. The
   article expatiates on the deployment of Biafra as a symbolic marker that
   captures the realization of an authentic Igbo national spirit, the
   ultimate act of Igbo self-determination and quest for nationhood in the
   Nigerian state.},

Abstract = {The 2015 Agreement on the Resolution of the Conflict in the Republic of
   South Sudan provides quite ambitiously and laudably for the creation of
   the Hybrid Court for South Sudan under the auspices of the African
   Union. The article is an extract from the author's 2016 LL.M.
   dissertation submitted to the University of Pretoria. It critically
   examines the salient features of the proposed court with the aim of
   testing the court's ability to effectively address historical grievances
   and injustices in South Sudan. In so doing, the article draws lessons
   from similar mechanisms in Africa and beyond. It also interrogates the
   role of the African Union and South Sudan in operationalising this
   court. It reveals strengths as well as weaknesses in the proposed design
   of the court as well as in the ability of the African Union and South
   Sudan to fulfil their obligations. Despite these weaknesses, the article
   argues that by harnessing the strengths identified and learning from
   lessons from across the continent, the African Union (AU) and South
   Sudan can overcome the anticipated challenges and operationalise a
   hybrid court which will effectively deliver sustainable justice to the
   victims of international crimes committed during the South Sudan civil
   war.},

Abstract = {Political activity is a type of social activity displayed by citizens.
   Observations and research indicate that gender can be a factor which
   conditions its degree and forms. Apart from biological gender, which
   shapes the societal roles of women and men, additional factors that are
   supposedly responsible for their activities include elements of the
   system of beliefs (i.e. acknowledged political values, conviction that
   political activity has an importance, level of satisfaction with
   democracy, as well as individualism and collectivism understood as an
   element of individual's mentality). The impact of those factors on the
   degree of unconventional political activities among women and men is the
   subject of surveys which were conducted in 2004, 2010, and 2014 on a
   group of 1048 students from Polish universities. The received results
   show that differences in political activity between surveyed men and
   women, as well as varying determinants in both groups, are slowly fading
   away. The most important predictors of women's political activity
   include: conviction of its significance in democracy, and (dis)
   satisfaction with the way it functions.},

Abstract = {Metropolitan areas represent the state-of-the-art way of living where
   people can find a lot of opportunities, nevertheless, local governments
   have been constantly overwhelmed by a public agenda that demands strong
   interaction between municipal actors that must carry on complex
   metropolitan public policies. In this article we analyze the roll that
   Jalisco's government has been playing in this scenario, the political
   networks that lead to a metropolitan agenda setting in social policy,
   the possibility that programs can be surpassing their frontiers and a
   balance between beneficiaries and budget, which leads to the fact that
   Guadalajara is not the one who needs assistance the most, but it is
   definitely the one that concentrates it.},

Journal = {REVISTA ANDINA DE ESTUDIOS POLITICOS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {8},

Abstract = {The present work studies the phenomenon of ``state capture{''} according
   to which an economic elite favors its interests exercising excessive and
   undue power over different institutions of Peru. The case of the Camisea
   Gas Project is presented, which operates in Block 88, which is
   superimposed on the Kugapakori Nahua Nanti Territorial Reserve, which is
   inhabited by indigenous peoples in a particularly vulnerable situation.
   The research addresses the time lapse in which the initiation of the
   second phase of activities for the expansion of the Exploration and
   Development Program within the Block (2013-2014) was requested and
   approved, and presents it as an example of how the so-called ``The
   national interest{''} is ``captured{''} and in reality it's the interest
   of the economic groups of power, which can act with impunity, even at
   the expense of restricting rights, encouraging the division of
   indigenous organizations, and limiting the very survival of entire
   peoples who live in crisis before a slow and negligent act of the
   competent state institutions.},

   illegality. Mexicans have been constructed as unassimilable and a threat
   to the US national polity. They are also viewed as working class likely
   to become a public charge. Mexican women have been imagined as extremely
   fertile and while their production has been desired, their reproduction
   has been feared. These social, political, and legal constructions
   resulted in the creation of Mexican illegality despite time of residence
   in the United States, ties to US citizens, or birthright citizenship.
   While scholars have documented immigration laws that have expatriated US
   citizen women (mainly of European racial backgrounds), policies that
   allowed for the deportation of ``public charge{''} cases, and the
   racialization of Mexicans, who were once considered legally white for
   naturalization processes; the three identity-based exclusions have not
   been examined together to understand Mexican experiences in the United
   States. This article utilizes a racial, class, and gendered analysis to
   understand the making of Mexican illegality that began with the 1790
   citizenship statue in which the United States Congress limited US
   citizenship rights to ``free `white people' and women's citizenship was
   determined by their fathers or husbands.{''} The making of Mexican
   illegality continues with today's immigration restrictions that perceive
   Mexicans as a threat to: national security, the white racial makeup of
   the country, and the stability of the economy.},

Abstract = {The humanitarian initiative for nuclear disarmament has challenged and
   transformed global nuclear politics. Aimed at delegitimising nuclear
   weapons as acceptable instruments of statecraft, the initiative has been
   backed by many civil society organisations and most non-nuclear-weapon
   states. The nuclear-weapon states, however, have opposed the initiative,
   accusing it of undermining the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and
   destabilising nuclear politics. Conceptualising a `diplomacy of
   resistance', this article positions the humanitarian initiative as a
   transnational social movement and traces its development through
   practices of resistance and counter-resistance. Drawing on Robert Cox's
   conception of resistance as counter-hegemonic and Michael Barnett and
   Raymond Duvall's taxonomy of power, the article explores the nexus of
   power and resistance in global nuclear politics. We explain the
   humanitarian movement's specific aims and practices as a function of its
   champion's relative political weakness vis-a-vis the nuclear-weapon
   states. The movement's coherence and effectiveness, in turn, was
   fostered by a coalitional logic that allowed different identities of
   resistance to be steered towards a nuclear ban treaty within the UN's
   institutional framework.},

   for which the International Centre for the Settlement of Investment
   Disputes (ICSID) released a Final Award on Jurisdiction in December
   2016: The Renco Group vs. Republic of Peru case. This was the first case
   where an American-based transnational mining company sued the Peruvian
   State under the legal framework of the US-Peru FTA, which entered into
   force in February 2009; with a favourable result for the Peruvian State.
   In order to understand the causes of this outcome, we deal with two
   different but complementary problems: the impact of the US-Peru FTA in
   domestic politics and its public policy outcomes, as well as the
   influence of these reforms in the Final Award given by the ICSID
   arbitration court.},

Abstract = {Altruism is an important omitted variable in much of the political
   economy literature. While material self-interest is the base of most
   approaches to redistribution (first affecting preferences and then
   politics and policy), there is a paucity of research on inequality
   aversion. I propose that other-regarding concerns influence
   redistribution preferences and that (1) they matter most to those in
   less material need and (2) they are conditional on the identity of the
   poor. Altruism is most relevant to the rich, and it is most influential
   when the recipients of benefits are similar to those financing them.
   Using data from the European Social Survey from 2002 to 2012, I will
   show that group homogeneity magnifies (or limits) the importance of
   altruism for the rich. In making these distinctions between the poor and
   the rich, the arguments in this article challenge some influential
   approaches to inequality, immigration, and voting.},

Abstract = {Anthony King's 1976 article Modes of executive-legislative relations:
   Great Britain, France and West Germany' is a classic in legislative
   studies. It argued that it is simplistic to analyse relations between
   the executive' and the legislature' in parliamentary systems, because
   parliaments are complex organisations comprised of competing actors.
   Instead, we must consider the various modes' through which these actors
   can interact to challenge the executive. As King pointed out, the
   classic view of the British Parliament was of a dominant opposition
   mode' and yet, in fact, the most important relationship was the
   intraparty mode': between the government and its own backbenchers. Other
   options, such as the non-party mode' or cross-party mode' were
   considered weak in Britain. This article revisits King's modes in the
   light of changes at Westminster during the intervening forty years.
   Developments such as the establishment of the select committee system
   and a more confident and party-balanced House of Lords require
   significant changes to his conclusions. But his central insights,
   encouraging readers to focus on the multiple relationships inside
   legislatures, including those within political parties, remain
   fundamentally important.},

   Organizations' Strategies},
Journal = {POLITICS AND GOVERNANCE},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {6},
Number = {4},
Pages = {103-114},
Abstract = {European Union (EU)-based Civil Society Organizations (CSOs) are usually
   pictured as well-established professionalized actors basing their
   advocacy strategies on the provision of expertise. Does the focus on
   expertise imply the removal of emotions and feelings from political
   communication? Following the emotion turn in social movement and
   collective action studies, this article investigates how and why
   EU-based CSOs use emotions in their advocacy strategies. The article
   shows first how CSOs use rhetorical appeals to emotions and rhetorical
   appeals to reason in their communication. Secondly, the focus is
   directed to emotion-inspired advocacy strategies, namely blaming and
   shaming, fear-mongering and boosting. The choice of rhetorical appeals
   and strategies is mainly explained by three different inter-related
   factors: the logics of influence, the logics of membership and media
   logics. Empirical data is drawn from a content analysis of press
   releases and policy documents of environmental (climate change) and
   human rights (refugee crisis) CSOs active at the EU level and from
   semi-structured interviews with key CSO representatives.},

Abstract = {In the last two decades, much has been written - for and against - about
   the relevance of Carl Schmitt's thought for a better understanding of
   the present-day situation of both global politics and Western
   democracies. This revival has led to new translations and reissues of
   Schmitt's works, including his less famous writings. Yet, little
   attention has been paid to his early works, and in particular to his
   prewar writings from 1910 to 1914. By focusing on these seminal texts,
   the article aims at showing the relevance of some key concepts that
   Schmitt introduced for the first time in the early 1910s and that would
   have fully developed in the institutional writings of the early 1930s.
   In this perspective, particular attention will be paid to the
   normalising function of judicial practices and the key role of the
   judges in securing a stable social order in a way that is far from being
   consistent with Schmitt's decisionism of the 1920s. At the same time,
   the article intends to offer an alternative interpretation of Schmitt's
   political theory as a whole, by making a distinction between three
   different types of decisionism: deliberative, sovereign and
   institutional.},

Abstract = {The Sykes-Picot Agreement structured the Middle East resulting from the
   decomposition of the Ottoman Empire according to the interests of the
   European powers of the time. This extra-regional design was altered from
   1945 on by the emergence of the Cold War, polarizing the region.
   Following the end of the bipolar era, the growing securitization of
   international politics after 9/11 and the outbreak of violent conflicts
   in the region have relaunched the geopolitical analysis of the Middle
   East and emphasized its ``gray area{''} character. The situation has
   been instrumented by some regional actors and also by great powers that
   compete for hegemony. A new geopolitical map is being developed that may
   transform the Middle East in the coming decades.},

Abstract = {Since the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty, regional parliaments
   may be consulted by national parliaments in the framework of the Early
   Warning System to voice their opinion on European legislative proposals
   infringing the subsidiarity principle. Out of the eight Member States
   including regional parliaments, six States have a bicameral legislative
   system. This paper examines whether one of these two chambers, the
   second chamber, may be invested with the task of spokesperson of the
   regional parliaments' interests. This question has to be analyzed, on
   the one hand, from a theoretical perspective, in light of the
   particularities of the second chambers, of their internal evaluation
   proceedings of European legislation and of the diversity of
   institutional mechanisms allowing regions to voice their opinions; and
   on the other hand, in analyzing the effective participation of both
   second chambers and regional parliaments in the Early Warning System.},

Abstract = {As violent extremists continue to surface in online discussion forums,
   law enforcement agencies search for new ways of uncovering their digital
   indicators. Researchers have both described and hypothesized a number of
   ways to detect online traces of potential extremists, yet this area of
   inquiry remains in its infancy. This study proposes a new search method
   that, through the analysis of sentiment, identifies the most radical
   users within online forums. Although this method is applicable to
   web-forums of any type, the method was evaluated on four Islamic forums
   containing approximately 1 million posts of its 26,000 unique users.
   Several characteristics of each user's postings were examined, including
   their posting behavior and the content of their posts. The content was
   analyzed using Parts-Of-Speech tagging, sentiment analysis, and a novel
   algorithm called `Sentiment-based Identification of Radical Authors',
   which accounts for a user's percentile score for average sentiment
   score, volume of negative posts, severity of negative posts, and
   duration of negative posts. The results suggest that there is no simple
   typology that best describes radical users online; however, the method
   is flexible enough to evaluate several properties of a user's online
   activity that can identify radical users on the forums.},

Abstract = {In 1917 the Provisional Government of the Russian Empire orders to the
   soldiers to renew their oath of allegiance, not to the decayed Emperor
   (Gosudar) but rather to the State (Gosudarstvo). Many soldiers refuse to
   do so and proclaim: ``If there is no more Gosudar, there is no
   Gosudarstvo{''}. The elites understand: ``If there is no Emperor, there
   is no State{''}, even though the soldiers are saying ``if there is no
   Master, there is no Master's domain{''}. The immediate reason of this
   misunderstanding lies in the polisemy of the two Russian concepts, but
   its temporal structure is problematic. The historical-conceptual
   analysis discovers a temporal relationship among concepts and states of
   things (Sachegeschichte) which is not visible from the social history's
   point of view.},

Title = {EMPIRE AS A NOTION AND CONCEPT OF MODERN POLITICAL SCIENCE: THE PROBLEMS
   OF INTERPRETATION},
Journal = {POLIS-POLITICHESKIYE ISSLEDOVANIYA},
Year = {2018},
Number = {4},
Pages = {22-36},
Abstract = {The article deals with the problems associated with the actualization of
   the empire theme in contemporary political studies with reference to
   current political processes. The empire is explored as a concept of
   political science and as a notion. The term ``empire{''} denotes a
   special type of state that has universalist political claims and a
   structure of political institutions that ensures the concentration of
   power and its resources. The concept of ``empire{''} is characterized by
   negative connotations, as well as ambiguity of interpretations as
   applied to the present. Two main interpretations of the empire are
   considered: the ideocratic and the center-peripheral one. The
   methodological limitations associated with attempts to apply them in the
   analysis of modern political institutions are shown. Thus, the
   application of center-peripheral approach leads to the erosion of the
   picture of center itself, as a subject of politics and management. The
   ideocratic interpretation of the concept ``empire{''} is limited by
   modern trends of the de-ideologization of the state. In American
   political science the concept of ``empire{''} is actualized in
   connection with attempts to advocate the role of the U.S. in
   post-bipolar world politics, their attempts to establish the world
   hegemony. At the same time, the concept of ``empire{''} is actually
   replaced by the established categorical apparatus for the study of
   international relations and is intended to emphasize the unique, in the
   opinion of foreign researchers, nature of U.S. domination. In other
   interpretations of modern imperialism, it is identified with the great
   power and is used to characterize a number of modern states and their
   alliances. In the article, conclusions are drawn about the serious
   theoretical and methodological difficulties of interpreting the empire
   as a concept of modern politics, connected not only with the complexity
   of the empire phenomenon itself, but also with the fact that the
   attempts considered are based on the concept of empires of the era of
   imperialism, a special period characterized by domination
   states-empires. It seems promising to consider the `` empire{''} as a
   type of conceptualization of policy based on specific political
   interests, and its implementation is possible in the event of
   legitimization of its imperial nature.},

Abstract = {Asylum law and policy are tightly connected to migration, which remains
   an omnipresent phenomenon in the globalized world and an alarming issue
   of the 21st Century. Some of the European countries including Germany,
   Austria and Switzerland have been dealing with immigrants for more than
   a century. In other countries, such as Slovakia, it is a relatively new
   phenomenon. The current study aimed to provide a comparative insight by
   pointing out political, institutional and legislative frameworks of
   asylum in the German-speaking countries and in Slovakia, and to
   highlight particularities of the asylum procedures and legal terminology
   of the respective countries in the context of the European law. The
   analysis and legal comparison showed that following EU legislation, the
   countries had undergone legislative changes as well as establishing a
   number of new institutions, with specifics stemming from differences in
   preexisting asylum and migration policies. This process was determined
   mainly by the increased pressure on the migration systems, which
   reflected in the need to improve the efficiency of the migration system
   management.},

Abstract = {This paper examines the persistent gender gap in electoral politics at
   the local level in Buenos Aires, Argentina. I argue that the combination
   of the division of political work and existing social norms regarding
   the separation of domestic chores contributes to women's political
   underrepresentation at the local level. Studying everyday politics in
   Buenos Aires, a clear division of political work between men and women
   was found. Only women were in charge of finding solutions to issues of
   domestic abuse and violence, and of taking care of children, the
   pregnant, and senior citizens. Using information from Buenos Aires
   municipalities, I document the gender gap in elected legislative and
   executive offices at the local level - as well as in non-elected offices
   within municipal cabinets. It was also found that the types of political
   work assigned to female activists and candidates reinforce existing
   stereotypes of women as mothers of the poor.},

Abstract = {The European community's response to a sweeping growth of value of
   intellectual resources in late the late XX - early XXI century was to
   initiate seven consecutive framework programs, aimed at support and
   intensification of European scientific co-operation during the period
   from 1983 till 2013. The new phase, which influenced higher education
   and the European scientific community, was the Lisbon Process, aimed at
   increase of Europe's competitiveness and creation of Europe of
   Knowledge. European scientific community's goal became the achievement
   of a unified research and area. In the article the author offers a
   detailed analysis of the most voluminous program for support of research
   and innovation in the history of the EU - ``Horizon 2020{''} with a
   total budget of 80 billion euro aimed at the completion of European
   Research Area. The author considers three pillars, which the program is
   based on: excellent science, industrial leadership, and societal
   challenges. The article examines economic and political circumstances,
   which have led to the adoption of the Horizon 2020. The author concludes
   that the program reflects the interests of the scientific community: it
   consistently accentuates such problems as climate change and Europe's
   technological gap in relation to the U.S., both of which threaten dire
   consequences and can only be addressed by scientists. However, it
   prioritizes the interests of a small group of leading researchers
   connected to leading universities and transnational corporations, which
   become to be identified as the European scientific community.},

Abstract = {Survey questions concerning citizenship guidelines, naturalization

   knowledge of immigration. However, a feature of US immigration
   enforcement is noticeably absent: the role of state elected officials in
   making policies on immigrant treatment. Using policy data from the
   National Council of State Legislature and a nationally representative
   sample of US voters in the 2014 Cooperative Congressional Election Study
   (CCES), I validate answers to factual policy questions about whether
   respondents believe their state enacted three common state policies that
   affect immigrants: authorizing police to enforce immigration law,
   offering in-state tuition benefits for undocumented students, and
   requiring employers to verify the lawful status or citizenship of
   employees. I find that citizens align their answers to factual
   immigration policy questions with their predispositions toward
   immigrants, even if their answers are verifiably incorrect. The results
   suggest that anti-immigrant citizens seem more knowledgeable of local
   immigration policies, but only because most state policies on immigrant
   treatment are restrictive and are consistent with their negative beliefs
   about immigrants and immigration.},

Abstract = {Any assessment of the democratic nature of representation should look at
   both electoral and non-electoral representation yet few empirical
   studies have looked into the latter. To increase our understanding of
   non-electoral representation, we use Saward's concept of representative
   claims, which helps bring into view a broad variety of representatives.
   Our empirical study of decentralized social and healthcare policies in
   the Netherlands describes the actors making representative claims at the
   local level, including elected, appointed non-elected and self-appointed
   non-elected representatives working on a variety of bases, such as
   elections, expertise and shared experience. Their democratic nature is
   assured by authorization and accountability mechanisms, including but
   not only election. However, a number of difficulties are encountered in
   assuring responsiveness in practice. We conclude that non-electoral
   representation can and does strengthen democratic representation at the
   local level. This study reflects on the strengths and weaknesses of the
   representation practices found and on what our findings mean for future
   studies of representation.},

Title = {Intersecting Spheres of Analysis in Business and Human Rights:
   Developing a New Socio-Legal Research Agenda and Methodology for UN
   Guiding Principle No 9},
Journal = {NORDIC JOURNAL OF HUMAN RIGHTS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {36},

Pages = {333-352},
Abstract = {Existing methodological approaches to business and human rights
   frequently fail to address the broad spectrum of relevant issues in the
   field. Persistent disciplinary silos and normative limitations of key
   legal and governance instruments result in reductive normative
   approaches and ultimately in ineffective policies. Focusing on the
   normative environment covered by UN Guiding Principle on Business and
   Human Rights No 9, specifically on the intersection between business and
   human rights in international investment, this paper argues for the need
   to put forward interdisciplinary socio-legal methodologies. It contends
   that any comprehensive methodology addressing the field ought to account
   for the specificity of existing governance models, the intrinsic
   dominant role of corporate actors and the socio-legal complexity
   displayed at the intersection of human rights with business and market
   mechanisms. The analysis developed is advanced not as a `model'
   methodology but as an instance of mapping out how a relatively narrow
   governance approach can be enhanced methodologically in order to better
   inform research and policy design.},

Abstract = {There are parallels between the most recent political events in Poland
   and Hungary. It is tempting to explain them from the perspective of
   their similar historical development during the course of the 20th
   century. However, in reality, the experiences of the two countries were
   very different. They were on different sides during the Second World
   War, and while in 1956, the uprising in Hungary was put down by the Red
   Army, in Poland, the party leader Gomutka succeeded in preventing Soviet
   troops from marching into the country after the Poznan riots.
   Accordingly, the relationship between the regime and society, as well as
   the history of the opposition during the three decades that followed,
   developed in different ways. The rise of the Law and Justice party (PiS)
   and Fidesz is not a direct consequence of the communist era. Both
   parties owe their success to their specific portrayal of history.},

Abstract = {In the context of the discussion of the fiscal decentralisation and the
   European Union's efforts to fulfil the principle of the fiscal
   equalisation, it should be noted that the issue of the decentralisation
   and in the particular fiscal decentralisation is considered to be a
   significant factor in the quality of the public sector working in the
   European Union. The paper presents the results of the monitoring of the
   current situation and development over the past 5 years in the area of
   fiscal decentralisation measured by selected indicators of the income
   side of budgets of 6 cities. In relation to the issue of
   decentralisation of incomes in Czech and Slovak Republic, the measure of
   financial self-sufficiency of municipal budgets is measured by
   indicators that express the share of entrusted taxes in total tax
   revenues, the share of real estate tax revenue in the tax and total
   revenues and the share of own revenues in total budget receipts. The
   results of the analytical-synthetic study show that the collection of
   the real estate tax and the volume of other local taxes and fees for
   both fiscal units in the Czech Republic as well as in the set of towns
   in Slovakia have posted a moderate increase in monitored years. It can
   be said that the current model of decentralisation of public
   administration in Slovakia and the Czech Republic can be described as a
   combined model according to the theory of fiscal federalism with
   prevailing elements of decentralisation from the political and
   administration perspective and centralisation from the fiscal aspect.},

Abstract = {This study uses the case of a German American association in the 1920s
   as a historical case study to gain a better understanding of the
   integration of an immigrant group in American society. Philanthropy,
   membership recruitment tactics, and associational mission are used as
   analytical categories in the analysis of German Americans' processes of
   assimilation against the background of the aftermath of the First World
   War and Prohibition. Philanthropy and associational membership provide a
   vantage point for studying dynamics of identity, assimilation, and
   integration. The study argues that the difficulty of transitioning from
   a membership of German origin to a membership of second-generation
   immigrants played a major role in the progressive membership decline of
   this organization. This study points to challenges of an ethnic-based
   membership association in maintaining its relevance within an immigrant
   community in the face major political, social, and economic
   transformations, while attempting to renew its membership.},

Abstract = {The concept of ``overdetermination{''}-developed by Freud, Lukacs, and
   Althusser, among others-shook the received wisdom of Marxists who
   engaged with it (rather than ignoring or dismissing it). Engagement
   forced a rethinking of the philosophical foundations of modern Marxism:
   both its notion of what theory is and does and its notion of what
   society is and how it changes. Steve Resnick and Rick Wolff together
   undertook that engagement and that rethinking subject to all the
   influences stemming from their time's particular phase of capitalist
   development: from the Cold War, from the ideologically servile
   structures of U.S. academia, from their personal and family lives. In
   short they used the concept of overdetermination to rethink Marxism and
   especially Marxist economics. This essay likewise uses overdetermination
   to explain something about their collaboration, including its importance
   in and to their lives and works from 1973 to 2013.},

   India and Pakistan; their bilateral relations greatly determine the
   existing balance of power in the region of South Asia and are marked
   with high level of tension and mutual mistrust. Since the Independence
   of the former members of the British Dominion in 1947 the sides consider
   each other as the main potential adversary. After nuclear tests
   conducted by both countries the conformation of New Delhi and Islamabad
   escalated to a new level, and the state of bilateral relations is a
   matter of reasonable concern all over the globe. The analysis of
   military doctrines of India and Pakistan gives every reason to think
   that, despite the aggressive and jingoish rhetoric of the sides, they
   are not ready for a full-scale war, and military warfare will be limited
   and short-term.},

Abstract = {The German Prevention Act of 2015 obliges the statutory health insurance
   funds to contract framework agreements with the Lander and the other
   social insurances. The agreements display ahigh variance in respect to
   the degree of commitment for binding joint action as well as in regard
   to the role of the Lander ministries. Using aframework based on the
   actor-centred institutionalism, we analyse actors' resources and
   orientations, and the interaction between health funds and ministries
   during the negotiation process in five Lander. The analysis reveals that
   the differences between the Lander primarily result from differing
   orientations for action of the ministries. Furthermore, we found
   differences in the interaction that also had an impact on negotiation
   outcomes. Ministries' orientations towards action and interaction were
   both influenced by their (missing) cooperation experiences with health
   funds. The ministries' orientations for action, furthermore, mirror the
   relevance of preventive policies in the respective Lander.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this article is to reflect on an aspect, scarcely
   explored, of the multiple links among art, aesthetics and politics.
   Particularly, we analyse one dimension of the aesthetics of politics,
   namely: the forms of appearance of social movements in the public space,
   in this case, the Frente Popular Dario Santillan Rosario, a social
   organization of the city of Rosario (Argentina), between 2004 and 2012.
   We analyze different components of this dimension, namely: a) the
   configuration of a piquetera dramaturgy which we understand as the
   dramatic use of emblematic elements of the piquetera political grammar;
   b) the carnivalization process of protest, in other words, the
   constitution of a festive form of appearing in the public space; and c)
   the mystical dimension of its politics, that is, organized celebratory
   practices of motivation and renewal of faith and political commitment.
   We propose the hypothesis that in the composition and recreation of the
   aesthetic dimension of politics, in the fabulation of these forms of
   appearing in the public space, a large part of the configuration of the
   collective subjectivity of this social movement is settled. In other
   words, we argue that complex processes of aesthetic subjectivity have
   been involved in the collective subjectivation of the Frente Popular

Abstract = {This article reflects on the proliferation of responses to the so-called
   phenomenon of ``foreign terrorist fighters,{''} and the profound human
   rights challenges they give rise to. It considers national, regional and
   international developments, many spurred by an activist Security
   Council, through which expanded powers have been assumed and rights
   restricted by reference to the need to respond to FTF threats. A series
   of uncomfortable relationships emerge from this analysis. They include
   for example tensions: between the evolving and still relatively
   superficial understanding of the nature and source of uncertain threats
   and contributing factors on the one hand, and the onerous and
   far-reaching nature of responses directed against them on the other;
   between the expansive use of coercive measures including criminal law,
   and basic constraining principles of criminal law upon which its
   legitimacy and power depends, such as individual culpability, harm
   principle and remoteness; or between the original purposes of most FTF
   measures and their impact in practice, on the operation of humanitarian
   law, on humanitarian workers and human rights defenders, and on the rule
   of law. Exceptional FTF measures continue to spread their reach and
   creep into other areas of security and organised crime. The article
   highlights the need to consider the short and long term impact, on the
   full range of rights of many, of the array of administrative, criminal
   and other measures being passed into law and implemented in practice
   across the globe in the name of responding to the ill-defined phenomenon
   of ``FTFS{''}.},

Abstract = {In recent decades election campaigns have shifted their focus from the
   local to the national level, increasingly featuring party leaders,
   labels, and national platforms. Despite this trend, there remains
   significant variation in the local/national orientation of campaigns
   across countries and parties. This article tests several propositions on
   why campaigns adopt a local or national orientation by analyzing a
   unique collection of more than 12,000 geocoded Thai election posters.
   Specialized software was used to measure the spatial proportions of
   visual and textual content on each poster. Using Thailand's mixed
   electoral system to enable a controlled comparison of electoral rules, I
   demonstrate that proportional rules were associated with national
   campaign strategies whereas majoritarian rules fostered local
   strategies. In addition, large parties ran party-centered,
   policy-focused campaigns whereas small parties relied more on their
   leader's image. This contrasts with Western countries, where large
   parties increasingly promote their leader's image and small parties
   emphasize narrower policy objectives.},

Abstract = {This article explores the challenges and opportunities presented by
   advances in artificial intelligence (AI) in the context of information
   operations. The article first examines the ways in which AI can be used
   to counter disinformation online. It then dives into some of the
   limitations of AI solutions and threats associated with AI techniques,
   namely user profiling, micro-targeting, and deep fakes. Finally, the
   paper reviews a number of solutions that could help address the spread
   of AI-powered disinformation and improve the online environment. The
   article recognises that in the fight against disinformation, there is no
   single fix. The next wave of disinformation calls first and foremost for
   societal resilience.},

Abstract = {This article presents an explanation for the success of the right in the
   2015 Swiss parliamentary election based on the spatial model of voting.
   Since there is no party combining economically left with culturally
   authoritarian policy stances, voters with that preference combination
   face a difficult electoral choice. We show that they are more likely to
   abstain, and that those voters who turn out are more likely to cast
   votes for the right who represents them on cultural issues. We argue
   that this behavior is due to the fact that voters with this culturally
   conservative and economically left preferences attach more weight to
   cultural issues when making an electoral choice. On the aggregate, both
   findings imply an underrepresentation of economically left interests in
   the election result, and lead to a disproportional vote share for the
   right.},

Title = {The Court of Justice and treaty revision: A case of strategic leniency?},
Journal = {EUROPEAN UNION POLITICS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {19},
Number = {4},
Pages = {570-596},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Students of European Union judicial politics have debated the
   credibility of legislative override as constraint on the behaviour of
   the European Court of Justice. Yet because of the high political hurdles
   for the passage of treaty amendments, treaty revision has been dismissed
   as the `nuclear option', exceedingly effective but difficult to use.
   However, when treaties are being renegotiated, the ability of member
   state governments to pass treaty amendments to either punish or reward
   the Court is greater. We argue that this may induce the Court of Justice
   to display more leniency towards member states in cases coinciding with
   ongoing treaty negotiations. To test this hypothesis, we examine the
   outcome of all infringement cases adjudicated between 1961 and 2016. We
   find that the European Court of Justice is significantly less likely to
   render adverse rulings in cases concomitant with the final, most salient
   stage of treaty negotiations. Our analysis suggests that the
   relationship between treaty revision and judicial behaviour may be more
   nuanced than commonly assumed in the literature.},

Abstract = {This article studies the heterogeneity of cantonal SVP branches in terms
   of populism and relates it to individual populist attitudes around the
   2015 National Council elections. Quantitative text analysis of party
   manifestos delivers measures of populism for 24 cantonal branches of the
   SVP. These estimates are related to individual-level 2015 Selects survey
   data. The results indicate that there is still a variety of populism
   between the different cantonal branches of the SVP, even after the split
   into two parties (BDP and SVP). Evidence for general correspondence
   between contextual populism (supply side) and individual-level populist
   attitudes (demand side) is limited, but some patterns related to the
   existence of the BDP emerge.},

Abstract = {This paper examines the mechanisms of deliberation and conflict
   resolution in Chinese urban middle-class residential communities. Along
   with the rise of private home ownership and urban middle-class
   residential estates, disputes and conflicts have risen between the
   residents, resident self-elected organization (homeowner associations),
   real estate developer and property management companies, and the local
   government. Through the lens of deliberation in middle-class
   neighborhoods, this paper analyzes (1) how and to what extent
   deliberation is introduced and employed as an instrumental tool by the
   local government to achieve their goal of maintaining social stability.
   (2) In what ways and to what extent deliberation has served as part of
   governance strategies. And (3) whether and how the state and non-state
   actors interact with each other during this process to produce more
   democratic governance under the Party-state's authoritarian rule. This
   paper adopts a systemic approach to examine authoritarian deliberation
   as a neighborhood governance strategy. The findings suggest that (1)
   deliberation has become an instrumental tool for conflict resolution
   introduced by the local government to middle-class neighborhoods.
   Residents' Committees, on behalf of the state, has become key
   coordinator and mediator during the deliberation process. (2) The
   systemic approach of authoritarian deliberation includes a mix of
   deliberative elements and other features of political culture,
   traditions, strategies, and institutions. The dynamic interactions
   between deliberation and authoritarianism, between deliberative and
   non-deliberative features, and between formal deliberative meetings and
   informal deliberative talks all contribute to a functional deliberative
   system.},

Abstract = {Since the 2008 global financial crisis, the landscape of South-South
   cooperation has greatly changed mainly due to the ongoing power shift
   from the North to the South. Rising economies like China and India are
   taking the lead in driving forward the institutional development of
   South-South cooperation despite lingering challenges that call for
   collective actions and mutual support among developing countries. Based
   on the principle of achieving shared benefits through consultation and
   collaboration, China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) has presented a
   good opportunity for reinvigorating South-South cooperation and drawing
   concerted efforts from the international community to reduce the global
   deficits in peace, development and governance. In the long run, the BRI
   is expected to facilitate a new round of economic globalization and help
   shape a more balanced and efficient system of global economic
   governance, which will serve as the basis for jointly building a
   ``community of shared future for mankind{''} proposed by the Chinese
   government.},

Abstract = {Rationalist models of judicial decision-making expect courts to defend
   their institutional integrity in politically sensitive cases. This
   article presents two African case studies of courts not doing so. They
   have elicited predictable backlash from executives and placed their
   institutions in avoidable danger. I argue that judges' desire for esteem
   from emerging global judicial networks can explain this otherwise
   puzzling behaviour. These new networks become particularly salient in
   human rights cases. This conclusion partially supports Anne-Marie
   Slaughter's controversial claims about the significance of `the global
   community of law' but also identifies risks this poses for courts'
   domestic authority. The argument is made with reference to two recent
   and well-known decisions by the High Court of Botswana and the Southern
   African Development Community Tribunal. The first case, Sesana (2006),
   dealt with the vexed question of indigenous rights in Africa. The second
   case, Campbell (2008), concerned the compensation of expropriated
   commercial farmers from Zimbabwe.},

Abstract = {Do elected representatives have a time-constant representation focus or
   do they adapt their focus depending on election proximity? In this
   article, we examine these overlooked theoretical and empirical puzzles
   by looking at how reelection-seeking actors adapt their legislative
   behavior according to the electoral cycle. In parliamentary democracies,
   representatives need to serve two competing principals: their party and
   their district. Our analysis hinges on how representatives make a
   strategic use of parliamentary written questions in a highly
   party-constrained institutional context to heighten their reselection
   and reelection prospects. Using an original data set of over 32,000
   parliamentary questions tabled by Portuguese representatives from 2005
   to 2015, we examine how time interacts with two key explanatory
   elements: electoral vulnerability and party size. Results show that
   representation focus is not static over time and, in addition, that
   electoral vulnerability and party size shape strategic use of
   parliamentary questions.},

Abstract = {Theories of legislative committees, lobbying, and cue-taking assume
   information affects legislators' support for policy alternatives.
   However, there is little direct, empirical evidence to support this
   foundational assumption about legislative behavior. This article reports
   results from a field experiment in which state legislators were randomly
   assigned to receive policy research about pending proposals. Results
   show that policy information increased aggregate cosponsorship by 60\%
   above baseline rates. For one bill covered critically, information
   diminished cosponsorship and roll-call voting support. Results are
   broadly consistent with information signaling models' predictions about
   the importance of information to position taking.},

Abstract = {In this article we analyse Stulhofer and Buric's empirical hommage
   (2015, 2016) to Zupanov's egalitarian syndrome theory (EST). We show
   that the authors neglect fundamental steps in research design, including
   the imperative of situating their argument within the existing research
   on the topic. Furthermore, the authors fail to fully acknowledge the
   implications of the multidimensionality of EST, both in their
   conceptualisation and in their choice of statistical analyses. We show
   why the data that they use are not appropriate for the analyses that
   they undertake. In contrast to that, in our comparative analysis of
   income inequality preferences across countries Croatian citizens turn
   out to be quite average. Citizens of Germany or Switzerland seem to be
   more strongly oriented towards income equality ({''}uravnilovka{''})
   than citizens of Croatia. These findings clearly challenge
   interpretations according to which preferences for greater income
   equality are remnants of a socialist past, or those according to which
   such demands pose obstacles to societal development. Taking all this on
   board, we conclude that the egalitarian syndrome theory remains a
   theoretical fantasy.},

Abstract = {Recent emphasis on credible causal designs has led to the expectation
   that scholars justify their research designs by testing the plausibility
   of their causal identification assumptions, often through balance and
   placebo tests. Yet current practice is to use statistical tests with an
   inappropriate null hypothesis of no difference, which can result in
   equating nonsignificant differences with significant homogeneity.
   Instead, we argue that researchers should begin with the initial
   hypothesis that the data are inconsistent with a valid research design,
   and provide sufficient statistical evidence in favor of a valid design.
   When tests are correctly specified so that difference is the null and
   equivalence is the alternative, the problems afflicting traditional
   tests are alleviated. We argue that equivalence tests are better able to
   incorporate substantive considerations about what constitutes good
   balance on covariates and placebo outcomes than traditional tests. We
   demonstrate these advantages with applications to natural experiments.},

Abstract = {We analyze a model of policy making in which only one actor (e.g., a
   bureaucratic agency or a well-funded interest group) has the capacity to
   develop high-quality policy proposals. By virtue of her skills, this
   actor has an effective monopoly on policy development and thus can craft
   proposals that are good for herself but provide few benefits to decision
   makers who enact policies. We then examine institutional responses that
   decision makers can use to induce a policy-development monopolist to
   craft more appealing proposals: (i) establishing in-house policy
   development capacity, (ii) delegating authority to an agent who
   counterbalances the monopolist's preferences, and (iii) fostering
   competition by policy developers with different preferences. We apply
   our model to a diverse set of contexts, including lobbying in
   term-limited state legislatures, regulation of banking and financial
   services, and administrative procedures for rule making in US federal
   bureaucracies.},

Abstract = {This article revisits Nelson Polsby's classic article ``The
   Institutionalization of the U.S. House of Representatives{''} fifty
   years after its publication, to examine whether the empirical trends
   that Polsby identified have continued. This empirical exploration allows
   us to place Polsby's findings in broader historical context and to
   assess whether the House has continued along the ``institutionalization
   course{''}-using metrics that quantify the degree to which the House has
   erected impermeable boundaries with other institutions, created a
   complex institution, and adopted universalistic decision-making
   criteria. We empirically document that careerism plateaued right at the
   point Polsby wrote ``Institutionalization,{''} and that the extension of
   the careerism trend has affected Democrats more than Republicans. The
   House remains complex, but lateral movement between the committee and
   party leadership systems began to reestablish itself a decade after
   ``Institutionalization{''} was published. Finally, the seniority system
   as a mechanism for selecting committee chairs-the primary measure of
   universalistic decision-making criteria-has been almost thoroughly
   demolished. Thus, most of the trends Polsby identified have moderated,
   but have not been overturned. We conclude by considering the larger set
   of interpretive issues that our empirical investigation poses.},

   practices and intellectual discourse developed in NGOs related to the
   educational field during the Dictatorship, emphasizing two institutions:
   Centro de Investigacion y Desarrollo de la Educacion (CIDE) and Programa
   Interdisciplinario de Investigaciones en Educacion (PIIE). From the
   analytical point of view the article emphasizes the perspective of
   social history of ideas, linking political and social context with the
   intellectual one. Were researched the most of publications of the NGOs
   and two interviews were conducted with CIDE members during that time.},

Abstract = {While it is widely appreciated that public political action can be
   socially costly, there is little evidence of the effects of social
   pressure on petition signing despite its importance as a mode of
   political participation. We examine the social costs of petition signing
   in the context of mass mobilization to reform the sectarian political
   system in Lebanon. We invited a representative sample of 2,496 adults to
   sign a petition calling for an end to sectarian politics, randomly
   assigning respondents to a public condition where they had to provide
   their names or a private condition where they did not. Our results show
   that public signing reduced willingness to participate by 20 percentage
   points despite substantial private support for reform and that this
   reduction was significantly greater for those more afraid of social
   sanctioning. This is strong evidence that social pressure can deter
   individuals from publicly expressing their private political
   preferences.},

Title = {Tradition, politics and dispute for meaning: analyzing the origins of
   Peronism from the position of the press of Santiago del Estero
   (1945-1946)},
Journal = {IZQUIERDAS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {42},
Pages = {159-185},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {The article analyzes the effects that Peronism provoked in actors of
   power of a specific provincial context before and during its arrival
   (1945-1946). Contrary to the view assumed by specialized historiography,
   on how certain elites served the arrival of Peron to the provincial
   stages, we consider that this support was not homogeneous in all cases.
   To develop the argument, we will take the case of the main
   communicational actor, the newspaper El Liberal, in the province of
   Santiago del Estero. This will show how the arrival of Peronism in a
   provincial context meant a break in relative terms, around certain
   preexisting structures and relations of domination. The main hypothesis
   that guides the work is that the threatening of the Labor Party for a
   sector of power like the press was the constitution of a political
   subject that emerged with the arrival of the new movement. The following
   work then proposes to contribute in the political historical study of a
   phenomenon of high intensity and long drag in Argentina but taking into
   account a new political-cultural dimension in its study: the one that
   refers to the construction of another negatively meaning as epicenter of
   a game of senses around which the attractiveness and rejection of
   Peronism was disputed.},

Abstract = {Who are the taxpayers? In political rhetoric, the taxpayer is often the
   hardworking counterpoint to the undeserving welfare recipient, or the
   long-suffering victim of government corruption and ineptitude. And yet,
   despite its potency as a political symbol, we know little about who is
   understood by the public to be among the taxpaying class. New survey
   data reveal that there is a large discrepancy between the population of
   self-described taxpayers and the population of perceived taxpayers;
   about 93\% of US adults describe themselves as taxpayers, but they
   imagine that only about 69\% of their peers pay taxes. In the control
   condition, Republicans had lower estimates of the taxpaying population,
   were more concerned that low-income people do not pay enough in taxes,
   and low-income Republicans were more likely to doubt their own status as
   taxpayers. After receiving information about the substantial total tax
   liability of low-income people, Republicans and Democrats' views of the
   taxpaying population converged. However, in the condition that focused
   on low-income Americans as net beneficiaries of the federal tax system,
   partisans had opposite responses. Low-income Democrats become less
   likely to describe themselves as taxpayers while low-income Republicans
   become more likely to assert their status as taxpayers. The results have
   implications for how and why the parties talk about tax policy, and
   suggest that the identity of ``the taxpayer{''} has both an economic and
   a political resonance worthy of greater scholarly scrutiny.},

Abstract = {This article investigates public and private goods provision in two
   hybrid regimes: Hong Kong and Singapore. We build on the selectorate
   theory, which analyses all regimes in terms of the size of their
   leaders' support coalitions. This research follows a
   differences-in-differences design, with the exogenous political change
   in Hong Kong in 1997 as a treatment and Singapore as a control case.
   This study contributes to the literature in two ways. First, as the aim
   of the selectorate theory is to transcend traditional regime typologies,
   a focus on hybrid regimes provides another test of the theory beyond the
   democratic-authoritarian divide. Second, the distinctive comparative
   set-up allows us to disentangle the effects of the size of the winning
   coalition from those of supporter loyalty. The empirical results
   demonstrate that whilst public goods increase with the winning coalition
   size, private goods provision is not affected unless accompanied by a
   change in supporter loyalty.},

Abstract = {This paper aims to investigate the effect of arbitrators' lack of
   impartiality or independence on the arbitration process in accordance
   with the Model Law. The reasons for choosing the latter is that it is
   the origin for most modern national arbitration laws and any amendments
   to it would likely to be followed by national laws. The research problem
   lies in the fact that the Model Law does not tackle in detail the issue
   of challenging arbitrators for lacking impartiality or independence. A
   challenge application would have an immediate effect on both the
   arbitration proceedings and the task of arbitrators. This study
   concludes that grounds for challenging arbitrators' impartiality or
   independence under the Model Law are broad and general. Hence,
   regulating the scope, grounds and limitations related to the lack of
   impartiality or independence on the part of arbitrators should be
   addressed in depth in the Model Law to safeguard the interests of
   arbitration parties and therefore justice at large.},

Abstract = {This article explores ways in which state crime theory, which is
   predominantly based on contemporary conceptions of human rights, might
   be applied to settler-colonial violence and the forced dispossession of
   the land from Indigenous peoples. The Australian state was established
   through the foundational violence inherent to settler colonialism and
   the processes of primitive accumulation that underpinned it. This
   created the conditions for ongoing structural violence, inflicted
   through a continuum of criminogenic, arguably genocidal state practices
   designed to disrupt - if not eliminate - the social worlds and
   collective identities of Indigenous peoples. These practices have been
   normalized through Australian nationalist ideology and its associated
   narratives of progress, democracy and the rule of law. Theories of state
   crime need to break from these normative narratives to make sense of the
   criminogenic nature of settler colonialism.},

Abstract = {This article investigates the electoral success of the Alternative for
   Germany (AfD) at the general elections in 2017. Drawing on theoretical
   arguments from electoral geography it focuses on a factor that had not
   been explored in existing studies: proximity to the border. Using the
   example of Bavaria, where the AfD scored relatively well compared to
   other West German states, the article tests whether communities which
   are situated closer to the southern and eastern border of Bavaria
   exhibit a higher share of votes for the AfD. For this purpose we
   calculate the distances of all 2,556 communities in Bavaria to the
   border and test this variable in a multi-level-regression additionally
   controlling for established patterns of explanation for the vote of
   right-wing populist parties, such as the theory of modernization losers
   or the contact hypothesis. The results confirm-even if it cannot be
   finally resolved which factors are causal for the electoral success of
   the AfD in eastern Bavaria-that proximity to the border indeed has a
   significant and substantial impact in excess of well-known predictors.
   An additional analysis for all Germany shows furthermore that the AfD is
   stronger in electoral districts at the border to Poland, the Czech
   Republik and Austria. These findings, together with the general insight
   that geographical variation or clustering are factors that are often
   given not enough attention in political science although they have the
   potential to point out so far undetected causal mechanisms, could be
   fruitfully transferred to the analysis of other (right-wing populist)
   election results.},

Abstract = {Taxation is a critical part of state power and has evolved with
   modernization. Although tax systems are expected to converge as
   countries achieve economic development, there are variations in the
   scale and structure of tax revenues. A recurring question is which tax
   dominates state financing in democracies. Some scholars associate mature
   democracies with progressive income taxation, and others find that
   democracies have relied on regressive taxation on consumption. Learning
   from the history of tax development, this paper illuminates that
   countries in different democratic waves followed divergent paths of tax
   development in the process of modernization. The first and second wave
   democratizers established progressive income taxation in the nineteenth
   and early twentieth centuries and continued to rely on it. On the other
   hand, newly democratized countries came to rely heavily on the
   value-added tax, which was innovated in the mid-twentieth century,
   shortly before the beginning of the third wave of democratization. By
   shedding new light on the linkage between the development of modern
   taxation and the waves of democratization, the study demonstrates that
   the trajectory of modernization has shaped different tax system.},

Abstract = {This paper explores how the Ghadar legacy is interpreted by the Punjabi
   literary movement in Punjab, Pakistan. Putting Ghadar poetry into
   conversation with the work of these contemporary activists sheds light
   on unexplored facets of both. It unveils how these writers and thespians
   invoke Ghadar to subvert the narrow discourse of ``Punjabiyat{''} and
   ethno-nationalist identity, and allows us to appreciate the politics of
   language that underpinned Ghadar di Goonj. The intertwining of these
   histories of literary dissent raises key questions for debates around
   radical literature and progressive writing in South Asia, by
   highlighting the role of vernaculars in reading subaltern consciousness
   and native traditions of revolt.},

Title = {Analyzing the political survival prospects of Kim Jong-un's North Korean

Abstract = {The political survival of Kim Jong-un's regime in North Korea has been a
   major international concern since his accession in 2012. While
   international research has endeavored to diagnose the stability of the
   regime based on its limitations and weaknesses due to political,
   economic, and international factors, studies based on baseline
   theoretical models of leadership stability have rarely been undertaken.
   This paper employs selectorate theory to address this issue, by
   identifying the selectorate and winning coalition in North Korea and
   illustrating their relationships with Kim Jong-un's political survival.
   To reexamine the analytical framework and results, this study has
   undertaken in-depth interviews with high-level North Korean defectors
   who have served in key power apparatuses of Kim Jong-il and/or Kim
   Jong-un's regime. It analyzes how frequent co-optation of top aides,
   economic ideologies, and policies are utilized for political survival.
   It further explains the correlation of his political survival with the
   party-dependent bureaucracy, internal reign of terror, development of
   nuclear capacity, and continuous military provocations. However, as the
   regime further intensifies the reign of terror, the possibility of a
   coup d'etat by the selectorate and coalition cannot be completely ruled
   out.},

Abstract = {Since its democratization, South Korea has widened the population
   coverage of various social programs, yet the generosity of most programs
   remains shallow. Existing studies offer state/elite-centered
   explanations for this move toward a weak universalistic welfare state. I
   suggest that the move rather accurately reflects citizen attitudes as
   well: a majority of Koreans across economic classes support welfare
   state expansion, yet a large segment of the self-proclaimed supporters
   are unwilling to pay for the expansion. I argue that underlying such
   mixed attitudes is the perceived unfairness of the tax and transfer
   systems. More specifically, (1) the perception of unfair contribution
   vis-a-vis other taxpayers and (2) the perception of unfair fiscal
   exchange with the government significantly lower one's willingness to
   contribute to the welfare state. My analysis of a nation-wide survey
   lends support to my argument. My findings have important policy
   implications for the emerging economies where, despite a growing citizen
   demand for social protection, the fiscal support base for welfare state
   expansion is frail.},

Abstract = {Do female executives exercise the authority of their office distinctly
   from their male counterparts? Anecdotal evidence suggests women
   legislators are likely to govern in a more consensual manner than men.
   Yet there has been little systematic research extending such claims to
   women in executive office. Using an original data set, we evaluate one
   aspect of policy agenda settingrates of executive decree issuanceamong
   four male-female pairs of Latin American presidents between 2000 and
   2014. Female presidents are generally less prone to rule by decree, but
   this relationship is conditioned by presidential popularity. Female
   executives with high presidential approval ratings are less likely to
   rule via unilateral action than similarly popular male executives, but
   the gendered differences in decree issuance disappear when executives
   possess low approval ratings. Our findings have implications for
   understanding the potential benefits of feminine leadership styles for
   executive-legislative relations and good governance.},

Title = {Analyzing the Fragmented Sri Lankan Muslim Politics in Post-Ashraff Era},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF POLITICS AND LAW},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {11},

Abstract = {The traditional Muslim politics in Sri Lanka transformed with the
   formation of Sri Lanka Muslim Congress (SLMC) and its active communal
   politics under its founder-leader, M.H.M. Ashraff. While representing
   the interests of the Muslim community, particularly those living in the
   north-eastern region, SLMC through its politics of bargaining and
   consensus voiced and advocated for the interests, rights and privileges
   of the Muslim community as well as contributed to their socio-economic
   and cultural upliftment at the crossroad of ethnic conflict and civil
   war. Although SLMC received popular mandate from the Muslim community,
   the party fell into fragmentation with the unexpected demise of its
   founder-leader in 2000, and splits were instigated shortly. This
   fragmentation caused a severe effect in the distinct path of Muslim
   politics in Sri Lanka. This study examines the fragmented nature and the
   trends of Muslim politics, particularly the politics of SLMC in
   post-Ashraff era and their impact. This study reveals that the
   fragmentation within SLMC caused leadership crisis and emergence of many
   Muslim political parties that promoted ugly politics of opportunism.
   This trend ultimately reduced the bargaining strength of Muslim
   politics, negatively influenced representative politics, leading to the
   negligence and marginalisation of Muslims' concerns and grievances in
   national politics. The leadership crisis and regionalism also negatively
   influenced the politics of SLMC and other Muslim parties in post-Ashraff
   era. This study also finds that unifying splinter-groups, reforming
   party structure and procedures, and redefining goals and path of
   achieving them would not only strengthen the politics of SLMC and other
   Muslim political parties but also would give a new brand for Muslim
   minority politics in Sri Lanka.},

   Health-Care System through the Lens of European Experience},
Journal = {POLITICS \& POLICY},
Year = {2018},

Abstract = {Over the recent past, Mexico has been exemplary in having launched
   regulatory reforms in order to modernize its health-care system, with
   major objectives being universal insurance coverage and less
   infrastructural fragmentation. In this article we argue that these
   reforms, widely inspired by the global New Public Management movement
   and its aftermath, take shape in a difficult encounter with both the
   traditional public administration model in Mexico and tensions endemic
   to the aforementioned reform movement as attempts to enhance system
   integration coincide with procedural disorganization. This results in a
   paradoxical internationalization of the Mexican health-care system due
   to which the above objectives may be difficult to achieve. To illustrate
   our argument, we examine the Mexican case through the lens of experience
   two European countries (Germany and Norway) in which reforms have
   affected the health-care system in a similar way.},

Abstract = {After describing a newly assembled dataset consisting of almost 9,000
   local appropriations made by the U.S. Congress between 1789 and 1882, we
   test competing accounts of the politics surrounding them before offering
   a more nuanced, historically contingent view of the emergence of the
   pork barrel. We demonstrate that for most of this historical
   period-despite contemporary accusations of crass electoral motives-the
   pattern of appropriations is largely inconsistent with accounts of
   distributive politics grounded in a logic of legislative
   credit-claiming. Instead, support for appropriations in the House mapped
   cleanly onto the partisan/ideological structure of Congress for most of
   this period, and only in the 1870s produced the universalistic
   coalitions commonly associated with pork-barrel spending. We trace this
   shift to two historical factors: the emergence of a solid Democratic
   South, and growth in the fraction of appropriations funding recurrent
   expenditures on extant projects rather than new starts.},

Journal = {EUROPEAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {10},
Number = {3},
Pages = {417-440},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Inclusiveness is essential to deliberative democracy, but factors
   influencing citizens' willingness to participate in deliberation need to
   be better understood. In the case of deliberative minipublics,
   demographic, and attitudinal attributes demonstrably correlate with
   willingness to participate, and thus arguably affect the inclusiveness
   of deliberative events. Similarly, features of deliberative situations
   also influence participation - whether it will be decisive, for example.
   However, what is lacking is a framework for how individual and
   situational characteristics interact, and the role of background
   political and cultural settings in influencing this dynamic. Advances in
   personality psychology offers a useful framework for addressing this
   lacuna, as well as providing tools for understanding how effective
   participation can be enhanced. In this article, I explore how
   personality interacts with situational features to influence patterns of
   deliberative participation, as well as the motivations that are
   associated. These effects are illustrated by drawing on data from a
   field experiment, involving minipublic deliberation in Sweden on the
   issue of begging by internal EU migrants. The findings support the
   relevance of personality as a predictor of participation in
   deliberation, which interacts with features of deliberative situations
   to induce particular motivations to either participate or refuse.},

Abstract = {Once entirely the province of men, government cabinets in democracies
   have featured greater gender diversity in recent years, with many
   governments featuring women in the most influential posts. This analysis
   examines the effect of gender diversity on one aspect of government
   performance: the duration of governments in parliamentary systems. I
   test the argument that women serving in complex task-oriented groups (in
   this case government cabinets), particularly when they hold influential
   roles, create the potential for parliamentary governments that tend to
   last longer than other governments. Using data drawn from 125 European
   cabinets across 13 countries, I test this argument and a series of
   controls using several hazard models and supplement these with
   simulations of various interesting empirical scenarios. I find nuanced
   support for this argument-greater numbers of women do matter, but only
   when women serve in influential premier ministerial posts.},

Abstract = {In this article, I argue that the national political environment can
   meaningfully affect variation in aggregate demand for partisan media. I
   focus on the relationship between the political context-namely,
   political advantage and disadvantage derived from elections-and media
   demand in the form of partisan newspaper circulations. Using a data set
   that characterizes the partisan slant of local newspapers and their
   circulation levels between 1932 and 2004, I find that when parties are
   electorally advantaged in presidential contests, demand for their
   affiliated newspapers decreases relative to demand for papers affiliated
   with disadvantaged parties. I uncover evidence of similar patterns in a
   case study of Florida newspapers, and I also compare the power of
   presidential versus congressional outcomes in shaping feelings of
   advantage and disadvantage. Taken together, these results provide
   evidence of a negative link between political advantage derived from
   presidential elections and the relative demand for partisan news.},

Abstract = {The objective of the article is to investigate the causal factors that
   affect the non-transfer of the environmental surcharge, on the occasion
   of what happened in the Corporation Ambiental de Sucre in the period
   (20102018). The Political Constitution of Colombia of 1991 contemplates
   the preservation and sustainable conservation of the environment, and to
   fulfill this assignment, Law 099 of December 22, 1993 is created. Which
   in turn in its second article creates the Ministry of the Environment
   and the National Environmental System as a governing body for the
   environment and renewable natural resources. Within this legal
   framework, the Regional Autonomous Corporations were constituted,
   following the environmental guidelines drawn up by the Ministry of the
   Environment; within these are CARSUCRE responsible for the recovery,
   conservation, protection, management, use and utilization of renewable
   natural resources, in order to ensure sustainable development in their
   region. It is concluded that, the administrative and political autonomy
   granted to the CARS in article 150-7 of the Constitution is quite
   deteriorated due to the governmental limitations of the State that
   places the budget, on the one hand, while eroding your tax revenues.},

Abstract = {Gender differences in academic performance and attitudes are widespread
   in male-stereotyped disciplines but rarely are studied in the social
   sciences. To assess the extent that gender influences the behavior of
   undergraduate women in political science, participation was analyzed in
   a large (N = 130) introductory comparative-politics class at the
   University of Bergena large public university in Norway. In the 2016
   fall semester, observers documented classroom behaviors of men and women
   using a protocol that characterizes types of in-class participation.
   Findings showed that women participate less than expected given their
   observed numbers in the classroom. After the semester ended, we provided
   an opportunity for students to describe why they chose to participate
   and whether they felt that barriers existed in the classroom that
   prevented them from expressing their opinions. This article
   characterizes those responses and presents the first study to draw
   conclusions about the gendered educational experience in political
   science by integrating these qualitative and quantitative results.},

Abstract = {We argue that citizens' trust attitudes are inversely related to party
   polarization because polarization tends to encourage political conflict,
   which most people dislike. We further posit that partisans trust
   attitudes are driven by the ideological extremity of the opposing and
   their own parties for similar reasons. Using roll-call-based estimates
   of state legislative party polarization and public opinion data
   collected in 2008, we show strong evidence in favor of our theory:
   higher levels of party polarization within legislative chambers
   depresses citizens' trust in their legislatures. Among partisans, we
   also find that trust attitudes respond to the ideological extremity of
   the opposing party but not to a citizen's own party's extremity. We
   further find that as citizens' interest in politics increases, they
   react more strongly to polarization when forming their trust attitudes.
   Finally, partisans become less responsive to the ideological extremity
   of the opposing party as they become more politically interested.},

Abstract = {Afghanistan has been in conflict for many reasons since 1978. Opium
   production is one of these reasons. Afghanistan has been the world's
   leading illicit opium producer since 1992. Opium is a focal point of
   instability to security and development in Afghanistan.
   The United States has been practicing an unsuccessful eradication policy
   since 2001. After more than fifteen years, Afghanistan needs a different
   strategy in this area. One of the alternatives would be implementing a
   policy of legalization to promote a legal opium poppy cultivation
   market. However, there are some obstacles - political and legal-to
   implement this policy. The restrictive international legal framework and
   the weakness of the Afghan's State prevent the implementation these
   policies.
   We would like to argue the utility level that a policy of legalization
   of opium poppy cultivation could have over security and human
   development improvement in Afghanistan.},

Abstract = {This article analyses the category of citizenship in perspective of the
   construction of political community from the theoretical statement of
   Chantal Mouffe and Ernesto Laclau. In order to do so, this analysis
   studies the socio-political practices performed by an organization of
   ethnic, peasant, and displaced population of Montes de Maria - OPDS.
   Thereby, approaching the experience of the OPDS from the postulates of
   Mouffe and Laclau allows exploring diverse theoretical and practical
   elements that contribute with the radicalization of plural democracy.
   Finally, the method proposed comes from the discursive studies,
   particularly from the documentary analysis because the base of the quest
   is the article Mesa de interlocucion y concertacion campesina de los
   Montes de Maria. Propuesta de desarrollo rural y agrario construida por
   organizaciones campesinas, afrodescendientes, consejos comunitarios,

Abstract = {Previous research shows that the household context is a crucial source
   of influence on turnout. This article sets out a relational theory of
   voting in which turnout is dependent on the existence of relational
   selective consumption benefits. The study provides empirical tests of
   key elements of the proposed model using household survey data from
   Great Britain. First, building on expressive theories of voting, it
   examines the extent to which shared partisan identification enhances
   turnout. Secondly, extending theories of voting as a social norm, it
   tests whether the civic norms of citizens' families or households affect
   turnout over and above the social norms of the individual. In accordance
   with expectations of expressive theories of voting, it finds that having
   a shared party identification with other members of the household
   increases turnout. It also finds that the civic duty of other household
   members is important in explaining turnout, even when allowing for
   respondent's civic duty.},

Abstract = {The economic crisis that erupted in Europe in 2008 has not only caused
   economic grievances, but hurt citizens' trust in their national
   political system. By now, most research attributes this loss in
   political trust to governments' failing economic achievements. This
   article considers if and to what extent the drop in political trust
   amidst The Great Recession also was connected to governments' welfare
   state effort. Combining individual and country-level data in a
   comparative multilevel research design, this paper overall finds that in
   cases of sudden and severe performance setbacks for which accountability
   is hard to assign, trust in democratic institutions may suffer. However,
   political trust seems to be especially susceptible to economic
   performance setbacks in countries with relatively low levels of welfare
   state effort, suggesting that governments might blunt some of the pain
   of an economic crisis by providing generous welfare state services to
   those in need.},

Abstract = {The article examines the process whereby government and business elites
   have driven the expansion of London airports, particularly via the mode
   of the establishment of an independent' commission, the Davies
   Commission (2012-2015). It addresses the strategic framing of airports
   planning, including the role of National Policy Statements, and the
   nature of the consideration of the planning applications for consent to
   develop. Temporal and geographical dimensions are analysed, showing how
   central to the UK state project is the expansion of the southern English
   / Greater London core, with associated infrastructure geographies. It
   concludes that corporate and state power may well achieve the desired
   expansion of airport capacity in the London region, overriding
   environmental and other non-commercial considerations. However, there
   are tensions in the dominant state and business model, given an apparent
   commitment to carbon emissions reduction and other air quality goals, as
   well as to minimising the costs to the public sector which airport
   expansion is likely to generate.},

Abstract = {Disarmament, demobilisation and reintegration (DDR) is a mechanism that
   mitigates the outbreak of violence. It has three components critical for
   peace, reconstruction and stability in every post-conflict society. The
   DDR programme commenced in 2009, when restive youths agitating for
   resource control accepted the amnesty proclaimed by President Umaru
   Yar'Adua. With primary and secondary data, the study investigated the
   perceptions communities have of the DDR for ex-militants, as well as the
   challenges and prospects for peace in the Niger Delta. The study showed
   that most of the respondents established a link between militancy and
   unemployment. The ex-militants were at peace with their various
   communities. The majority (76.5\%) of the respondents believed that such
   ex-militants pose no threat to their communities after their being
   re-integrated. A major hindrance to the DDR is the unwillingness of some
   groups to totally disarm, while excluded groups agitate over exclusion
   in the programme. This contributed to the resurgence of youth violence
   against oil companies and security operatives in the Niger Delta.
   Therefore, preventing the resurgence of youth restiveness demands timely
   management of the conflicts that are motivated by grievances and lack of
   equity in the distribution of resources.},

Abstract = {This article explores popular reactions to Enoch Powell's speech in
   Birmingham on 20 April 1968. It describes the protests by sympathetic
   workers, such as the Smithfield meat porters, and the responses of the
   press, both nationally and in the West Midlands. It considers the
   speech's impact on immigrants themselves and it makes the case that
   Powell's real significance was as an early champion of a particular kind
   of anti-Establishment populism, which has now become a very familiar
   feature of our political landscape.},

Abstract = {The present article exposes a perspective of the territorial reality of
   the Commune 8 of Medellin making use of Raffestin to refer to the
   territory, of Deleuze and Guattari to refer to the territorialization,
   the deterritorialization and the reterritorialization, and of the
   theoretical contributions of Rogerio Haesbaert corresponding to the
   multiterritorialization. Based on these concepts, a reflection is made
   about the processes that take place in the territory, based on the
   relationship between the community, the National Police and organized
   crime. It was established that the territorial dynamics of the Commune 8
   constitutes an ecosystem of relationships in which State, social and
   even criminal actors struggle to take control of the political,
   economic, social and cultural territory.},

Abstract = {After decades of large-scale rural-to-urban migration, a massive wave of
   return migration has emerged in China, signalling China's entry to a new
   stage of economic and social development. Behind the new trend are the
   economic take-off of China's hinterland and the ageing of the
   first-generation migrant workers. While potentially a benign
   transformative force for rural China, return migration also risks
   becoming a way to ``dump{''} ageing, unproductive or laid-off migrant
   workers in the vast countryside.},

Abstract = {We examine how descriptive representation, formal representation, and
   responsiveness affect the legitimacy of political decisions: Who are the
   representatives, how are they selected, what is the outcome of the
   decision-making process, and to what extent do these three aspects
   matter for decision acceptance among the citizens? We examine this from
   the citizens' perspective, and ask whether decisions are perceived as
   more legitimate when they are made by groups that reflect society in
   certain characteristics and chosen according to certain selection
   procedures. In a Norwegian survey experiment, we find that people are
   more willing to accept a decision when it is made by a group of people
   like them, and who are assigned as decision makers based on their
   expertise. Descriptive representation also serves as a cushion for
   unfavorable decisions. Moreover, when asked, the traditionally less
   advantaged groups tend to value descriptive representation more than
   other citizens.},

Abstract = {Turkey's role as a gas corridor to the EU is developing rapidly but the
   impact on wider relations between the country and the bloc appears
   muted. While long-term gas pipeline projects may be overshadowed by the
   current tensions regarding gas exploration and exploitation in disputed
   areas offshore Cyprus, other energy projects could bridge the gap. On
   the other hand, Turkey as a hydrocarbons-poor country, is pushing to
   develop green energies. This opens up another area for cooperation with
   the bloc, which also has ambitious targets for renewables as well as an
   interest in less coal use by Turkey If both parties can cooperate
   positively in technical areas, there is a chance that the strained
   relationship can be improved.},

Volume = {9},

Abstract = {Of all the countries in Latin America, Mexico has the strongest economic
   ties to the United States, formalized by the creation of the North
   American Free Trade Agreement in 1994, but this Agreement does not
   preclude Mexico from targeting the United States in the World Trade
   Organization's Dispute Settlement Mechanism. In fact, the Agreement's
   dispute-settlement system encourages it to do so if the complaint at
   hand is to have a fair consideration. The North American Free Trade
   Agreement's dispute-resolution system goes to a board containing
   representatives from the three-member countries, which includes by
   default the complainant state and the defendant state. Therefore, even
   though Mexico has the closest economic relationship with the United
   States of the Latin American states considered in this project, it is
   also the most likely to target the United States in the World Trade
   Organization. This article focuses on how trade ties constrain Mexico's
   use of the Dispute Settlement Mechanism against its largest trade
   partner.},

Abstract = {Political scientists often characterize state and local governments as
   marginal and highly constrained in policymaking. However, I suggest that
   in recent decades state governments have moved from the margins to the
   center of partisan battles over the direction of U.S. public policy.
   Across 16 issue areas, I investigate interstate policy variation, policy
   differences across states, and policy polarization, the changing
   relationship between party control of state government and policy
   outcomes. Since the 1970s, interstate variation has increased such that
   an individual's tax burden, right to obtain an abortion, and other
   relationships to government are increasingly determined by her state of
   residence. Policy polarization increases dramatically after 2000 in 14
   of the 16 areas. I show that party control increasingly predicts
   socioeconomic outcomes in the polarized area of health care, but not in
   the nonpolarized area of criminal justice.},

Abstract = {This article explores in greater detail the nexus between party system
   change and democratic qualities. In doing so, we do not simply assess
   whether, how, and to what extent qualities of democracy in East Africa
   are affected by the instability of the patterns of interparty
   competition (fluidity of the party system); we also plan to show how the
   subcomponents of party system fluidity (frequency of change, scope of
   change, variety of change) influence the democratic qualities. By
   disaggregating fluidity in its constitutive elements and by testing how
   each of them affects the qualities of democracy, we find that while the
   frequency of change has a beneficial impact on the qualities of
   democracy, the other subcomponents of fluiditynamely, the ``scope{''}
   and ``variety{''} of system changehave a consistently negative effect on
   democratic quality.},

Abstract = {In the last presidential election of the United States (2016), the
   interaction between the Donald Trump and the American media was
   remarkable and unprecedented from both political and communication
   perspectives. The present paper is interested in observing the
   interactions between then the Republican Party candidate, Donald Trump,
   and the media of the United States. As there were major verbal
   confrontations between Trump, and some media, specifically CNN, this
   paper observes how Trump campaign reacted to CNN that turned out to be
   one of his biggest opponents. The relations and reactions are explained
   using ``agenda setting{''} and ``selective exposure{''} as theories and
   ``thematic analysis{''} as the research methodology. The paper analyzes
   CNN videos from October 7 to October 31, and Trump's tweets during the
   same period. The reason for conducting the research during October is
   that this month is regarded as one of the most critical periods in US
   presidential election, known as ``October surprise{''}. Then a thematic
   analysis of the data is conducted to extract all accusations and
   allegations against Trump. Research results show that President Trump
   did not react to most of the accusations and attacks raised by CNN.
   Apparently Trump had decided that ignoring and not responding is a
   better strategy. There was an exception to this rule: Trump's treatment
   toward women. He did address that issue frequently and tried to justify
   himself and apologize. Accordingly, Trump's presidential campaign aim
   was to ignore accusations, keep attacking, and answering accusations
   only if they are already known to too many people.},

Abstract = {We reflect on the youth activist trajectories in 15M and the
   biographical impacts of this activism based on the results of
   qualitative research carried out between 2012 and 2015. We use a
   qualitative methodology based on the technique of semi-directed
   interviews and an extensive documentary analysis. And we focus on
   processes of activation, reactivation and political deactivation of
   young activists in the cities of Madrid, Salamanca and Santander in the
   period 2012-2015.
   We start from a typology of participants based on two axes (previous
   political trajectory and permanence in 15M), the experiences,
   motivations, concrete implications and consequences of biographies
   derived from their relationship with 15M are presented. The conclusions
   are directed towards the 15M as a new space and climate of rupture of
   youth activism. We hypothesize it as a new historical-generational space
   that generates lasting biographical effects over time, mainly to
   activists who remain in spaces of activism (at the time of research). We
   also perceive other effects such as a change in worldview and
   acquisition or reinforcement of a militant capital in these cases.},

Abstract = {By drawing from Rita Felski's innovative theoretical framework, one that
   seeks to exit the paradigms of ``againstness{''} (Felski 2015, 17),
   hegemonic in critical theories of the humanities, this essay proposes a
   genealogy of postcritique that seeks to rethink power. By deliberately
   assembling different theoretical traditions, the essay aims at
   establishing a genealogical nexus between the feminist tradition of the
   thought of sexual difference and Hannah Arendt, as possible creative
   sources for thinking of power in a generative way, outside the frames of
   both domination and subjection. This task is one with the need of an
   ``affective realignment{''}, perceived as theoretically and politically
   necessary in order to discard the negativist attitude of most critical
   theory, which, in the end, seems to confirm and contribute to the
   maintenance of the ``status quo{''}.},

Abstract = {This article analyzes how individual-level assessments of the quality
   and functioning of the representative channel affect citizens'
   likelihood to turn out to vote and to engage in alternative forms of
   non-institutionalized participation, and whether these relationships are
   moderated by individual resources as measured by education. Relying on
   novel data from the sixth round of the European Social Survey on how
   European citizens evaluate different aspects of democracy we show that
   negative evaluations of the quality of the representative channel
   discourage voting, but only promote participation in demonstrations
   among the highly educated. These findings highlight potential
   inequalities in citizens' ability to voice their political demands:
   while highly educated individuals are likely to translate their negative
   evaluations of the institutional channel of representation into
   non-institutionalized forms of participation, in the presence of
   negative evaluations low educated individuals are simply more likely to
   withdraw from politics.},

Title = {LARGER THAN LIFE? DECOLONISING HUMAN SECURITY STUDIES THROUGH FEMINIST
   POSTHUMANISM},
Journal = {STRATEGIC REVIEW FOR SOUTHERN AFRICA},
Year = {2018},

Number = {1},

Abstract = {Binary thinking is one of the features of coloniality, manifesting in a
   zero-sum game between `our' and `their' security. The development of
   human security as an antidote has, however, been marked by a
   continuation of such divisions in a much subtler way. This state of
   affairs is exacerbated by the fact that concepts held up as possible
   solutions, such as the gendering of human security or the broader tool
   of decolonisation, are often also trapped in unimaginative oppositional
   thinking which runs the risk of recolonising knowledge and harming those
   who are supposed to be secured. The focus in this article is therefore
   on the coloniality of human security scholarship and practices and how
   this concept can be reinvigorated through a feminist `pose-humanist
   lens. I argue that a feminist posthuman security approach that decentres
   the human (by going beyond asking for the inclusion of women only) and
   underscores agentic relations between (all) humans, the natural
   environment, technology and objects more adequately captures the
   entangled nature of human security practices, especially in the
   postcolony. The approach draws on a blend of six conceptual pillars,
   namely a poststructuralist understanding of agency as the product of
   intra-action rather than interaction; feminist critiques of equating
   what is male and what is human; the emphasis on intersections between
   race and gender in feminist postcolonial theory; the importance of
   situated knowledge; the agency of matter and objects in the construction
   of security and/or insecurity; and an acknowledgement of indigenous
   Africacentred knowledge forms. I conclude that this kind of posthuman
   security frame, which merges feminist posthumanism and new materialist
   posthumanism, not only allows a more nuanced and inclusive understanding
   of the human condition but also offers a foundation for developing a
   decolonised human security research agenda.},

Abstract = {The 2008 global economic crisis has had profound social and economic
   consequences across states. In addition to cross-national social and
   economic disparities, the crisis generated increased domestic divisions
   between labor market insider and outsider groups. This article analyzes
   the impact of the global economic crisis on female workers across
   advanced welfare states. While considerable attention has been given to
   the impact of the Great Recession on financial markets and employment
   sectors, we argue that the crisis had an important gendered effect
   across advanced capitalist states that remains significantly
   underexplored. In particular, we examine the divergent ways in which
   distinct welfare systems and their cultural underpinnings shape labor
   market access and levels of social protection for women. In this
   endeavor, we integrate literature on welfare systems, feminist political
   economy and financial crisis to examine the relationship between social
   protection structures, cultural legacies and gender inequalities - which
   manifests most strongly during times of economic crisis. Our
   hierarchical panel model of 28 countries across 7 years is supplemented
   by cultural and survey data. Our findings not only give an important
   analysis of an understudied aspect of the global economic crisis, but
   also provide policy implications for more gender-conscious crisis
   management responses going forward.},

Abstract = {Nowadays it could look paradoxical to consider that some alternative
   systems to the neoliberalism has succeeded. However, David Graeber
   (anarchist theorist and activist himself), defends the success of some
   of the anarchist like protest movements in the last two decades. The
   present essay deals with the meaning Graeber gives to ``success{''}, and
   the concepts it is based on: society, human being, and at the very last,
   revolution. The radical democracy and the direct action are the starting
   points of Graeber's praxis and reflection, from where he tries to
   redefine the frontiers of a new society of free, autonomous and mutually
   supporting individuals.},

Abstract = {Many studies have found that countries with union-administered
   unemployment insurance have higher rates of unionization than countries
   with state-administered unemployment insurance. With data going further
   back in history, this article demonstrates that the introduction of
   so-called Ghent systems had no effect on unionization rates. We argue
   that the Ghent effect identified by the existing literature came about
   as a result of increasing state subsidization and benefit generosity in
   the 1950s and 1960s. Exploring the partisan politics of unemployment
   insurance, we show that progressive Liberals (Social Liberals) favored
   Ghent designs while Social Democrats favored state-administered
   unemployment insurance before the Second World War. We also present some
   evidence suggesting that Left governments, inheriting Ghent systems that
   were not of their choosing, promoted state subsidization in the postwar
   era and thus helped generate the Ghent effect identified by the existing
   literature.},

Abstract = {Social Movements emerged since 2011 in the so-called Spring of the
   Movements are symptoms of citizen's disaffection to prevailing political
   systems. These movements, named here as Recent Global Social Movements,
   represent a new radical analytical category to mainstream theory on
   Social Movements of the last decades. Their appropriation of Internet
   Social Media with a political purpose, not only communicative but
   strategic, which involves their own identity, defined here as
   Technopolitics, actualize and re-define the previous social theory,
   pointing out the need for a new theoretical framework. In this task, the
   Epistemologies of the South allow us to interpret the praxis of these
   movements as a situated knowledge in both sociologies of the absences
   and the emergences.},

Abstract = {Do businesspeople who win elected office use their positions to help
   their firms? Business leaders become politicians around the world, yet
   we know little about whether their commitment to public service trumps
   their own private interests. Using an original dataset of 2,703 firms in
   Russia, I employ a regression discontinuity design to identify the
   causal effect of firm directors winning seats in subnational
   legislatures from 2004 to 2013. First, having a connection to a winning
   politician increases a firm's revenue by 60\% and profitability by 15\%
   over a term in office. I then test between different mechanisms, finding
   that connected firms improve their performance by gaining access to
   bureaucrats and not by signaling legitimacy to financiers. The value of
   winning a seat increases in more politically competitive regions but
   falls markedly when more businesspeople win office in a convocation.
   Politically connected firms extract fewer benefits when faced with
   greater competition from other rent-seekers.},

Volume = {50},

Abstract = {This article offers a critique of the conception of the good intimate
   life in Justice Kennedy's majority opinion in Obergefell v. Hodges
   (2015). In so doing, it draws upon insights from both queer theory and
   liberal theory, each of which repudiates the endorsement of any
   particular conception of the good life. Queer theorists point out the
   dangers of normifying any particular way of life because it demeans and
   marginalizes those who will not, or cannot, assimilate into the dominant
   culture, while liberal theorists point out that neutrality with regard
   to competing conceptions of the good life can lead to stability and the
   mitigation of strife, while expanding the range of human freedoms. The
   Court's opinion in Obergefell, however, is deeply ensconced in a
   specific conception of the good intimate life-one that positions
   marriage, romantic love, monogamy, parenting, and the nuclear family as
   a standard to which all Americans ought to aspire. Consequently, it
   demeans queer-identified and other non-assimilationist lesbian, gay,
   bisexual, and straight individuals, and it potentially exacerbates,
   rather than tempers or resolves, the conflict surrounding LGBT + rights
   in the United States.},

Abstract = {It is often said that the claims of man and citizen are irreconcilable
   in the philosophy of Jean-Jacques Rousseau. This view, most famously
   articulated by Judith Shklar, holds that the making of a man and the
   making of a citizen are to be understood as rival enterprises or
   competing alternatives. This reading has recently been challenged by
   Frederick Neuhouser. He argues that one can make a man and a citizen,
   but only if the education of each is performed in the absence of the
   other. In his view, Emile is raised to be a man first (Books I-IV)
   before his subsequent instruction in citizenship (Book V). This paper
   challenges both views. I argue that the making of man and citizen are,
   in principle, neither rival enterprises nor competing alternatives, and
   that although Neuhouser is indeed correct to argue for a successive
   system of education, the making of a citizen is not completed in Emile,
   but extends into the Social Contract. His account diminishes the crucial
   role the Lawgiver plays in the fashioning of citizens capable of
   discerning the general will. I show that although raising individuals
   under a system of private instruction does not preclude their
   transformation into citizens but makes such a transformation possible,
   it is on its own incapable of making citizens.},

Abstract = {The Affordable Care Act (ACA) has been the subject of one of the most
   contentious policy issues in recent memory. Previous research has
   tracked the volatility of state decisions over a three-year period,
   2012, 2013, and 2014, using an index ranking states by their policy
   decisions regarding whether they were in support or opposition to the
   ACA. The present study suggests state legislatures may increasingly be
   making health-care choices based on the needs of the citizens in the
   state and less on partisanship. This article employs a case study
   methodology to examine the health-care policy decisions made in four
   states: Alabama, which ranked as one of the staunchest opponents;
   Michigan, which scored as neutral; California, which scored as highly
   supportive; and New Hampshire, which moved from opposition to support
   during the reviewed three-year time frame. This research examines
   influences driving these decisions at the state level.},

   article will employ a political science approach to explore how
   ideology, institutions and interests within the trade and investment
   policy space may constrain policy recommendations made in the World
   Health Organization's Global Action Plan (GAP) on NCDs. Specifically, it
   details how neoliberal ideology may constrain public health values, how
   the new constitutionalism may constrain public health legitimacy and how
   disparities in money, power and resources between elite economic actors
   and public policy actors may constrain the capacity of public health to
   influence trade and investment agreement negotiations. The implications
   of these constraints on the implementation of the GAP-NCDs are
   discussed.},

Title = {To Lag or Not to Lag?: Re-Evaluating the Use of Lagged Dependent
   Variables in Regression Analysis},

Abstract = {Lagged dependent variables (LDVs) have been used in regression analysis
   to provide robust estimates of the effects of independent variables, but
   some research argues that using LDVs in regressions produces negatively
   biased coefficient estimates, even if the LDV is part of the
   data-generating process. I demonstrate that these concerns are easily
   resolved by specifying a regression model that accounts for
   autocorrelation in the error term. This actually implies that more LDV
   and lagged independent variables should be included in the
   specification, not fewer. Including the additional lags yields more
   accurate parameter estimates, which I demonstrate using the same
   data-generating process scholars had previously used to argue against
   including LDVs. I use Monte Carlo simulations to show that this
   specification returns much more accurate coefficient estimates for
   independent variables (across a wide range of parameter values) than
   alternatives considered in earlier research. The simulation results also
   indicate that improper exclusion of LDVs can lead to severe bias in
   coefficient estimates. While no panacea, scholars should continue to
   confidently include LDVs as part of a robust estimation strategy.},

Abstract = {In this paper, it will be highlighted, that Samuel Huntington's notions
   of demarcated, ``conflicting{''} cultures in the 1990s have become
   unquestioned paradigms of scientific and political debate in Germany as
   well, as the debate around Thilo Sarrazin have shown. Rather based on
   power-strategic motives, in both notions in the USA and Germany,
   consciously or less consciously, dynamic and contradictory realities are
   captured with process-reduced and essentialist concepts. This has led to
   the establishment of fixed boundaries between different groups of people
   as established and outsiders. Any potential for development and change
   among the members of the outsider group is denied by the introduction of
   such static and rigid categories. Thus, the term ``culture{''} as a
   means of distinction has received in both notions the same essential
   characteristics of the term ``race{''}, which, as it will be shown, has
   resulted in a kind of ``cultural racism{''}.},

Abstract = {Through a case study of Barack Obama, this article evaluates the
   inclusive form of public reason that John Rawls developed in his later
   writings to accommodate religion. Rawls anticipated recent attempts in
   liberal theory and practice to reopen liberalism to religion, and Obama
   contributes to this effort through his engagement with the civic role of
   Christianity in America's reform movements. Opening liberalism to
   religion may lead us to three conclusions that challenge even this more
   inclusive form of public reason: (i) translation from religious to
   secular reasons may not be the most productive way to accommodate
   religion in democracy, (ii) it may be difficult to distinguish between
   acceptable and unacceptable religious contributions without recourse to
   their underlying theological perspectives, and (iii) a more modest
   constitutional consensus may do a more effective job of accommodating
   religion in democracy than the overlapping consensus that Rawls and
   Obama recommend.},

Abstract = {This article examines how political scientists in West Germany
   (1949-1989) dealt with public finance issues. Facing the enormous
   challenges of establishing a democracy and coming to terms with the
   legacy of National Socialism, it shows that neither tax nor budget
   policy played much of a role in this fledgling discipline during the
   first two decades of this country's history. This was changing during
   the 1970s with the emergence of the largely neo-Marxist influenced
   debates about the nature of the state, when attention turned toward its
   finances. The resulting scholarly works argued primarily at the
   meta-level, however. It was not until the 1980s that researchers
   produced their first empirically sound, international comparative
   studies, focusing above all on budget policy.},

Abstract = {Which religious rights can be granted to Muslim migrants? This question
   has been at the center of the public debate in many countries including
   Germany. The most contested issues in Western Europe are headscarves
   (for teachers) and minarets. German federal states differed in their
   positions towards religious symbols in public institutions. Yet, little
   is known about the extent to which these policies are reflected in
   attitudes. Using the original EURISLAM dataset, this study fills this
   gap. Tentative evidence is shown for attitudes of natives towards
   Christian religious symbols, which vary across federal states. With
   regard to the headscarf for teachers, however, attitudes of natives and
   migrants do not correspond to the actual policies. For natives,
   institutional effects emanate from local mosques under control of other
   factors. The closer natives live to mosques, the more positive their
   attitudes towards minarets. Moreover, religiosity is linked to more
   liberal attitudes towards religious rights for out-groups.},

Abstract = {The Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB), one of the largest
   investment institutions in the world, was established in 2015. The
   launch of the China-initiated AIIB generated intense debate among
   scholars and politicians over the functions and potential economic and
   political implications of the institution. This paper aims to examine
   the AIIB from a normative perspective, investigating its role as a
   cursor for structural changes in China's foreign policy
   conceptualization. It goes on to hypothesize that, over the past few
   years, there has been a gradual transformation in China's relations with
   Southeast Asian countries, which indicates a shift from a traditional
   ``South-South{''} model to a ``North-South{''} model. It observes that
   as Beijing continues to promote its own brand of frameworks and
   institutions, the emerging North-South paradigm will likely be further
   emphasized, transforming China's position vis-a-vis other nations and
   groupings. Nevertheless, China as an emerging Northern country will
   continue to experiment on and develop this new North-South interaction
   in a way that is distinct from the orthodox North-South dyadic
   relationship.},

Abstract = {Pluralism has become a buzzword in International Relations. It has
   emerged in a number of linked literatures and has drawn the support of
   an unusual coalition of scholars: advocates of greater methodological
   diversity; those who feel that IR has degenerated into a clash of
   paradigmatic ``-isms{''}; those who favor a closer relationship between
   academics and policy-makers; and those who wish to see greater
   reflexivity within the field. Perhaps unsurprisingly, no single vision
   of pluralism unites these scholars; they appear to be using the term in
   divergent ways. Accordingly, our aim is threefold. First, we wish to
   highlight this odd state of affairs, by placing it in disciplinary and
   intellectual context. Second, we distinguish between plurality-the de
   facto recognition that IR has become a more diverse field-and
   pluralism-a normative position which values that diversity, given the
   public vocation of social science. Finally, we lay out a more consistent
   understanding and defense of pluralism in those latter terms. We argue
   that, properly understood, pluralism entails a position of
   epistemological skepticism: the straightforward claim that no single
   knowledge system, discipline, theory, or method can claim singular
   access to truth.},

Abstract = {Although state transformation after the 1980s has been a major topic of
   debate in political science, the transformation of the Japanese state
   has not been fully explored, with the pluralist and rational choice
   approaches dominating within the Japanese politics literature. This
   article addresses the lacuna by exploring state transformation in
   Japan's antimonopoly regulation after the 1980s, focusing on the state
   at the macro level through analysing evolving power relations within the
   core executive in response to the challenges of governance. The case
   study reveals the flexible change of power relations within the core
   executive; the core executive retained its dominance within
   policy-making arenas through this adaptation, which is regarded as the
   reconstitution of the state. Drawing on that, the article argues that
   the nature of state transformation in Japan is the sustained dominance
   of the core executive as a collective group over the sector through
   reconstituting the state.},

Abstract = {While a sense of civic duty has long been perceived as important for
   political participation, little is known about its implications for
   political preference formation. I argue that civic duty has salubrious
   effects for opinion formation by dampening partisan distortions in
   decision making. I theorize that a heightened sense of civic duty
   stimulates a motivation to form accurate opinions and, in doing so,
   diminishes the effects of partisan motivated reasoning. Using survey
   experiments focused on tax and education policies, I provide evidence
   that when civic norms are accentuated, at times, people shirk party
   endorsements and incorporate substantive policy information in
   preference formation. The implications for citizen competence and public
   opinion in democratic politics are discussed.},

Abstract = {Commitment to the European Union's gay rights standards remains weak in
   new EU members and countries applying for EU membership. If the EU's
   standards have minimal consequences, then when do voters support the
   EU's involvement in gay rights? The existing research misses a
   comparison of opinions between those who identify with gay people, and
   those who do not. Sexuality-based marginalization carried out by state
   institutions (political homophobia) motivates those who identify with
   gay people to support alternatives to their state's authority. Using an
   original survey of Bosnia and Herzegovina, I find that those who
   identify more closely with gay people are more likely to support
   transferring control of gay rights to the EU. Using twenty-one surveys
   of EU member states, I find that in countries with high levels of
   political homophobia, those who report discrimination on the basis of
   sexuality exhibit higher levels of support for the EU.},

Abstract = {Previous scholarship describes an inconsistent role for democratic
   institutions in driving political participation. Some research has
   detected signs of attachment leading to greater engagement while others
   observe a negative, statistical relationship (Levi and Stoker, 2000). In
   the liberal and electoral democracies of Asia, where support for
   democratic values appears to be growing (Chu and Huang, 2010; Sanborn,
   2015), institutions have taken an outsized role in an individual's
   decision to participate. This may be reflective of a `broken back' form
   of democratization, where an engaged citizenry is continually frustrated
   by poor performing government actors (Rose and Shin, 2001). In this
   article, I evaluate the role of efficacy, internal and external, on the
   decision to attend rallies, participate in campaigns, and contact
   officials. I find that citizens engage in these actions when they are
   internally engaged in politics and frustrated with government
   performance. While this finding offers a simple explanation for the
   decision to participate, it also signifies the obstacles to democratic

Abstract = {Two accounts of change dominate with new institutional literature. The
   first emphasises punctuated equilibria' in which change is shock-driven,
   sudden and radical enough to loosen path dependencies. The second
   emphasises a more gradual-incrementalism and a view of change that is
   more or less constant. This article argues that neither account is
   suitable for the policy scholar interested in understanding the
   complexity of a post-crisis reform period and that a synthesis between
   these two views would better serve those interested in the nuance of
   post-crisis change. The article provides this synthesis in the form of a
   reconceptualization of the critical juncture. This reconceptualization
   merges the punctuated equilibrium and the gradual-incremental views and,
   in doing so, presents a much more realistic institutional account of the
   fine print of policy change post-crisis. The reconceptualization is
   subsequently justified empirically through the analysis of a specific
   post-crisis reform period (the Queensland floods of 2010-11).},

Abstract = {There have been many retrospective analyses written about the
   marriage-equality movement since the Supreme Court's 2015 ruling that
   made marriages between people of the same sex legal in all 50 states.
   Most attribute that triumph to a stunningly swift turnaround in public
   comfort with and approval of same-sex relationships. However, public
   opinion data indicates that this narrative is inaccurate. In 2015, 51\%
   of General Social Survey respondents declared that they found sexual
   relationships between people of the same sex to be ``wrong{''} at least
   ``some of the time.{''} Nevertheless, at the same time, 56\% of
   respondents affirmed that people of the same sex ought to have the legal
   right to marry. This dissonance suggests that the most common narrative
   about the success of the movement misses something crucial about how
   political persuasion happened in this case, as well as the way that
   political persuasion happens in general. In this article, I show that
   the massive shift in support for same-sex marriage was likely not the
   result of large majorities changing their underlying attitudes regarding
   gay sexual relationships, but was instead the result of activists
   inserting new criteria for evaluating same-sex marriage into popular
   political discourse by consistently using resonant arguments. These
   arguments reframed the political stakes, changed the public meaning of
   the marriage debate, and altered the decisional context in which people
   determine their policy preferences.},

Abstract = {The article reconstructs the dispute over Chile's position in the
   Non-Aligned Movement, between Augusto Pinochet's military government and
   a group of exiles known as Chilean Resistance. The article aims to show,
   first, that the exiles -conceived as an international non-state
   actor-contributed, with the support of Cuba, to keep the military
   government excluded from the Movement. Second, the article argues that
   the dictatorship made its foreign policy more flexible in its vain
   attempt to be readmitted into the Movement.},

Abstract = {We propose a multilevel account of legislative Court curbing in order to
   assess existing explanations as to why such proposals come about. We
   argue that although Court curbing is commonly seen as the result of
   institutional conflict between Congress and the Supreme Court, it is
   best understood as a product of three interrelated factors: the
   individual motivations on the part of lawmakers, the partisan context in
   which they operate, and institutional disagreements between Court and
   legislature. We find evidence that micro-level factors offer an
   important insight into Court curbing that institution-focused
   explanations alone cannot.},

Title = {Just sick of it? Health and political trust in Western Europe},
Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL RESEARCH},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {57},
Number = {1},
Pages = {116-134},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {This article explores two theoretical possibilities for why personal
   health may affect political trust: the psychological-democratic contract
   theory, and the role of personal experience in opinion formation. It
   argues that citizens with health impairments are more likely to
   experience the direct effects of political decisions as they are more
   dependent on public health services. Negative subjective evaluations of
   public services can lower trust levels, especially if people's
   expectations are high. Using European Social Survey data, the
   association between health and trust in 19 Western European states is
   analysed. The results indicate that people in poor health exhibit lower
   levels of trust towards the political system than people in good health.
   The differences in trust between those in good and poor health are
   accentuated among citizens with left-leaning ideological values. The
   results suggest that welfare issues may constitute a rare context in
   which personal, rather than collective, experiences affect opinion
   formation.},

Abstract = {In this article it is proposed as general objective the realization of a
   historical-political analysis to the legitimating principles that
   justified the coup d'etat and the subsequent military civil dictatorship
   that was established in Chile in 1973. It is proposed as a research
   hypothesis that the project of the Escuela Nacional Unificada of the
   Unidad Popular government, which sought from the school system the
   construction of a ``new man{''} - without God - was the main
   legitimating antecedent that finally incited civilians and right-wing
   military to disrupt the constitutionality of the State. Subsequent to
   this event, the coup authorities were concerned to sacralize from the
   cultural sphere their own matrix of legitimating principles, which
   politically should be studied as ideology and theologically as religious
   doctrinaire. The above statement is relevant as an object of study,
   since it undoubtedly has significant implications in the current
   political, social and economic development of Chile.},

Abstract = {Between raw and assimilationist territorialism on the one hand, and
   unfinished and evasive personalism on the other, the handling of
   personal status in private international law should pursue a third way
   combining tolerance, liberalism and clarity. Drawing from these main
   theoretical foundations, Muslim law has always striven to maintain a
   sincere multiculturalism. Family affairs being one of the most conducive
   areas to the implementation of such an endeavor, an infinitely
   personalist, lenient and liberal approach, fully recognizing the
   cultural specificities of minorities and rejecting the recourse to
   techniques of exclusion and negation of the other, was born since the
   very beginnings of this law. Since then, an ultraliberal welcoming of
   foreign family institutions has been an extension of a sustained
   millennial tradition that have withstood over centuries the
   territorialist temptations of an international law which has never
   ceased to develop an extreme egocentrism. Its legal foundations are
   strikingly clear, precise, and simple that it would be impossible to
   override them without violating the very spirit of the central legal
   dogma supporting such a tradition.},

Abstract = {Within the growing research on the influence of economic ideas and
   economic sciences in economic policies it is proposed to analyze the
   system of debate of economic policies. It is assumed that economic
   policy in democracy needs to integrate politico-democratic rationality
   with technical rationality. This article analyses three relevant
   dimensions that constitute the debate system of economic policymaking:
   economic science, government and dominant discourses. Based on empirical
   literature, secondary data and interviews, Denmark and Spain's systems
   are compared, and illustrated with the case of the latest labour
   policies. First, the main features and differences of Denmark and
   Spain's economic sciences are identified, especially their policy
   orientation. Second, government's role in economic policy is compared,
   specifically the way it incorporates the technical rationality into the
   political policy decision-making. Third, the working of dominant
   discourses is contrasted, through the role of policy organizations like
   specialized think tanks. As conclusion, the debate system of economic
   policies in Denmark displays a rather institutionalized nature that
   combines and integrates the political and the technical rationality,
   while in Spain is shaped by a political rationality that dominates over
   the technical rationality.},

Title = {Gendered Strategies between Democratization and Democratic Reversal: The
   Curious Case of Turkey},
Journal = {POLITICS AND GOVERNANCE},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {6},
Number = {3},
Pages = {101-111},
Abstract = {The processes of democratization or democratic reversal have serious
   implications for gender equality regimes. Although the gender and
   transition literature has extensively examined the relation between
   democratization and gender, it only recently began to question how the
   changing dynamics of democratic reversal influence gender politics and
   policies. While women's participation and representation in the formal
   arena of politics has been the primary object of theoretical
   discussions, the research rediscovers the power of the informal arena.
   To find tentative answers to the newly developing research agenda, this
   article employs the case of Turkey. To this end, the article examines
   the gendered strategies of four groups of organized women (feminist,
   Kurdish, Islamist, and Kemalist women's organizations) engaged in
   strengthening women's rights and gender equality. It first questions
   how, and to what extent, organized women engendered democratization
   process and then sheds lights on the shift in their strategies to
   respond to the increasingly authoritarian and conservative Islamist
   political agenda of the ruling Justice and Development Party. Drawing on
   empirical findings, the article aims to inform the theoretical debates
   on the analytical relation between democratic reversals and gender
   rights regimes.},

Abstract = {In this contribution, I offer the reader two things: in the first place,
   a Spanish translation of the article, ``Sabato's `El tunel': More Freud
   than Sartre{''} - published by Fred Petersen in the journal ``Hispania'
   (May, 1967), the prestigious publication of The American Association of
   Teachers of Spanish and Portuguese. The aforementioned Association,
   which generously granted the journal RIPS the right to publish my
   translation, is naturally in no way responsible for any errors that I
   might have committed while carrying out that translation. In the second
   place, and on my own account, I offer the reader a very brief
   sociological commentary which makes use of Sabato's novel and Petersen's
   article to call attention to a possible epistemological reorientation
   for use in research on intimate partner violence against women. That was
   the true motive behind my decision to translate it.},

Abstract = {Over the last year and a half, a number of scholars, pundits, and
   journalists have criticized college campuses for coddling students by
   constructing environments that protect them from offensive opinions and
   evidence that disconfirms their prior attitudes. In this article, I
   suggest two pedagogical techniques that can help students encounter and
   digest evidence that may go against their preconceived worldviews and
   opinions: teaching rational versus irrational thought and quantitative
   research design and critique. Guiding undergraduates through empirical
   studies on sensitive topics and encouraging them to critique their
   findings in a rational, academic manner can help ease them into more
   reasoned and less reactionary discourse about race, gender, religion,
   politics, and any other controversial topic in today's contentious
   climate. I use my own experience teaching students research design in
   the months following a race-related murder to illustrate the
   effectiveness of this method in an extreme circumstance.},

Abstract = {One way to study the politics of big data is the inspection of their
   assemblages. By opening up the ``black boxes{''} of data assemblages, it
   is possible to reconstruct the choices, compromises, conflicts and
   agreements that contributed to the construction of a given datum.
   Leaning on in-depth interviews and focus groups with experts and
   specialists who work within three European data centers, we unveil the
   interdependence between social and technical aspects and between a
   series of internal and external actors, which all contribute to the data
   assemblage. Results show that communities of experts, technologies,
   stakeholders and end-users are entwined components that interact amongst
   them in a contingent and complex web of negotiations and constraints and
   frame what is possible, desirable and expected by data.},

   Electoral System},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF POLITICS IN LATIN AMERICA},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {10},
Number = {1},
Pages = {3-28},
Abstract = {It has been argued that close elections lead to policy convergence, as
   legislators elected by a small margin are more likely to adopt moderate
   policy positions (Downs 1957). However, Lee, Moretti, and Butler (2004)
   find that electoral competition does not affect legislators' policy
   preferences in the United States, questioning the median voter paradigm.
   To help to discern this paradox, we estimate the effect of close
   elections on legislators' subsequent policy positions under different
   electoral rules. With Chile's two-seat open-list proportional
   representation system, we exploit the dynamics of within-coalition
   competition to test both hypotheses. Using the margin of victory in 383
   races in four different parliamentary elections and 3,741 roll-call
   votes for the 120-seat Chamber of Deputies from 1998 to 2014, we find
   that electoral competition did not lead to policy convergence under
   either the center-left Concertacion coalition or the rightist Alianza
   coalition. We contend that policy convergence responds to electoral
   incentives but is also conditioned by the nature of the political regime
   (presidential or parliamentary) and government-opposition dynamics.},

   identification and the impact of globalization on this relation. The
   multilevel approach drew survey data from 89 countries, country-level
   measures of globalization enabling an examination of globalization
   effects on the relation between national and global identification. A
   negative link obtained between national and global identification in
   most of the countries, the cross-country variation of this link is
   related to globalization. Countries characterized by rapid globalization
   exhibit a lower negative relation between national and global
   identification than those marked by lower levels of globalization

Abstract = {This research offers innovative ways to study fanaticism in higher
   education. It builds on simulations of regional crises to test four
   expectations and discusses their implications. The first, on the
   benefits of experimental learning, is supported: participants identify
   with their actors and show little empathy to rivals, indicating they
   learn the script and play seriously. So simulations provide an effective
   method to study fanaticism and should be used more frequently. Findings
   on crisis negotiations show that participants disregard fanaticism in
   the scenario, consider themselves as moderates, and label rivals as
   fanatic. Rather than admitting deadlock or defeat, they regard
   negotiation outcomes as compromise. These results refute three
   expectations: perceptions of fanaticism are not knowledge-based or
   bias/prejudice free; success and outcome assessment are not based on
   relative goal attainment; and common heuristics rather than individual
   inclinations shape perceptions and ways of coping with fanaticism.
   Together, negotiations, feedback, and in-depth debriefing on
   appeasement, other policy alternatives, and the role heuristics create a
   comprehensive simulation experience. Further applications of
   experimental learning in political science could enhance the role of
   education as a crucial means to confront fanaticism and minimize its
   dangers.},

Abstract = {Elections are in theory democratic means of resolving disputes and
   making collective decisions, yet too often force is employed to distort
   the electoral process. The post-Cold War increase in the number of
   electoral authoritarian and hybrid states has brought this problem into
   relief. In recent years the prevention of electoral violence has played
   an increasingly large role in the democratic assistance activities
   undertaken by international agencies, following increased awareness
   within the international community of the specific security challenges
   that elections entail. However, there has to date been little systematic
   evaluation of the success of different electoral violence prevention
   (EVP) strategies in reforming electoral institutions so as to enable
   them to maintain the peace during the electoral period. This article
   assesses the effectiveness of two common types of international EVP
   activity. Using a new global dataset of EVP strategies between 2003 and
   2015, this article finds evidence that capacity-building strategies
   reduce violence by non-state actors, whereas attitude-transforming
   strategies are associated with a reduction in violence by state actors
   and their allies. The findings are relevant both for understanding the
   dynamics of electoral violence, and also for policymakers and electoral
   assistance providers in the international community who have
   responsibility for the design of democratic assistance projects in
   states at risk of electoral violence.},

Abstract = {Under what conditions can courts produce political and social change? My
   claim is that courts can be most consequential when they act in concert
   with other actors to create political spaces for ongoing discussion and
   engagement with regard to rights. In explaining judicial impact, I focus
   on the novel and understudied oversight mechanisms-like follow-up
   committees and public hearings-that some assertive high courts deploy to
   monitor adherence to some of their rulings. The analysis is based on
   comparative case studies of two landmark socioeconomic rights cases
   handed down by the Argentine Supreme Court. I show that the deployment
   of oversight mechanisms can create institutional spaces where the court,
   elected leaders, and private and civil society actors converge to
   generate change, resulting in greater impact.},

Abstract = {Although political discourses emphasize the attractiveness of France and
   the reception conditions for foreign students, these students remain
   strangers like any others, progressively facing monitoring policies over
   their entry and stay in France. African students are at the forefront of
   this border closure, implemented from the consulates. This article
   proposes to reverse the perspective by observing not the production of
   these borders, but the perceptions and practices of the students who
   face them. Investigating students' life courses both those who have
   obtained their visa and those who have not reveals the inequalities
   introduced by this political filter, which is very socially selective.
   Often confined by a student visa procedure, students develop different
   strategies to adapt to borders, or to bypass them, according to their
   social profile, their family history, and their individual and
   collective resources. This approach to public policies from below, and
   from its users, explains how the inextricable imbrication of borders,
   both political and social, reinforces the spatial immobility of some,
   but above all makes the mobility of others more complex.},

Title = {Analysing OECD National Contact Point Statements for Guidance on Human
   Rights Due Diligence: Method, Findings and Outlook},
Journal = {NORDIC JOURNAL OF HUMAN RIGHTS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {36},
Number = {4, SI},
Pages = {390-410},
Abstract = {This article examines statements issued by National Contact Points
   (NCPs) under the OECD's Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises.
   Applying the term `risk-based due diligence', the OECD's Guidelines have
   adopted the human rights due diligence concept introduced by the UN
   Framework and elaborated by the UN Guiding Principles. OECD NCPs de
   facto serve as remedy institutions for those instruments. The analysis
   aims to identify and glean insights provided by NCPs on human rights due
   diligence. It identifies and analyses specific instances that have
   addressed due diligence in regard to state guidance for companies
   operating in conflict areas and the identification of a business
   relationship as `directly linked' in the terms of the UNGPs and the
   Guidelines. It also considers steps that form part of due diligence,
   particularly stakeholder engagement, the exercise of influence through
   leverage, and integrating and acting upon findings on impact. The
   article finds that final statements and recommendations issued by NCPs
   can serve as sources of norms for human rights/risk-based due diligence.
   It also finds that there appears to be scope for a larger number of NCPs
   to deliver guidance through their final statements.},

Abstract = {This article reviews recent survey-based research on citizens' trust in
   government, focusing particularly on the United States. It addresses the
   long-term decline in trust and potential causes for this decline, with
   an emphasis on the effects of partisanship, polarization, performance,
   process, and media priming. While dispositions can anchor trust levels,
   the dominant research findings show that the sources of variation and
   change in trust are political, if multifaceted, in nature. We discuss
   new versions of standard measures, call for a renewed look at the
   distinction between trust in authorities and trust in the regime, review
   ongoing work on how and why trust matters, and recommend broadening the
   foci of mistrust to include antiestablishment sentiments and attacks on
   electoral integrity. How trust intervenes between perceptions of
   political processes and compliance with authoritative commands is a
   critical domain for additional research. We conclude with a caveat
   against confidence that the decline in trust can be quickly or easily
   reversed.},

Abstract = {Existing research shows that the election of members of previously
   underrepresented groups can have significant consequences for
   policymaking. Yet, quotas, reserved seats, communal rolls, and
   race-conscious districting make it difficult to distinguish whether it
   is group membership, electoral incentives, or a combination of the two
   that matters. It is argued here that lawmakers who are members of
   underrepresented groups will stand out as defenders of their group's
   interests only when electoral rules incentivize them to do so. This is
   demonstrated empirically using data from New Zealand, showing that Mori
   Members of Parliament systematically vary in the extent to which they
   represent their ethnic group as a function of the three different sets
   of rules under which they were elected.},

Title = {Assessing democratic representation in multi-level democracies},
Journal = {WEST EUROPEAN POLITICS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {41},
Number = {3, SI},
Pages = {541-564},
Abstract = {This article introduces the special issue Assessing democratic
   representation in multi-level democracies' from a conceptual
   perspective. It adapts Powell's chain of responsiveness - as a model of
   the democratic process on the national level - to the context of
   multi-level systems and discusses conditions that might facilitate or
   hamper responsiveness in regional democracies. The theoretical reasoning
   identifies added complexity, multiple actors sharing the same label and
   cross-level interdependent decisions as the key challenges to
   multi-level democracy. Empirical illustrations focus on the first stage
   of the representation process. Here voters should form rational policy
   preferences and take informed voting decisions, and parties are expected
   to offer coherent policy platforms that are tailored to the specifics of
   the regional level. While the analysis of party manifesto data suggests
   that regional parties cover regional issues, and strategic incentives to
   focus on other levels appear limited, survey-based information
   illustrates the cognitive burden of multi-level democracy on voters. In
   combination with a synopsis of the other contributions assembled in this
   issue, the findings suggest that information, responsibility and
   accountability problems may be particular obstacles to responsiveness in
   multi-level systems.},

Abstract = {``Where is the Palestinian Gandhi?{''} is a question often asked in
   relation to the nature of Palestinian resistance. The question reflects
   a lack of accurate knowledge about Palestinian society and history, as
   well as a misrepresentation of the forms in which Palestinian resistance
   has taken place over the past few decades. Throughout their struggle for
   independence, Palestinians have predominantly adopted nonviolent forms
   of resistance. Focusing on the determinants of Palestinian support for
   nonviolent resistance against Israeli occupation two decades after the
   signing of the Oslo Accords in 1993, this paper lays out the historical
   context of nonviolence in the Palestinian political landscape. Through
   the use of survey data this study provides an alternative theoretical
   conceptualization of Palestinian popular resistance, and community
   resilience. The findings of this empirical study highlight the impact of
   self-reported identities on support for nonviolent tactics in resisting
   Israeli occupation.},

Abstract = {Housing Provision Systems can be defined as public and private
   initiatives that configure the options available in each society to
   provide a place to reside. From this perspective, it should be
   considered as a central element of the Welfare States, along with
   employment policies, health or education. In fact, comparative analyzes
   between countries show housing provision systems that correspond to
   classifications of welfare regimes and have effects on access to
   housing, the predominant form of housing regime and their conditions. In
   these researches, Spain, usually classified as a dualist model that
   promotes housing ownership over rental, as opposed to the integrated
   model more characteristic of northern European countries. In this way,
   this article develops two objectives. On the one hand, show the
   existence of Autonomous Systems of Housing Provision in Spain, proposing
   indicators in this regard. On the other hand, it aims to show the
   effects on residential emancipation of young people, using data from
   different statistical sources (Housing Census, Spanish Labour Force
   Survey and other Spanish secondary data sources). Thus, it is an
   analytical and empirical proposal about an aspect scarcely studied of
   sub-national welfare systems.},

Title = {Picturing immigration: how the media criminalizes immigrants},
Journal = {POLITICS GROUPS AND IDENTITIES},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {6},
Number = {4},
Pages = {814-824},
Abstract = {A growing body of evidence demonstrates that the way the press frames
   policy issues can foster fear, particularly with respect to portrayals
   of immigrants. Building on this research, we examine images of
   immigrants, borders, and legality in the media's coverage of
   immigration. To do so, we collect a unique dataset of images appearing
   in three major national news magazines' articles about immigration or
   immigrants in the U.S. between 2000 and 2010. We code the images based
   on whether they include visual representations of the border and
   immigration enforcement, whether illegality and/or criminal behavior is
   shown or implied, and the activities in which the immigrants are
   engaged. We find that the press frequently portrays immigrants as
   undocumented, presenting images of the border as well as immigrant
   arrests and detentions. Moreover, when immigrants are working, they are
   disproportionately engaged in low-skilled activities. Our analysis
   demonstrates a general tendency to frame immigrants in a negative light,
   consistent with a ``threat{''} narrative but inconsistent with actual
   immigrant demographics. Our findings are particularly important in light
   of research establishing that such portrayals contribute to more hostile
   attitudes about immigration in the U.S. as well as greater support for
   punitive immigration policy among Whites.},

Abstract = {This essay reflects on Stanley Hoffmann's contributions as a scholar and
   public intellectual. We focus on Stanley Hoffmann's scholarly,
   intellectual and ethical legacy by highlighting two sets of
   contributions, where his work challenged much international relations
   scholarship in the second half of the 20(th) century. First, we identify
   the ways in which his research speaks to important policy concerns,
   whilst maintaining a certain detachment from the corridors of power.
   This is a distinctive approach to policy relevance that allowed Hoffmann
   to contribute to public debate and raise important challenges to
   prevailing policies at crucial moments. Second, we stress the importance
   of Hoffmann's arguments for a humanistic approach to the social sciences
   and international relations, a plea that remains relevant in an age of
   heightened scientific ambitions.},

Abstract = {Particularly for 30 years the Mexico-United States migration has new
   modalities and characteristics in its centennial history. In order to
   understand this unprecedented massive migration, it is crucial to take
   into account the socioeconomic situation and the migration policies of
   the United States, and the globalizing, privatizing and opening-up
   situation brought about by economic policies and the trade agreement in
   Mexico (macroestructural level), linked to the importance of tradition
   and migration culture, social networks, migration industry, modern
   media, psychological motivations, symbolism, ritualization of returns
   (meso and microstructural level). This research, which is based on
   empirical data from a case study in Michoacan (Huandacareo), aims to
   propose some concepts to highlight the importance of microstructural
   analysis in contemporary migration. In the analysis of the causes of
   migration, economic and political considerations are as transcendental
   as the cultural, traditional and psychosocial elements.},

Abstract = {The effects of foreign trade on the environment in the cases of rice,
   cassava, and fish in Cambodia are examined in this article, but as a
   case study analyzing markers of developmental discursive practice. The
   study identifies and analyzes five rhetorical techniques in discursive
   practice-assertion, provincialism, dismissal of positive outcomes,
   reference to external causes, and policy fetishism-then argues that
   these have in common the denial of local voice. It argues that their
   deployment tends to increase where a discursive order is more contested.
   In general, the case study shows how much of development policy
   literature is rather disreputable.},

Abstract = {In the UK and Australia, the use of the term `hate preachers' to
   describe jihadist extremist speakers has become common. In this article,
   I argue this term is confused, and that the contemporary cause of this
   confusion lies in new incitement to religious and racial hatred
   provisions enacted in 2006 and 2010, respectively. To date, scholarly
   analysis of these provisions has suggested that their primary purpose is
   to protect vulnerable communities. Analysing the context and justifying
   discourse of key policymakers during debates, I argue by contrast that
   their primary purpose is as a counter-terrorism measure, and that both
   the public debate and the provisions themselves evince and entrench an
   enduring epistemic confusion.},

Abstract = {Among the actors that took part in the process of democratic change in
   Spain, a prominent role was occupied by the reformists, leading figures
   who, at the death of Franco, held relevant positions within the
   dictatorship's institutions and carried out several attempts to
   transform the regime in a democratising sense. Some of these reformists,
   deputies of the Cortes, decided during the spring of 1975 to form the
   Independent Parliamentary Group (IPG), which served as an authentic
   wake-up call in the dull existence of the House, dominated as it was by
   ultraconservatism. Through its initiatives, the IPG re-invigorated
   Spanish political life, and its influence was patent during the
   discussion of the Political Reform Law. Through the analysis of
   unpublished documents, this paper aims to reconstruct the activity of
   the Group and assess the contribution of its members to the transition
   to democracy.},

Abstract = {The paper examines Hannah Arendt's interpretation of Thomas Jefferson's
   political thought. First, we put forward the main arguments that place
   him within the framework of political liberalism. In this regard, his
   writings of the pre-revolutionary period allude to the ancient Saxon
   constitution and to the natural rights of John Locke. Second, we expose
   Hannah Arendt's assessment of the American Revolution as a replica of
   classical republicanism, to the detriment of the thesis prevailing until
   1960, which places it within the context of classical liberalism. We
   assert that she interprets T. Jefferson as representative of
   republicanism, highlighting in particular his thesis on the council
   system.},

Abstract = {One of the minor yet recurring themes of Antonio Gramsci's Prison
   Notebooks is his treatment of the ``simple,{''} a category he developed
   to examine the Catholic Church's paternalistic view of common people and
   peasants as ``simple and sincere souls,{''} in contrast to its superior
   view of cultured intellectuals. Throughout the Notebooks, he examines
   how the Church's condescending and fatalistic portrayal of the
   ``simple{''} provides a basis for common sense, reinforcing the
   conditions of subalternity. Because of the uncritical nature of common
   sense and the simple's desire for change, he argues for the articulation
   of a ``renewed common sense{''} containing critical and reflective
   philosophical foundations that transcend the passivity and paternalism
   of religion. Such a movement requires defining and disseminating new
   conceptions of philosophy and culture that are critically grounded and
   provide a basis of struggle in which the ``simple{''} play the
   predominant role in the direction of their political lives and in the
   creation of a new hegemony.},

Journal = {POLITICA Y SOCIEDAD},

Abstract = {150 years after the publication of book I of Marx's Capital (1867), our
   aim is to review the influence of this book in Spain, in the dual sense
   of dissemination (especially) and reception (at a more primary level).
   Therefore, we study, first, the translations of Capital into Spanish
   (Castilian and Catalan but not in Latin America), looking at their
   number and diffusion, the translator's personality, the character of the
   publisher and the respective historical circumstances. Secondly, we try
   a first approximation to the theoretical influence of this book on
   different Spanish authors, but given the magnitude of this field, we do
   it in a non-exhaustive and not-systematic or methodical way. On the
   other hand, we do not deal with the influence of Marxism in general, but
   with something more specific: how Capital has influenced the authors who
   have written about it or from it in Spain, both for and against. The
   results of our analysis show an important set of translations (more than
   in English), but less disseminated than others made in Mexico and
   Argentina; and an increasing intellectual influence of Capital, with a
   periodic flourishing, as at the present, of studies on this book and on
   the theories it contains.},

Pages = {370-384},
Abstract = {Traditional class theories invariably embrace the proposition of
   economism', either extruding politics from the causality of class
   formation or treating politics as epiphenomenal. Similar ideas of class
   inform much of the literature on class in the People's Republic of China
   (PRC). This article contends that social stratification and class
   formation in post-Mao China cannot be fully understood without
   recognising state power as a critical determinant of life chances and a
   major organising principle in the country's class map due to the
   authoritarian nature of the Party-state and the ubiquity of state power
   in the economic sphere. It proceeds to illustrate the part that state
   power plays at the macro and micro levels in the production and
   reproduction of class.},

Abstract = {With regard to its domestic and foreign policy, the Turkish regime is
   coming closer to the Russian authoritarian regime of control with its

   and the EU and Russia and Turkey are not a misunderstanding, but
   symptoms of a systemic conflict. In this country, society, the media and
   politics should stand up to Ankara's and Moscow's subversive activities.
   Western double moral standards are the most powerful argument used by
   Putin's and Erdogan's supporters, while normative integrity in Europe is
   the necessary response.},

   and Perils of (Austrian) Political Science Going Mainstream},
Journal = {AUSTRIAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {47},
Number = {3},
Pages = {71-79},
Abstract = {This essay raises the question of whether mainstream political science
   fails to address adequately the important questions about the state of
   democracy that are dominating the current public discourse. Increasingly
   common research practices in mainstream political science focus on
   technical questions and puzzle-solving while incentivizing conventional
   approaches and narrow risk-averse scholarship. This threatens political
   science's ability to contribute meaningfully to the public discourse.
   Under these circumstances, the Austrian branch of the discipline is
   joining mainstream international political science in a quest for
   greater relevance after decades of marginalization. The article traces
   the evolution of postwar international and Austrian political science,
   suggesting that the current focus on puzzle-solving is a reaction to
   previously dominant paradigms in the discipline that made grand claims
   on the basis of few data. The essay also shows that the delayed
   establishment of Austrian political science as an academic discipline
   and its long disconnect from international developments in the field
   long undermined its recognition. Now that it is becoming more mainstream
   and international, there are unprecedented opportunities for greater
   prestige but also new perils to be avoided.},

Journal = {AMERICAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE},

Number = {1},
Pages = {55-71},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Every time a major violent act takes place in the United States, a
   public debate erupts as to whether it should be considered terrorism.
   Political scientists have offered a variety of conceptual frameworks,
   but have neglected to explore how ordinary citizens understand
   terrorism, despite the central role the public plays in our
   understanding of the relationship between terrorism and government
   action in the wake of violence. We synthesize components of both
   scholarly definitions and public debates to formulate predictions for
   how various attributes of incidents affect the likelihood they are
   perceived as terrorism. Combining a conjoint experiment with machine
   learning techniques and automated content analysis of media coverage, we
   show the importance not only of the type and severity of violence, but
   also the attributed motivation for the incident and social
   categorization of the actor. The findings demonstrate how the language
   used to describe violent incidents, for which the media has considerable
   latitude, affects the likelihood the public classifies incidents as
   terrorism.},

Abstract = {Shifting attention from Central America's transatlantic engagements to
   South America helps explore the less discussed intra-American nature of
   transatlantic transactions, while also bringing the dominant east-west
   flows into the twenty-first century. Both dimensions expose several
   Central American patterns: the global-transatlantic connection,
   competition between today's trading blocs resembling those between
   corporations and empires before, the transatlantic-transpacific marriage
   being resuscitated, and the growing intra-Latin flows that colonialism
   and nationalism previously prevented.
   Other key findings include: (a) the possible peaking of transatlantic
   flows, with the faster transpacific trade, and thereby the possibility
   of a shift from the notion of `transatlantic as an end in itself' to
   `transatlantic as the means to other, more intra-continental and global
   ends'; and (b) the growing theoretical turbulence as the dominant
   explanatory frameworks account for less and less of the exploding
   dynamics.},

Abstract = {The aim of this article, and of the special issue it introduces, is to
   claim a more prominent role for the analysis of school textbooks when
   studying peace and conflict. School textbooks can contribute to several
   core discussions in this research field because they are indicators of
   dominant political knowledge, have privileged access to a large
   audience, and are objects of peace and conflict processes themselves. We
   reflect how the analysis of school textbooks has already contributed
   significantly to peace and conflict studies and outline avenues for
   further research.},

Abstract = {In the wake of recent political scandals, pundits have argued that the
   way a politician reacts to a scandal can make or break said politician's
   relationship with constituents and future in elected office. Some
   politicians concede guilt immediately, apologize, promise to take
   corrective action, and possibly open the door to moving on with their
   careers. Others deny culpability and attack their accusers, hoping to
   quickly put accusations behind them, change the subject, and channel
   public attention in a different direction. Does conceding guilt after a
   scandal breaks and offering to take corrective action to solve the
   problem help ameliorate the issue, or does it push the public away even
   further? Does denying involvement in a scandal and attacking the accuser
   compound the problem, or can it evoke positive feelings? This research
   uses an experimental design to test individuals' reactions to how
   politicians act after being accused of a personal scandal (in this case,
   an inappropriate relationship with a staffer). Results illustrate that a
   strategy involving denial and attacking accusers can spur positive
   evaluations of who a politician is and what that politician will do in
   the future, while the performance of conceding and taking corrective
   action is mixed at best.},

Abstract = {After having been dormant for much of the 20th century, the concept of
   cosmopolitanism has regained some of its former rhetorical power in
   current academic and political debates. Taking Kwame Anthony Appiah and
   Robert Fine as key interlocutors, the article argues that a historically
   informed analysis of the linguistic context, in which the language of
   cosmopolitanism first emerged, can help us understand better the
   political and ideological underpinnings of the concept. In the first
   part of the article, I discuss the emergence of cosmopolitanism in the
   context of what I shall refer to as the `ismatization' of political
   language in the late 18th and early 19th centuries. In the second part,
   I turn to what I consider to be a key text for understanding the
   paradoxes of cosmopolitanism: the essay Das Geheimnis des
   Kosmopolitenordens ('The Secret of the Order of the Cosmopolitans'),
   published by the German novelist, poet and publicist Christoph Martin
   Wieland in the journal Teutscher Merkur in 1788. At the end of the 18th
   century, I argue, Wieland makes a similar observation to Fine, namely
   that the `ism' connotes something doctrinal, even sectarian, and steeped
   in secrecy and conspiracy.},

Abstract = {Past scholarship has offered varying explanations for why presidents
   choose to use executive orders. However, to this point, much of what we
   know of unilateral powers does not adequately address the role the
   bureaucracy plays in the president's decision. This research seeks to
   account for bureaucratic factors as a strategic presidential
   consideration in the employment of such directives. I classify executive
   orders from 1989-2012 based on which agency or agencies they apply to,
   and consider the importance of various characteristics (e.g. agency
   ideology, level of centralization, politicization, etc.) in determining
   which organs of the bureaucracy presidents will direct executive orders
   to generally. The results provide evidence that the White House directs
   fewer executive orders to agencies that have a politically independent
   leadership structure, and this result holds across a variety of measures
   judging an order's impact. The results demonstrate that the type of
   directive is crucial in determining a president's strategic decision to
   use executive orders, in line with previous research, and that agency
   centralization is one crucial component of this strategic calculation.},

Title = {INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION IN THE FIELD OF COMBATING GLOCALIZED
   CORRUPTION},
Journal = {POLIS-POLITICHESKIYE ISSLEDOVANIYA},
Year = {2018},
Number = {1},
Pages = {116-128},
Abstract = {The article examines the factors and conditions for complicating the
   forms of corruption that affect the relations between countries and form
   new trends of international cooperation. While in traditional and even
   industrial societies the nature of corruption was determined by the
   peculiarity of local social pathologies, under the conditions of
   dynamically developing globalization processes corruption goes beyond
   the national and territorial context, acquires fundamentally new
   qualities. The world community has witnessed the formation of glocalized
   corruption. Like any other complex phenomenon, the corruption is
   subjected to non-linear development. With the preservation of the
   ``old{''} forms of immoral-unlawful mercenary behavior, new, more
   cynical and dangerous forms of corruption emerge, forming unprecedented
   hybrid pathologies. Quantitative and qualitative characteristics of the
   glocalized corruption are largely due to the increasing scale and
   inconsistency of international interaction, uncontrollable openness of
   modern society. Corruption has become networked. There is also a
   paradoxical combination of objective realities and staged corruption
   that ambiguously affects international cooperation. On the one hand,
   international anti-corruption structures are being formed, and on the
   other hand, the staging of corruption, which has become an integral part
   of modern provocations. The article also presents the main meanings and
   meaningful characteristics of international cooperation in the field of
   combating corruption, problem areas, forms of existing and possible
   cooperation between Russia and other states and international
   organizations in this field. It is substantiated that the policy of
   counteracting corruption and the measures that are being taken at the
   national level can no longer be functionally effective. Thus, the task
   of consolidated anticorruption actions on a global scale is being
   actualized, including countering the policy of exporting corruption and
   corruption technologies. Without a close interaction of national
   political structures, law enforcement bodies with scientific centers
   that study the new social pathologies it is practically impossible to
   defeat corruption evil. The most important prerequisite for the success
   of such cooperation is the constructive interaction between governments,
   law enforcement and judicial bodies, structures of the civil society.},

Abstract = {Homer's portrayal of Odysseus's wife, Penelope, has long been used as a
   model for the contribution of women and private life to politics.
   Political scholarship on Penelope has either focused on her private
   virtues or argued that she wields a distinctively feminine set of
   political powers. In the former case the result is a narrowing of the
   scope of her political power and importance, and in the latter case she
   represents an alternative, feminine model of political excellence.
   Presenting a third alternative, I argue that examination of Penelope's
   actions, words, and thoughts reveals a woman whose gender-neutral
   virtues are politically significant and provide the conditions for
   friendship between Odysseus and Penelope.},

Title = {Capital, Economic Growth, and Socio-Ecological Crisis: A Critique of
   De-Growth},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL CRITICAL THOUGHT},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {8},
Number = {1},
Pages = {46-65},
Abstract = {This paper presents a critique of mainstream growth ideology, as well as
   of a variety of neo-Malthusian or liberal approaches considering
   economic growth as an ideology, and ``growth economies{''} as the main
   culprit of ecological crisis, while disconnecting growth from the
   prevailing capitalist mode of production. To tackle ecological crisis,
   they suggest economic de-growth or a steady-state economy, while often
   projecting the negative impact of economic growth to different forms of
   production. On the contrary, this paper considers economic growth as an
   inherent necessity of the capitalist mode of production and explores the
   socio-ecological conditions of economic growth and capitalist
   accumulation. With a brief reference to Greece, it is demonstrated that
   even a protracted recession cannot reverse the trend of environmental
   degradation and socio-ecological crisis. As argued, overcoming the
   current crisis requires overcoming not only economic growth, but
   capitalism itself.},

Abstract = {Until its recent crisis, Brazil's rise, combined with seeming US decline
   and distraction, led observers to declare South America a
   `posthegemonic' region. How have US and Brazilian ambitions and
   capabilities affected the countries' relations within the shared
   neighbourhood of the Western Hemisphere? Building on work by Womack, B.
   {[}2016. Asymmetry and international relationships. New York: Cambridge
   University Press], the article analyses the US-Brazil-South America
   relationship as a regionally located, asymmetrical triangle. During two
   centre-left presidencies, Brazil sought to shift the dynamics of the
   hemisphere's soft triangles. Brazilian diplomacy redefined its
   neighbourhood as South America, developed exclusive regional groupings,
   and assumed the role of pivot to shape relationships between the US and
   South America. In the face of sceptical neighbours and weakened
   Brazilian capabilities, the regional triangle is likely to return to a
   more `normal' configuration in which the United States acts as a
   central, albeit often uninterested, pivot.},

Abstract = {This research note extends the confrontational approach to estimating
   party policy positions by providing a way to estimate uncertainty
   associated with the measurements. The confrontational approach is a
   flexible method of determining party policy positions, which is ideally
   suited to measure parties' positions on issues that are specific to a
   country or period in time. We introduce a method of estimating the
   uncertainty of confrontational estimates by restating the approach as a
   special case of an item response theory, opening up the possibility of
   using the confrontational approach not only as a descriptive tool but
   also as a means of testing hypotheses on party policy preferences. We
   illustrate our model using analysis of the 2010 Dutch parliamentary
   election and the 2009 European elections.},

Abstract = {Several decentralisation studies were conducted in the context of one
   political party controlling both the central and local state, where it
   is assumed that there is a concordance of vision between the two. This
   paper examines the impact of shared or unshared vision and the
   centre-local power dynamics in Harare which is controlled by an
   opposition political party. Data was collected qualitatively from
   various stakeholders in Harare. `Unshared vision' is evident between
   local and central state. Centre-local power contestations are one-sided
   and there is the prioritisation of political battles at the expense of
   serving the residents of the Harare.},

Journal = {POLITIX},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {31},
Number = {121},
Pages = {29+},
Abstract = {This article has two main aims. First, we define and describe the notion
   of ``philanthrocapitalism,{''} a global movement that purports to make
   philanthropy more effective by applying the market logic of the
   corporate sector to the charitable sector. In contrast to other analyses
   of philanthrocapitalism, we suggest that an increase in the scale of
   private disbursements is not the defining feature of new philanthropic
   models. What is new is the use of bequests from philanthropic
   organizations such as the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation to directly
   subsidize large corporations. This point leads to our second main aim,
   which is to argue that the most important feature of the new
   philanthropy is the way that pro-market rhetoric espoused by
   philanthrocapitalists helps to confer moral legitimacy on pro-corporate
   government regulation and public spending that directly exacerbates
   economic inequality. Importantly, this moral legitimacy can only last as
   long as the negative effects of pro-corporate government wealth
   transfers on the public purse are strategically ignored. We suggest that
   philanthrocapitalist organizations perform an epistemological and
   moralizing function which renders corporate harms less apparent to the
   public. Drawing on Max Weber's concept of charismatic authority and on
   research by criminologists into social harms and crimes of the powerful,
   we explore how and why elite philanthropic actors, whose existence and
   actions often harm the public, have managed to successfully present the
   push for market solutions to human problems as socially beneficial.},

Abstract = {This note analyzes, from an axiological perspective, why the perception
   rates of political and administrative corruption are higher in the South
   than in Northern Europe, as well as in Latin America, which is an
   inheriting population of the culture of Spain and Portugal. The specific
   question to be investigated is how the religion and the philosophy have
   shaped two different visions to understand the human essence of Western
   Christianity, with specific emphasis on the study of Spain. The research
   method used is qualitative, it is based on an analysis of the content of
   the multiplicity of orthodox texts, besides others qualified in its
   belief of heretical doctrines. Heterodoxy started in Ancient Egypt and
   it had as its principal figure to the Pharaoh Akenaton, who created the
   first monotheism. Thoughts based on the Maat, the harmony that has to
   dominate every act. This element was forgotten within the catholic
   orthodoxy and it caused an inharmonious corruption. Christianity was
   divided into Catholic, where the most important message is the
   collective, and Protestant, where the individual prevails. Protestant
   countries worried about preserving the separation of power, whereas the
   Catholics pleaded for the philosopher King.},

   TEACHING CAREER: REFLECTIONS ON ITS LABOUR AND TRADE-UNION IMPLICATIONS},
Journal = {REVISTA ANDINA DE ESTUDIOS POLITICOS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {8},
Number = {1},
Pages = {60-84},
Abstract = {Framed in the implementation of the Teachers' Reform Law in Peru, the
   following text discusses the process of hegemony construction that a
   performance narrative associated to labour regulation, particularly
   tenure, has experienced as a professionalization criterion. It
   highlights the process of dislocation which performance had as a
   parameter for professional dignification, by turning from continuous
   improvement and social acknowledgment to individual prestige and the
   increase of purchasing power, in a context of peer competition.
   Throughout the testimonies of key informants, some counterproductive
   effects derived from a performance policy based on tenure regulation
   from an accountability logic are pointed out. They include simulation
   and credentialism, and the legitimacy of a labour statute which
   dispenses incorporation to the teachers' public career, according to
   individual merit. Also, recent representation challenges for the
   teachers' trade union regarding the institutionalization of an
   individualized remuneration policy are exposed. Finally, it argues that
   some elements existing in the professional dignification narrative are
   capable to dislocate the sense of performance associated to
   accountability and labour regulation.},

Abstract = {Why do autocratic rulers liberalize financial markets? This article
   shows how autocrats use financial liberalization for two distinct
   purposes. First, autocrats may use liberalization to bolster the
   economy, making revolution less attractive to the political opposition
   and stabilizing the autocracy. Second, when stabilization of the
   autocracy is too costly, autocrats may use liberalization to make assets
   more mobile. Mobility provides elite asset owners with external
   investment options, which limit redistribution. When redistribution is
   the main fear associated with democratization, the mobility associated
   with liberalization makes direct control of political institutions
   through dictatorship unnecessary. Thus, autocrats use liberalization to
   stimulate the economy and stabilize their rule or to reduce
   redistribution in anticipation of democratization. Suharto's policies in
   Indonesia and Pinochet's policies in Chile illustrate these two
   objectives of financial liberalization.},

Abstract = {This paper analyses three fundamental processes in the construction of
   peace in the current stage of the Basque conflict. Firstly, the creation
   of public discourses by pacifist organizations, conditioned by the
   communicative strategy, the economic availability, the repertoires of
   action, the ideology and the existence of networks of interaction with
   other peace platforms and social actors. Secondly, the media diffusion
   of news related to the conflict, analysed through the existence of
   violence in the socio-political milieu, the type of media ownership, the
   editorial line, the availability of resources and the professional
   abilities of journalists. Finally, the citizenry level focuses on the
   legitimation of the precedent stages and on the deployment of awareness
   and participation processes that may lead to the consolidation of local
   peace-promoting practices.},

Abstract = {India's top foreign policy priority is its neighbourhood of South Asia
   and the Indian Ocean, which it shares with China. This article seeks to
   understand how India views its largest and most powerful neighbour China
   in their shared neighbourhood. In view of the nature of the geographical
   location of the two major rising powers, India seeks to engage China
   through a mix of cooperation and competition. An unprecedented growth in
   Sino-Indian bilateral trade has taken place, with China becoming India's
   largest trade partner. Yet, this dominant geo-economic narrative until
   the mid-2000s is increasingly being challenged by the dynamics of
   competition between the two countries in their shared neighbourhood.
   This has sharpened over their border dispute impacting Bhutan, new
   dramatic Chinese economic-focused initiatives in South Asia and an
   expansion of Chinese influence and presence in the Indian Ocean.},

Abstract = {A half decade since the Arab Spring erupted, efforts to put these
   political and constitutional processes into proper prospective are
   becoming more prevalent. It cannot be denied, however, that this alleged
   new democratising wave remains provisional in many ways. While the new
   Constitution emerging from the Tunisian spring only began to take effect
   from January 2014, in others countries we can openly speak of the
   `autumn season' of the Arab Spring, an expression that seeks to capture
   the degeneration into authoritarianism - such as in the Egyptian case.
   The same cannot be said in the case of Morocco which, among all the
   constitutional processes opened, was the first to be concluded and to
   have reached a mature level, following several years of development of
   the new constitutional text. This essay focuses on the constitutional
   development introduced by the new organic legislation, including
   regarding representative institutions, the government, the judiciary,
   the jurisdiction of the constitution, advanced regionalisation, and new
   mechanisms of participation.},

Abstract = {This article examines the conditions under which great powers succeed or
   fail to shape a cooperative security agenda in their shared
   neighbourhoods. It compares Russia's interactions with the EU and with
   China in their respective shared neighbourhoods: the EU's Eastern
   Neighbourhood region and Central Asia. The article applies a synthetic
   framework. It analyses how the interplay between three factors - ideas,
   capabilities and circumstantial factors such, as the personalities of
   leading politicians, - shape the process of interaction between great
   powers. It starts from a comparison of the images of the two regions in
   Russia's mind-set because such images provide cognitive lenses through
   which powers make sense of political developments in shared
   neighbourhoods. The article then moves to show how change in the balance
   of power (soft and hard) created enabling conditions for
   competition/collaboration. Finally, the article shows how specific
   circumstantial factors led to or shaped the Russian-European conflict.
   At the same time, similar factors prevented Russian-Chinese conflict in
   Central Asia.},

Abstract = {This article introduces a special issue on candidate nomination,
   intra-party democracy, and election violence in Africa. Although a
   burgeoning literature on African democratization has focused on the
   topic of electoral violence, little attention has been given to violence
   during party nominations. When local-level or national-level competition
   between parties is low, as in much of Africa, electoral politics become
   a matter of intra-party rather than inter-party competition. Nominations
   are a part of the electoral process often left to the discretion of
   poorly institutionalized parties, free of the involvement of electoral
   management bodies and external monitors, and violence often results.
   Rather than developing an elaborate theoretical framework on the causes
   of nomination violence, our ambition in this introduction is to
   introduce the concept of nomination violence and situate it in the
   literatures on intra-party democracy and election violence. We also
   offer new descriptive data on nomination rules and nomination violence
   across parties on the African continent. The data show that nomination
   violence is a prevalent problem across both democracies and electoral
   autocracies. However, the level of nomination violence varies
   significantly between parties in the same party system and we recommend
   further research into the effect of parties' selection procedures on
   nomination violence.},

Abstract = {The author discusses problems of identity presented in the 2017
   publication of an encyclopedical volume edited by I.S. Semenenko through
   the lenses of political psychology. Methodology is one of the main lines
   of discussion in the study of identity. Analytical work made by the
   authors of this volume has shown that linking of different levels and
   areas of research is still a problem that needs to be solved; otherwise,
   all the construction of identity theory is in risk to stay a simple
   collection of particular disciplinary models. Another line of analysis
   is a ``human{''} or ``subjective{''} dimension of politics that was
   discussed in the book. This approach is close to political-psychological
   one. One of the most important topics of this volume is a topic of
   social relevance of identity theory, its capability to answer the real
   political issues that challenge this theory. Among those issues that
   make identity theory so popular in recent decades one can name such new
   phenomena as globalization processes, market pressure that transforms
   individual into a mere consumer, new forms of communication that produce
   specific forms if internet identities. An important phenomenon connected
   with identity is an asynchronism of political, social and cultural
   transformation with their reflection in people's minds in a process of
   identity formation. This ``effect of delay{''} demands a thorough
   psychological analysis as it causes multiple new threats and challenge.
   Principal uncertainty is one of its consequences. Individual cannot
   reach any particular identity and adjust himself to this uncertain
   reality.},

Abstract = {This essay explores the origins of Bernard Mandeville's evolutionary
   theory of social and political institutions, and will show that he built
   the framework of his overall social theory on the English common law
   tradition. Its first aim is to explain why, beginning from the 1720s,
   the law gained such importance in Mandeville's work, and to analyse the
   different roles that it played in the Fable of the Bees and the Fable of
   the Bees Part II. The essay's second hypothesis is that Mandeville may
   have been inspired by the work of Sir Matthew Hale and drew on the
   common law tradition when developing his own evolutionary view of law,
   which he used as the blueprint for a new kind of social theory.},

Abstract = {Political symbols such as the Confederate flag and Confederate monuments
   present a certain kind of ``stickiness{''} in meaning, interpretation,
   and ownership. In some instances, a symbol is deeply tied to its
   referent, as is the case for the iconic ``Hollywood sign{''} that sits
   atop the Hollywood Hills in Los Angeles. In other instances, a symbol is
   only distantly connected to its referent and is more informed by emotion
   than by details or facts, as I argue is the case for the Confederate
   flag. These socalled ``condensation symbols{''} take on meanings that
   are shaped by politics, communities, and myths making them difficult to
   challenge or reframe. Using the actions of rapper Kayne West as an
   abbreviated case study, this paper proposes the possibility of
   disrupting symbolic meanings in ways that could make Confederate symbols
   less sticky in meaning and ownership, and perhaps less politically
   divisive.},

   for populist radical right parties},
Journal = {WEST EUROPEAN POLITICS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {41},
Number = {1},
Pages = {28-52},
Abstract = {In the literature, explanations of support for populist radical right
   (PRR) parties usually focus on voters' socio-structural grievances,
   political discontent or policy positions. This article suggests an
   additional and possibly overarching explanation: societal pessimism. The
   central argument is that the nostalgic character of PRR ideology
   resonates with societal pessimism among its voters. Using European
   Social Survey data from 2012, the study compares levels of societal
   pessimism among PRR, radical left, mainstream left and mainstream right
   (MR) voters in eight European countries. The results show that societal
   pessimism is distributed in a tilted U-curve, with the highest levels
   indeed observed among PRR voters, followed by radical left voters.
   Societal pessimism increases the chance of a PRR vote (compared to a MR
   vote) controlling for a range of established factors. Further analyses
   show that societal pessimism is the only attitude on which MR and PRR
   voters take opposite, extreme positions. Finally, there is tentative
   evidence that societal pessimism is channelled through various more
   specific ideological positions taken by PRR voters, such as opposition
   to immigration.},

Abstract = {What is the use and purpose of American political development (APD) in
   the era of Black Lives Matter? This article clarifies the APD's role in
   analyzing the institutions to which the Movement for Black Lives
   primarily responds - racialized surveillance, policing, and
   incarceration. In particular, I spotlight what the discipline can offer,
   given the challenges of the current Trump era. The rise of Donald Trump
   to the presidency and the concurrent popularization of white populist
   nationalism in mainstream American politics present unique challenges. I
   argue that today, as scholars strive to understand how we arrived, or
   arrived again, in an era of overt white supremacist rhetoric, American
   political development's focus on historical institutional change offers
   necessary grounding. In an era of Charlottesville and chants of ``Build
   the wall!{''}, our collective focus is easily drawn to the spectacular
   and away from the long-standing and institutional, but black and brown
   lives also depend on our collective attention to the quieter routines of
   institutionalized racial violence that developed in post-civil rights
   era - even, and perhaps especially, in the absence of overt racial
   demagoguery.},

Abstract = {This article reviews some recent trends in research on everyday identity
   change. It argues that this field of research makes an important
   contribution to the explanation of political change and social
   transformation. It is particularly relevant to research on
   participation, social movements and contentious politics: like the
   latter, it emphasizes relationality, temporality and context, not simply
   variables and generalization; like the latter, it focusses on agency,
   choice and social practice as well as structure, power and constraint.
   Its focus on moving out from exclusivist, closed and oppositional forms
   of group identity is of particular interest. The article outlines some
   of the challenges and achievements of this field of research and
   highlights four areas where significant work exists and where it may
   usefully be developed further. In particular it focusses on: boundary
   work, and the informal nudging of boundaries towards greater
   permeability; identity-work, and the challenge of comparison;
   (once)-dominated and (once-)dominant groups, and their distinctive forms
   of identity change; and the interrelation of everyday, institutional and
   political processes. It argues for the need to incorporate analysis of
   everyday change in multi-levelled explanations of socio-political
   outcomes.},

Journal = {POLITICS AND GOVERNANCE},
Year = {2018},

Pages = {20-30},
Abstract = {This article aims to better understand current opposition to feminist
   politics by analyzing positions of extreme-right populist parties on
   gender knowledge, ``explicit and implicit representations concerning the
   differences between the sexes and the relations between them, the
   origins and normative significance of these, the rationale and evidence
   underpinning them and their material form{''} (Cavaghan, 2017, p. 48).
   These understandings contribute to constructing a societal truth on
   gender and/or to setting the terms of the political debate about gender
   issues. This article introduces and uses the theoretical concept of
   episteme to highlight the systematic nature of discursive institutional
   settings, and the role knowledge and truth production plays in processes
   reproducing or countering gender inequality. The article analyzes the
   positions of extreme-right populist parties in the Netherlands and their
   discursive attacks on the feminist project in the Netherlands, in which
   these opponents use a redefined concept of `cultural Marxism'. Through
   this analysis, the article illustrates the theoretical argument that
   epistemic dynamics play a strong role in opposition to feminist
   politics, that the shifting epistemic framing of science is important in
   these oppositions and that more comprehensive attention for the
   epistemic dimension is needed.},

Abstract = {Monarchy is liberalism's little secret. Given the number of articles and
   books appearing every year dealing with liberal democracy as the
   hallmark of contemporary Western societies, it is astonishing that
   monarchy is rarely ever mentioned despite the fact that monarchy, and
   not a republic, is the constitutional form of quite a number of Western
   liberal states. I argue that considering the political reality of the
   established monarchies in Europe leads into a dilemma: either
   contemporary liberalism is not the kind of theory it claims to be or it
   has to reconsider its central tenets. In conclusion, I show that the
   dilemma cannot be solved or avoided but needs to be embraced by
   conceiving liberalism not as a applied moral theory but as a political
   theory that leaves room for various symbolic self-understandings and
   acknowledges the crooked timber of historical realities.},

Journal = {CRITICAL REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL SOCIAL AND POLITICAL PHILOSOPHY},

Volume = {21},
Number = {4},
Pages = {433-455},
Abstract = {On the face of it, membership ballots present a clear case in which
   intraparty democracy comes into collision with core principles of
   representative democracy: they weaken the autonomy of representatives,
   and undermine the authority of the voters. In this article, I
   investigate whether this is correct, and whether membership ballots are,
   therefore, democratically illegitimate, using the controversial 2013
   Mitgliederentscheid in the German Social Democratic party as a critical
   case. I argue that there is nothing democratically suspect about
   membership ballots and mount a defence of intra-party democracy as
   intrinsically valuable, appealing to a principle of equal respect for
   persons as autonomous agents. It turns out that endorsing this principle
   has two possible implications: that the content of the ballot must be
   open to deliberation, and that these deliberations should be rendered
   open to non-members. I discuss these implications and offer some
   institutional design guidelines.},

Abstract = {Since the eighties several researches have advanced into the comparison
   between national models of cultural policy. Moreover, interest in
   cultural decentralization and the recognition of cultural and national
   plurality has grown parallel to the importance of regional and local
   public cultural action. However, not enough studies have been carried on
   comparing systematically the relationship between federalism models and
   models of cultural policy of a State. This work aims to fill this gap by
   performing a comparison of six federal or quasi federal countries that
   have excelled in their development of cultural policies, comparing their
   different levels of autonomy, shared government and recognition of
   different cultural and national identities States.},

Abstract = {China's five-yearly governmental restructuring has always taken place in
   lockstep with the Communist Party of China National Congress. Moreover,
   the theme of every administrative reform in the past three decades has
   complied with that of theoretical research by foreign scholars during
   the same period. The Chinese government draws lessons from theories of
   foreign public administration to explore ways to reform its practices.
   By means of evaluating the gains and losses of the Chinese government in
   the abovementioned process, this article points out that theories of
   Western public administration meet local challenges while contributing
   to China's reform practices. Through their analyses, we use China's
   practices as examples to highlight the balance between local concerns
   and global views and to suggest how scholars can better advise
   governments in the process of administrative reforms in other developing
   countries.},

Abstract = {The resurgence of South-South Cooperation (SSC) in Latin America during
   the first decade of the 21st century is linked to the transformations of
   power and the gradual reconfiguration of the systemic structures of the
   international order. After a historical-critical review of the dominant
   theoretical approaches in the discipline of International Relations and
   Development Studies, this article aims to analyze the ``South{''}
   unraveling the Eurocentric prism that crosses its analysis in the social
   sciences and examine its rise in the exercise of the foreign policy of
   the Latin American countries in three areas: a) economic and financial
   cooperation, b) regional integration, c) technical cooperation.
   The article aims to answer the following research question: why does SSC
   re-emerge in Latin America, and what spaces, agendas and policies does
   it prompt during the first decade of the 21st century? The central
   argument is that SSC brought back ``the politics{''} to question
   traditional models of development and generated spaces of consensus,
   institutions and public policies, which reflect the consolidation of a
   critical mass that reaffirms the aspirations of autonomy and defense of
   national interest of the countries.},

Abstract = {The OSCE Minsk Group was created by the Conference on Security and
   Cooperation for finding a political and peaceful resolution to the
   Nagorno-Karabakh conflict. Since its creation, the Minsk Group organized
   several meetings and initiated various proposals. However, despite its
   ``great efforts,{''} parties to the conflict have not come to an
   agreement and are still insisting on their position of `territorial
   integrity' and right of `self-determination,' therefore there has been
   no progress in the settlement of the conflict. The aim of this research
   paper is to give a general overview of the OSCE Minsk Group and
   investigate its mediation efforts, and analyze the question: Why does
   Azerbaijan accuse the OSCE Minsk Group of being biased in the settlement
   of the conflict?},

Abstract = {The study aimed at recognizing the impact of the subject of political
   science on students' awareness at Petra University. There are a grip of
   questions raised to be answered, and a sample of the study, consisted of
   (131) students had been chosen. These students were registered at three
   sections on the commencement of the academic year 2012/2013. A
   questionnaire had been organized for the sake of collecting information.
   This questionnaire leaned on (30) items and distributed. Just 87 items
   were valid and analyzed. The degree of political awareness among
   students was high at an arithmetic mean of (3.70), added to differences
   with statistical significance at the degree of the impact of political
   awareness at students due to their view and the variable of sex,
   opposite to differences of the faculty variable and its grade
   average-GPA. In the shadow of the results, the researcher recommends for
   further more studies on the very subject to disseminate the subject of
   politics at all universities which do not have this subject in their
   curriculums.},

Journal = {TURKISH POLICY QUARTERLY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {16},
Number = {4},
Pages = {131-142},
Month = {WIN},
Abstract = {Tunisia's remarkable democratization process in the wake of the Jasmine
   Revolution has not been followed by an improvement of civil liberties:
   Tunisia is still home to harsh repression on particular social
   behaviors, namely homosexuality and actions or speeches deemed insulting
   to religion. This article seeks to account for the apparent
   contradiction between the Tunisian newly free political environment and
   the socially repressive measures that persist in the country by arguing
   that the democratization of Tunisia further entrenches the repression of
   irreligious speech and of homosexuality. It highlights the coalition
   government's political disincentives in advocating against these
   restrictive measures and presents the rise of Salafi Islamism in the
   country as a factor of the unwillingness of the government to stop or
   even alleviate the violent repression of homosexuals and the severe
   sanctions against blasphemy.},

Title = {Elite polarization, party extremity, and affective polarization},
Journal = {ELECTORAL STUDIES},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {56},
Pages = {90-101},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Elites in the U.S. have become increasingly polarized over the past
   several decades. More recently, the degree to which partisans view the
   opposing party more negatively than their own - a phenomenon called
   affective, or social, polarization - has increased. How does elite
   polarization inform affective polarization? We argue that partisans
   respond to increasing levels of elite polarization by expressing higher
   levels of affective polarization, i.e. more negative evaluations of the
   opposing party relative to their own. Motivated reasoning further
   encourages partisans to blame the opposing party more than their own.
   Results from surveys collected from 1978 through 2016 provide strong
   support for our theory. We further find that increasing levels of
   political interest magnify the relationship between elite and affective
   polarization. These results produce important implications for the
   health of democratic systems experiencing high levels of elite
   polarization.},

Abstract = {American state constitutions vary tremendously in their length,
   amendment rate, and age. These three variables-especially the first
   two-strongly influence the rate at which state supreme courts strike
   down state actions for violating the state constitution. Longer, more
   detailed constitutions reduce policy flexibility, increasing judicial
   invalidations; rarely updated constitutions may fail to address modern
   concerns, increasing invalidations; and recently adopted constitutions
   may contain fragile logrolls and similar shortcomings, also increasing
   invalidations. These findings add new considerations to a rich
   literature on judicial review in state supreme courts.},

Journal = {ELECTORAL STUDIES},

Abstract = {Ukraine's 2014 parliamentary election, which took place in the aftermath
   of the Maidan revolution of February 2014 and at the height of war in
   the East of the country, appeared to produce significant party political
   realignment. In particular, support for parties that had represented the
   Russian element of the ethnolinguistic/geo-political cleavage that had
   dominated electoral competition in Ukraine since independence collapsed.
   The paper considers whether 2014 was a `critical' or `realigning'
   election for Ukraine. Our argument is that the 2014 election lacked the
   conditions that critical elections theory posits as necessary and that,
   on the contrary, there are strong theoretical reasons to expect cleavage
   stability in these volatile electoral circumstances. We offer evidence
   for this continuity drawn from surveys undertaken among Ukrainian voters
   from 1995 to 2014.},

Abstract = {Platform companies disrupt not only the economic sectors they enter, but
   also the regulatory regimes that govern those sectors. We examine Uber
   in the United States as a case of regulating this disruption in
   different arenas: cities, state legislatures, and judicial venues. We
   find that the politics of Uber regulation does not conform to existing
   models of regulation. We describe instead a pattern of ``disruptive
   regulation{''}, characterized by a challenger-incumbent cleavage, in two
   steps. First, an existing regulatory regime is not deregulated but
   successfully disregarded by a new entrant. Second, the politics of
   subsequently regulating the challenger leads to a dual regulatory
   regime. In the case of Uber, disruptive regulation takes the form of
   challenger capture, an elite-driven pattern, in which the challenger has
   largely prevailed. It is further characterized by the surrogate
   representation of dispersed actors-customers and drivers-who do not have
   autonomous power and who rely instead on shifting alignments with the
   challenger and incumbent. In its surrogate capacity in city and state
   regulation, Uber has frequently mobilized large numbers of customers and
   drivers to lobby for policy outcomes that allow it to continue to
   provide service on terms it finds acceptable. Because drivers have
   reaped less advantage from these alignments, labor issues have been
   taken up in judicial venues, again primarily by surrogates (usually
   plaintiffs' attorneys) but to date have not been successful.},

Volume = {71},

Abstract = {Despite coalition governments being the most widespread form of
   government, many aspects of coalition politics are still poorly
   understood. This is especially true for questions relating to the role
   of the prime minister party within the coalition. Being the prime
   minister party seems to imply considerable influence, but little
   evidence actually exists as to the factors shaping the influence of the
   prime minister. This paper offers a new approach to studying the factors
   conditioning the influence of the prime minister party in a coalition.
   The approach is focused on the extent of issue overlap between the party
   manifesto of the prime minister party and the first government speech
   after the election. This approach makes it possible to actually analyze
   the factors shaping the influence of the prime minister party. The
   results show that the PM party is constrained by the issue emphasis of
   its coalition partners but less so when it holds dissolution power and
   more, also when it has many coalition partners when controlling for the
   seat share of the PM party. The paper, thus, both offers a new approach
   to study the coalition compromise and new evidence on the factors
   shaping the influence coming from holding the PM position.},

Abstract = {Commentators and critics often invoke the metaphor Charter proofing to
   emphasize how much the Charter and judicial review have influenced
   legislation. This metaphor implies that proposed legislation is
   evaluated carefully for its consistency with Charter rulings as a
   condition of passage because decision makers believe legislation should
   respect judicial interpretations of constitutional norms and/or because
   they engage in risk-averse behaviour out of self-interest to minimize
   the likelihood that legislation could subsequently be challenged and
   declared unconstitutional. However, it is not clear that the federal
   government is as worried about having legislation declared invalid as
   many assume. If this is so, federal government responses to the Charter
   raise an interesting puzzle. The government has both the resources and
   the institutional capacity to anticipate judicial concerns and integrate
   judicial norms into legislation to minimize the likelihood of having
   legislation declared unconstitutional. So why does it not act in a more
   risk-averse manner at the outset, in order to protect legislation from
   the possibility of judicial invalidation? This address offers a
   five-part explanation to this puzzle that emphasizes the significance of
   political strategizing about risk. ResumeLes commentateurs et les
   critiques invoquent souvent la metaphore de la << verification de
   conformite >> pour souligner a quel point la Charte et le controle
   judiciaire ont influence la legislation. Cette metaphore implique que la
   conformite de la legislation proposee avec les decisions de la Charte
   est evaluee avec soin comme condition d'adoption, parce que les
   decideurs croient que la legislation devrait respecter les
   interpretations judiciaires des normes constitutionnelles et/ou adopter
   des comportements a risque par interet personnel afin de minimiser la
   probabilite que la legislation puisse etre contestee et declaree
   inconstitutionnelle par la suite. Cependant, il n'est pas clair si le
   gouvernement federal soit a ce point preoccupe de voir une loi declaree
   invalide comme beaucoup le supposent. Si tel est le cas, les reponses du
   gouvernement federal a la Charte soulevent un casse-tete interessant. Le
   gouvernement dispose a la fois des ressources et de la capacite
   institutionnelle necessaires pour anticiper les preoccupations
   judiciaires et integrer les normes judiciaires dans la legislation afin
   de reduire au minimum la probabilite que la legislation soit declaree
   inconstitutionnelle. Alors pourquoi n'agit-il pas d'emblee avec une plus
   grande aversion au risque afin de proteger la legislation contre la
   possibilite d'invalidation judiciaire ? Ce discours offre une
   explication en cinq parties de ce casse-tete qui met l'accent sur
   l'importance de l'elaboration de strategies politiques en matiere de
   risque.},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {How should political parties allocate resources in U.S. House elections?
   Are actual spending strategies optimal? This paper answers these
   questions by using Bayesian election forecasts to estimate a
   probabilistic voting model. The model provides real-time estimates of
   the marginal value of additional resources in a district during a
   campaign and can be used to compare actual spending patterns to the
   amount that should have been spent according to the model. The
   correlation between observed and optimal spending is over 0.5 in each
   non-redistricting year from 2000 to 2010 and observed spending patterns
   respond to new polls during a campaign. The correlations are consistent
   across different types of campaign donors including the Democratic
   Congressional Campaign Committee and the National Republican
   Congressional Committee, various political action committees, and
   individuals. There is also evidence that spending is based on maximizing
   total seats rather than the probability of winning a majority of seats.},

Abstract = {Past research suggests that people substantially overestimate the size
   of minority populations. Labeled ``innumeracy,{''} inflated estimates of
   minority populations can have a negative impact on intergroup relations
   and influence policy attitudes toward minority groups. Our research
   examines people's estimates of the gun owner population in the United
   States. We discover that people vastly overestimate gun ownership and
   similarly misjudge its future growth. Estimations of size are influenced
   by several determinants including gun ownership and affective
   orientations toward gun owners. Gun owners, compared to nongun owners,
   reported higher estimations of the gun owner population. In addition,
   positive feelings toward gun owners were associated with increased
   estimates of gun ownership. Affective orientations toward minority
   populations are in fact a key predictor neglected by prior innumeracy
   studies. Finally, estimations of the gun owner population, and judgments
   about its future growth, were both significant determinants of gun
   policy preferences.},

   to the Refugee Crisis in Poland},

Abstract = {The Polish response to the crisis that escalated across Europe in 2015,
   banning refugees from crossing its borders, has been one of the least
   welcoming in Europe. Poland has been reprimanded by the EU for its lack
   of solidarity with other countries that accepted refugees. The
   government's response was that it does indeed welcome refugees as long
   as they are not Muslims, since letting Muslim refugees in would be a
   security risk. The figure of the Muslim terrorist posing as a refugee
   has become a key trope through which xenophobic nationalist politics
   have been employed. In this sense, Poland can be seen to be drawing
   particular inspiration from the Eurosceptic politics of Orban's Hungary
   while also reflecting a broader European trend towards Islamophobia in
   countries such as France, Germany, Sweden or the UK. This article maps
   responses to refugees from key public actors. It focuses on how three
   key players in the Polish public spherethe Catholic Church, the State
   and civil society actorsresponded to the looming perspective of
   welcoming refugees to Poland. The paper argues that the Polish response
   to the so-called refugee crisis should be analysed as subtext to a
   broader political change in the country towards nationalism that has as
   its goal to push out all foreign invasion'. Mobilised within this are
   new and old manifestations of racism, suggesting that Poland's long
   history of racial Othering and exclusion has not been sufficiently
   accounted for.},

Abstract = {Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. articulated a covenant foundation for the
   United States. He called this covenant the ``Beloved Community.{''} In
   it, King described citizen obligations as the experience of divine love
   in the sacrifice of individual interests for the common good and
   personal atone. The Beloved Community operated outside the broader
   covenant tradition in American politics. Grounded in personalist
   theology, King conceived of the Beloved Community as the manifestation
   of individual persons engaging in acts of loving self-sacrifice, or
   agape. These acts provoked the national conscience to begin the legal
   and constitutional steps toward racial reconciliation. King's concept of
   agape was fundamentally Christian, as it grounded his understanding of
   the divine law that set firm moral limits to democracy. God in the
   person of Jesus was ``Lord and Master{''} in a way that renders the
   Beloved Community incompatible with contemporary efforts to fit King
   into secular democratic theory.},

Abstract = {This paper maps out the network of researchers on environmental security
   from the end of the 1980s to 2014, providing a systematic analysis of
   how the research is organized in this interdisciplinary field. Drawing
   on the Web of Science database, we generated a co-citation analysis that
   exhibits the cognitive structure of the field. Twenty interviews were
   conducted in order to uncover relationships of cooperation, rivalry and
   conflict so as to understand the structure of academic debates inside
   the field over time. The research findings highlight that central
   authors have had a long-lasting influence on the field despite the
   evolution of their productivity. We also found that the field is
   composed of six fairly structured groups as well as a few peripheral
   authors, which can in turn be distinguished by their epistemological and
   methodological choices, as well as geographical centre of gravity.},

Abstract = {The so-called chaos theorems imply that, under most preference
   configurations, majority voting in n-dimensional policy spaces is
   theoretically unrestricted. Empirical research, however, shows an
   apparent stability of democratic decisions. Recent theoretical
   developments have emphasized social preferences as a possible
   explanation for overcoming majority rule's instability problem. Hence,
   it is assumed that individuals not only maximize their own well-being,
   but also value distributional fairness. However, there is little
   experimental research into the influence of social preferences on
   majority decisions. This article presents findings from laboratory
   experiments on majority decisions in two-dimensional policy spaces with
   a systematic variation of the fairness properties of the incentive
   structures. The results show that distributional fairness is an
   important motivational factor in democratic decisions.},

   man who played a decisive role in shaping the culture and politics of
   the state-and attempts to examine the spatial tension, that is, the
   fusion and commonalities between the domestic sphere and political space
   in modern Tamil subjectivity construction and the implications it had

Abstract = {This article applies a comparative-historical analysis (critical
   junctures and multiple-orders framework) to understand how and why India
   and Pakistan chose different strategies for the management of diversity
   after partition, despite their common colonial roots. After identifying
   several strategies for the management of diversity, the article traces
   the factors which account for a predominantly group-dominant approach to
   diversity in Pakistan and an integrationist approach in India. The
   analysis highlights the relevance of structural antecedent conditions
   during colonial times: namely the accommodationist tradition within
   Congress, and the absence thereof in Pakistan (Muslim League) and the
   group-dominant legacy of the military and civil service. The comparison
   also draws attention to gradual processes of change within a dominant
   path and nuances the relevance of elections as sufficient mechanisms for
   strengthening accommodation. For elections to fulfil this
   accommodationist potential, they need to be embedded within a liberal
   constitutional framework.},

   outside Leachville, Arkansas, typing impatiently into his cell phone.
   ``I'm waiting on you,{''} he wrote. ``You coming?{''} It was hot for
   late October. The rows of soybeans, cotton, and corn, which just days
   ago had spread across much of the region, were largely gone, replaced by
   dry, flat dirt. The 2016 harvesting season was nearly over. A minute
   passed, and Wallace typed another message, sounding slightly triumphant.

Abstract = {How should we understand business interests in the welfare state when
   firms have strategic incentives to misrepresent their preferences? This
   article uses an event study to uncover firms' preferences over social
   protection. We use the stock market's response to proposed legal changes
   in employment and wage protection to test class- versus skill-based
   understandings of employer preferences. Using data from France between
   1997 and 2003, we find evidence in favor of the skill-centered approach.},

Abstract = {This article questions the currency of contemporary pipeline politics
   and diplomacy as applied in the Eurasian gas system. In doing so, it
   argues that the mosaic of proposed pipelines- notably Nord Stream 2,
   South Stream, and Turkish Stream-is out of tune with the current traits
   of global political life, namely geopolitical ruptures, changing market
   fundamentals, fuel uncertainty, and the evolving politics and economics
   of natural gas. This article provides alternative explanations for the
   still-central role of pipeline politics and diplomacy in energy politics

Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {For a number of decades now, scholars have been indicating that ties
   between citizens and parties are eroding. As a consequence, electoral
   behaviour has become more volatile and also more unpredictable. The
   consequences of this process of change on parties' strategic behaviour
   have, however, received little attention. In this article, the impact of
   dealignment on parties' strategic behaviour is examined, with the focus
   being on the extent to which parties are responsive to the mean voter.
   The expectation of dealignment allowing parties to move around more
   freely' leads to the hypothesis that parties are more responsive in a
   context of dealignment. The analyses provide evidence that is in line
   with this expectation. Ideological responsiveness is conditioned by the
   level of volatility in the electorate. The conclusion to draw from these
   results is that dealignment, which profoundly affects voters' behaviour,
   leads parties to become more responsive to the mean voter.},

Abstract = {We argue that short government durations in parliamentary democracies
   increase public spending by driving a political budget cycle. We present
   a revision of the standard political budget cycle model that relaxes the
   common (often implicit) assumption that election timing is fixed and
   known in advance. Instead, we allow cabinets to form expectations about
   their durability and use these expectations to inform their spending
   choices. The model predicts that (1) cabinets should spend more as their
   expected term in office draws to a close and (2) cabinets that outlive
   their expected duration should run higher deficits. Using data from 15
   European democracies over several decades, we show that governments
   increase spending as their expected duration withers and run higher
   deficits as they surpass their forecasted life expectancy.},

   are unlike other markets and which may make standard solutions to
   non-competitive price behaviour ineffective. New insights into decision
   making from behavioural sciences, which challenge the notion of
   rationality in many students' higher education choices, are also
   discussed. Recent research has suggested some interventions that may
   nudge students towards decisions that help achieve the objectives for
   higher education set out by the Department for Education. It is argued
   that the Department for Education might be more successful in reaching
   its objectives if it focused more on these behavioural insights and
   interventions, and less on trying to make HE function like the
   competitive market that it is not.},

Abstract = {This article focuses on ISIS followers on Twitter in an effort to
   understand the nature of their social media propaganda. The research
   study provides unique insight into one of the largest data sets that
   investigates ISIS propaganda efforts on Twitter by examining over 50
   million tweets posted by more than 8 million unique users that
   referenced the keywords ``ISIS{''} or ``ISIL.{''} The authors then
   searched this corpus for eight keywords in Arabic that included terms of
   support for ISIS and the names of different Al-Qaeda leaders. A mixed
   research method was used, and the findings indicate that ISIS activity
   on Twitter witnessed a gradual decline, but the group was still able to
   post different types of tweets to maintain its online presence. Also,
   the feud between ISIS and Al-Qaeda was intense, ongoing, and prevalent
   in online interactions among ISIS followers. The study provides an
   understanding of using big data to better grasp the propaganda
   activities of terrorist groups.},

Abstract = {Political activity is conventionally considered a constitutive feature
   of interest groups, underpinning an impressive literature on the
   strategies groups employ to exercise political influence. Whether and
   how intensely voluntary membership groups engage in political activities
   to start with, however, are rarely examined. We present a new
   incentive-theoretical perspective on group political activity,
   considering both member demands and leadership constraints. We argue
   that investments in political activities (one way of generating
   collective incentives) as a means to prevent member exit are more or
   less important depending on a group's composition. Simultaneously, the
   extent to which leaders are incentivized to cater to members' demands,
   when trying to balance these against conflicting demands, depends on
   communication channels between leaders and members and the importance of
   membership fees. Applying Bayesian ordered logit models to data from two
   group surveys supports our perspective and stresses the importance of
   considering how intraorganizational dynamics steer groups' external
   activities.},

Abstract = {When making appointments to bureaucratic positions, presidents often
   have to balance various appointee traits, including loyalty, competence,
   connections, campaign experience, and potential electoral benefit.
   Previous research has suggested that patronage appointeesoften
   characterized as those individuals appointed because of campaign
   experience, electoral benefit, or other nonpolicy political benefitstend
   to be placed in low-priority agencies whose missions are ideological
   matches to the president and in positions where they will have minimal
   effects on agency outcomes. However, this research has overlooked the
   role of agency structure and the ease with which appointees can be
   placed intoor removed fromoffice. This article focuses on agency
   decision-maker independence, or the extent to which agency structure
   limits the appointment/removal of key agency decision makers. Using data
   on individuals appointed in the first six months of the Obama
   administration, I find that presidents put fewer patronage appointees
   into agencies whose structural features promote agency decision-maker
   independence.},

   Theory of Power},
Journal = {CONFLICT STUDIES QUARTERLY},
Year = {2018},
Number = {25},
Pages = {49-67},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {The history of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) is awash with
   resistance against systemic exploitation of the country's huge mineral
   resources by foreign powers, coupled with repression of local population
   by subsequent regimes. This paper seeks to address the question as to
   why public withdrawal of consent does not necessarily cause the change
   of political power in line with the aspirations of the vast majority of
   citizens. The case study adopts an argumentative approach based on
   secondary data. The study reveals that the consent of the suffering
   masses is meaningless as far as regime change is concerned. In other
   words the survival of repressive regimes is contingent upon the
   submission of a co-opted few around the seat of power, the cooperation
   of hired agents of violence and the support of powerful multinationals
   that have vested interests in the status quo. In the light of Agency
   theory, it is argued that the success of nonviolent struggle against
   unpopular regimes depends on the astuteness of unarmed demonstrators to
   reach out to the agents of legitimate violence with an olive branch so
   as to not only bridge the distance between them but also turn them into
   partners for change. As a way forward, the study recommended a broad
   understanding of the concept of Civil-Military Relations that goes
   beyond elite framing.},

Abstract = {A core principle of liberal political theory is that citizens are owed a
   justification for public policies. But are noncitizens owed a
   justification for policies when their human rights are at stake? In this
   article, I explain what type of justification is owed to noncitizens,
   and I propose a principle for when policies must be justified. I argue
   that noncitizens have a moral human right to an actual, deliberative
   justification. Unlike other approaches, deliberative justification
   enables noncitizens to participate in justification procedures, it
   empowers them to contest public policies, and it is held in independent
   institutions. Since a concern about noncitizen justification is that
   there is no compelling standard for when policies must be justified, I
   propose a Human Rights Duty Principle. It improves upon the coercion,
   democratic origin, and all-affected interests principles for when
   justification is required.},

Abstract = {Electoral coordination is central to the creation of national party
   systems under first past-the-post rules, but there are instances where
   we see such coordination fail even at the constituency level. In this
   article, we argue that electoral coordination requires partisan control
   of patronage distribution by local bureaucracies. In electoral
   constituencies in which bureaucrats do not hold a monopoly over the
   distribution of patronage, we might see constituency-level electoral
   fragmentation. In constituencies in which the bureaucracy controls
   patronage, however, effective coordination yields Duvergerian
   equilibria. We formulate and test this argument through constituency-
   and precinct-level analysis of Pakistani elections and additional
   evidence from Indian elections.},

Abstract = {Considerations on the Principal Events of the French Revolution was
   Germaine de Stael's political testament. Published posthumously in 1818,
   the book offered a selective and provocative interpretation of the
   Revolution, making a clear distinction between the principles of 1789
   and the ideas that had made possible the Terror of 1793-94. It
   eventually came to be considered as the Bible of a new generation of
   French liberals. They embraced Stael's argument that the Revolution had
   not been an accident, as Burke and others had daimed, but had, in fact,
   been prepared by a long series of events and factors with deep
   historical roots. The essay explores the reception of Stael's book in
   liberal cirdes, with special emphasis on two prominent journals such as
   the ``Archives philosophiques, politiques et litteraires{''} and ``Le
   Globe{''}. In particular, it focuses on Francois Guizot and Charles de
   Remitsat's intellectual dialogue with Madame de Stael and her account of
   the Revolution.},

Abstract = {Using a dynamic panel approach, this article examines the determinants
   of military expenditures for 29 Asian and Oceanian countries during
   1992-2016. A two-step difference-GMM estimator is applied. Both the
   impact of Chinese and US military expenditure on sample countries'
   military budgets are considered. Results show that sample countries do
   not respond to Chinese military expenditure; however, these countries
   respond to US military expenditure. Moreover, lagged military
   expenditure, GDP, population, and trade openness are important
   determinants of military spending, while wars and regime type are not.},

Abstract = {The return of unified government following President Trump's election in
   2016 triggered fears that separation of powers could fail to rein in
   executive misconduct. However, Congress' handling of the Russia probe
   largely accords with lessons derived from analysis of more than a
   century of investigative activity. Unified government greatly blunted
   the force of the probe in the House; however, the Senate investigation
   has been more productive and comprehensive. The investigation directly
   led to sanctions legislation and contributed to the pressure to appoint
   a special counsel. More generally, it has significantly weakened
   President Trump's political position by eroding his support among the
   public.},

   have been interlinked through vigorous ocean diplomacy which helps
   strengthen their political, economic and cultural relations. Based upon

Abstract = {The diffusion of both nationalism and populism is the symptom of a
   crisis in European democracies. The convergence of nationalist ideology
   and populist rhetoric is the major challenge that the European Union
   faces today and can be effectively countered by developing the political
   project of a truly democratic and supranational union. In this article,
   I will first outline the distinctive features of nationalism and
   populism. I will then analyse the major factors fostering the rise of
   national populism in the European Union countries, and I will conclude
   by discussing its more effective alternative.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this article is to test if institutional approaches and
   legitimation-oriented explanations in comparative authoritarianism
   research can account for the differences in redistribution of income in
   autocracies. In order to address this question, the study analyses data
   on income redistribution for 122 autocracies worldwide between 1960 and
   2010. The existing literature suggests that authoritarian institutions
   and strategies of regime legitimation affect policy outputs in
   autocracies. This article develops an informal model that explains
   income redistribution as the outcome of bargaining between the dictator,
   political elites and the masses over the level of income taxation and
   social welfare expenditures. The findings of our statistical analysis
   suggest that there are substantial differences between income
   redistribution between different types of authoritarian regimes and
   their strategies of regime legitimation: Communist regimes exhibit the
   highest average income redistribution while monarchies have the lowest
   redistribution rate. However, legitimation strategies of different types
   of autocracy cannot account for the differences in social welfare
   expenditures in authoritarian regimes. In contrast, authoritarian
   political institutions explain different levels of social welfare
   expenditure in autocracies, but cannot account for the differences in
   income redistribution. Overall, institutional and legitimation-centred
   approaches contribute to a better understanding of differences in income
   redistribution between autocracies, but their explanatory power is
   limited. Therefore, the article concludes with some considerations
   concerning avenues for future research.},

Abstract = {In this article, I describe an important aspect of the intellectual
   tradition of Japanese political theory while focusing on the Japanese
   scholar Fujita Shozo's political and scholarly activities. Not
   surprisingly, he has been chiefly considered a thinker or a historian of
   ideas, due to his being a pupil of Japan's brightest political
   scientist, Maruyama Masao. It must be stressed, however, that his
   scholarly works do not confine his academic scope to their ingredients;
   they are composed of theoretical requisites for the disciplinary
   activity of political theory, as can be seen particularly in his early
   contributions. He requires his theory to constitute integral aspects of
   practice, experience and perspective on the basis of his political
   concerns and practices in terms of detachment realism. From this
   perspective, I explore how Fujita changed his primary purpose from
   criticising Japan's `Tenno system' (Tennosei) to criticising its
   `high-speed growth' (kodo seicho) by highlighting the psychological
   transformation of his self-critical and self-reflective political
   thinking and acting according to his optimistic state of `hope' (kibo)
   and his pessimistic state of `despair' (zetsubo), especially in terms of
   his early work.},

Abstract = {How may the legitimacy of rebel groups shape the decisions of
   third-party states to support insurgencies militarily? In aiming to
   better understand how the (group-level) attributes of insurgencies
   motivate interventions on their behalf, we argue that the size of rebel
   forces serves as a proxy for a revolution's perceived legitimacy within
   the international community. Specifically, we maintain that the larger
   the insurgency, the greater the insurgency's perceived legitimacy and,
   thus, the more likely intervention on its behalf becomes. This analysis
   challenges previous studies that have confined the causal salience of
   faction size to relative capabilities or strength, and it also
   underscores the controversial policy implications of this finding.},

Abstract = {Experimental research on racial attitudes examines how Whites'
   stereotypes of Black Americans shape their attitudes about the death
   penalty, violent crime, and other punitive measures. Marginally
   discussed in the race-to-crime literature are Blacks' perceptions of
   retribution and justice. We fill this void by using an original survey
   experiment of 900 Black Americans to examine how exposure to intra- and-
   intergroup violent crime shapes their policy attitudes and emotional
   reactions to crime. We find that Black Americans are more likely to
   support increased prison sentences for violent crimes when the
   perpetrator is White and the victim is Black, and reduced sentences for
   Black-on-Black crime. Our analyses further reveal that Black people
   express higher levels of anger when the victim is Black and the
   perpetrator is White; levels of shame and anger also increase in
   instances of Black-on-Black crime. Given current race relations in the
   United States, we conclude by speculating about how these emotional
   reactions might shape one's willingness to participate in the political
   arena.},

Abstract = {How is citizens' factual historical knowledge related to their national
   identity? With original data from a nationally representative survey
   experiment in China, we find that significantly more Chinese citizens
   overestimate rather than underestimate China's objective historical
   achievements, and those who overestimate the achievements of ancient
   Chinese civilization have higher levels of national identity. To an even
   greater degree, citizens who underestimate Chinese historical
   achievements have lower levels of national identity. We also find that
   correcting misinformation can potentially affect individuals' national
   identity, although the effects did not reach statistical significance,
   likely because the survey experiment was under-powered for interaction
   effects, and because our information treatment was brief and on a very
   limited number of questions. These findings shed light on the subtle
   relationships between historical knowledge, propaganda, and national
   identity, and suggest avenues for future research.},

Abstract = {Building on the understanding that a career is a dynamic concept, this
   article applies the idea that parliamentarians' legislative activities
   vary according to their career stage and age. This is partly a function
   of experience and partly a function of future career prospects. Using a
   new data set of the German Bundestag (2002-13) that pinpoints the age
   and career stage of MPs at the time of individual activities, namely,
   attending votes, posing parliamentary questions, and holding
   rapporteurships, we identify practical and normative challenges to MPs'
   legislative work: It takes time to learn the trade and as the desire for
   re-election dissipates, a last-period problem arises. MPs significantly
   reduce their activity levels toward the end of their legislative
   careers, indicating a clear loss of accountability toward their parties
   and their constituents.},

Abstract = {Perceptions of politicians' character traits have played a central role
   in models of candidate evaluation, yet existing work lacks a clear
   theoretical framework for the structure of trait perceptions. In this
   paper, I argue that, while competence looms large in the mind of voters,
   the public cares deeply about moral character (e.g., compassion). Just
   as people vary in their beliefs about right and wrong, however, they
   also vary in their views on the traits that make a good person. Across
   two studies, I show evidence of five dimensions of moral character that
   are linked to the public's moral foundations. Next, I show that moral
   character helps explain candidate favorability and perceptions of issue
   competence. Yet, unlike non-moral traits, the effects of moral character
   are politically divisive. Overall, my findings lend new insight into the
   structure of trait perceptions and how they are used by the public.},

   raced, gendered, and sexed working class of their bodily and mental
   powers. Second, discussing these thinkers' ideas in the context of the
   larger mind and body opposition revives attention to the body in
   contemporary political theory and exposes the ways in which the mind and
   body opposition serves to cover over the suffering caused by capitalism.
   Third, it shows that we must theorize the mind and body, feeling and
   thinking, as a mediated relation to grasp the ways in which particularly
   negative feelings can generate critical thinking, necessary to rebel
   against the vampire capital.},

Abstract = {I employ computer-aided simulations to reexamine the effect of district
   magnitude on disproportionality and parliament fragmentation, in
   proportional representation (PR) elections. In the simulations, I
   attempt to isolate the purely `mechanical' effects of electoral rules.
   The `psychological' effects are represented by the theoretical
   probability distribution used to simulate PR election results, and also
   by the assumption as to the number of competing parties in
   constituencies. In particular, investigating the effect of DM on the
   disproportionality versus the parliament fragmentation trade-off, I
   critically reexamine the study of Carey and Hix (2011), who argue that
   the low-magnitude constituencies (four to eight seats) achieve a `good'
   balance between representativeness (favored by low disproportionality)
   and government accountability (favored by the low-level of fragmentation
   in parliament). Even if we accept Carey and Hix's disputable
   operationalization of the representativeness-accountability trade-off,
   this study provides evidence that the claim that the low-magnitude
   electoral districts are optimal is contestable. Also, the simulation
   results suggest that Carey and Hix's analysis is confounded by the
   psychological effects; due to strategic voting, low-magnitude districts
   appear to promote greater proportionality than they actually do.},

Abstract = {This article examines the importance of new public management in
   environmental governance. In order to explain what makes new public
   management such a robust framework for environmental governance, the
   article draws on the key themes of individual and collective
   responsibility in responding to climate change, examining the role of
   new public management in response to ecological and environmental
   change, resource scarcity, focus on global energy sources and politics.
   The article discusses the role of three aspects of environmental
   governance in turn: the theoretical understandings relating to
   individuals and society in response to climate change, the politics of
   these responses and governance arrangements, and how these are formed by
   the hastening paucity of certain energy resources. The article then
   moves on to examine these themes in the context of new public
   management, arguing that the responses we see to climate change in
   environmental governance are driven by measurement and targets, as these
   can be universally set and communicated. This shows the enduring nature
   of new public management in political and policy responses to the
   challenges of climate change. Bradshaw B (2014) Global Energy Dilemmas.

Abstract = {Consensual-pluralistic institutional features of representative
   democracies have traditionally been associated with satisfaction with
   democracy (SWD). However, more recent studies report contradictory
   results on the effects of some of these institutional determinants on
   SWD. This article confirms these puzzling findings by showing that
   electoral proportionality increases SWD while other pluralistic factors
   such as government fractionalization produce the opposite effect. We
   illustrate this duality of counteracting effects by expanding the number
   of cases under study to different regions of the world in a
   comprehensive time-series cross-sectional sample of 58 democracies
   between 1990 and 2012. In the second part of the paper, we are able to
   reconfirm these findings at the individual level by employing survey
   data from the Comparative Study of Electoral Systems.},

Abstract = {The evolution of Taiwan's political economy seems paradoxical. From the
   1960s to 1980s, Taiwan went through economic transformations that have
   been called an economic miracle. This was followed by a successful
   democratic transition from the late 1980s to mid-1990s that might be
   considered a political miracle. In the early 1990s, Taiwan could be
   regarded as a success story and a model for developing nations. Yet,
   Taiwan was soon to enter troubled waters marked by growing conflict and
   threat from China (PRC), fears about the hollowing out of its previously
   vaunted economy, and vicious polarization and gridlock in its domestic
   politics. We argue that many of the challenges facing Taiwan derive from
   unanticipated and unintended costs of its previous successes. In
   particular, what worked to promote successful economic and political
   development at one point later became counterproductive in the changed
   circumstances created by the country's rapid developmental trajectory.
   Our basic research questions, hence, are whether the challenges
   currently facing Taiwan's political economy can be explained by the
   country's past pattern of development and, if so, whether these linkages
   appear to be connected to success or failures in Taiwan's history.},

Abstract = {On the face of it, self-censorship is profoundly subversive of
   democracy, particularly in its talk-centric forms, and undermines the
   culture of openness and publicity on which it relies. This paper has two
   purposes. The first is to develop a conception of self-censorship that
   allows us to capture what is distinctive about the concept from a
   political perspective and which allows us to understand the democratic
   anxiety about self-censorship: if it is not obvious that biting our
   tongues is always wrong, we need a fuller account of the moral
   sensibility that finds it so troubling and this is elaborated here. The
   second is to develop an argument to the effect that this sensibility
   should not have the last, or only, word, but instead that
   self-censorship should be viewed as an `ordinary vice' of democratic
   societies. The grounds for tolerating it rest on the democratic values
   that critics believe it threatens.},

Abstract = {Authoritarian governments often impose crude and heavy-handed propaganda
   messages on society. Is such hard propaganda effective in sustaining
   authoritarian rule? With an original survey experiment featuring
   messages from China's ongoing propaganda campaign, this study finds that
   hard propaganda can backfire and worsen citizens' opinions of the
   regime, while at the same time signaling the state's power and reducing
   citizens' willingness to protest. Thus, hard propaganda can deter
   dissent and help maintain regime stability in the short term, but it can
   also decrease regime legitimacy and aggravate the government's long-term
   prospects, especially when its power and control capacity do not keep up
   with propaganda.},

Abstract = {The paper evaluates the Rapid Deployment Capability (RDC) of the African
   Standby Force (ASF) in post - Road Map III after 2015, viz-a-viz its'
   mandate as the mechanism for regional Peace Support Operations (PSOs).
   The ASF failed to respond timeously to Malian and Central African
   Republic (CAR) conflicts in 2013 and this led to the formation of
   African Capacity for Immediate Response to Crises (ACIRC) as an interim
   RDC mechanism till 2015. The study is grounded on the theory of
   Collective Security. It adopts Case Study Research Design. Data are
   generated from both primary and secondary sources. Primary data are
   generated from Open-end interview, using purpose sampling method and
   secondary data involve the review of extant literature. Data are
   presented qualitatively on tables and analysed, using Content Analysis
   techniques. The study discusses the uniformity and differences in the
   generation of the ASF's RDC in the management of Burundian and Gambian
   conflicts of 2015 and 2017 respectively. It reveals the factors which
   led to these differences in outcome, specifically the role of
   `democratic density' and `competitive democratic security community' and
   their impacts on conflict resolution in Africa. The study concludes that
   the RDC of the ASF is needed for robust regional security in Africa and
   recommends pragmatic and sustainable funding of the mechanism, as well
   as the creation of `security communities' through shared democratic
   values across the continent.},

Abstract = {Students of American politics are indebted to Richard Fenno's
   path-breaking work, Home Style, published four decades ago. But, given
   the book's widespread acclaim, few have taken Fenno's prescription to go
   back home with members of Congress to heart. In this essay, I echo
   Fenno's call for scholars to become participant-observers of the
   political process while offering the modern ``soaker and poker{''} a
   guide to the pitfalls and opportunities of pursuing such a research
   project. I respond to Fenno's methodological treatise, written as the
   appendix to Home Style, focusing in particular on gaining access and how
   to remain publicly engaged while observing a competitive Senate
   campaign. I discuss how changes in American political culture create
   additional wrinkles for participant observation that must be considered,
   especially if scholars chose to remain engaged in public outreach. I
   conclude by addressing the need to consider carefully the ethics of
   engaging the political world we study, particularly in the light of the
   Stanford-Dartmouth experiment scandal rocking Montana in the weeks
   preceding the state's 2014 judicial elections. We may not all do
   participant observation, but we should follow Fenno when considering the
   implications of interfering in the political world as we study it.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF POLITICS},

Volume = {80},
Number = {3},
Pages = {996-1010},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {This article offers an additional explanation for why corrupt
   politicians survive democratic elections. I argue that, unlike other
   electoral issues, corruption possesses some specificities that make it
   an issue that voters tend to believe politicians are particularly
   incompetent to deal with. When voters believe corruption to be a
   constant among candidate options, they are likely to overlook this
   aspect of government performance, basing their vote on other concerns.
   This attitude is particularly prevalent when corruption is more
   pervasive, which leads to the prediction that accountability for
   corruption will be weaker when it is needed the most. This study relies
   on a multimethod approach that brings together data from Brazil and a
   broader set of countries. This article helps one to understand why
   corrupt governments go unpunished and informs efforts to curb this
   problem.},

Abstract = {We use plausibly exogenous variation in the availability of the Russian
   analog television signal in Ukraine to study how a media source with a
   conspicuous political agenda impacts political behavior and attitudes.
   Using highly disaggregated election data and an original survey, we
   estimate that Russian television substantially increased average
   electoral support for parties and candidates with a ``pro-Russian{''}
   agenda in the 2014 presidential and parliamentary elections. Evidence
   suggests that this effect is attributable to persuasion rather than
   differential mobilization. The effectiveness of biased media varied in a
   politically consequential way: Its impact was largest on voters with
   strong pro-Russian priors but was less effective, and to some degree
   even counter-effective, in persuading those with strong pro-Western
   priors. Our finding suggests that exposing an already polarized society
   to a biased media source can result in even deeper polarization.},

   concretizing the constitutional duty to provide a differentiated
   treatment for micro-enterprises and small businesses, they currently
   have numerous benefits in the contests as provided by Complementary Law
   123/2006, which allows them a concrete advantage in comparison with
   Other legal entities. Complementary Law No. 147/2014, by modifying part
   of Complementary Law 123/2006, created the margin of preference for
   micro or small local or regional companies, which also expressed concern
   for the promotion of local socioeconomic development Or regional.
   However, at Federal level, Federal Decree No. 8538/2015 in regulating
   said margin of preference misrepresented the meaning of the legal
   provision, incurring in illegality when the regulation.},

Abstract = {Between the government of Mexico and the press they built a relationship
   of interdependence during the 20th century. Its foundation was the
   corporate state and the figures of the President of the Republic, the
   Secretary of the Interior and the Partido Revolucionario Institucional.
   The control over the press was exercised through legal mechanisms such
   as the Constitution of 1917 (Article 6 and 7), the Stamp Act and the
   operation of the Production and Paper Importing Company. In this article
   we ask ourselves through the historical-critical method, if there were
   other control mechanisms such as the celebration of Press Freedom Day on
   June 7 from 1951 and to what extent journalists assumed it as an
   opportunity to Ingratiate yourself with the government, and the latter
   as a stage to remind you that your freedom was limited.},

Abstract = {This paper presents the results of a research regarding the mobilization
   of govenmental machinery for applying the pollution regulation through
   the Biopower's notion proposed by Michel Foucalt. From this perspective,
   the focus turns to the concrete political power practices, which allows
   to overcome the simplistic conclusions of an adequate but unfulfilled
   environmental regulation in Mexico. By focusing on environmentaly
   harmful conducts, it is possible to understand how public policy
   instruments are applied. After exposing this research focus, two
   empirical cases are described. Some considerations regarding the
   relations between government and governed in respect of pollution
   regulation are posed.},

Abstract = {There has been a long-held view since the Federalist Papers that the
   lower the level of government, the greater is the extent of capture by
   vested interests. Relying on the analytical framework of relative
   capture, I challenge this assumption by arguing that interest groups
   have different incentives and capacities to capture different levels of
   government. I test the theory by investigating how judges at different
   judicial levels adjudicate corporate lawsuits in China. Exploiting a
   quasi-experiment in which the Supreme People's Court dramatically raised
   the threshold for entering higher level courts in 2008, I show that
   privately owned enterprises are more likely to win in lower level
   courts, and state-owned enterprises are more likely to win in higher
   level courts. I then employ qualitative interviews to explore the
   mechanisms behind them. The findings challenge an underlying assumption
   in the decentralization literature and have important policy
   implications for countries that are trapped in
   centralization/decentralization cycles.},

Abstract = {Usually pictured in relations of opposition, political parties are
   sometimes inclined to make alliances. This article examines the ethical
   questions such arrangements give rise to. It considers first the formal
   characteristics of an alliance as a distinctive form of association,
   moving on to examine what reasons for alliance are good reasons.
   Intrinsic arguments that invoke epistemic or democratic criteria, and
   instrumental arguments that cite areas of shared programme or imperfect
   institutions, are weighed in turn, with the latter judged to be more
   consistent with the partisan ethos. The final section examines the
   normative standards to which alliances should be held once formed.},

Abstract = {Contemporary scholarship on intra-party democracy pays a great deal of
   attention to aggregative procedures like primaries or membership ballots
   but widely ignores deliberative procedures within parties. This article
   begins by highlighting why scholars should care about deliberation
   within parties, discussing several functions intra-party deliberation is
   said to serve in the democratic theory literature. It then goes on to
   explore the deliberative credentials of political discussion between
   party members, drawing on group interviews with party members in two
   Social Democratic parties in Germany and Austria. Two issues are
   investigated: the preconditions for deliberation among party members and
   their justificatory patterns. The results of the analysis suggest that
   parties can be genuine vehicles of deliberation, and thus point towards
   a research programme on intra-party democracy that differs quite starkly
   from that which prevails.},

Abstract = {This article examines politics of memory on the Second World War and its
   aftermath in contemporary Serbia, focusing on the people executed or
   sentenced after the war and their framing. Discussing the dominant
   narratives and institutional and legal frameworks of official memory
   politics, the first part of the paper is concerned with the dynamics
   between different mnemonic agents, including non-state actors. Namely,
   commemorations and memorials dedicated to victims of communism come from
   below, from the groups considering the state efforts in this sphere
   insufficient. They are, however, supported by some political actors, the
   church, and Karadordevic family. Finally, the paper looks at the
   perception of Bleiburg commemorations in media and political discourses
   in Serbia, placing it in the context of relations between the two
   countries concerning the memory of the war and its aftermath. As opposed
   to very similar tendencies in Croatia and Serbia, the political actors
   are concerned with their own victims respectively, framing them as the
   victims of communism. At the same time, the commemorations and
   rehabilitations happening in the other country are never acknowledged
   but condemned.},

Abstract = {Constraints on resources, staff, facilities, and other features of the
   multidimensional problems of the cultivation, production, trafficking,
   and use of illicit drugs (or drug-related activities) in Afghanistan
   require many organizations to work together. The advantages of this
   cooperation include effectively and efficiently combating this
   multidimensional phenomenon. Addressing this, this paper examines the
   patternized interactions among counternarcotics stakeholders in the
   collaborative process of combating drugs in Afghanistan based on a
   typology of network governance: shared governance network, lead
   organization-governed network, and network administrative organization.
   This study reveals that counternarcotics policies are implemented in
   vast networks including governmental, nongovernmental and international
   actors in the form of multilevel and multisectoral governance across
   seven types of counternarcotics activities, comprising influence in
   decision making, information and advice seeking, collaboration, resource
   sharing, funding provision, and goal congruence. This research also
   improves our understanding of network governance, in which
   counternarcotics stakeholders are actually collaborating within several
   distinct networks across different areas of counternarcotics activities
   in Afghanistan.},

   Government Communication in a Personalised Media Landscape},

Abstract = {This article explores how personalisation, blame avoidance and
   institutional constraints collide in contemporary government
   communication practices. Based on ethnographic fieldwork in a Norwegian
   ministry, it analyses how a central government agency manages the media
   during critical news campaigns featuring individuals suffering from
   inadequate public health services. To provide a comprehensive analysis
   of the particular limits and aims of government communication, the
   article combines perspectives from public agency studies with media
   research on personalisation. It finds that the need to be visible and
   demonstrate agency in the media drive personalisation strategies towards
   a strong focus on government leaders, while simplifying the
   representation of complex government organisation and processes. At the
   same time, institutional constraints and the formal delegation of
   responsibility limit the communication repertoire available for public
   agencies when critical human interest stories dominate in the media.
   This results in a standard type of unconvincing media performance, where
   incumbents appear to evade direct personal responsibility. The case
   study provides new knowledge on dilemmas, negotiations and strategies
   behind government communication, illuminating how competing interests
   play out in a rapidly changing media landscape.},

Abstract = {As the world's largest greenhouse gas emitter, China has been a key
   party in global climate negotiation. External perceptions of China's
   role in climate negotiation are significant for China's domestic
   policy-making process and international climate efforts. Based on the
   case studies of two most historic climate talks, the Copenhagen and
   Paris climate conferences, this article attempts to examine the
   evolution of external perceptions on China's role in international
   climate negotiation by three criteria: acceptability, credibility and
   constructiveness. The study shows that external perceptions of China's
   role in international climate talks have changed considerably since
   2009. At the Copenhagen conference, China was regarded as a ``dead
   weight{''} or even a ``wrecker,{''} though it managed to attain most of
   its negotiating goals. At the Paris conference, however, China was
   widely recognized as a global climate leader whose endeavor was
   indispensable for the conclusion of the Paris Agreement.},

Abstract = {Diaspora engagement has increasingly been adopted as a strategy for
   leveraging migration's development potential. While a rich literature
   accounts for the emergence of diaspora engagement institutions, there is
   less research on how these institutions perform in practice and why they
   change over time. This article compares change across diaspora
   ministries in Croatia and Serbia from 1990 to 2015. It was found that
   institutional change was driven by conflict between parties and within
   parties rather than by the state's collective economic or geopolitical
   interests.},

Abstract = {A persistent question in the literature on policy adoption and diffusion
   focuses on the ways in which jurisdictions gather policy information.
   Decades of research have offered numerous conclusions regarding
   knowledge transfer mechanisms assumed to drive diffusion. While
   important, we suggest that the characteristics of existing work may have
   limited what we know about the exchange of policy information among
   peers. Most studies infer learning indirectly, and as a result, the
   literature has tended to focus on exchange between geographic and
   ideological peers, to the exclusion of other channels. As an
   alternative, this study takes a more direct approach and draws on a
   survey of 112 U.S. expert informants in the area of energy policy. We
   use the information exchange channels revealed by these informants to
   predict the diffusion of state renewable portfolio standards and
   electricity deregulation among the American states to determine whether

Abstract = {This article, based overwhelmingly on primary sources produced by the
   Yugoslav State Security Service, provides a historical overview of their
   work with respect to the commemorations at Bleiburg. It summarizes the
   stance of the Yugoslav State Security Service towards Croat emigres by
   focusing on the concrete measures and the entire spectrum of available
   methods undertaken by the Service in conjunction with the
   commemorations. After a general summary of the work of the Yugoslav
   security services with respect to emigres, the article provides detailed
   examination of two events separated by two decades (1966 and 1985). The
   1966 commemoration was notable not only because it was the year in which
   the emigres purchased a plot of land in Bleiburg, but also because the
   aftermath of that year's commemoration was marred by a bomb attack. The
   second case is the fortieth anniversary commemoration in 1985, which was
   perceived by both the agents of the Yugoslav state and the emigres
   themselves as being particularly important. Together the two cases
   provide insight into the Yugoslav State Security Service's long-term
   operation aimed at curtailing and suppressing Croat emigre activity. The
   article shows that even though the Yugoslav State Security Service was
   willing to use violent means in this struggle, the preferred means
   remained infiltration, disinformation, provocation, and constant
   surveillance.},

Abstract = {Law Number 31 of 2002 regarding Political Parties provides authority to
   the Minister of Law and Human Rights to register changes in the
   leadership of political parties was previously intended as a state
   administrator in the field of law and politics. The problem arises when
   the authority given in 2002 slowly shifted to become a government tool
   to obtain the support of political parties which is very dangerous for
   democracy and parties' independency. Settlement of political parties'
   leadership conflict is an integral part of the registration of political
   parties' leadership therefore an ideal dispute settlement model is
   needed. This paper is the result of a research on the Court judgments in
   the dispute of political parties' leadership. Ultimately this paper
   offers a One Roof Political Judgment Concept where one justice agency is
   empowered with an overall authority starting from the authority to
   examine the properness of the political party leadership at the central
   level and the Official decision regarding changes in the political
   party's leadership at the central level by Bawaslu. During all this time
   the General Election Supervisory Agency (Bawaslu) itself has acted as
   quasi justice given the authority to adjudicate all issues of the
   general election involving political parties. Bawaslu itself consist of
   professionals in the field of general election which are not affiliated
   to the political parties and controlled by the Election Advisory Board
   (DKPP). Through this model Political parties, KPU and Bawaslu shall
   become a sub-sub system of the political justice system in Indonesia.},

Abstract = {Why has the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partisanship met with
   strong public resistance among some Europeans and in some European Union
   member states, but not in others? This article argues that one important
   perspective to explain the pattern of support for TTIP is the role of
   heuristic opinion formation and issue attention. Analysing multiple
   waves of Eurobarometer data, I find that views of the two treaty
   partners, the US and the European Union, shape attitudes towards TTIP
   and that the largely post-materialist concerns over TTIP resonated
   specifically in those European countries whose citizens' attention was
   less focused on economic issues. In showing how opinions towards
   concrete real-world trade policy proposals are shaped by the political
   context, these findings complement previous research on citizens'
   general stances towards trade.},

Abstract = {This article explains why Mexican drug cartels went to war in the 1990s,
   when the federal government was not pursuing a major antidrug campaign.
   We argue that political alternation and the rotation of parties in state
   gubernatorial power undermined the informal networks of protection that
   had facilitated the cartels' operations under one-party rule. Without
   protection, cartels created their own private militias to defend
   themselves from rival groups and from incoming opposition authorities.
   After securing their turf, they used these militias to conquer rival
   territory. Drawing on an original database of intercartel murders, 1995
   to 2006, we show that the spread of opposition gubernatorial victories
   was strongly associated with intercartel violence. Based on in-depth
   interviews with opposition governors, we show that by simply removing
   top- and midlevel officials from the state attorney's office and the
   judicial policethe institutions where protection was forgedincoming
   governors unwittingly triggered the outbreak of intercartel wars.},

Abstract = {Political conservatism in India is usually associated with right-wing
   traditionalist positions infused with religion, or with forms of
   economic liberal conservatism, the kind of which the Swatantra Party
   briefly incarnated. This article asks if the notion of conservatism can
   be useful to study non-Hindu right parties, by considering the
   trajectory of the Samajwadi Party, in the state of Uttar Pradesh (UP).
   Born out of the socialist tradition, the Samajwadi Party spearheaded the
   struggle for reservations, secularism and the quest of power of the
   middle peasantry, in the early 1990s. It gradually transformed into a
   family holding associated with caste preferentialism, cronyism and the
   criminalization of politics. This article seeks to account for these
   transformations by examining the party's trajectory since its origins,
   its ideological underpinnings and the evolution of its sociological
   composition, placed in the context of changing electoral politics in UP.},

Journal = {AMERICAN POLITICAL THOUGHT},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {7},
Number = {3},
Pages = {432-463},
Month = {SUM},
Abstract = {The Social Gospel has been primarily framed through the critique
   articulated by Reinhold Niebuhr, which cast the movement as
   theologically utopian and politically naive. Defenders of the Social
   Gospel contend that the movement demonstrated the vital role of religion
   in providing moral resources for political action. Departing from the
   epistemic (or excarnational) model of religion underlying both these
   positions, I interpret Social Gospel theologian Walter Rauschenbusch as
   providing an incarnational conception of religion that foregrounds the
   embodied dimensions of faith that are crucial in the constitution of
   political subjects. I argue that the Social Gospel situates Christian
   faith as political praxis so that piety is realized through democratic
   engagement and social transformation. This practice of faith is
   cultivated not simply by beliefs but by liturgical practices. The
   recovery of this framework reveals a heterodox tradition of Christian
   thought that resists the privatized vision of religion inherited from
   liberal secularism.},

Abstract = {Read throughout the world, H. G. Wells was one of the most famous
   political thinkers of the early twentieth century. During the first half
   of the 1900s, he elaborated a bold and idiosyncratic cosmopolitan
   socialist vision. In this article, I offer a new reading of Wells's
   political thought. I argue that he developed a distinctive pragmatist
   philosophical orientation, which he synthesized with his commitments to
   Darwinian evolutionary theory. His pragmatism had four main components:
   a nominalist metaphysics; a verificationist theory of truth; a Jamesian
   ``will to believe{''}; and a conception of philosophy as an intellectual
   exercise dedicated to improving practice. His political thought was
   shaped by this philosophical orientation. Wells, I contend, was the most
   high-profile pragmatist political thinker of the opening decades of the
   twentieth century. Acknowledging this necessitates a re-evaluation of
   both Wells and the history of pragmatism.},

Abstract = {Using evidence from Great Britain, the United States, Belgium and Spain,
   it is demonstrated in this article that in integrated and divided
   nations alike, citizens are more strongly attached to political parties
   than to the social groups that the parties represent. In all four
   nations, partisans discriminate against their opponents to a degree that
   exceeds discrimination against members of religious, linguistic, ethnic
   or regional out-groups. This pattern holds even when social cleavages
   are intense and the basis for prolonged political conflict. Partisan
   animus is conditioned by ideological proximity; partisans are more
   distrusting of parties furthest from them in the ideological space. The
   effects of partisanship on trust are eroded when partisan and social
   ties collide. In closing, the article considers the reasons that give
   rise to the strength of partyism' in modern democracies.},

Title = {More Than a Score: Interest Group Ratings and Polarized Politics},
Journal = {STUDIES IN AMERICAN POLITICAL DEVELOPMENT},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {32},
Number = {1},
Pages = {49-78},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {This article examines the origins and influence of ideological index
   scoreswhere liberal and conservative interest groups rate legislator
   performance on selected roll call votes. Two such groups founded in the
   mid-twentieth centurythe Americans for Democratic Action (ADA) and the
   Americans for Constitutional Action (ACA)were crucial to the development
   of this type of metric, transforming roll call analysis from detailed
   tabular scorecards into streamlined percentage scores showing how often
   a lawmaker voted right. ADA and ACA scores have been heavily utilized in
   political science as proxies for liberalism and conservatism and used to
   demonstrate the growing polarization of the congressional parties.
   Archival evidence suggests, however, that those scores were intended to
   create the very phenomenon they have been used to measure. They were
   deeply political rather than objective metrics, which the ADA and ACA
   used to guide their electoral activities in accordance with an
   increasingly partisan strategic plan. Each group directed campaign
   resources toward incumbent lawmakers they rated highly, but they did so
   unevenlywith the ADA favoring liberal Democrats over Republicans and the
   ACA showing a preference for conservative Republicans over time. By
   rewarding favored lawmakers in their preferred party, and using scores
   to highlight and discourage ideological outliers, they hoped to reshape

Abstract = {Many political phenomenafrom wars to elections and lobbyinginvolve
   winner-take-all contests in which the value of the prize differs across
   the actors involved and from one issue to the next. To better understand
   competitive behavior in such environments, we conduct a controlled
   laboratory experiment in which participants face a series of asymmetric
   prize values in a lottery contest game. We find support for some, but
   not all, of the game's comparative static predictions. Most subjects
   respond to changes in their own values, but few subjects conditionally
   respond to cross-player changes. We also administer two
   information-based treatmentsfeedback and a calculatorfinding that
   feedback on past play has a stronger effect on decreasing socially
   wasteful effort than a payoff calculator. Our data suggest a new type of
   heterogeneity in the degree of strategic sophistication, one that
   differs from the existing models of iterated reasoning.},

Abstract = {A common denominator of recent proposals suggested by political realists
   has been a rather pessimistic view of what we may rightfully demand of
   political authorities in terms of legitimacy. In our analysis, three
   main justificatory strategies are utilized by realists, each supposedly
   generating normative premises for this low bar conclusion. These
   strategies make use of the concept of politics, the constitutive
   features of politics, and feasibility constraints, respectively. In this
   article, we make three claims: first, that the two justificatory
   strategies of utilizing the concept of politics and the constitutive
   features of politics fail, since they rely on implausible normative
   premises; second, that while the feasibility strategy relies on
   reasonable premises, the low bar conclusion does not follow from them;
   third, that relativist premises fit better with the low bar conclusion,
   but that this also makes the realist position less attractive and casts
   doubt on several of its basic assumptions.},

Abstract = {To give Information Technology (IT) a more central role in an
   organization and avoid disrupting the existing executive team power
   balance, Chief Information Officers (CIOs) should only leverage their
   power in certain situations. We propose CIOs can leverage their expert,
   prestige, and structural power attributes to influence the
   social-intellectual alignment relationship versus the social-operational
   alignment relationship in unique ways. Analyzing data collected from 140
   CIOs, the results suggest IT knowledge strengthens the social-strategic
   alignment relationship, business knowledge and structural power weaken
   the social-intellectual alignment relationship, and prestige power has
   no impact on the social-strategic alignment relationship. Implications
   of these findings are discussed.},

Title = {The Clash of Rights: Explaining Attitudes toward a Religious Exemption
   to the HHS Contraception Mandate},

Abstract = {In recent years, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS)
   contraception mandate associated with the Patient Protection and
   Affordable Care Act (ACA) has been a contentious issue that has created
   clash-of-rights claims between advocates of reproductive freedom and
   advocates of religious freedom. Americans differ considerably in their
   views toward whether religiously affiliated institutions that object to
   the use of contraceptives should be granted an exemption to the HHS
   contraception mandate. This article explores the determinants of
   Americans' support for or opposition to the religious exemption. We
   focus particularly on the effects of individuals' religious
   orientations, gender, and political attitudes that generate support for
   competing rights claims. Using data from a 2012 Pew Research Center
   survey, we (surprisingly) find little evidence of a gender effect.
   Rather, we find that support for the religious exemption is driven
   largely by church attendance and moral conservatism, with adherence to
   specific religious traditions having relatively minor effects. We also
   find that support for the religious exemption to the HHS contraception
   mandate is influenced by political variables (i.e., partisanship and
   ideology, attitudes toward President Obama, and Tea Party support) and
   demographic attributes (i.e., number of children in a given household,
   racial/ethnic identity, education, and age). We conclude that the clash
   of values over the contraception mandate is driven largely by religion
   and political attitudes.},

Abstract = {We propose a method for decomposing variation in the issue preferences
   that US citizens express on surveys into three sources of variability
   that correspond to major threads in public opinion research. We find
   that, averaging across a set of high-profile US political issues, a
   single ideological dimension accounts for about 1/7 of opinion
   variation, individuals' idiosyncratic preferences account for about 3/7,
   and response instability for the remaining 3/7. These shares vary
   substantially across issue types, and the average share attributable to
   ideology doubles when a second ideological dimension is permitted. We
   also find that (unidimensional) ideology accounts for almost twice as
   much response variation (and response instability is substantially
   lower) among respondents with high, rather than low, political
   knowledge. Our estimation strategy is based on an ordinal probit model
   with random effects and is applicable to other data sets that include
   repeated measurements of ordinal issue position data.},

Abstract = {This article focuses on the complex intellectual formative process of
   Jose Carlos Mariategui. The aim is to discover the ideas underlying this
   process during his stay in Italy, identify his intellectual referents
   and how they influenced his political thinking. Mariategui resided in
   Italy from 1919 to 1923, a period which can be considered key years for
   the recent history of Italy as the country saw the creation of the
   Italian Communist Party contemporary to the rise of the Fascist
   movement. My methodological approach will be firstly investigating what
   I call the ``stone age{''} of Mariategui, or his youthful phase
   characterized by his attraction towards decadence literary and a first
   introduction to the political and social problems of Peruvian society.
   Then I will analyze Mariategui's ideas and points of view on the
   political, intellectual, and cultural protagonists of the Italian life
   of the time. Finally, I will focus on the intellectual inheritance of
   Mariategui, taking into account five main intellectuals (Labriola,
   Croce, Gobetti, Gramsci and Tilgher) who -in a different way, influenced
   the thinking and the intellectual universe of the Peruvian Marxist.},

Abstract = {Since the beginning of the Syrian Civil War in 2011, approximately five
   million refugees have fled their homeland. By 2017, Germany had accepted
   over half a million refugees from Syria; in stark contrast, the U.S. had
   allowed approximately 10,000 Syrian refugees to enter. What are the
   factors that explain why some countries are more open to refugees than
   others? This article compares German and U.S. responses to the Syrian
   refugee crisis, placing the differing responses in their historical,
   cultural, political, and institutional contexts. While acknowledging
   that proximity matters, the authors argue that several other factors are
   more important to explain the gulf between the German and U.S. response.
   One key variable is the extent to which policy-making is embedded in an
   international context. Given the fact that Germany's refugee policy is
   couched within the EU, it is less volatile and more likely to reflect
   international norms. This applies, contrary to first impression, to
   chancellor Merkel's open door policy of September 2015 as well. By
   contrast, U.S. refugee policy is more subject to political interests and
   trends. In addition, the critical juncture literature is applied to
   explain how the U.S. has, after the 9/11/2001 attacks, dramatically
   altered refugee policy to reflect public opinion and public concerns
   about national security.},

Abstract = {This essay addresses the relationship linking Canada's Indian
   Residential School saga with the Truth and Reconciliation Commission and
   the United Nations' Genocide Convention. It sets the Canadian experience
   in a broader context, investigating the treatment of marginalized
   peoples in national and international environments dominated by the
   unwritten conventions of victors' justice. From the era of the Nuremberg
   and Tokyo tribunals, the full weight of international law falls
   disproportionately on the losing side of major conflicts. Those who
   commit crimes against humanity on the side of triumphant power are
   usually put behind shields of impunity, and this propensity sets the
   framework for the contained domestic handling of the international crime
   of genocide in Canada. This justiciable genocide took place historically
   through the forced removal of Aboriginal children from their biological
   families with clear intent to terminate First Nations as distinct
   peoples. The Indian Residential Schools were one part of a larger
   complex of enforced laws and policies including the effort to
   enfranchise schooled Indian adults as regular Canadian citizens bereft
   of Aboriginal and treaty rights.},

Abstract = {The majority party dominates legislative outputs and throughputs in
   rule-driven institutions, but these agenda-setting powers may not extend
   to other facets of the policy process. This article assesses the
   minority party's ability to influence majority party issue attention in
   the US House of Representatives by analyzing one-minute speeches given
   on the House floor. This new measure of partisan issue attention
   highlights how the parties focus on the same policy issues in the same
   relative proportions, rather than crafting divergent issue agendas. Time
   series analysis indicates gaps between the parties' level of attention
   to particular issues result in corresponding changes to majority party
   attention, which suggests the minority party can influence majority
   party issue attention by placing more emphasis on specific policy
   issues.},

Abstract = {Record collection and record preservation have direct consequences for
   survivors and often determine the efficacy of the production of genocide
   memory. Currently, there are increased restrictions that limit our
   access to evidence and threaten long-term preservation of records. This
   article will focus on the recent decision to permanently destroy
   Independent Assessment Process files within fifteen years. These records
   contain personal disclosures of serious abuses and their destruction
   reflects an uneasy precedent with record conservation. While
   institutions strive to protect the privacy and safety of survivors and
   respect the use of their information, there are concerns that the state,
   churches and organizations obscure memory through the use or misuses of
   records or use the terms of privacy to protect themselves. This paper
   will draw on examples of conflicts within access, privacy, respect, and
   memory that inevitably contribute or detract from efforts in
   reconciliation or transitional justice.},

Abstract = {The conducted longitudinal research (1999-2016) about young, educated
   examinees' perception on changes in typical women and men roles showed a
   high degree of egalitarism in the Croatian public sphere, controlled by
   different kinds of profession and role characteristics. On the other
   hand, in the private sphere, it was shown that women today have an even
   more difficult role in the family than before - women again play their
   traditional roles, such as taking care of children and the elderly,
   taking them to doctors, taking part in parents' meetings in schools. Men
   tend to help them in their housework, but participate less in activities
   connected to children, their education and upbringing. This increases
   men's chance in employment and professional development. Consequently,
   women still dominantly spend their free time on family matters and
   taking care of their personal appearance, unlike men, who spend their
   free time mostly on themselves. Although typical modern family and
   egalitarian relations are still an ideal for the young, the practice is
   a bit different than in 1999. The continuation of cumulating roles for
   women, the modern and traditional ones, without redistribution, raises
   the question whether traditional understandings or ``traditionalities of
   necessity{''} are strengthened in response to leaving the responsibility
   for organization of family life exclusively to individuals.},

Abstract = {That the state and the people are antonyms of American political thought
   is a widely held assumption. This essay argues that it is a
   mistakeAmericans early in their thinking about politics distinguished
   the state from government and defined the state as the people
   themselves. Building on a deep reservoir of political thought pioneered
   by seventeenth-century theorists, Americans believed that to raise
   questions about the state was to inquire about the legitimacy of
   governmental action. The essay has three parts. It begins by explicating
   Quentin Skinner's recent research on the concept of the state,
   supplemented by the work of other scholars, to apply that research to
   the American context. The essay then turns to a discussion of the
   concept of the people in the American context to orient the final
   section of the paper. Finally, the paper explicates James Wilson and St.
   George Tucker's influential and rival populist theories of the American
   state. The overall aim of the essay is to stretch our political
   imagination and thus help us begin to reimagine the concept of the
   democratic state in more fruitful ways.},

Abstract = {China's rapid growth in comprehensive capabilities has been accompanied
   by an increasingly serious rise dilemma. The rise dilemma refers to the
   dilemma a rising great power faces, as it seeks to maintain the growth
   in comprehensive capabilities and international influence, while
   simultaneously managing the increasing external security pressures
   generated by its growth. Provided that the United States continues to
   lead its East Asian allies through providing security protection and
   shared norms, China must adopt a state-by-state approach in integrating
   the tripartite relationship between China, the United States and China's
   neighbors into a coherent policy framework. In the context of a
   state-by-state approach, China needs to employ strategic hedging to
   maintain stability in China-US strategic relations. At the same time,
   two dimensions need consideration in determining a specific security
   policy towards a given neighbor, i.e., whether a state is help-dependent
   (depending on the US security protection) or self-help (safeguarding its
   security independently), and the extent to which that a state harbors
   concerns over China's rise.},

Abstract = {The article examines the determinants of party fragmentation based on
   electoral district data from the Swiss cantons (2010-2015). In contrast
   to previous studies, three different dependent variables are taken into
   account: firstly, the raw number of parties, secondly, the effective
   number of parties based on vote shares and, thirdly, the effective
   number of legislative parties. On all three levels, the exclusion
   magnitude proves to be the most important factor. Compared to this,
   other institutional variables contribute little explanatory power.
   However, apparentments are relevant in the first stage of our analysis
   as they increase the raw number of parties standing for election. In
   terms of sociological factors, we only find limited relevance.
   Denominational and linguistic heterogeneity do not have any impact. This
   can be explained by the fact that linguistic heterogeneity is only
   weakly pronounced at district level. The finding emphasises the
   importance of district-based data for the analysis of party system
   fragmentation in general.},

Abstract = {The neoliberal depoliticization of economic policy is commonly seen as
   consisting of ``supply-side{''} practices of removing, denying, and
   closing avenues for public action of politicians and societal actors. I
   argue that this view overlooks ``demand-side{''} practices that actively
   encourage action in the private sphere through constructing and
   legitimating private action channels for societal actors to attend to
   their economic needs and wants. These channels are crucial for the
   depoliticization of economic policy since their declining effectiveness
   can stimulate processes of repoliticization. This article focuses on
   higher education in Israel as a case study of such a channel. Higher
   education has been constructed institutionally and legitimated
   discursively by politicians and bureaucrats as a channel for action in
   the private sphere, by employing the logic of education as human
   capital. The declining effectiveness of this private action channel
   contributed to the eruption of mass protest in 2011 which repoliticized
   economic policy.},

Abstract = {This article focuses on the controversial eighteenth-century Whig
   politician, John Wilkes (1725-97), his journalism and his reception in
   the Scottish periodical press, while considering parallels with current
   debates on Brexit and Scottish independence. Wilkes, seen by some at the
   time as a notorious rabble-rouser and a voracious Scotophobe, was
   nevertheless elected democratically (an unusual phenomenon at this time)
   to various political offices while campaigning for the freedom of the
   press. His outspoken attacks on the Scottish Prime Minister, Lord Bute,
   and associated insults to Scotland, prompted an angry response in the
   Scottish press and magnified the political divide between Scotland and
   England. If Wilkes represented `liberty' to many English Whigs, he
   symbolised outspoken prejudice to many in Scotland. The article will
   examine some of Wilkes's own pronouncements on the Scots in his North
   Briton magazine, alongside responses in the contemporary Scottish
   periodical press. The debates that Wilkes focuses on - Scotland's
   so-called `rebellious' nature and its unhelpful attachment to
   continental Europe - resonate with twenty-first-century political
   debates in illuminating ways.},

Journal = {ELECTORAL STUDIES},

Volume = {51},

Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {The link between individual perceptions of the economy and vote choice
   is fundamental to electoral accountability. Yet, while it is
   well-established that economic perceptions are correlated with voting
   behaviour, it is unclear whether these perceptions are rooted in the
   real economy or whether they simply reflect voters' partisan biases.
   This article uses time-series data, survey data and unique experimental
   evidence to shed new light on how British voters update their economic
   perceptions in response to economic change. Our findings demonstrate
   that while partisanship influences levels of economic optimism, people
   respond to information about real economic changes by adjusting their
   economic perceptions. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {The objective of the paper is to describe the prison government system
   implemented by penitentiary service and the armed forces on Villa Devoto
   prison during the last Argentinean civil-military dictatorship. The
   characteristics acquired by prison government when dealing with a
   specific population, the political women prisoners, are analyzed. The
   empirical resource is the Dictatorship Letters Collection (National
   Library), thus the analysis start from the women prisoner own experience
   and voice.},

Title = {The Effect of Farmer-Pastoralist Violence on State-Level Internal
   Revenue Generation in Nigeria: A Modified Synthetic Control Analysis
   Approach},
Journal = {PEACE ECONOMICS PEACE SCIENCE AND PUBLIC POLICY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {24},

Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Nigeria's ethnically and religiously diverse Middle Belt has experienced
   recurrent eruptions of violence over the past several decades. Disputes
   between pastoralists and farmers arise from disagreements over access to
   farmland, grazing areas, stock routes, and water points for both animals
   and households. Although relatively low in intensity, this form of
   violence is widespread, persistent, and arguably increasing in its
   incidence. This study seeks to answer the question: How has
   farmer-pastoralist conflict affected state internally-generated revenues
   (IGR)? The literature on the effect of violence on sub-national fiscal
   capacity is slim to none. We use a synthetic control approach to model
   how IGR for four conflict-affected states - Benue, Kaduna, Nasarawa, and
   Plateau - would have developed in the absence of violence. To account
   for the endogeneity criticism commonly leveled at such synthetic control
   analyses, we then use a fixed-effects IV model to estimate IGR losses
   predicted by the synthetic control analysis as a function of
   farmer-pastoralist fatalities. Our conservative estimates for percentage
   reduction to annual state IGR growth for the four states are 0\%, 1.2\%,
   2.6\%, and 12.1\% respectively, implying that IGR is likely much more
   sensitive to conflict than GDP. In total, the four study states of
   Benue, Kaduna, Nasarawa, and Plateau are estimated to have lost between
   US\$719,000 and US\$2.3 million in 2010 US dollars, or 22-47\% of their
   potential IGR collection during the period of intense.},

Abstract = {This study reports results from a new analysis of 17 survey experiment
   studies that permitted assessment of racial discrimination, drawn from
   the archives of the Time-sharing Experiments for the Social Sciences.
   For White participants (n=10435), pooled results did not detect a net
   discrimination for or against White targets, but, for Black participants
   (n=2781), pooled results indicated the presence of a small-to-moderate
   net discrimination in favor of Black targets; inferences were the same
   for the subset of studies that had a political candidate target and the
   subset of studies that had a worker or job applicant target. These
   results have implications for understanding racial discrimination in the
   United States, and, given that some of the studies have never been fully
   reported on in a journal or academic book, the results also suggest the
   need for preregistration to reduce or eliminate publication bias in
   racial discrimination studies.},

Abstract = {The increasing use of online surveys (CAWI) raises the question about
   ``mode effects', i.e., substantive differences in results. This study
   looks at causes of mode effects in electoral research, taking reported
   vote choice for the FPO as an example. For this purpose, data from
   AUTNES 2013 surveys are used to decompose indirect effects of the survey
   mode on vote choice, comparing CAWI with CAPI (face-to-face). The
   results suggest that differences in the likelihood of voting for the FPO
   in CAWI and CAPI are hardly related to socio-demographic heterogeneity,
   but rather result from including more politically alienated people and
   generally from less social desirability when expressing right-wing
   ideological attitudes in the CAWI mode.},

Abstract = {Is there a relationship between a party's capacity to influence
   legislative decision-making and its decision to be part of a government
   coalition? In this study, we argue that when formal legislative rules
   are more conducive to actors' policy preferences, parties have fewer
   incentives to join the cabinet. To test our analytical model, we analyze
   68 governments and 112 cabinets in 12 presidential systems, from 1979 to
   2011. Our results indicate that the decision to integrate the cabinet in
   presidential systems is related to the level of influence parties have
   on legislative policy formation in Latin American democracies.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this article is to revise Karl Marx's model for the
   formation of capitalism in light of new research. In Das Kapital, Marx
   focused his study in England through parliamentary documents. The
   present article examines not only the English situation, but also that
   of other areas, especially Castile, through village documents. It
   demonstrates that the new relations of production developed within the
   functioning process of feudalism. Therefore, there was only one
   contradictory logic for the reproduction of feudalism and the genesis of
   capitalism. This leads to the reconsideration of the role of class
   struggle in the transition.},

Journal = {NATIONAL IDENTITIES},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {20},
Number = {3},
Pages = {277-298},
Abstract = {The question of what Australian identity means has re-emerged, as
   globalisation and a concerted political effort to reconstruct an `Anglo'
   identity have caused uncertainty about `who we are'. To explore how
   Australians conceptualise identity, this paper examines empirical
   research since Phillips' {[}1998. Popular views about Australian
   identity: Research and analysis. Journal of Sociology, 34(3), 281-302.
   doi: 10.1177/144078339803400305] seminal work synthesising research on
   Australian identity. Nearly two decades on, a civic/ethno-nationalist
   distinction and traditional socio-political correlates remain; but less
   dichotomous constructions are also being explored and more progressive
   values included. Key differences are found in the increased range of
   meanings of Australianness, as well as an apparent shift, for some,
   towards a cosmopolitan identity.},

Abstract = {This article reflects on the political efficiency of prophecy by
   distinguishing two types of prophetic speech, assertive and inducive,
   based on a singular parable narrated by Gunther Anders in Die beweinte
   Zukungt. There, Noah is represented as announcing the imminence of the
   Flood to his fellow human beings; this condition is similar to ours
   today, as we are warned, not by God but by so many scientific reports,
   of a planetary environmental catastrophe. This distinction between two
   types of prophetic speech also helps us understand the peculiar features
   of Pasolini's words and what makes them so different from those of other
   Apocalypse announcers of his time.},

Journal = {SRAVNITELNAYA POLITIKA-COMPARATIVE POLITICS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {9},

Pages = {109-123},
Abstract = {This article examines the foreign policy platform of Donald Trump, based
   on his proposals, the composition of his advisers and supporting
   coalitions. Second focus of the article is the internal political
   context and limitations to the new administration of the White House.
   Finally, there are conclusions for Russia and possible scenarios for the
   development of bilateral relations after the inauguration of Donald
   Trump. The future of Russian-American relations is the key uncertainty
   of 2017. Russian foreign policy greatly depends on it. The development
   of relations can go in several directions, which is conditioned to
   success or failure of Trump domestic economic program, as well as high
   or low level of conflict behavior of new US administration in its
   foreign policy. From the perspective of economic and internal policy the
   criterion of success for Trump will be the speed with which he could
   launch a legislative mechanism for tax reform and infrastructure
   investment despite the Democrats opposition. From the perspective of
   foreign policy, the main uncertainty in US-Russia relations will be
   about the future of confrontation in Eastern Europe and willingness of
   the parties to cooperate in stabilizing the situation in the Middle
   East, despite the differences in objectives and choice of allies. A key
   condition for normalizing relations remains the preservation of
   strategic balance between Russia and the United States.},

Abstract = {Question time represents one of the most relevant institutional arenas
   where parties compete to get their favourite issues on the parliamentary
   agenda. Parties select which issue to address by weighing up two
   commitments simultaneously: fulfilling the party mandate received by
   their voters at election time and responding to the current priorities
   of voters. This article assesses the extent to which the recent
   sovereign debt crisis impacted the way parties balance these two
   imperatives of democratic representation. Through the issue coding of
   around 10,000 parliamentary oral questions tabled in Italy, Portugal and
   Spain between 2003 and 2014, the analysis shows that the worsening of
   economic conditions intensified the impact of citizens' priorities.
   However, there is no clear evidence of a decline in the importance of
   the party mandate for either the majority or opposition parties. These
   findings offer insights on the topic of party political representation
   in Southern Europe and whether it was affected by the Eurozone crisis.},

Abstract = {As technical opportunities develop, new forms of testimony are being
   created for educational purposes. The latest development are
   three-dimensional light projections (holograms) of survivors of the
   Holocaust that, via a very refined voice recognition software, react to
   users' questions. The pre-recorded answers and images are currently
   being developed and started to put in use in Great Britain and in the
   US. This article discusses whether this new way of teaching and learning
   could also be suitable for our heterogeneous society here in Germany. At
   the same time, the current challenges of Holocaust Education are being
   pointed out to: Especially with regard to the concepts of Human Rights
   Education or Teaching Tolerance and fighting modern Anti-Semitism there
   are many misconceptions that need to be addressed before we start
   investing in and using new and extremely expensive technologies.},

Abstract = {Political scientists relying on observational data face substantial
   challenges in drawing causal inferences. A particularly problematic
   threat to inference is the unobserved confounder. As a means to assess
   this threat, we introduce simultaneous sensitivity analysis to the
   political science literature. As an application, we consider the
   potentially confounded relationship between Supreme Court justice voting
   and oral argument quality. We demonstrate that this relationship is
   sensitive to the presence of a confounder, to a degree that threatens
   inference, and explore the confounder both theoretically and
   empirically. More generally, we show how sensitivity analysis can guide
   inquiry related to a covariate that cannot be directly measured.},

Abstract = {After a comparison of Nasser with Julius Caesar (the ``democratic
   dictator{''}) and Machiavelli (the pragmatic politician) and a short
   discussion of Nasser's non-Marxist, but ``Islamic{''} socialism, the
   article focuses mainly on the posthumous effects of Nasserism. On the
   international level, pan-Arabism and non-alignment have been destroyed
   by local particularism, and the whole Middle East lost definitely the
   stabilizing pivot Nasser represented in the Fifties and Sixties; on the
   domestic Egyptian level, the total de-Nasserization in politics, economy
   and social policy carried out by Sadat and Mubarak weakened and
   impoverished the country rather than implementing and improving
   democracy and welfare. If Nasser's myth, coupled with Islam, continues
   to foster hopes of national and popular rescue, after the so-called
   ``Arab spring{''} Egyptian regime reproduced dictatorship without
   Nasser's charisma and far-sighting.},

Abstract = {Skepticism about citizen competence is a core component of Christopher
   H. Achen and Larry M. Bartels's call, in Democracy for Realists, for
   rethinking our model of democracy. In this paper I suggest that the
   evidence for citizen incompetence is not as clear as we might think;
   important research shows that we are good group problem solvers even if
   we are poor solitary truth seekers. I argue that deliberative democracy
   theory has a better handle on this fundamental fact of human cognition
   and therefore has a more realistic view of the conditions that might
   improve citizen competence.},

Abstract = {This article examines how parties use clientelism in competitive and
   uncompetitive electoral environments. It argues that parties enjoy wide
   discretion to target clientelistic payoffs to inexpensive voters in
   their strongholds, but that head-to-head competition compels them to bid
   for more expensive voters. Empirically, it uses a list experiment
   embedded in a postelection survey to study electoral clientelism in
   Lebanon, a country with a mix of competitive and uncompetitive electoral
   districts. It finds respondents underreport clientelistic transactions
   by a factor of two. Proxies for the cost of a vote explain payoff
   targeting decisions in party strongholds, but lose their explanatory
   power in the competitive districts.},

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL CRITICAL THOUGHT},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {8},

Pages = {264-276},
Abstract = {Recent research has emphasised how Marx's views underwent profound
   change after 1870. Its major focus has been on how Marx's increasing
   interest in developments in Russia culminated in his adoption of the
   Russian populists' belief that the country might reach socialism without
   passing through the stage of capitalism. Less attention has been devoted
   to Marx's later attitude towards the prospects of proletarian revolution
   in Western Europe. This paper attempts a more detailed explanation of
   Marx's approach to the development of the labour movement in Britain,
   France and Germany during the 1870s. It also aims to show that he no
   longer expected a forthcoming revolution carried out by the organised
   working class in the most advanced Western European countries. First,
   Marx complained of the lack of revolutionary spirit in the British
   proletariat; moreover, he criticised the immaturity of the French labour
   movement; finally, he rejected the eclectic ideology of German social
   democracy, which was on the rise.},

Volume = {22},

Pages = {329-343},
Abstract = {This paper contributes to the study of cultural citizenship by laying
   the foundations for a concept of culture regime. Depicting culture as a
   malleable concept that encompasses both particularistic and
   universalistic elements, the paper emphasizes the potential of the
   concept of culture regime to bridge those of citizenship, language and
   ethnicity regime. While presenting narrow conceptions of culture as
   ethnic identity as a defensible compromise in the context of comparative
   empirical research, the paper discusses how the study of culture regimes
   could integrate broader approaches to culture by incorporating other
   forms of culturalclaims and identities that go beyond ethnic traits. In
   doing so, the paper aims to promote an inter-disciplinary dialogue on
   cultural citizenship, arguing that someof the differences in
   cross-disciplinary approaches to culture owe to methodological rather
   than ontological considerations.},

Abstract = {Our model of audit of public finances was established by the
   Constitution and inferior norms decades ago. However, the system
   presents some endemic problems which derive from its highly
   decentralized character. Some of these difficulties came from the norms
   which rule on the institutional position, compositions and functions of
   the several organs that exercise the control. However, other defects
   come from the adverse practices generated by the application of the
   logic of the ``State of political parties{''} to the external control of
   public finances. Furthermore, the article stresses that some statements
   of the Constitutional Court should be reconsidered.},

Journal = {NEW POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {40},

Pages = {459-476},
Abstract = {In this article, we explore Norwegian Progress Party politicians' change
   of their rhetoric of immigration after the party for the first time
   became part of a coalition government in 2013. Equal to other right-wing
   populist parties in Europe, immigration has been the main reason for
   voters to support the Progress Party. How then does their immigration
   rhetoric change after entering office? This is important, as an
   intolerant immigration rhetoric has far-reaching consequences for the
   political climate in Europe. Right-wing populist parties can achieve
   much regarding migration policies merely because there is broad
   consensus on a strict migration policy today. However, to succeed
   remaining in office, they must remain being acceptable to other parties
   in the parliament and their coalition partner and therefore they need to
   moderate the way they go about communicating their message. Too much
   moderation however might lead to a split within the party, or losing
   core voters.},

Abstract = {The objective of this article is to study the political identity that
   characterizes the current Catalan social and political independence
   movement (2011-2017) from the rhetorical theory of democracy
   perspective. The question to be analyzed will be whether this identity
   contains democratic deficits that affect its inclusivity and pluralism
   in such a way that its ability to interact with a significant portion of
   Catalan society is limited. For this purpose, the political identity in
   question will be examined to determine if it is a common or a partial
   political identity because, in the latter case its normative problems
   will be significant, from a democratic perspective, given the goal that
   this movement aims to achieve.},

Journal = {SIYASAL-JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCES},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {27},

Pages = {149-161},
Abstract = {The longstanding political turmoil in the Middle East especially between
   Israelis and Palestinians attracts worldwide attention. A main player in
   the area is the USA. Their pro-Israeli foreign policies are highly
   visible especially during Republican Presidencies. Considering that the
   last five Republican Presidents were Evangelical Christians my concern
   is to clarify their religious beliefs and their relationships to the
   foreign policies implemented in the area. What started as a religious
   Puritan movement in the 16-17th centuries in England and moved to the
   USA later on turned into a far-right Christian political movement. Their
   literal interpretation of the Bible, including the belief that the
   Jewish people were given the land of Israel by God himself supported the
   Jewish Zionist movement at the turn of the century and developed their
   name into Christian Zionists around the 1980's. The current Trump
   Administration and their recent move of the USA embassy to Jerusalem,
   signifying the official acceptance of Jerusalem as the capital of Israel
   and the following change of discourse about the Palestinians, will be
   studied. I will first define and describe the two ideologies, that is,
   Jewish Zionism and Christian Zionism followed by their historical paths
   focusing mainly on Christian Zionism. I will conclude by analyzing the

Title = {The Different `Shades' of German Power: Germany and EU Foreign Policy
   during the Ukraine Conflict},
Journal = {GERMAN POLITICS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {27},
Number = {4, SI},
Pages = {498-515},
Abstract = {Germany emerged as the leader of EU crisis management efforts during the
   Ukraine conflict in 2014 and 2015. Traditional conceptualisations of
   German foreign policy - from civilian to hegemonic and geo-economic
   power - have not been able to sufficiently explain this new German
   leadership role. By applying a comprehensive taxonomy of power, this
   analysis aims at untangling the different `shades' of German power,
   arguing that German `Machtpolitik' is much more nuanced and subtle than
   previous conceptualisations and theoretical schools suggest. Taking
   Germany and EU foreign policy during the Ukraine conflict as a case
   study, this article contributes a new theoretically grounded perspective
   to the question of German power and influence within the European Union.
   The aim is to bring back power as a category into the analysis of member
   states' relations within the EU since power politics have only been
   tamed, but not excluded from the European project. By combining and
   applying different shades' of power, Germany has become the central axis
   of policy-making between the European Union and Russia during the
   Ukraine conflict, decisively shaping discourse and content of EU policy
   towards Russia.},

Title = {The weakness of agrarian parties in France: The case of the ``party of
   agriculture{''} under the Second Empire},
Journal = {POLITIX},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {31},
Number = {123},
Pages = {147-169},
Abstract = {Little known to researchers, the debates raised in the late 1860s by the
   vain efforts of a publicist to launch a ``party of agriculture{''}
   nevertheless provide many lessons. Whereas parties were being structured
   in a way that led them, at the end of the nineteenth century, to become
   parties in the modern sense of the word, this case enables us to better
   understand the paradox of the absence of a true agricultural or peasant
   party in France a country where rural people have long constituted an
   overwhelming electoral majority. Distrust for parties, often invoked, is
   not sufficient to account for the failure of the ``party of
   agriculture{''} under the Second Empire. It is, above all, an effective
   argument for its opponents, in a conflict that rural voters finally
   resolved against their self-proclaimed spokespersons. Reluctant to
   mistake their interests for those of the agricultural elites, the
   peasantry was also attracted by the arguments of their adversaries, who
   did not hesitate to denounce them as former notables eager to
   re-establish feudal relations. In a France where power relations are
   forcefully determined by the social and political imagination left
   behind by the Revolution, the ``party of agriculture{''} was doomed to
   failure, not in spite of, but because of the electoral predominance of
   rural people.},

   support for democratization, and global city residence in Russia},
Journal = {DEMOCRATIZATION},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {25},
Number = {3},
Pages = {481-503},
Abstract = {Using Russian survey data from 2011 to 2012, this article examines
   public understanding of and support for democratization in a
   semi-authoritarian context. When knowledge of democracy is weak, and
   conceptual understanding of democracy is mixedas in Russiatraditional
   measures of democratic support inadequately capture demand for
   democratization; that is, for more democracy than currently perceived.
   Contrary to conventional wisdom, Russians who adhere to textbook
   political definitions of democracy are more, not less, likely to
   advocate democratization. Residence in global cities increases support
   for democracy and democratization, while education fosters the latter
   but not the former. Other traditional indicators of middle-class status,
   such as income and urbanization, lack consistent effects. Based on these
   results we re-evaluate the mechanism linking modernization and support
   for democracy in developing, non-democratic societies. Rather than exert
   social-psychological or normative effects, modernization works primarily
   by raising exposure to global political discourses that define and
   promote democratic government.},

Abstract = {In this article, I examine the theoretical-methodological dispute
   between two distinct conceptions of national developmentalism, embodied
   by Helio Jaguaribe and Alvaro Vieira Pinto, within the scope of the
   Higher Institute of Brazilian Studies (ISEB). I maintain that, rather
   than just a debate on the nature, methods, and objectives of national
   developmentalism, the debate contrasted two perceptibly distinct
   positions on the nature of political knowledge, the relation between
   thought and action, and the ideal role of the Isebeian intelligentsia in
   national social and political life.},

Title = {Precarization of employment in Morelia, Michoacan, Mexico},
Journal = {CIMEXUS},

Volume = {13},

Abstract = {It is called precarization of employment to a continuous process of
   degradation in working conditions. Precarity is not exclusive to
   emerging countries or to the most disadvantaged social classes, it
   occurs in all countries and classes. The city of Morelia, Michoacan, has
   a low level of unemployment, although the quality of employment offered
   in terms of income and labor benefits is deficient, affecting the
   population that depends on them. The objective of the study is to
   develop a Job Precariousness Index in Morelia, using the model proposed
   by Rubio (2010). This model analyzes separately the dimensions of
   temporality, insufficient salary and lack of job protection, being the
   source of information the National Survey of Employment and Occupation.
   The resulting Precariousness Index for Morelia is 33\%, lower than that
   of Michoacan (52\%) and Mexico (38\%). There is a growing trend, which
   shows a gradual deterioration in the quality of employment.},

Abstract = {This article focuses on Italian regional chief executives and aims to
   investigate if and how the Italian regionalization process has affected
   regional chief executives' career trajectories. Our analysis is based on
   an original dataset on political careers of regional heads of government
   in Italy from 1970 to 2015. After presenting our two research
   expectations, we find that the direct election of regional presidents
   and the decentralization process have gone hand in hand with the
   selection of more regional political outsiders and visible politicians
   as well as with a higher integration between institutional levels in
   terms of career paths},

Journal = {DEMOCRATIZATION},

Volume = {25},

Pages = {1073-1092},
Abstract = {This article investigates the sources of public demand for democratic
   institutions under authoritarian rule. While a growing body of
   literature recognizes that in authoritarian polities such as China,
   economic development does not lead to democratization in a linear
   fashion, our understanding of the sources of democratization in
   resilient authoritarianism remains limited. This article provides an
   empirical test of the three most compelling theories to subsequently
   emerge: modernization theory, social capital theory, and institutional
   theory. The results of a survey conducted in the countryside of Zhejiang
   and Sichuan provinces provide support for the institutional approach in
   understanding public demand for democracy in rural China, while the
   modernization theory and social capital theory are shown to be less
   useful. Specifically, results show that people working in the government
   system are core supporters of the regime, whereas income, education
   attainment, social trust, and one's satisfaction with regime
   institutions turn out to be irrelevant and do not serve as direct
   sources of public demand for democracy. These results extend our
   understanding of the complex interaction between an authoritarian regime
   and its people, shedding new light on the democratic prospects for
   resilient authoritarianism.},

Abstract = {Harry Brighouse and Adam Swift, together with many other philosophers,
   think that adults' interests in raising a child can give them a moral
   right to parent when they will be adequate parents. We consider whether
   the same interest could give such adults a moral right to procreate, as
   a means of acquiring a child to raise. We argue that the interest in
   parenting cannot support a right to procreate, because the features of
   childhood that make parenting uniquely valuable for adults are bad for
   children. Adults may have a right to procreate, but they do not have
   that right due to their interest in a parent-child relationship.},

Title = {The challenge of assessing governance in Asian states: Hong Kong in the
   Worldwide Governance Indicators ranking},
Journal = {ASIAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {26},
Number = {2},
Pages = {276-291},
Abstract = {As countries in Asia work towards achieving development, the state of
   governance emerged as a benchmark for them. Assessing governance is an
   important exercise because a country's image is influenced by its
   position in world rankings which plays a role in decisions by the
   international community regarding aid and trade. The methodology adopted
   in preparing the Worldwide Governance Indicators (WGI) rankings
   underlines the preference for some values that are dominant in Western
   liberal democratic systems. This places Asian states at a disadvantage
   as other traditional values are ignored in assessing the state of
   governance. This article examines the methods and criteria of the WGI
   with reference to the case of Hong Kong. An overview of the critiques of
   WGI and analysis of the scores awarded to Hong Kong reveal the challenge
   of assessing governance across countries with the same instrument
   without taking into consideration the context of the units. The article
   argues that there is a need for developing alternative criteria for
   accommodating indigenous institutional structures, processes, and
   practices to ensure that Asian countries can benefit from the desired
   values of governance and help overcome the partial picture of governance
   that emerges in the WGI.},

Abstract = {The discursive traverses of ``precarious work{''} invoke a wide range of
   meanings, from a political frame of reference for new labor and social
   movements to conceptualizations framing scholarly inquiries and
   institutional policymaking. Often, the notion is simultaneously
   registered along both descriptive and analytic planes. It consequently
   generates a certain amount of ambiguity, flitting between different
   levels of analysis. Quite paradoxically, however, the terms ``precarious
   work{''} and ``precarity{''} over the last decade or so have generated a
   potentially stable frame of reference for labor politics against the
   tide of neo-liberal policies and practices. How do we go about
   conceptualizing ``precarious work{''} within specific, historical
   contexts and arrive, from such instances, at a more historicized
   understanding of the notion? What does such an exercise in
   conceptualization reveal about its contemporary salience among labor
   scholars, activists and policymakers in different contexts? These
   questions motivate the paper. In addressing them, the central argument
   of the paper alludes to a world-historical approach in tracing parallel
   concerns between contemporary scholarly discussions on ``precarious
   work{''} and ``informal labor.{''} It claims that the proliferating
   usages of ``precarious work{''} beyond their original scope of reference
   in European contexts indicate tensions through which ongoing
   world-historical processes are mediated in shaping relations of social
   (re)production today.},

Abstract = {This chapter examines the cultural aspects of Brexit. The most obvious
   such aspect is the likely impact on the European Union's (EU) language
   regime. English has steadily replaced French as the most used working
   language within the EU and this chapter concludes that this is unlikely
   to be affected by Brexit, and that English might even be seen in future
   as a more neutral ``lingua franca{''}. In addition to the linguistic
   aspect, wider cultural aspects of Brexit are also considered in the
   chapter. So, for example, the UK has helped to shape certain EU working
   practices and procedures, such as question time in EP plenaries, impact
   assessments on legislation and other aspects of better regulation. The
   UK has also influenced EU attitudes on such matters as lobbying, codes
   of conduct and openness of meetings.},

Title = {The Dislocated Universe of Laclau and Mouffe: An Introduction to
   Post-Structuralist Discourse Theory},
Journal = {CRITICAL REVIEW},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {30},
Number = {3-4},
Pages = {294-315},
Abstract = {Post-Structuralist Discourse Theory analyzes political ideas and action
   from a Marxist direction. However, while classic Marxian sociology is
   rooted in economic processes that structure society and ideas,
   Post-Structuralist Discourse Theory emphasizes the absence of any
   determinative principle. Thus, it radicalizes an ongoing shift in
   Marxism away from economic essentialism towards indeterminacy,
   contingency, and openness. The ideological superstructure becomes ever
   more important at the expense of the economic base; class struggle and
   relations of production lose analytical and strategic purchase in favor
   of a complex and integral form of politics; there are no deeper, natural
   foundations determining how society is organized and structured.
   Post-Structuralist Discourse Theorists argue that this orientation leads
   to a more satisfactory analysis of political practice than is possible
   through positivist research. Assessing this claim requires a survey of
   the hermetic terminology in which Post-Structuralist Discourse Theorists
   express their ideasthe discourse, as it were, of Discourse
   Theoristsexploring their use of sociology, structuralist linguistics,
   psychoanalysis, and the political theory of populism.},

Abstract = {Voluntary action in Indonesia is often state-driven, emerging not in
   relation to bottom-up grassroots initiatives, but encouraged or even
   enforced by the state. This article examines the ways volunteers in a
   development programme in the city of Medan use state-created
   opportunities for volunteering to critique the practices of the state
   and experiences of citizenship. Volunteers articulate an ideal
   relationship between citizens and the state, based not on the impartial
   distribution of welfare according to rights, but on personalized
   relationships of care. Volunteers suggest that their position outside of
   formal state structures makes them better able to form these
   relationships with citizens. In making these claims, volunteers both
   carve out a role for themselves within state-led development, while also
   conveying the impossibility that state-actors can achieve this
   citizenship ideal. At the same time, volunteers' entanglement with the
   state - their association with the norms and practices that constitute
   it - limit their ability to transform citizenship practices.},

Title = {Anti-Americanism and Public Attitudes toward Transatlantic Trade},
Journal = {GERMAN POLITICS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {27},
Number = {3},
Pages = {317-338},
Abstract = {The recent debate about the Transatlantic Trade and Investment
   Partnership (TTIP) has triggered widespread opposition to the trade
   agreement in Germany. It is not clear, however, what factors drive
   public attitudes toward transatlantic trade. This article explores the
   role of anti-Americanism in predicting attitudes toward TTIP among the
   German public. It argues that the impact of anti-Americanism depends on
   the extent to which political elites frame the TTIP proposal as a basic
   conflict between American and European values. Using data from two
   national representative surveys, it is found that attitudes toward
   America strongly predict support for the TTIP agreement. The results
   further demonstrate that the effect of national resentment is moderated
   by issue awareness, with citizens with a strong anti-American sentiment
   being significantly more likely to oppose the agreement if they follow
   the elite debate more closely. Taken together, the results suggest that
   national resentments are more important for the explanation of TTIP
   preferences than traditional factors such as partisanship, ideology and
   material concerns.},

Journal = {POLITICS AND GOVERNANCE},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {6},
Number = {2},
Pages = {90-102},
Abstract = {Authoritarian leaders often claim that they promote democratic
   institutions such as elections and democratic values. In China, the
   central propaganda often promotes the right and duty of citizens to vote
   in local elections as well as the importance of citizens' input into the
   policy making process. However, there is often a gap between government
   rhetoric and reality. In this article, we use the China General Social
   Survey (CGSS) 2013 to evaluate the determinants of voting in local
   elections and democratic values (attitudes) in rural and urban China.
   The results show that respondents with higher education tend to have
   lower levels of democratic values and participate less in local
   elections, but respondents with only compulsory education are more
   likely to display democratic orientations and vote. This suggests the
   relative success as well as the limits of authoritarian democratic
   propaganda.},

Abstract = {Voluntary work of citizens for the benefit of society at large or its
   underprivileged members is a salient feature of developed civic
   cultures. Under state socialism, the very essence of volunteerism was
   hollowed out by its top-down, coercive ``management{''} and ideological
   control. This article highlights the experiences and perceptions of
   voluntary work under socialism drawing on retrospective narratives of
   ex-Soviet immigrants in Israel who continued volunteering after
   migration. In conclusion, we reflect on the economic and political
   functions of ``mandatory volunteering{''} in the USSR and discuss some
   of their analogies in Western democracies. Our study helps elicit the
   reasons for the slow expansion of volunteering behavior among
   post-socialist citizens in the former Soviet Union and Eastern Europe.},

Journal = {WEST EUROPEAN POLITICS},

Volume = {41},

Pages = {196-217},
Abstract = {Theoretical and empirical accounts of public opinion show that people's
   social policy preferences are affected by the state of economy.
   According to the countercyclical view, economic downturn increases
   citizens' demands for social policy whereas the procyclical view states
   that citizens demand less social policy during economically tough times.
   This article argues that individuals' differences in political
   sophistication and, specifically, the commonly associated
   social-psychological characteristics are part of the micro-foundations
   for those different responses. People acquire and process information
   differently, which influences their political preferences. Public
   opinion and macroeconomic data from Europe during the economic crisis
   support the argument. The results show that people with lower levels of
   political sophistication tend to be procyclical, whereas this
   relationship weakens and moves towards countercyclical opinion
   structures with increasing levels of sophistication. These findings help
   to explain social policy preferences in response to the economy, and
   they offer insights into the origins of social policy preferences.},

Abstract = {Recent decades have seen a considerable increase in delegation to
   independent regulatory agencies, which has been justified by reference
   to the superior performance of these bodies relative to government
   departments. Yet, the hypothesis that more independent regulators do
   better work has hardly been tested. We examine the link using a
   comprehensive measure of the quality of work carried out by competition
   authorities in 30 Organisation for Economic Co-Operation and Development
   (OECD) countries, and new data on the design of these organizations. We
   find that formal independence has a positive and significant effect on
   quality. Contrary to expectations, though, formal political
   accountability does not boost regulatory quality, and there is no
   evidence that it increases the effect of independence by reducing the
   risk of slacking. The quality of work is also enhanced by increased
   staffing, more extensive regulatory powers, and spillover effects of a
   more capable bureaucratic system.},

   self-determination within BDSM communities},
Journal = {CITIZENSHIP STUDIES},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {22},
Number = {7},
Pages = {667-684},
Abstract = {There has been - and continues to be - a tension within the political
   strategies of sexual minority communities claiming citizenship. Whilst
   attempting to forge a political self-determination based on being
   (dissident) sexual subjects, members of sexually diverse communities
   have frequently engaged in political practices that normalize their
   diversity to accord with wider socio-cultural conventions. In this
   article, we address this issue in relation to the political strategies
   of one of the most marginalized sexual identities/practices: BDSM. By
   drawing on the work of Foucault, Rose, Rabinow and Bahktin, we advance a
   case for how it may be possible for dissident sexual communities to
   resist the normalizing effects of citizenship whilst still making claims
   for legal recognition and wider social acknowledgment. Key to the
   argument is the theorization of a position wherein carnival
   transgression operates within a dialectical integration of ideology and
   utopia as a mode of citizenship.},

Abstract = {In Georgia, the political arena is dominated by influential men, while
   parties play a subordinate role. The real lines of conflict between the
   wealthy and the poor are not reflected in the party system. The
   `Georgian Dream' party, which describes itself as being social
   democratic, also does not act as a representative of the interests of
   the weaker sections of society. The political discourse frequently
   revolves around the relationship with Russia and the West. Here, the
   fact is ignored that the government party, which is accused of having
   close ties with Russia, has signed an association agreement between the
   EU and Georgia. Equally, people forget that all parties seek to
   associate themselves with the Orthodox Church, which does indeed
   disseminate socio-political ideas that are propagated by Moscow.},

Abstract = {All regional studies are based on the assumption that different
   countries or regions are characterised by historical differences. In
   recent years, political scientists and economists have also begun to use
   statistical methods to study the influence of history on present-day
   developments in the countries of Central and Eastern Europe. Such
   studies look at the variation of historical developments and attempt to
   draw conclusions as to the cause-effect relationship between the past
   and the present. The research is delivering a broad range of results,
   which in many individual cases confirm the influence of historical
   inheritance - the inheritance of socialism as well as the pre-socialist
   order. Here, the highest level of methodological care is required,

Journal = {JOURNAL OF POLITICAL POWER},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {11},
Number = {3},
Pages = {419-432},
Abstract = {This paper revolves around the politics of time and temporality within
   Michel Foucault's theorisation of resistance. In focus is Foucault's
   outline of resistance as discursive resistance, reversed discourses,
   techniques of the self and counter-conducts, and other anti-authority
   struggles. These forms of resistance are played out across a range of
   temporal scales. When is resistance, in Foucault's view, spectacular and
   instantaneous rather than incremental and `slow'? Overall, this paper
   reveals how the resistance practices, that are described within
   Foucault's texts, appear as repetitions of signs across time, major
   ruptures, breaks or as rhizomatic movements between now, then and the
   future.},

Abstract = {The UN Convention on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC) from 1989 remains
   the most widely ratified treaty on human rights and functions as a
   normative frame for myriads of actors working to promote the rights of
   children. The scholarship on the convention recognises that
   non-governmental organisations were crucial to the drafting of the
   treaty. Some of these accounts also single out the Swedish Save the
   Children Federation (Radda Barnen) as significant for facilitating
   non-governmental cooperation and shaping the drafting group discussions.
   Drawing on archival and published first-hand sources, the paper adds to
   the available accounts, first by outlining some of the developments that
   led Radda Barnen to embrace the concept of children's rights in the
   1970s and become involved in drafting of UNCRC in the 1980s. The paper
   then reveals how the organisation engaged creatively with the concept of
   children's rights in the drafting process and succeeded in framing
   children in armed conflict and female genital mutilation as rights
   issues, effectively challenging some of the conventional boundaries of
   international human rights law. But the paper also points to the limits
   of Radda Barnen's influence and suggests that its creative engagement
   took place within a relatively conventional framework of child
   protection.},

Abstract = {In an effort to promote learning in classrooms, political science
   instructors are increasingly turning to interactive teaching strategies
   experiments, simulations, etc. - that supplement traditional lecture
   formats. In this article, I advocate the use of student-generated data
   as a powerful teaching tool that can be used in a variety of ways to
   support learning. The ``data-driven classroom{''} is one in which
   original student data are collected via survey at the beginning of the
   course and the results presented throughout the term. Examples and case
   studies across multiple courses and classroom settings are used to
   illustrate how the method may be applied in practice. Feedback from
   student assessment surveys reveals strong support for the method, even
   among nonmajors. The article concludes with recommendations for
   instructors interested in creating more data-driven classrooms.},

Title = {Reproducing the `national home': gendering domopolitics},
Journal = {CITIZENSHIP STUDIES},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {22},
Number = {1},
Pages = {1-18},
Abstract = {Walters developed the concept of domopolitics to refer to the ways in
   which the securitisation of migration contributes to the construction of
   the UK as a `nationalhome'. Domopolitical policies and discourses
   produce the UK as the `national home' of `neoliberal citizens'; they
   thus serve as tools of neoliberal governmentality, disciplining both
   citizens and migrants into displaying qualities associated with
   neoliberal citizenship, especially economic productivity. However, the
   concept of `home' has a particular genealogy within liberal discourses
   of citizenship. As Pateman contends, the political `public' sphere of
   liberal citizenship is constructed in opposition to an apolitical
   `private' sphere. The public sphere has been coded as the domain of men,
   while women have been relegated to the private `home'. Consequently,
   women have been deemed responsible for the reproduction of both the
   private, and the `national' home, a construction which has persisted
   under neoliberalism. While often superficially gender-neutral,
   domopolitics actually relies upon, and reinforces, these gendered
   understandings of neoliberal citizenship. Domopolitical policies and
   discourses construct migrant women's reproductive practices as a
   legitimate and necessary site of state intervention, disciplining
   migrant women to ensure they `correctly'reproduce the neoliberal
   `national home.'},

Title = {In the shadow of the treaties National Parliaments and their evolving
   role in European Integration},
Journal = {POLITIQUE EUROPEENNE},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {59},
Number = {1, SI},
Pages = {198+},
Abstract = {This contribution, which concludes the special issue, provides some
   reflections regarding the way in which national parliaments manage and
   adapt to the numerous and particularly varied challenges posed by the
   European integration process. In particular, this work discusses two
   normally agreed upon assumptions about national parliaments being mainly
   passive institutions and appearing on the EU scene only with the Treaty
   of Lisbon. Subsequently, this work summarises some of the findings of
   the articles included in the special issues that shed new light on the
   many roles of national parliaments in the EU and on some of the main
   characteristics of their Europeanisation process. Their analyses follow
   different approaches, some adopting a political science methodology,
   others a legal approach; some focussing on a single area of
   policymaking, others addressing cross-sectorial topics; and some
   concentrating their comparative analysis on a small number of states,
   other on a reduced amount of years. Nevertheless, all works consider
   both the European and the national dimensions. Overall, the articles
   help to get a clearer although still incomplete overview of the effects
   of the provisions of the Treaty of Lisbon attributing ``European
   powers{''} to national parliaments, whose implementation took place
   while the EU was facing a series of crucial crises and deep
   transformations. It is argued that further research along the same path
   is still ahead. The research should possibly adopt the same methodology
   and focus on the regular institutional interaction between the EU and
   the national levels through the so-called ``Euro-national parliamentary
   procedures{''}. In its last part, this article argues that the role of
   national parliaments in the future evolution of the European integration
   process, specifically in a more asymmetric Europe, is going to increase.
   However, it is far from clear through which institutional mechanism the
   democratic legitimacy resources of national parliaments might be used.},

Journal = {AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {53},
Number = {3},
Pages = {320-335},
Abstract = {Large, politicised and separate ministerial offices are a feature of
   Australian government, while the UK ministerial office remains a hybrid
   unit which is part of the civil service. Using an historical
   institutionalist lens, and focusing on institutional factors, the
   article analyses why the separate partisan model evolved in Australia.
   It argues the Australian innovation was an historical compromise made in
   an unsuccessful attempt to move towards US-style
   political-administrative institutions. By contrast, the UK ministerial
   office has remained unified and hybrid, and, despite experimentation,
   resilient to structural and ideational change. There is ongoing pressure
   for more committed support for British ministers but strong forces have
   prevented moves towards larger offices, seen in the collapse of Extended
   Ministerial Offices. The article argues explanations for these divergent
   paths can be found in concepts such as critical junctures, path
   dependency and institutional resistance. The article contributes to an
   emerging comparative literature on advisory institutions.},

Title = {IN-GROUP AND OUT-GROUP IN RUSSIAN POLITICAL CARTOONS: RESEARCH OF THE
   LATENT MEANINGS OF NARRATIVE CONFLICT BETWEEN RUSSIA AND THE WEST},
Journal = {POLIS-POLITICHESKIYE ISSLEDOVANIYA},
Year = {2018},

Pages = {100-114},
Abstract = {The article examines the invariant contents of Russian political
   cartoons, the representation of actual political processes in it and,
   most significantly, the implicit or masked aspects of sociopolitical
   life identified via content analysis of the caricature image. The author
   claims that the virtualization of politics has given humor an additional
   significance for contemporary political discourse. Despite the emergence
   of new genres, professional cartoons in the media are still the
   static-visual humor direction most in demand. Plots of political
   cartoons as well as of political humor in general often reflect conflict
   episodes of the relationship between in-group (for the artist and
   audience) and out-group. This is also true for the Russian cartoons,
   given the relatively high importance of state, cultural and national
   identity for Russian collective identity. As shown by the
   comparative-historical analysis, the representation of conflicts between
   Russians as in-group and the West / representatives of Western societies
   as out-group is typical for Russian cartoons. The profound meanings of
   the reflection of Russian cartoonists over this antagonism and the
   dynamics of the concentration on it are studied by the method of content
   analysis. This study revealed that since the ``perestroika{''} time the
   interest to represent Western political actors in cartoons has decreased
   - the domestic events and processes became a priority. The
   attractiveness of the in-group representation declines over time, which
   indicates a more critical attitude to the Russian internal problems.
   With a greater overall attractiveness of Russian in-group, it is
   important to note that, as a result of content analysis, out-group
   representatives are shown as more impressive and presentable. The
   transfer of the in-group and the out-group antagonism from the foreign
   policy field to the internal policy field which is characteristic of the
   last decades, coupled with the polar ideological orientation of
   contemporary Russian cartoonists (including the attitude toward the
   West), indicates a low consolidation of Russian society.},

Abstract = {The recent proliferation of referendums on sovereignty matters has
   fuelled growing scholarly interest. However, comparative research is
   hindered by the weaknesses of current compilations, which tend to suffer
   from conceptual vagueness, varied coding decisions, incomplete coverage
   and ad hoc categorizations. Based on an improved conceptualization and
   theory-driven typology, this article presents a new dataset of 602
   sovereignty referendums from 1776-2012, more than double the number in
   existing lists. In an exploratory analysis, it uncovers eight
   distinctive clusters of sovereignty referendums and identifies patterns
   of activity over time and space as well as outcomes produced.},
