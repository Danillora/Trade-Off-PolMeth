Abstract = {The Stabilization and Association Process (SAP) launched by the EU in
   the aftermath of Kosovo war in 1999 has created a new policy environment
   for the Western Balkans countries. In exchange for EU assistance,
   prospect of EU accession, and continuation of preferential access to EU
   markets, these countries have to upgrade their institutions and
   governance to European standards and engage in mutual regional
   cooperation including other Stability Pact member - countries. The 2003
   European Council in Thessaloniki reaffirmed that all SAP countries were
   potential candidates for EU membership. In July 2017 the EU Trieste
   Balkans Summit discussed the status of the SAP and unanimously
   reaffirmed the importance of providing the European perspective of the
   Western Balkans. The essay examines of the current status of SAP in the
   Western Balkans countries (WB6) based on the Copenhagen political,
   economic and legislature criteria using the international data bases. It
   argues that among the criteria, the political requirements are the most
   important as they lay down the framework and administrative and
   institutional capacity to develop stable democracy and market economy.
   It concludes that EU SAP has remained consistently linked to compliance
   with the Copenhagen criteria but the Regional Cooperation Council
   countries have to create a positive environment for the WB6 to fulfill
   these European standards.},

Abstract = {This article aims at improving precision in the theoretical discussions
   of ``hedging{''} strategy. It proposes a generalizable basket of the
   strategy's components. It then examines the evolution of Vietnam's
   hedging strategy since the end of the Cold War based on this framework.
   The findings show that Vietnam's hedging strategy is a dynamically
   changing mix of four realist and liberal ingredients (diplomatic
   engagement, economic engagement, soft balancing, and hard balancing).
   The most dominant component in Vietnam's hedging has shifted across
   different periods, as Vietnam reacted to China's movements in the South
   China Sea as well as changes in the domestic conditions and the external
   security environment.},

Journal = {POLIS-POLITICHESKIYE ISSLEDOVANIYA},
Year = {2018},
Number = {4},
Pages = {56-71},
Abstract = {The article is focused on the U.S. policy of economic sanctions against
   Iran. The topic has become a burning issue again after the U.S.
   withdrawal from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Actions (JCPOA), also
   known as Iranian nuclear deal. American U-turn on JCPOA means a new wave
   of sanctions against Iran. It raises the question of future efficiency
   of sanctions in terms of their ability to make Iran comply with key U.S.
   political demands. More fundamental question is the one of why sanctions
   are effective in some cases or periods, while they are useless in the
   others? Why does a target state comply or resist to comply with the
   requirements of initiators? We base our hypothesis on the results of the
   quantitative research of Navin Bapat and his colleagues who used TIES
   data on 888 sanctions episodes and revealed significance of such factors
   as sanctions' damage to economy and the existence of initiators'
   coalition. We assume that the success of sanctions is determined by
   these two conditions among other factors. We examine this hypothesis
   learning the case of Iran using sanctions' legislation as a key source.
   We conclude that in the Iranian case the relation between the damage of
   sanctions and their political efficiency is non-linear and is well
   described in terms of ``Daniel Drezner's sanctions paradox{''} - in case
   of sanctions against political foes, stronger sanctions do not provide
   proportionally strong results. We also find a critical role of
   initiators' coalition and its sustainability on the efficiency of
   sanctions. Our analysis predicts poor efficiency of the U.S. sanctions
   after the withdrawal from JCPOA.},

Title = {Baby Boom or Bust? the New Media Effect on Political Participation},

Abstract = {A considerable number of studies have investigated the influence of new
   media on political attitudes and behaviors. However, much of this
   research focuses on young people, ignoring other age cohorts,
   particularly Baby Boomers (born between 1946 and 1964). To fill this
   gap, this research examines the influence of attention to specific forms
   of traditional and online media on Baby Boomers' online and offline
   political participation during the fall 2012 U.S. presidential campaign.
   Drawing on a Baby Boomer survey panel, responses were collected during
   the 2012 general election to analyze the empirical relationship between
   attention to traditional and online media sources and political
   participation. Data analyses reveal that Boomers' attention to
   traditional media sources, particularly television, did not increase
   their offline and online political participation. Instead, various forms
   of offline and online participation were consistently heightened by
   Boomers' attention to presidential candidate websites. In addition,
   attention to Facebook for campaign information was positively linked to
   online engagement. Boomers' attention to blogs, Twitter, and YouTube
   were associated with only certain types of online and offline
   activities.},

Abstract = {The much-heralded use of data, analytics, and evidence-based decisions
   marks the U.S. presidency, wherein many processes and decisions are
   structured by the analysis of data. An approach with historical
   precedent, reliance on data was prominent under Obama, and is even under
   Trump, despite signals to the contrary. This article examines three
   cases from the Obama era: microtargeting in electoral campaigns,
   performance management in government, and signature drone strikes
   employed by the national security apparatus. It also reflects on the
   early Trump administration. The processes described are highly dependent
   on data, technically big data in two instances. The article examines the
   cases both on their own terms and in the context of a critical lens that
   directs attention to the political economy of the data. The analysis
   helps unpack the allure of data and analytics as well as the challenges
   in structuring an environment with a measured approach to data and big
   data, which would examine both their potential and drawbacks.},

Abstract = {This study uses a survey of undergraduate college students at two
   schools in the eastern United States to investigate whether how they
   self-classify (e.g. choice of major and political view) effects their
   levels of trust in the government and how safe they feel in regard to a
   terror attack. We found that while all of the self-classification
   variables had an effect on trust in the government, none of them had an
   effect on feelings of safety.},

Abstract = {This work considers that it is important to debate the question of
   federalism from the point of view of Political Geography and
   Geopolitics. The article's main goal is to analyse the
   territorialization processes conducted by the governments of each
   federal unit (the Brazilian states) in order to legitimize their
   capacity of autonomous action within the federation. From this
   standpoint, the key question turns out to be `How do the governments of
   the federal units handle their autonomy to elaborate and execute
   investment strategies within their territories?' The paper focuses on
   the state of Bahia, which will be analysed in relation to two terms,
   2003-2006 and 2007-2010, during which two clearly distinct territorial
   development plans were elaborated and put in place, respectively.},

Abstract = {Since 2000, the political system in Russia has developed into an
   authoritarian regime. The creation of a totalitarian system is hindered
   by the fact that in Russia, the western model of consumerism has taken
   hold. Furthermore, Russia's ruling elite is not pursuing any universal
   ideological goals, but is interested only in personal power and
   enrichment. The state institutions are characterised by a parasitic
   system of patronage and clientelism, in which secret service officials
   play a key role. By annexing Crimea and waging war against Ukraine, the
   regime spoke to imperial aspirations, while at the same time also
   fostering anti-Western resentment. This is not the way to achieve
   long-lasting legitimacy.},

Abstract = {Commenting on Australian Bicameralism as Semi-Parliamentarianism', this
   paper reconstructs the underlying justification of the issue-by-issue
   median as a rule of collective choice, a rule central to the theory of
   complex majoritarianism. In semi-parliamentary systems, this rule is
   institutionalised in parliamentary chambers that make law and policy by
   issue specific majorities. The comment questions whether it is necessary
   to balance the vision of complex majoritarianism with the principle of
   simple majoritarianism, arguing that the values of identifiability,
   clarity of responsibility and stability are instrumental rather than
   intrinsic values. It notes further problems with semi-parliamentarianism
   as a two-chamber system.},

Abstract = {Vladimir Putin's state-building project, which has included a war on the
   oligarchs', the reining in of regional power, the co-optation or
   marginalization of civil society and political opposition, and the
   establishment of a power vertical', has not been based on state
   strengthening but has had much more to do with regime consolidation. It
   is argued that, in the Russian case, the building of state capacity may
   not be a crucial factor in determining the medium or even the long-term
   survival of the authoritarian system. Although Russia has relatively
   weak state capacity, the Putin regime has remained stable. The regime's
   resilience is built on the distribution of rents among political and
   economic elites, the provision of social welfare, the coercion or
   co-opting of civil society and political opposition, and the
   mobilization of public support through the provision of economic
   benefits and national-patriotic appeal.},

Abstract = {Gun violence is one of the biggest social problems in Latin America. In
   recent years gunshot detection systems have been gaining relevance in
   the region as a technological tool that may reduce it. This article
   presents a review of gunshot detection technology, and attempt to
   examine its use in some Latin American countries. The main operating
   attributes of these systems are described, and researches conducted to
   evaluate their effectiveness in supporting police work and reducing gun
   violence and crimes are reviewed. Based upon the operating principles of
   these systems and considering the urban and demographic differences of
   the cities where they are used, the performance and effectiveness of the
   fire detection systems in the region are qualitatively examined.},

   states' workforce, investment in research and development (R\&D), and
   policy environment. The authors find statistically significant results
   in the areas of workforce education, migration of knowledge workers,
   industrial and nonindustrial R\&D, and policy to promote the development
   of the biotechnology industry. While the MANOVA for policies placing
   limits on the development of biotechnology policy did not yield
   statistical significance, the authors argue that the finding deserves
   further study as it may indicate some states' willingness to strike a
   more sustainable balance between support and regulation.},

Abstract = {Existing research on alternative forms of political participation does
   not adequately account for why those forms of participation at an
   ``everyday{''} level should be defined as political. In this article we
   aim to contribute new conceptual and theoretical depth to this research
   agenda by drawing on sociological theory to posit a framework for
   determining whether nontraditional forms of political engagement can be
   defined as genuinely distinctive from traditional participation.
   Existing ``everyday politics{''} frameworks are analytically
   underdeveloped, and the article argues instead for drawing upon Michel
   Maffesoli's theory of ``neo-tribal{''} politics. Applying Maffesoli's
   insights, we provide two questions for operationally defining
   ``everyday{''} political participation, as expressing autonomy from
   formal political institutions, and building new political organizations
   from the bottom up. This creates a substantive research agenda of not
   only operationally defining political participation, but examining how
   traditional governmental institutions and social movements respond to a
   growth in everyday political participation: nexus politics.},

Abstract = {This article explores the relevance of disinformation in international
   relations. It discusses the nature of information manipulation, ways to
   counter disinformation, and possibilities for international
   organizations, including the OSCE, to initiate confidence-building
   measures. The article suggests that although disinformation becomes an
   increasingly salient aspect of global politics, its security impact
   should not be overstated. As in domestic politics, international
   disinformation parasites on existing divisions and concerns, which it
   exploits rather than creates. This should not be trivialized.
   Disinformation is disruptive and it further deteriorates the overall
   international context. But as yet it is not a significant security
   challenge, and it does not change the international balance of power.},

Abstract = {This article focuses on the emerging phenomenon of Muslim women's
   entrepreneurial networks in France. It seeks to illustrate a causal
   relationship between a sociopolitical context where state secularism
   (laicite) has been abusively interpreted as a blank check to enforce
   religious neutrality in France, which has therefore inadvertently
   encouraged these entrepreneurial networks. As such, this article
   positions these networks as form of empowerment to overcome the sense of
   humiliation, isolation, and exclusion produced by the current context of
   state secularism in France, rather than solely an illustration of an
   independent entrepreneurial spirit. The labor market appears as a field
   in which social and political practices regulating religious visibility
   have been enacted within a context of religious tensions in French
   society rising since the late 1980s (Bauberot 2000). This occurs between
   the pre-eminence of individual freedoms in secularism and the
   anticlerical tendencies that can be inferred from recent decisions made
   by French courts. Based on observations of participants in two women's
   entrepreneurship networks made as part of my doctoral research on the
   impact of la nouvelle laicite on the lives of Muslim women in France,
   this article also draws on qualitative interviews with over 30 Muslim
   women entrepreneurs and dozens of participants involved in professional
   network initiatives. Because these networks are rapidly evolving and
   relatively new, my fieldwork data addresses a significant gap in the
   literature concerning this particular aspect of the debate concerning
   laicite. This study makes it possible to observe how in a key part of
   the private sectorthat of entrepreneurial self-employmentthe question of
   the place of religion and its expression in society is a consequence of
   a particularly French shift away from a common-sense duty of religious
   neutrality, the result of mounting layers of political debate over the
   hijab at schools, universities, and hospitals. The Baby Loup case
   legally confirms the gradual prohibition of public displays of religion
   outside of the public-sector work environment.},

Abstract = {Intended as a pilot flagship project under the Chinese-led Belt and Road
   Initiative (BRI), the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) has
   received relatively positive responses from actors in and outside the
   South Asian region. Islamabad, New Delhi, and Washington have offered
   their support to the project to varying degrees, because the financial
   commitments made by Beijing can help narrow the substantial funding gap
   for regional infrastructure connectivity. Nevertheless, enduring
   animosity and mistrust between India and Pakistan and growing strategic
   competition between Beijing and Washington present the biggest
   challenges to the project's sustainable progress. Although the unfolding
   U.S.-China competition has not tangibly affected regional cooperation,
   as Washington's enthusiasm for and investment in the U.S.-led
   Indo-Pacific Economic Corridor (IPEC) remain low compared with China's
   down payment, the potential change in the balance of power in South Asia
   has triggered increasing concern from and collaboration between the
   United States and India. By highlighting the positive-sum logic of
   improved infrastructure interconnection as well as greater economic
   integration, and contributing to a more stable geopolitical environment
   in South Asia, Beijing can help alleviate the longstanding enmity
   between India and Pakistan and assuage Washington's and New Delhi's
   skepticism about its strategic intentions.},

Abstract = {The cross-national comparative politics literature on authoritarian
   regimes has advanced rapidly in recent years, providing fresh insights
   into regime longevity, potential for successful democratization, and
   derivative policy choices. The study of North Korea's politics has
   likewise advanced, albeit largely without reference to this budding
   literature. Given the paucity of data on North Korea, this article
   reviews and leverages the budding comparative literature to bring new
   perspectives on perennial debates on North Korean regime stability. The
   article argues the comparative literature fails to capture evolution in
   authoritarian regimes, including North Korea, suggesting areas for
   theoretical improvement. It documents political evolution in Kim Jong
   Un's North Korea and draws upon cross-national findings to show how and
   why the one-party political structure, personalist elements, and
   hereditary succession identified in this analysis are stabilizing
   elements for the regime.},

Abstract = {Research on campaign strategies generally assumes that political parties
   avoid campaigning on issues that are internally divisive. However, this
   strategy might not always be viable, especially when parties attack each
   other in high-stake elections. This article provides novel evidence on
   the effects of campaigning on cross-cutting issues by focusing on the
   2015 U.K. general election in Scotland. Results based on an experiment
   and a nationally representative survey show that the strategy to
   criticize the Scottish National Party (SNP) with regard to the
   cross-cutting issue of Scottish independence polarized voters along
   national identity lines. Among British voters, attack statements and
   perceived negativity increased support for some of the parties
   sponsoring the attacks, whereas among Scottish voters they actually
   increased support for the target of the attacks. In addition,
   experimental results indicate that attack statements affected mainly
   ideologically close parties (the Labour Party and the SNP). At the
   theoretical level, these findings indicate that the strategy to attack
   opposite parties on divisive issues can lead to both electoral gains and
   losses depending on voters' ``identification{''} with such issues.},

Abstract = {This paper questions how the EU Member States handled the 2015 migrant
   crisis. The EU Humanitarian Aid Policy allows the coexistence of
   unilateralism, partial delegation and full delegation. Consequently,
   each EU Member State can also act autonomously. The paper records first
   the presence of different behaviours among EU Member States in the field
   of humanitarian aid. Second, it finds a correlation between states'
   concern for the defence of their sovereignty, facing the risk of
   `fragilisation', and the propensity to solidarity. Third, this
   correlation between fragility and solidarity has a causal direction that
   corroborates the research hypothesis according to which the higher the
   state fragility, the less its solidarity. Fourth, the article
   categorises the EU Member States into four groups according to their
   generosity.},

Abstract = {With high growth rates during the past two decades and the largest trade
   surplus with the United States, China is the primary target of the U.S.
   trade war efforts. Tariffs are the first shot in bilateral tensions that
   are multilateralizing and injuring global economic integration, coupled
   with ever more intense technology competition. The evolving global
   scenarios of U.S.-China trade and technology conflicts are the outcome
   of an ever more anxious America forsaking its multilateral cooperative
   stances for primacy doctrines. In the worst case, these conflicts may
   escalate into a ``decoupling{''} of both economies and cause lasting
   global recession and new geopolitical confrontation. This gloomy
   scenario has become viable with the exceptional use of executive power
   by the post-9/11 U.S. administrations. The Trump administration, in
   particular, is predicated on ``imperial presidency{''} that relies on an
   emergency status quo, new campaign finance, and ``big money,{''} which
   poses significant risks not only to U.S.-China relations, but also to
   American democracy and existing international order.},

Abstract = {Migrant remittances have been linked to improving the quality of
   government and political accountability in the developing world. The
   argument is that migrants have the capacity to withhold remittances to
   their families when they deem that their local governments are blighted
   with corruption and bureaucratic inefficiency. Relatedly, migrants also
   empower citizens in sub-national regions by providing funds to family
   members who become less beholden to clientistic ties with political
   parties which concomitantly foster state-level corruption. Thus,
   relatives of migrants also become social agents who will increasingly
   expect better governmental performance and demand higher levels of
   political accountability at the sub-national level. Using data provided
   by the Philippine National Statistics Office and the National
   Statistical Coordinating Board of the Philippines (NSCB hereafter), the
   study provides empirical evidence that the number of migrants (by
   province) and the amount of remittances sent by migrants are positively
   associated with governmental effectiveness and higher levels of human
   development at the provincial level. It is also found that opportunistic
   shirking on the part of the sub-national governments is also not
   occurring, as remittances also induce provincial governments to spend
   more on their citizens, which will likely lead to better public goods
   provision. The overall findings imply that just like their counterparts
   from other developing countries, Filipino migrants are agents of
   democratic accountability.},

Abstract = {In times of multiple crises and a looming partial breakup of the
   European Union, the question of what binds Europeans together appears
   more relevant than ever. This article proposes transnational attachment
   as a novel indicator of sense of community in Europe, arguing that this
   hitherto neglected dimension is substantially and structurally different
   from alternative ones such as cross-border trust and identification.
   Combining Eurobarometer 73.3 data on ties between all EU-27 countries
   with further dyadic data, it is shown empirically that the European
   network of transnational attachment has an asymmetric core-periphery
   structure centred on five extremely popular countries (the United
   Kingdom, France, Germany, Italy and Spain). In line with
   transactionalist theory, cross-border mobility and communication are
   strongly related to transnational attachment. Furthermore, the article
   demonstrates that the network of transnational attachment is much denser
   among those with a higher level of education than among those with a
   lower level. The results suggest that offering European citizens
   incentives to travel to peripheral countries may help counterbalance the
   current asymmetric structure of transnational attachment, thereby
   increasing Europe's social cohesion.},

Abstract = {How does contact with nonnatives affect immigration-related fears? While
   there is strong general support for the argument that intergroup contact
   decreases intergroup prejudice and fear, previous research arrives at
   mixed conclusions when applying this argument to the study of natives'
   attitudes toward immigrants. We propose that people's preexisting
   partisan affinities condition the effect of contact, which may explain
   the mixed findings. Building on the literature on motivated reasoning,
   we argue that contact reduces immigration-related threats among leftist
   voters, but have a threat-increasing or no effect among rightist voters.
   We find support for our argument using original surveys conducted in two
   very different contexts: the United States and Germany.},

Abstract = {Are there mechanisms by which the advantaged can see the perspectives of
   the disadvantaged? If advantaged individuals have prolonged engagement
   with disadvantaged populations and confront issues of inequality through
   national service, do they see the world more through the lens of the
   poor? We explore this question by examining Teach For America (TFA), as
   TFA is a prominent national service program that integrates top college
   graduates into low-income communities for two years and employs a
   selection model that allows for causal inference. A regression
   discontinuity approach, utilizing an original survey of over 32,000 TFA
   applicants and TFA's selection data for the 2007-2015 application
   cycles, reveals that extended intergroup contact in a service context
   causes advantaged Americans to adopt beliefs that are closer to those of
   disadvantaged Americans. These findings have broad implications for our
   understanding of the impact of intergroup contact on perceptions of
   social justice and prejudice reduction.},

Abstract = {Academics are increasingly using the concept of populism to make sense
   of current events such as the Brexit referendum and the Trump
   presidency. This is certainly a welcome development, but two
   shortcomings can be observed in the contemporary debate. On one hand,
   new populism scholars often start from scratch and do not build upon the
   existing research. On the other hand, those who have been doing
   comparative research on populism stay in their comfort zone and thus do
   not try to link their work to other academic fields. In this article, we
   address these two shortcomings by discussing some of the advantages of
   the so-called ideational approach to the comparative study of populism
   and by pointing out four avenues of future research, which are closely
   related to some of the contributions of this special issue, namely, (a)
   economic anxiety, (b) cultural backlash, (c) the tension between
   responsiveness and responsibility, and (d) (negative) partisanship and
   polarization.},

Abstract = {This research examines the degree to which legislators respond to their
   districts by analyzing immigration-related legislative speeches from the
   Swedish parliament (2005-16). Using a text-scaling method, we find that
   the immigration discourse fluctuates between ``socioeconomic
   responsibility{''} and ``cultural difference{''} poles. We argue that
   socioeconomic declines and extreme-right party success serve as an
   indication to MPs that there is demand for ``cultural difference{''}
   rhetoric on immigration. Our statistical analyses support the argument
   and demonstrate that district-level economic declines can lead to an
   increase in the salience of cultural framing of migrants, especially in
   districts with a higher share of foreign residents. We also find that
   district-level extreme-right electoral success has a significant
   influence on legislative immigration discourse. Overall, the results
   have implications for studies of legislative texts, dyadic
   representation, and the impact of the populist right on legislative
   politics in Europe.},

Abstract = {The claim that income drives political preferences is at the core of
   political economy theory, yet empirical estimates of income's effect on
   political behavior range widely. Drawing on traditions in economic
   history and anthropology, we propose using height as a proxy for
   economic well-being. Using data from the British Household Panel Study,
   this article finds that taller individuals are more likely to support
   the Conservative Party, support conservative policies and vote
   Conservative; a one-inch increase in height increases support for
   Conservatives by 0.6 per cent. As an extension, the study employs height
   as an instrumental variable for income, and finds that each additional
   thousand pounds of annual income translates into a 2-3 percentage point
   increase in the probability of supporting the Conservatives, and that
   income drives political beliefs and voting in the same direction.},

Abstract = {The fragmentation and polarization of party systems in Europe is
   increasingly hindering the construction of government majorities. In
   Spain, the 2016 crisis has shown that it may be impossible to form an
   executive at the beginning of the legislature and that this situation
   may continue after a new election. It seems clear that our electoral
   system no longer encourages the concentration of the vote, and that our
   parliamentary regime is not prepared to assimilate certain electoral
   results, which facilitates the reproduction of blockades and long
   interim periods. All this entails a serious risk of delegitimation of
   the political system. This paper analyzes the errors of the
   constitutional regulation and the different factors that contribute to
   produce such institutional paralysis. It also studies, in prevision of a
   future constitutional reform, the existing formulas in comparative law
   that would guarantee the appointment of a President of the Government
   after a general election.},

Abstract = {Foundations are traditionally viewed as civic-minded but politically

   involved in a wide variety of activities aimed at influencing public

   interest groups in the American political system. There are differences
   between conventional interest groups and foundations to be sure, but
   there are similarities as well. The choices foundations make as to
   whether to consciously try to influence government appears to be guided
   by organizational norms, regulatory requirements, and the beliefs of
   boards, donors, and internal leadership.},

Year = {2018},

Abstract = {``Indo-Pacific{''} is a new term in the geopolitical lexicon and a
   response to rapidly evolving global power shifts that currently induce
   strategic realignments among major regional players. It is increasingly
   used by political leaders, policymakers, journalists and academic
   commentators and in government documents. While Indo-Pacific is used
   frequently today, each proponent of the term attaches varied emphases,
   guided by their own strategic prisms. The Indo-Pacific concept has yet
   to be institutionalised. Some offshoots, such as the rebirthed idea of a
   quadrilateral framework among the key proponents of a ``free and open
   Indo-Pacific{''} and the proposal to jointly fund infrastructure
   projects in Asia, appear to be in direct competition with China's Belt
   and Road Initiative. How the Indo-Pacific concept would affect the
   regional power balance remains unclear. However, neither the concept nor
   the strategic thinking and actions it inspires will disappear anytime
   soon.},

Abstract = {Do perceived political threats lead to religious exclusion? This study
   explores the political rationale of the exclusionary attitude towards
   non-Muslim minorities in Turkey. It relies on a qualitative content
   analysis of the discussions on the Armenian, Greek and Jewish
   foundations in the Turkish parliament in the 2000s. While doing so, the
   research brings together the academic literatures on the perception of
   religious minorities in Turkey with the group threat perspective. The
   findings show that the exclusionary statements about the non-Muslim
   minorities are often justified by suspecting them as potential plotters
   of the dismemberment of the country. The article concludes that to
   achieve an inclusive political culture in Turkey, it is imperative to
   understand the perceived national security threats. It also underlines
   that parliamentary debates constitute an ideal resource for research,
   which deserves greater attention.},

Abstract = {Misperceptions and conspiracy theories about foreign powers and
   religious and ethnic groups can inflame intergroup conflict and distort
   public opinion, especially in divided and contentious regions like the
   Middle East and North Africa (MENA). Why do people acquire and maintain
   these false or unsupported beliefs? This study reports the results of a
   novel survey experiment examining conspiracy beliefs in the MENA region.
   We find that belief in conspiracy theories about the West, Jews, and
   Israel is widespread and strongly associated with generalized
   anti-Western and anti-Jewish attitudes, especially among individuals
   with high political knowledge. However, both experimental and
   observational data indicate that these beliefs do not appear to be the
   result of feelings of powerlessnessour findings provide little support
   for the hypothesis that a lack of control makes people more vulnerable
   to conspiracy theories.},

Abstract = {Tocqueville's insights on local politics in Democracy in America have
   led some scholars to ask where he fits into longstanding debates about
   the balance of power between the national government and state
   governments in American constitutionalism. Although Tocqueville's
   observations speak to these questions, he also transcends them by
   developing the concepts of governmental and administrative
   (de)centralization. In differentiating governmental and administrative
   capacities, Tocqueville offers language by which to understand and
   evaluate the federal system in terms of the nature of the authority each
   level of government exercises, rather than simply by the objects of
   national, state, and municipal powers. The purpose of this article is to
   clarify Tocqueville's understanding of governmental and administrative
   (de)centralization and thereby contribute to a better understanding of
   political authority in the American federal system.},

Abstract = {Public policies invariably confer or deny benefits to particular
   citizens. How citizens respond to relevant policies has fundamental
   implications for democratic responsiveness. We study the beliefs of a
   core constituency of one of the most celebrated sex non-discrimination
   policies in U.S. history: Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972.
   Using a novel survey of college student-athletes, we find strong support
   for the spirit of the policy, with the vast majority of respondents
   reporting the opinion that there should be equity. Concurrently,
   student-athletes also perceive mal-distribution among status quo
   resources and opportunities and believe that redistribution is needed.
   Furthermore, they are willing to take political action to improve
   equality. Consistent with our expectations, these beliefs are
   particularly salient for women and those who perceive persistent sex
   discrimination in society. Our results reveal positive policy feedback
   among policy beneficiaries of Title IX who mobilize to seek equity in
   athletics. The dissatisfaction among policy beneficiaries raises
   questions about democratic responsiveness (e.g., to whom are
   policymakers and leaders in college athletics responding?) and
   highlights the political nature of college athletics.},

Abstract = {What makes some lawmakers more effective than others is a central
   question in American politics. Recent research has emphasized the role
   of informal, persuasive leadership, but this research has focused almost
   exclusively on Congress, so it is unclear whether this approach to
   lawmaking is generally effective. Analysis of state legislatures is
   hampered by the lack of a theoretically sound and practically feasible
   measure of legislative effectiveness. I offer a solution to the primary
   problem with traditional hit rates. I apply this approach to North
   Carolina legislators and show my effectiveness estimates correspond with
   expert evaluations. I then examine recent terms of the Michigan,
   Georgia, and North Carolina legislatures to evaluate the relative
   importance of formal and informal powers at the state level. I
   hypothesize and find that informal, persuasive leadership is not
   effective in state legislatures where lawmaking is better explained by
   formal, hierarchical authority.},

Abstract = {Donald Trump won the American presidency in 2016 by overperforming
   expectations in upper Midwest states, surprising even Republican
   political elites. We argue that attitudes toward social change were an
   underappreciated dividing line between supporters of Trump and Hillary
   Clinton as well as between Republicans at the mass and elite levels. We
   introduce a concept and measure of aversion to (or acceptance of) social
   diversification and value change, assess the prevalence of these
   attitudes in the mass public and among political elites, and demonstrate
   its effects on support for Trump. Our research uses paired surveys of
   Michigan's adult population and community of political elites in the
   Fall of 2016. Aversion to social change is strongly predictive of
   support for Trump at the mass level, even among racial minorities. But
   attitudes are far more accepting of social change among elites than the
   public and aversion to social change is not a factor explaining elite
   Trump support. If elites were as averse to social change as the
   electorateand if that attitude mattered to their vote choicethey might
   have been as supportive of Trump. Views of social change were not as
   strongly related to congressional voting choices.},

Abstract = {This paper analyzes the factors influencing whether individuals have
   delegative democratic attitudes (i.e. supporting strong executive power
   with little oversight from the legislature). Roughly up to 50\% of
   voters in East Asia have delegative democratic attitudes, which are
   known to undermine democratic governance in new democracies.
   Understanding delegative democratic attitudes is thus closely linked to
   the question of why delegative democracy persists. Our theoretical
   analysis suggests that delegative democratic attitudes are associated
   with low support for democracy, a perception of the strong influence of
   interest groups on policy, and trust in a national leader who can
   counter the power of interest groups. Using Asian Barometer Survey data
   from East Asian countries, 2001-2011, we confirm the hypotheses. Our
   findings imply that transforming a delegative democracy into a
   consolidated democracy requires promoting support for democracy and
   preventing interest group dominance over public policy.},

Abstract = {Party rules for determining allocation of delegates to the Democratic
   and Republican national conventions once again drew criticism in 2016.
   Analyses of the effects of various rules indicate that the inclusion of
   party leader and elected official delegates (superdelegates) within the
   Democratic Party and use of winner-take-all primary elections by
   Republicans bias the representativeness of states' delegations to
   national conventions; neither the choice of primary election or caucuses
   nor of open or closed events affect representativeness. The choice of
   primary election or caucuses did affect vote percentages of candidates,
   but the choice of open or closed events had no effect on candidates'
   vote percentages in recent nominating contests. The basic conclusion is
   that the party rules that created biased, unrepresentative state
   delegations to national conventions and that benefited certain
   candidates in the 1980s continue to do so in the 21st century.},

Abstract = {Lin-Manuel Miranda's Broadway blockbuster Hamilton: An American Musical
   kept Alexander Hamilton on the \$10 bill and has transformed this
   unlikely founding father into a Broadway celebrity. But while Hamilton
   is currently seen as a heroic figure, throughout much of the nation's
   history he was seen as un-Americana closet monarchist who allegedly
   hated the people, the great beast. Many progressive historians and
   biographers repeated distorted accounts first circulated by Thomas
   Jefferson and his lieutenants, all of whom were determined to ruin
   Hamilton's reputation. While Lin-Manuel Miranda restored Hamilton to his
   proper standing as a key American founder, he too has misrepresented the
   real Hamilton. The real Alexander Hamilton was a statesman devoted to
   the rule of law and to moderation and possessed a healthy aversion to
   utopian schemes.},

Abstract = {The aim of this article is to examine whether core personality traits
   are associated with opinions on and engagement in political
   participation of either participatory or deliberative nature. The Finish
   National Election Survey 2015 is used to explore the link between the
   Big Five personality dimensions and a wide array of political opinions
   and behaviour. The results suggest that variations in personality to
   some extent affect what kind of activities one prefers and engages in.
   Personality traits seem to better predict actual engagement in
   participatory and deliberative activities rather than having favorable
   opinions about them. This suggests that there is a difference between
   being positive about an activity in principle and actually engaging in
   it. Extraversion and Openness are positively linked to engagement in
   both participatory and deliberative activities, while Agreeableness and
   Emotional stability are negatively related. There are stronger effects
   of personality traits in predicting opinions on and engagement in
   deliberative activities than for participatory activities. The traits
   associated with deliberation differ from traits associated with
   preferring more traditional forms of politics. Thus, the results clearly
   suggest that the impact of personality on participation should not be

Abstract = {Taxation is considered an important reason for the persistent inequality
   in developing countries. Developing countries tend to rely heavily on
   revenue from regressive taxation on consumption, such as the value-added
   tax, and fail to use progressive income taxes for revenue. Thailand is a
   typical case of those developing countries. Scholars argue that the
   median voter model does not apply to the developing countries because
   their ineffective income taxation results from the weak representation
   of the poor. A close examination of tax politics in Thailand, however,
   demonstrates that the low revenue from income taxation in Thailand is
   attributed to the strong representation of the poor rather than the weak
   one. This study details the process of Thai tax reform based on
   interviews with policymakers in Bangkok. It traces changes in the
   country's tax regulations and uses tax data collected at both the local
   and national level. Tax reforms, particularly those on income taxes
   after the 1997 financial crisis, have resulted in a decreased tax burden
   on the poor as well as the rich.},

Abstract = {This article explores the ways in which Willa Cather's early novels
   about life on the prairies demonstrate how the struggle to survive and
   prosper on the frontier can teach important political virtues, but not,
   in Cather's depiction, the individualistic virtues of self-reliance and
   independence so often idealized in American political thought and
   literature. Instead, Cather shows how these experiences shaped prairie
   communities that were bound together by settlers' recognition of their
   shared vulnerabilities and mutual dependence. In her writings, Cather
   further demonstrates how artists can play a political role by crafting
   an alternative, if romanticized, story of American democracy and the
   virtues necessary to sustain it.},

Abstract = {This article explores the determinants of the allocation of
   parliamentary posts to specific legislators. Using an original data set
   of biographical information and committee assignments for almost 10,000
   legislators in five non-presidential democracies (i.e. Finland,
   Luxembourg, Norway, Portugal, and Spain), we provide evidence that
   distributive posts are more likely to be allocated to electorally
   vulnerable members of parliament, mainly under candidate-centered
   electoral rules. We also show that posts in high-policy committees are
   usually assigned to prominent legislators within the parties. Contrary
   to what one could expect based on the literature on candidates'
   incentives to cultivate a personal vote, we find that the effect of
   district magnitude on the distribution of legislative posts does not
   depend on the type of list.},

Abstract = {The presidential nominating contests of 2016 were extremely fertile
   ground for hypothesizing by media analysts about alternative outcomes.
   Lacking much theoretical grounding, most of these were almost destined
   to be embarrassed by actual eventsand 2016 proved extremely good at
   that. Yet the practical collapse of these journalistic hypotheticals
   does raise insistent theoretical questions, most of which are variants
   of one central puzzle: Were the nominating dynamics of 2016 ever very
   different from those of previous years? If so, how? If not, why not?
   There is in fact an established theoretical approach in political
   science with which to frame some answers. This article sets out to embed
   those answers within that established wisdom.},

Abstract = {The system of government in Turkey shifted from a parliamentary to an
   intrinsic presidential system, in which the president solely employs the
   executive power granted from the constitution, after the elections held
   on June 26, 2018. Following the elections, the central government was
   reorganized in quite a short time. While the reorganization process will
   continue for a certain period, it seems that the main policymaking
   actors and their role in the new system have substantially emerged. This
   study provides a legal and institutional analysis of how the public
   policy process and the roles and responsibilities of policy actors
   changed as a result of the restructuring of Turkey's central government
   under the new presidential system.},

Abstract = {Current research demonstrates that instances where leaders' promises and
   actions are inconsistent leads to lower public approval and support.
   While there are exceptions to this trend there is no cohesive framework
   to address this issue. We introduce a conceptualization where public
   reactions to a leader's inconsistency is placed in a broader context of
   public perception of the leader's overall competency. We claim the
   public evaluation of the leader is dependent on her competency. And
   while inconsistency of a particular act can negatively affect public
   evaluations of the leader, the extent of that effect is conditioned by
   leaders' competency. To test this perspective we experimentally
   manipulate both the competency of the leader as well as her consistency
   in following up on her promises. Furthermore, we expand the context of
   inconsistency to include both international and domestic domains. We
   find both leaders' competency and inconsistency matter in public
   approval. Our findings hold across policy domains and levels of issue
   salience.},

Abstract = {The introduction of the ``Polar Silk Road (PSR){''} into the first
   comprehensive white paper on Arctic policy is a historic step for
   China's Arctic engagement. Over the past few years, China has achieved
   policy synergies and launched industrial, scientific and technological
   cooperation with Russia and Nordic countries. With enlarged interests
   and enhanced capabilities, China is becoming a preferred partner for
   Russia and Nordic countries in a number of infrastructure, energy and
   transportation projects within the Arctic region. The PSR framework to
   advance Arctic cooperation under the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI)
   presents both economic opportunities and social as well as environmental
   challenges for Chinese enterprises to balance the utilization and
   protection of the Arctic.},

Abstract = {Foundations in China's nonprofit sector have been increasing in both
   number and importance. However, scholarly research and nonacademic
   reports have left a question in the literature waiting to be answered:
   What led to the recent development and landscape of foundations in
   China? To answer this question within the framework of ``manufactured
   civil society,{''} the typological method was used, in which 3342
   foundations founded before 2014 were divided into seven types with
   regard to their founders and policy-related issues, namely
   government-created, corporate, school, family, religious, community, and
   independent. The results show that, to a large degree, (1) the
   government has been one of the major drivers behind the foundations'
   development and (2) the government's attitude and policy toward
   foundations have shaped and will continue to shape the foundation
   landscape in China.},

Abstract = {What makes people feel influential in politics? While prior studies
   describe political efficacy as a stable and socialized trait, I argue
   that feelings of effectiveness in politics follow from the actions of
   politicians and the design of government. When state governments afford
   citizens opportunities for voice and deliver desired policy outcomes, I
   expect that citizens feel more politically effective. Using a set of
   unique items from the 2014 Cooperative Congressional Election Study, I
   investigate how factors like policy congruence, descriptive
   representation, election administration, and ballot initiatives shape
   people's feelings that politicians are responsive to their concerns. I
   find that people feel more efficacious in state politics when they have
   greater opportunities for political voice and when their concerns are
   reflected in the policy process.},

Abstract = {Although anonymity is a central feature of liberal democracies-not only
   in the secret ballot, but also in campaign funding, publishing political
   texts, masked protests, and graffiti-it has so far not been conceptually
   grounded in democratic theory. Rather, it is treated as a
   self-explanatory concept related to privacy. To overcome this omission,
   this article develops a complex understanding of anonymity in the
   context of democratic theory. Drawing upon the diverse literature on
   anonymity in political participation, it explains anonymity as a highly
   context-dependent identity performance expressing private sentiments in
   the public sphere. The contradictory character of its core
   elements-identity negation and identity creation-results in three sets
   of contradictory freedoms. Anonymity affords (a) inclusion and
   exclusion, (b) subversion and submission, and (c) honesty and deception.
   This contradictory character of anonymity's affordances illustrates the
   ambiguous role of anonymity in democracy.},

Abstract = {Lately, the communicative variable of insurgent mobilization begins to
   appear in studies on recent history in Latin America. However, this
   phenomenon has been addressed previously from other disciplines,
   particularly from the studies on communication promoted by Anglo-Saxon
   researchers. This article analyzes the academic production centered on
   the relationship between communication and revolution in Latin America,
   particularly those works that have researched on the media produces by
   the Latin American guerrilla organizations. Based on a critical study of
   this production, the author proposes an inclusive analysis model that,
   from an interdisciplinary perspective, allows to overcome the study of
   cases and approach the dissemination strategies and insurgent
   communicative productions within the framework of a general strategy of
   revolutionary mobilization.},

Abstract = {To build a political economy of trade, it is important to understand not
   only the demand for protection but also the supply of trade policy. The
   policy preferences of the public and special interest groups are
   filtered through political institutions creating winners and losers in
   trade policy formation. This article examines the impact of constituency
   size on the supply of trade protection. Although a number of political
   economy models make assumptions about the effect of constituency size on
   policy makers, recent studies testing the microfoundations of the theory
   have failed to find support for the claim that smaller constituencies
   produce higher levels of trade protection. It is argued that the main
   effect of constituency size is creating responsiveness to regional
   interests. It is found that electoral pressure from import-competing
   sectors drives policy makers from small constituencies' preferences
   toward the Trans-Pacific Partnership in Japan. Furthermore, legislators
   from small constituencies are more responsive to regional sectoral
   interests than legislators from large constituencies. These finding lend
   support for the constituency size hypothesis.},

Abstract = {We consider a one-dimensional model of electoral competition with
   national and regional parties. There are two regions and three
   partiesone national party and one regional party for each region. We
   divide the paper into two partshomogeneous and heterogeneous regions. In
   the former, the policy positions of the national party and the regional
   party of the region with the greater number of constituencies coincide
   with the favorite policy position of the region-wide median voter. In
   the latter, the national party chooses a policy position in a maximal
   isolation set, while the two regional parties choose policies on the
   same side of the national party's policy as their own respective
   region-wide medians. For a given outcome function, the national party
   performs better when the regions are heterogeneous. In the homogeneous
   regions case, the national party can at best do as well as the regional
   party of the region with the greater number of constituencies. Our
   results are broadly consistent with intuition and evidence.},

Abstract = {I address the debate in this journal about the effects of strict voter
   ID laws on voter turnout rates of whites and minorities. Although some
   noteworthy disagreements remain, the exchange has nonetheless resulted
   in methodological advancements and agreement among the authors on some
   of the substantive findings. After focusing the discussion on key areas
   of remaining disagreement, I discuss several ongoing concerns.
   Specifically, the authors do not actually estimate key quantities of
   interest, the analyses uncritically combine different kinds of elections
   where ID laws are likely to have different effects, and no reasonable
   theory exists to explain why ID laws would increase overall voter
   turnout beyond the short term.},

Abstract = {This paper intends to verify the possibilities and the features of the
   ideal taxation trying to associate it with a fair one. Using the
   deductive method as well as making references to doctrines,
   jurisprudences and legal norms, this study aims to associate the fair
   taxation to the ability to pay principle. Through a historic perspective
   trying to link the taxation phenomena to several forms of economic
   capacity, it's proposed that, in fiscal capitalistic States, a fair
   taxation could be achieved if it's goes hand in hand with an
   individual's taxable expression of wealth.},

Abstract = {Violence is a subject of high historical recurrence in Colombia, which
   is why its dynamics have been approached from different approaches; some
   approaches seek to analyze the objective and subjective processes;
   others, in the light of the actors (victim-victimizers). This paper
   analyzes the opportunities generated by collective actions for the
   creation of public policies that guarantee the recognition of victims in
   specific contexts of violence. This study started with a conceptual
   review of three main categories: ``collective action{''}, ``contexts of
   violence{''}, and ``public policies{''}, from the hermeneutical

Abstract = {Democracy is an abstract and murky concept. This is particularly
   apparent in the wide variety of beliefs about democracy held by publics
   around the globe. Within democracies, political parties often define and
   name themselves with reference to a particular understanding of
   democracy. This article focuses on this partisan division in
   understanding democracy. We suggest that parties will attract those who
   share similar beliefs about democracy. Specifically, we look at whether
   differences in beliefs about democracy predict party support in the
   United States. Examining the responses of US participants to the fifth
   wave of the World Values Survey, we find that differences on a number of
   essential aspects of democracy among individuals predict vote intent
   (and party identification). Those more likely to understand democracy as
   a form of government that promotes civil liberties and the
   redistribution of wealth to protect the vulnerable are more likely to
   vote Democrat. Those who report stronger associations between democracy
   and both religious interpretation of laws and severe punishment of
   criminals are more likely to vote Republican. This research reinforces
   the idea that policy differences between the two main parties in the
   United States may derive from different understandings of the role of
   government in society.},

Abstract = {The article presents the research ``Memoirs of political exile in
   Colombia 1980-2010{''}, which sought to understand exile as one of the
   acts of victimization of the armed conflict, recognizing oral memory as
   the axis that articulates memory and political action. The research was
   oriented from a qualitative approach, resorting to methodological tools
   such as the documentary record, interviews and focus groups. The
   analysis and processing of the information was made from a critical
   discourse analysis, using analysis matrices. The article discusses the
   results of the research process regarding the current situation, in
   which there are tensions in the compliance and implementation of the
   peace agreement signed between the FARC and the national government.},

Abstract = {An advisory committee with common values and asymmetric information
   provides a recommendation to a decision maker facing a binary choice. We
   investigate the effect of a transparency requirement-requiring committee
   members' actions to be observable-on the committee's ability to
   influence the decision maker. We show that unless the preferences of the
   committee and decision maker are sufficiently close, requiring
   transparency eliminates the committee's ability to provide any useful
   information. In contrast, if preferences are very close or if committee
   members are able to verifiably reveal their signals then transparency is
   beneficial.},

Abstract = {In his Rivers of Blood' speech, and in several speeches in subsequent
   years, Enoch Powell claimed that immigration was an issue of numbers'.
   Britain could not, he believed, accommodate a significant number of
   non-white people without threatening the existence of the nation. I
   argue that Powell's opposition to immigration, and his numerical framing
   of it, rested upon his racialised conception of British, or English,
   nationhood. As he was shunned by political elites, Powell articulated an
   increasingly populist nationalism. Drawing repeated references to
   Britain's wartime experiences, Powell claimed that the British, or more
   often the English, were being attacked by an immigrant enemy without,
   and betrayed by an establishment enemy within. I conclude with some
   reflections on the similarities between Powellite nationalism and
   contemporary discourses about national identity during and since the
   European Union referendum.},

Abstract = {There is considerable debate about how election timing shapes who votes,
   election outcomes, and, ultimately, public policy. We examine these
   matters by combining information on more than 10,000 school tax
   referenda with detailed micro-targeting data on voters participating in
   each election. The analysis confirms that timing influences voter
   composition in terms of partisanship, ideology, and the numerical
   strength of powerful interest groups. But, in contrast to prominent
   theories of election timing, these effects are modest in terms of their
   likely impact on election outcomes. Instead, timing has the most
   significant impact on voter age, with the elderly being the most
   overrepresented group in low-turnout special elections. The electoral
   (and policy) implications of this effect vary between states, and we
   offer one explanation for this variation.},

   its nuclear primacy with a clearer strategy of assured destruction
   against any rivals, China has encountered greater pressure to further
   modernise its nuclear forces. In highlighting the enhanced credibility
   of its retaliation-based nuclear deterrence under the no-first-use
   doctrine, China is enhancing command and control of nuclear forces,
   upgrading its nuclear triad, and constructing its early warning and
   rapid response capabilities. However, with a further destabilising
   global nuclear order, more normative challenges have been plaguing
   China's nuclear modernisation.},

Abstract = {This article considers social media as a radicalization venue within the
   context of terrorism. The 2016 extremist/terrorist attack in Orlando,
   Florida showed the potential of an ISIS type extremist organization to
   leverage social media toward a lethal outcome within American society.
   While the ISIS organization originated overseas in a culture of which
   mainstream American society is unfamiliar, it is in many ways remarkable
   the level of success they quickly achieved connecting globally. Their
   efforts reflect the potential of social media to market a message of
   radicalism worldwide toward generating murderous converts who are
   willing to travel to join the fight or attack at home. Given these
   notions, this article considers the use of social media as an extremist
   cyber-recruitment tool.},

   Experimental Evidence from Kosovo},

Abstract = {An emerging literature points to the heterogeneous effects of violence
   on social norms and preferences in conflict-ridden societies. This
   article considers how responses to violence could be affected by
   in-group/out-group divisions. The research uses lab-in-the-field
   experiments to gauge norms for pro-social behavior in the aftermath of
   ethnic violence in post-war Kosovo. The study finds that one set of
   treatments (ethnicity) captures a negative legacy of violence on
   parochialism, while another (local/non-local) shows stronger evidence of
   pro-sociality and norm recovery. Examining individual variation in
   conflict exposure, it finds that victims of violence are more biased
   against ethnic out-groups and less pro-social to others outside of their
   local community. Balancing and matching on observables helps alleviate
   concerns that the results are driven by selection bias on victimization.
   Overall, the results suggest that the effects of violence may be
   contingent on the salience of in-group/out-group cues and boundaries.},

Abstract = {Undoubtedly, the ALBA-TCP, is a proposal of antisystem integration,
   which aims to generate a cooperation model with great ideological
   elements. In this sense, its promoter, the late president of Venezuela,
   Hugo Chavez Frias, proposed a new form of collaboration among the
   peoples that left behind the old prevailing integration schemes and
   consolidated, in this way, a new block where the political would have a
   primordial role in the framework of it. This article presents the
   foundations and current challenges that the ALBA-TCP presents from the
   point of view of geopolitics and its possibilities of survival, given
   the current situation of the international and American context. This
   article analyzes this cooperation scheme based on qualitative research
   and the consultation of diverse sources, which gives elements to make
   projections regarding its effectiveness or not in the area of the
   political reality of the region, concluding that it crosses a delicate
   situation given the instability of its promoter country (Venezuela),
   which makes its future uncertain.},

Abstract = {The article is part of the debate about the state of art of IPE research
   in Latin America and, particularly, on the necessity to develop broader
   perspectives about the development of the IPE subfield in Brazil.
   Inspired by the critical literature concerning the knowledge production
   in the periphery of IR, the assumption here is that the understanding of
   the IR field pathways discloses the limits and potentials of indigenous
   knowledge production in diferent regions and places. Shows therefore,
   the article aims to present an exploratory research proyects about the
   academic research on IPE in Brazil from 2000 to 2015, notably in regard
   to articles published in Brazilian journals daries this period.},

Journal = {AMERICAN POLITICS RESEARCH},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {46},

Abstract = {The U.S. Senate is a party-polarized institution where divisive
   political rhetoric stems from the partisan divide. Senators regularly
   chastise political opponents, but not all senators are equally critical.
   Research finds that elite party polarization is asymmetrical with
   greater divergence by Republicans, so I expect Republican senators to
   mimic that trend with higher levels of partisan rhetoric. To assess the
   variance in partisan rhetoric, I catalogue senators' Twitter activity
   during the first 6 months of the 113th and 114th Congresses, and find
   that Republicans are more likely to name-call their Democratic opponents
   and to make expressions of intraparty loyalty, particularly when they
   are the minority party.},

Title = {Assessing the contextual stability of moral foundations: Evidence from a
   survey experiment},
Journal = {RESEARCH \& POLITICS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {5},
Number = {2},
Month = {JUN 20},
Abstract = {Moral foundations theory (MFT) claims that individuals use their
   intuitions on five virtues as guidelines for moral judgment, and recent
   research makes the case that these intuitions cause people to adopt
   important political attitudes, including partisanship and ideology. New
   work in political science, however, demonstrates not only that the
   causal effect of moral foundations on these political predispositions is
   weaker than once thought, but it also opens the door to the possibility
   that causality runs in the opposite directionfrom political
   predispositions to moral foundations. In this manuscript, I build on
   this new work and test the extent to which partisan and ideological
   considerations cause individuals' moral foundations to shift in
   predictable ways. The results show that while these group-based cues do
   exert some influence on moral foundations, the effects of outgroup cues
   are particularly strong. I conclude that small shifts in political
   context do cause MFT measures to move, and, to close, I discuss the need
   for continued theoretical development in MFT as well as an increased
   attention to measurement.},

Abstract = {The year 2015 marked the deadline for finishing the Millennium
   Development Goals (MDGs) as the United Nations (UN) member states
   launched the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development with its
   Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The UN 2030 Agenda encompassing 17
   goals and 169 targets aims at eradicating global poverty, combating
   inequalities and utilizing natural resources in a sustainable manner so
   that ``no one is left behind.{''} All stakeholders have committed to
   proceeding with the incomplete agenda of the MDGs and achieve the SDGs
   by 2030. Also in 2015, China initiated the China-Pakistan Economic
   Corridor (CPEC), a collection of projects to develop energy, industry
   and communication infrastructure costing US\$46 billion as a key part of
   the ``Belt and Road Initiative (BRI).{''} This paper examines different
   components of the CPEC and explores the extensive convergence between
   the main goals envisioned under the CPEC and the universally accepted
   SDGs. It posits that if successfully implemented, the CPEC will
   contribute to achievement of various SDGs in Pakistan. While it is
   expected that the CPEC will enable the country to move forward on a
   number of SDGs, three goals are particularly relevant to the
   construction of the CPEC. The paper argues that there is immense
   potential for convergence, commonality, and division of labor for a host
   of bilateral and multilateral actors to enhance the Global Partnership
   for Sustainable Development (SDG17), resolve political differences,
   participate in the CPEC, and contribute to the implementation of the UN
   2030 Agenda even beyond Pakistan in the broader South Asian region.},

Abstract = {Turbulent relations between Turkey and its Western allies, as well as
   the country's drift into the arms of Russia, are putting strains on the
   NATO alliance and raising questions about Turkey's role within it. A
   Turkish exit from NATO, previously considered out of the realm of
   possibility, is now an option that is gaining currency In this article,
   the author explores the scenario of a Turkish exit from NATO, weighing
   the strategic benefits and drawbacks that would affect both. The author
   posits that while Erdogan brought profound changes to both the domestic
   and international sphere, Turkey and its NATO allies are bound to
   recognize that the strategic benefits linking them ultimately outweigh
   current frictions.},

Abstract = {This article is based on the premise that trust emerges and is shown to
   the world as an act. This act is simultaneously given and read
   contextually, which implies that trust requires regularity so that the
   act itself obtains results; therefore, confidence is generated in the
   experience that is configured in the correlation between human beings;
   as a result, trust has a double role: as a motivator and as an
   implicator in others. Based on an ontological understanding of trust,
   the article illustrates the way in which this is a pilar for democracy
   and civic education and its relevance in contexts of formation for
   peace. Finally, the text exposes some elements of the ideas raised by
   the pedagogy of trust and the pedagogies of alterity that integrate
   trust as an epistemological foundation of them, with the intention of
   reflecting on: the repositioning of practice, pedagogical knowledge, and
   the importance of didactics under critical and intercultural practices.},

Abstract = {One of the persistent concerns and conflicts faced by social scientists
   who study different aspects of Indian society and politics pertains to a
   methodological divide. This divide is constituted by a separation of
   methods into the quantitative and qualitative broadly. While these two
   categories cover a wide range of methods and techniques of research and
   data collection, they have also been treated as representing two
   polarities of the social sciences, often seemingly opposed. This note
   will explore the division between the quantitative and qualitative.(3)
   While we feel that any divide in method and theory is counterproductive
   to the larger project of studying political life, we want to try and see
   how this separation can be bridged without necessarily forcing
   cohabitation. By looking at the survey as a method, this note is an
   initial attempt to engage in a dialogue between quantitative- and
   qualitative-oriented scholars and to perhaps consider how the two groups
   are far closer than they think.},

   representative landmarks of the forms of processing social unrest
   generated by the Chilean political-institutional field during the period
   between the presidential election of 1999 and the last year of the first
   Michelle Bachelet government (2009). The ``retorica cosista{''} deployed
   in the 1999 presidential campaign, the ``Acuerdo para la modernizacion

   resolved, the creation of the Consejo asesor presidencial{''} in
   response to the ``Revolucion Pinguina{''} of 2006 and activation of the
   policy of ``bonos{''} in the context of the economic crisis of 2009. it

Abstract = {Immigration policy over the last decade has been characterized by
   sustained congressional inaction, unilateral executive action, and an
   intensification of policy activity at the state and local level. The
   combination of immigration federalism and congressional fecklessness
   means that, in spite of radical differences in policy intent, Donald
   Trump's nativist agenda faces constraints similar to those that
   undermined Barack Obama's integrationist agenda. The failure to chart a
   consistent legislative course for national immigration policy has
   propelled centrifugal forces at the state and local level, with three
   consequences. First, state and local governments have grown increasingly
   assertive in pressing their claims to policy authority via legislation,
   resolutions, executive actions, and court challenges. Second, wide
   policy differences have emerged across states, as have policy
   contradictions and conflicts within some states. Finally, while the
   federal government retains plenary power over immigration policy, the
   breadth of state and local laws governing immigrant lives increasingly
   constitutes a de facto encroachment into that authority.},

   Strategic Think Tank Behaviour},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF POLITICS CULTURE AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {31},
Number = {2, SI},
Pages = {179-192},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Expert advice is gaining importance in advanced-knowledge societies. The
   demand for scientific knowledge increases as political decision-makers
   look for answers to cope with the ever more complex challenges of a
   globalised world. At the same time, scientific evidence has become a
   strategic resource capable of justifying world-views and political
   positions. Against this background, the `global spread' of think tanks
   seems to respond to this growing demand for scientific expertise.
   Defining what a think tank is, let alone what they do and if they are
   able to effectively shape political ideas, is still a controversial
   issue. This contribution outlines a conceptual framework for analysing
   the strategies of different types of think tanks in distinct
   institutional environments. Starting with classical typologies to
   distinguish between organisations, those which adhere to standards of
   scientific inquiry at one end of a continuum and ideologically biased
   institutes at the other, the analytical model takes into account
   distinct `points of intervention' and systematically considers the
   respective institutional and ideological environment. The first
   dimension allows for distinguishing between distinct effects of
   political ideas: They can influence decision-making as concepts in the
   foreground or as underlying assumptions in the background of policy
   debates. At the cognitive level, they can function either as programmes
   (foreground), serving as policy prescriptions for the political elite
   necessary to formulate actual agendas, or as paradigms (background).
   Considering different `knowledge regimes' permits to test the influence
   of respective institutional and normative settings and simultaneously
   assess the assumptions and convictions underlying these models and
   typologies.},

Abstract = {According to Leo Strauss, one of the primary purposes of the esotericism
   practiced by philosophers is the defense against persecution. This
   defense entails communicating the truth only to philosophers and
   concealing it from non-philosophers. For many commentators, this
   conception of esotericism has inegalitarian implicationsfor example,
   that the philosophers, who constitute a minority of people, are
   naturally capable of being told the truth, while the non-philosophers,
   who constitute a majority, are not. In this article, I argue that
   Strauss gives another account of esotericism that does not have
   inegalitarian implications. He gives this account in his discussion of
   Farabi's esotericism in the ``Introduction{''} to Persecution and the
   Art of Writing. I also argue that Strauss presents this account
   esoterically. The ``Introduction{''} reproduces text from an earlier
   article by Strauss, ``Farabi's Plato,{''} and Strauss makes certain
   changes, which point towards this other account. Finally, I explain why
   Strauss presents this other account esoterically.},

Abstract = {Think-tanks and their researchers are located within an interstitial and
   ill-defined `space between fields'; a space both constituted and divided
   by the worlds of academia, politics, journalism and business. This
   liminal position can be problematic for a think-tank researcher's
   intellectual credibility as they lack the recognised cultural and
   symbolic capital derived from being located within an established
   profession's jurisdiction. The question arises, how do think-tanks gain
   intellectual credibility? Drawing on interviews with think-tank
   researchers, this paper explores how these interstitial intellectuals
   produce policy reports. In following this process, we find that
   credibility emerges from a complex web of relationships across
   established fields/professions. Think-tank researchers must engage in a
   complex `dance' of positioning the symbols, capitals and interests of a
   number of professions. To maintain their integrity, researchers must try
   to keep in step with competing interests from different professions; at
   times aligning them, at other times blocking or obscuring them from one
   another.},

Abstract = {The majority of Canada's women premiers were selected to that office
   while their parties held government. This is uncommon, both in the
   comparative literature and among premiers who are men. What explains
   this gendered selection pattern to Canada's provincial premiers'
   offices? This paper explores the most common explanation found in the
   comparative literature for women's emergence as leaders of electorally
   competitive parties and as chief political executives: women are more
   likely to be selected when that party is in crisis or decline. Using the
   population of women provincial premiers in Canada as case studies,
   evidence suggests three of eight women premiers were selected to lead
   parties in government that were in crisis or decline; a fourth was
   selected to lead a small, left-leaning party as predicted by the
   literature. However, for half of the women premiers, evidence of their
   party's decline is partial or inconclusive. As a result of this
   exploration, more research is required to draw generalizations about the
   gendered opportunity structures that shape how women enter (and exit)
   the premier's office in Canada.},

Abstract = {A central concern for experimental studies is participant motivation,
   which is crucial for internal validity. When participants are not
   committed to the task, internal validity diminishes because responses
   might not be authentic. This study introduces and tests the seriousness
   technique as a method for increasing participant investment in political
   science experiments that use student samples. The seriousness technique
   aims at creating a sense of responsibility by telling students that
   their participation is important because science needs quality data.
   Results from a computer-assisted foreign policy decision-making
   experiment show that the seriousness technique increased the degree of
   information participants access during the foreign policy simulation and
   the time they spent on the study. These findings suggest that political
   scientists who use student samples in their experiments can nurture
   serious subjects by employing the seriousness technique. It is argued
   that the results should be of interest not only to experimentalists but
   also to all scholars who use human subjects, including survey
   researchers, in their research.},

Abstract = {In the last twenty years in Latin America, the arrival of the government
   of some countries of political currents that define themselves as
   progressive is verified. This historical event revitalized the debate
   regarding the viability, pertinence, and characteristics that the
   welfare state should assume in the twenty-first century. In this
   context, the present article is interested in emerging social practices
   that redefine the senses that the public space has. Practices that go
   beyond the National States that are situated in global territoriality,
   that articulate languages, that excite emotions, able to produce new
   socialities. The multitude is discussed as a social subject capable of
   generating transformative practices. Specifically, it analyzes how the
   singularities of occupations raise further questions for nation states.
   It is used for the analysis the encamped in the squares by global
   movements like \#Occupy.},

Abstract = {This review article brings together six recent books on democratisation.
   They cover Africa, Latin America, the Middle East, East Central Europe
   and the Balkans, Eurasia, and East and South East Asia. The review asks
   what we can learn from reading about democratisation in different parts
   of the world. The aim is twofold: to identify regionally specific
   processes of democratisation and to explore cross-regional
   commonalities. When viewed in combination, these regional studies of
   democratisation reveal the limitations of area studies and the need for
   comparative area studies. Cheeseman N (2015) Democracy in Africa:

Journal = {AMERICAN POLITICS RESEARCH},

Volume = {46},

Abstract = {Recently, Americans have become increasingly likely to hold
   anti-intellectual attitudes (i.e., negative affect toward scientists and
   other experts). However, few have investigated the political
   implications of anti-intellectualism, and much empirical uncertainty
   surrounds whether or not these attitudes can be mitigated. Drawing on
   cross-sectional General Social Survey (GSS) data and a national election
   panel in 2016, I find that anti-intellectualism is associated with not
   only the rejection of policy-relevant matters of scientific consensus
   but support for political movements (e.g., Brexit) and politicians
   (e.g., George Wallace, Donald Trump) who are skeptical of experts.
   Critically, though, I show that these effects can be mitigated. Verbal
   intelligence plays a strong role in mitigating anti-intellectual
   sympathies, compared with previously studied potential mitigators. I
   conclude by discussing how scholars might build on this research to
   study the political consequences of anti-intellectualism in the future.},

Abstract = {The problem of the 21st century in the knowledge domain is best rendered
   as the `epistemic line'. It cascades directly from William E B Dubois's
   `colour line' which haunted the 20th century and provoked epic struggles
   for political decolonisation. The connection between the `colour line'
   and the `epistemic line' is in the racist denial of the humanity of
   those who became targets of enslavement and colonisation. The denial of
   humanity automatically disqualified one from epistemic virtue. This
   conceptual study, therefore explores in an overview format, how Africa
   in particular and the rest of the Global South in general became victims
   of genocides, epistemicides, linguicides, and culturecides. It delves
   deeper into the perennial problems of ontological exiling of the
   colonised from their languages, cultures, names, and even from
   themselves while at the same time highlighting how the colonised refused
   to succumb to the `silences' and fought for epistemic freedom. The
   article introduces such useful analytical concepts as `epistemic
   freedom' as opposed to `academic freedom'; `provinciali sation\%
   `deprovincialisation\% `epistemological decolonisation'; `intellectual
   extroversion'; and `epistemic dependence'. It ends with an outline of
   five-ways-forward in the African struggles for epistemic freedom
   predicated on (i) return to the base/locus of enunciation; (ii) shifting
   the geo-and bio-of knowledge/moving the centre; (iii) decolonising the
   normative foundation of critical theory; (iv) rethinking thinking
   itself; and finally (v) learning to unlearn in order to relearn.},

Abstract = {In this note we use dyadic data to address the issue of the spread of
   political regimes in Sub-Saharan Africa from 1977 to 2014. Dyadic data
   are binary relationship between countries and provide a data-rich
   environment for the study of international relations. We address the
   issue of correlation between these dyadic observations, which generates
   a cluster of dependent observations associated with that country. We
   find that borders matter, since often the effect of home- and
   foreign-grown variables have differentiated effects on democracy in one
   country.},

Abstract = {To better understand the relationship between information and political
   knowledge, we evaluate an ambitious government initiative: the
   nationwide dissemination of taxpayer receipts, or personalized, itemized
   accounts of government spending, by the UK government in fall 2014. In
   coordination with the British tax authorities, we embedded a survey
   experiment in a nationally representative panel. We find that citizens
   became more knowledgeable about government spending because of our
   encouragement to read their receipt. Although baseline levels of
   political knowledge are indeed low, our findings indicate that
   individuals are capable of learning and retaining complex political
   information. However, even as citizens became more knowledgeable, we
   uncover no evidence that their attitudes toward government and
   redistribution changed concomitantly. The acquisition and retention of
   new information does not necessarily change attitudes. Our results have
   implications for citizens' capacity to learn and research on the
   relationship between knowledge and attitudes.},

Month = {APR},
Abstract = {How do civilians respond to civil war narratives? Do they react to
   ethnic frames more strongly than to alternatives? Governments and rebels
   battle for hearts and minds as well as strategic terrain, and winning
   the narrative war can shift legitimacy, popular support, and material
   resources to the sympathetically framed side. We examine the effect of
   one-sided and competing war discourses on ordinary people's
   understandings of the Syrian civil war-a conflict with multiple
   narratives, but which has become more communal over time. We conduct a
   framing experiment with a representative sample of Syrian refugees in
   Lebanon in which we vary the narrative that describes the reasons for
   the conflict. We find that sectarian explanations, framed in isolation,
   strongly increase the importance government supporters place on
   fighting. When counterframed against competing narratives, however, the
   rallying effect of sectarianism drops and vanishes.},

Abstract = {Comparable household income measures are crucial for most social science
   analyses of cross-national public opinion survey data. However, income
   questions in many cross-national surveys suffer from comparability and
   interpretability limitations that have not been adequately addressed by
   the existing literature. In this article, we examine the income measure
   in one major survey, the World Values Survey (WVS), arguing that a
   variety of problems arise when drawing inferences-descriptive or causal,
   individual or aggregate-using the standard ten-category measure. We then
   propose and implement a number of corrections to these potential biases
   and present a series of diagnostics that confirm the importance of our
   proposed corrections. We conclude by documenting some of the same
   challenges in the income measures used in other cross-national surveys.
   The accompanying data set can be merged with the WVS to make better use
   of the income measure.},

Abstract = {Donald Trump dominated the 2016 Republican primary despite the fact that
   he was not, in any meaningful sense, a Republican. Bernie Sanders came
   just shy of winning the Democratic nomination despite the fact that he
   switched his party affiliation from Independent to Democrat only three
   months before the election. Why did two candidates with no formal ties
   to the political parties fare so well? One possibility is that primary
   voters are more ideologically extreme and that ideology drives support
   for these candidates. However, another possibility is that concerns
   about government process drives support for insurgent candidates. We
   test the proposition that distrust was the primary motivator of primary
   voting for these two insurgent candidates using two datasets: a poll of
   New Hampshire voters fielded a week before their primary and a national
   poll taken in June 2016. Results confirm the hypothesis that distrust
   drove intraparty vote choice in the 2016 presidential primaries.},

Abstract = {In contrast to non-partisan Get Out the Vote (GOTV) campaigns, political
   parties do not aim to increase turnout across the board. Instead, their
   principal goal is to affect the outcome of an election in their favor.
   To find out how they realize this aim, we carried out a randomized field
   experiment to evaluate the effect of campaign visits and leafleting by
   Conservative Party canvassers on turnout in a marginal English
   Parliamentary constituency during the 2014 European and Local Elections.
   Commonly-used campaign interventions, leaflets and doorknocks, changed
   the composition of the electorate in favor of the Conservative Party,
   but did not increase turnout overall. Supporters of rival parties,
   particularly Labour self-identifiers, were significantly less likely to
   mobilize in response to Conservative campaign contact than Conservative
   supporters. In contrast to the non-partisan GOTV literature, we show
   that impersonal campaign leaflets were as effective in shaping the local
   electorate in the Conservative's favor as personal visits. The common
   practice of contacting all constituents irrespective of their party
   preferences was effective as a campaign tactic, but had no civic
   benefits in the aggregate.},

Abstract = {Diverse identities coexisting within the same society are often viewed
   as problematic for economic and political development. This article
   argues that different types of social diversity have differential
   effects on regime type. Specifically, ethno-linguistic diversity
   increases prospects for democracy while religious diversity decreases
   prospects for democracy. The article presents a variety of reasons why
   diversity might have divergent causal effects on regime type.
   Cross-national regressions in a variety of econometric formats -
   including instrumental variables - provide corroborating evidence for
   the argument.},

Abstract = {European Union (EU) law is based upon a liberalising imperative, the
   goal of which is to construct a single market between member states.
   Yet, the EU is no ordinary trade pact, incorporating as it does a range
   of supranational political institutions and common policies in a range
   of areas beyond simple market building. Scholars have nevertheless noted
   a distinction between positive' integration (the formulation of common
   policies applying to all member states) and negative' integration (the
   removal of national-level regulations acting as barriers to market
   integration). In the context of debates about the implications of trade
   law and corporate activity for health, this article poses three related
   questions. First, to what extent does EU law afford corporations
   opportunities to challenge national-level health regulations? Second, to
   what extent do EU legal and political processes provide opportunities
   for positive pro-health supranational regulation, including that which
   might offset the effects of negative liberalising integration? Third,
   how do EU market-building processes differ from those of more narrowly
   drawn trade agreements and organisations in their implications for
   health? We analyse and compare two recent sets of health-related legal
   proceedings under EU law, the first of which challenges legislation
   passed by the Scottish Government to introduce minimum unit pricing for
   alcohol, and the second of which addresses the legality of specific
   aspects of the EU's 2014 Tobacco Products Directive. We find, first,
   that EU law offers ample opportunities for corporations to challenge
   national health regulations; second, that there is significant scope for
   pro-health supranational regulations, but that these must be couched in
   the language of facilitating the single market, and are dependent on the
   political commitment of key policy actors; and, third, that this (albeit
   limited) scope for pro-health supranational regulation distinguishes EU
   legal and political processes from those of other trade agreements and
   organisations.},

Abstract = {This article provides the first systematic examination of the voting
   motivations of Conservative MPs in the final parliamentary ballot of the
   Conservative Party leadership election of 2016. We identify the voting
   behaviour of each Conservative parliamentarian as part of a unique data
   set that we use to test, through the use of multivariate analysis, a
   series of hypotheses based around social background variables (i.e.
   gender and education); political variables (i.e. parliamentary
   experience, electoral marginality, the electoral threat posed by UKIP
   and ministerial status); and ideological variables (i.e. attitudes
   towards same-sex marriage and Brexit). Our findings demonstrate that
   ideology did matter in terms of voting. Attitudes towards Brexit were
   central to the appeals of both Theresa May (to Remainers) and Andrea
   Leadsom (to Leavers). We also demonstrate that in terms of support for
   Leadsom, Brexit was not the only significant driver, as opinion on
   same-sex marriage, year of entry and ministerial status also influenced
   voting behaviour.},

Abstract = {Research on presidential distributive politics focuses almost
   exclusively on federal domestic spending. Yet, presidential influence on
   public policy extends well-beyond grant allocation. Since the early 20th
   Century, for example, the president has had substantial discretion to
   adjust tariff schedules and non-tariff barriers ``with the stroke of a
   pen.{''} These trade adjustments via presidential directive allow us to
   test the logic of presidential particularism in an area of policy
   understudied among presidency scholars. We examine unilateral
   adjustments to US trade policies between 1917 and 2006, with a detailed
   analysis of those made between 1986 and 2006, and find that
   presidents-in accordance with electoral incentives-strategically
   allocate trade protections to industries in politically valuable states.
   In general, states in which the president lacks a comfortable electoral
   majority are systematically more likely to receive protectionist
   unilateral orders. Overall, our results show that the president's
   distributive imperative extends into the realm of foreign affairs, an
   arena in which the president has substantial authority to influence
   public policy.},

Abstract = {There has been an international trend in recent years towards voters
   casting an early ballot. In the 2016 Australian federal election almost
   one in three votes were cast in this way, most of them in person using
   pre-polling centres. This trend towards early voting raises both
   normative and practical questions about the purpose of election
   campaigns and how they are conducted, as well as what party advantage
   may be gained from the process. This paper applies multivariate analysis
   to the 2016 Australian Election Study to test four hypotheses related to
   early voting. The results show that early voters have less trust in
   politics and are less likely to participate in the election. There are
   small but consistent electoral advantages to be gained from early voters
   for the Liberal-National Coalition.},

Abstract = {Studies of political budget cycles in developing countries have
   generally sought to inform understanding of short-term fiscal dynamics,
   but can also offer unique insight into broader political dynamics in
   developing countries. This article correspondingly employs markedly
   improved data in order to study the impact of elections on tax
   collection, and draw broader lessons. It shows that while elections as a
   group have had no significant effect on tax collection, the subset of
   competitive elections has had a significant negative impact on
   pre-election tax collection; while this effect appears to be largest
   where incumbents are particularly unpopular. This provides powerful
   evidence that the impact of elections on political incentives in
   developing countries is conditioned by the existence of an electorally
   competitive opposition, while offering preliminary evidence that popular
   resistance to taxation by unpopular governments may be an important
   means by which taxpayers may generate pressure for improved governance.},

Abstract = {Many theories of war duration draw directly from theories of war onset.
   The implication of this theoretical diffusion is that there are not
   separate theories of war onset and war duration as much as there are
   broad theories of foreign policy decision making and strategic
   interaction that can be applied to explain both these phenomena. This
   article aims to show the theoretical connections between explanations of
   war onset and war duration in several important areas of international
   relations theory, including information, commitment credibility,
   domestic politics, and psychological dynamics. Recognizing the
   conceptual overlap between theories of war onset and duration helps to
   build foundations for more unified theoretical accounts of war and to
   provide directions for future theoretical and empirical research on war
   duration.},

Abstract = {6 A rich theoretical literature argues that, in contradiction to
   Duverger's law, the plurality voting rule can fail to produce two-party
   system when voters do not share their common information about the
   electoral situation. We present an empirical operationalization and a
   series of tests of this informational hypothesis in the case of India
   using constituency- and individual-level data. In highly illiterate
   constituencies where access to information and information sharing among
   voters is low, voters often fail to coordinate on the two most viable
   parties. In highly literate constituencies, voters are far more
   successful at avoiding vote-wastingin line with the informational
   hypothesis. At a microlevel, these aggregate-level patterns are driven
   by the interaction of individual information and the informational
   context: In dense informational environments, even low-information
   voters can successfully identify viable parties and vote for them, but
   in sparse informational environments, individual access to information
   is essential for successful strategic voting.},

Abstract = {New interest in ``multi-winner ranked-choice voting{''} raises old
   questions about effects on party cohesion. Earlier scholars thought this
   single transferable vote (STV) rule was net-problematic for parties.
   This paper consults the roll-call and electoral records in Cincinnati
   (1929-57) and Worcester, Mass. (1949-60), two of three American STV
   implementations that produced conventional wisdom. First, I show how
   party cohesion could be high or low. Then I show how low-cohesion terms
   followed elections in which candidates campaigned for themselves over
   their parties. Finally, I show that parties endorsed such candidates
   when they needed the votes to expand their seat shares. In sum, the data
   suggest a strategic environment in which majority-seeking parties reach
   beyond their traditional bases - potentially at the expense of
   legislative cohesion. Whether that is good or bad depends on the value
   we give to cohesion.},

Abstract = {Previous empirical research has demonstrated that war has negative
   duration dependence: the longer a war has already lasted, the harder it
   is to end. Many arguments have been advanced to explain this, including
   bargaining or commitment problems, domestic politics, entrapment
   dynamics, sunk costs, and cognitive and emotional biases. Drawing on
   recent empirical and experimental research in neuroscience, psychology,
   and stress physiology, this article will examine the micro-dynamics of
   human decision making in high-stress situations (such as prosecuting and
   negotiating to end a war) in order to connect these many approaches. In
   high-stress environments, cognitive functioning usually depletes over
   time, decreasing top-down regulation of emotions and stress arousal, and
   thereby increasing subcortical influence on decision making. Depleted
   cognitive functioning also decreases tolerance of uncertainty and
   ambiguity, two states endemic to the war termination process, which
   further exacerbates subcortical influence on decisions. As a result,
   actors' ability to absorb and accurately assess information and to make
   effective decisions may be undermined. This article also connects these
   micro-dynamics of decision making under stress to some of the arguments
   previously advanced to explain war's negative duration dependence.},

Abstract = {The article is the first to explore the Icelandic legal framework for
   sports with a focus on gender equality. The underlying principles of the
   current legal framework, domestic and international obligations as well
   as government policy and funding arc analyzed, applying doctrinal
   methodology. Due to the structural formation of sports in Iceland, the
   article also examines the Icelandic sports association and to what
   extent gendered perspectives are reflected in its structure, bylaws and
   policy. The main conclusion is that the state does have an obligation to
   ensure gender equality in sports in Iceland. The article suggests some
   legal uncertainty as regards the extent of this responsibility, not
   least due to the distributed structure of legal responsibility of sports
   in Iceland. The distinction between sports as an organized recreational
   or youth activity on one hand and as a part of the work market on the
   other, calls for further studies concerning recent legal amendments
   demanding equal pay for equal work under the Gender Equality Act. The
   findings of the article highlight that there is room for improvement
   concerning the promotion of gender equality in Icelandic sports. The
   authors suggest a number of efforts for public authorities and the
   sports movement in Iceland to improve the situation.},

   among the electorate. We take advantage of Washington's 2012 charter
   school ballot initiativethe first voter-approved charter initiative in
   the United Statesto shed light on the politics of school choice at the
   mass level. Because in-depth, individual-level voter data are often
   unavailable in state-level elections, we leverage extensive precinct-
   and district-level data to examine patterns of support and opposition
   toward the charter school initiative, focusing on how partisanship,
   ideology, and demographic factors serve to unify or divide voters. Our
   analysis reveals that the coalition of supporters cut across usual
   partisan and demographic cleavages, producing somewhat strange
   bedfellows. This finding has important implications for the strategies
   advocacy groups may consider as they seek to expand or limit school
   choice programs via ballot initiatives as opposed to the statehouse, and
   provides suggestive evidence regarding the evolving shapers of voter
   support for school choice and ballot initiatives more generally.},

Abstract = {The EU-Turkey Customs Union of 1995 has been economically beneficial for
   both parties, and its revamping could go a long way towards improving
   the relationship between Brussels and Ankara, despite the numerous
   obstacles present. In this article, the authors argue that in its
   current form, the Customs Union no longer meets the requirements of a
   21st century trade agreement. Its modernization should include the
   signing of a free trade agreement covering agriculture, services, public
   procurement, investment protection, dispute settlement, and sustainable
   development. While difficult to achieve for Turkey these are necessary
   steps if the country wants to remain a competitive player in the world
   economy and increase its exports and FDI inflows.},

Abstract = {Recent decades have been marked by increasingly divided partisan opinion

   Results suggest that Canada has experienced a surge in partisan sorting
   that is comparable to that in the US. Over time, like-minded citizens
   have increasingly clustered into parties, with increasingly stark
   divisions between partisans.},

Abstract = {In the aftershock of the financial crisis many scholars and
   practitioners criticized the perceived loss of democratic control of
   national tax states. Many of these arguments are based on the assumption
   that democracies ought and should pursue policies that reflect the
   preferences of the majority of society. Hence, more democratic countries
   are expected to have higher tax ratios and more progressive tax systems
   than their autocratic counterparts. Yet, within the literature on regime
   type and taxation this assumption is more and more challenged. In this
   article, I summarize the arguments on the effect of democratic and
   autocratic institutions on the size and progressivity of tax states and
   test the effect of regime type on tax ratios and progressive taxation
   for 138 countries since the 1980s. My analysis illustrates that more
   democratic countries have higher tax ratios since the end of the Cold
   War. Yet, this effect varies over time and regime type plays no role for
   progressive taxation in general. Economic development on the other hand
   matters for both progressivity and size of the tax state. Income matters
   mostly for the tax state, not regime type.},

Abstract = {The current research examines the cross-national relationship between
   income and gender inequality as well as their interconnected influences
   on both female and male homicide victimization. Using a sample of 127
   heterogeneous countries, this research supports previous studies that
   economically stratified societies tend to have high levels of lethal
   violence. The study also finds that economically stratified societies
   tend to be male-dominated, which is also associated with increased
   violence against women as well as increased male-on-male violence.},

Abstract = {Stijn van Weezel and Michael Spagat (2017) have critiqued our 2011
   report of mortality in Iraq following the 2003 US-led invasion in this
   issue of Research \& Politics. In this response, we make our case for
   reporting both direct and indirect excess war-related deaths (while
   distinguishing the difference), defend our efforts to account for
   survival bias, and provide evidence for including all household-reported
   deaths, not just those cases where a death certificate can be
   demonstrated. We also point out Van Weezel and Spagat's misunderstanding
   of our sample selection method, despite our citation of our separate
   paper that thoroughly describes our approach.},

Abstract = {Vigorous extra-parliamentary public debate over the question of union
   helped to ensure that Scotland brought into the Union of 1707 a sense of
   itself as a nation with national opinions. Though the parliamentary
   electorate remained small, a meaningful number of Scots engaged in
   public political debate on the question of union. Petitions from shires,
   burghs and parishes spoke for local communities and pamphleteers
   presented Scottish voices through archetypal figures such as a `country
   farmer'. This allowed opponents to declare that incorporating union was
   inconsistent with `the publickly expressed mind of the nation'. After
   the Union, extra-parliamentary national opinion continued to be
   expressed and sustained by the Scottish press and petitions,
   contributing to the maintenance of Scottish national identity within the
   United Kingdom.},

Journal = {AMERICAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {112},
Number = {1},
Pages = {112-124},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {This article reintroduces a long-forgotten argument into the debate
   about social justice: Durkheim's argument from organic solidarity, as
   presented in The Division of Labor in Society. Organic solidarity is
   solidarity based on differentiation. According to Durkheim, it grows out
   of the division of labor, but only if the latter happens spontaneously.
   Social inequality creates obstacles to such spontaneity because it
   distorts prices, such that they are perceived as unjust, and it
   undermines equality of opportunity. Hence, Durkheim's argument connects
   commutative justice and distributive justice. The article argues that
   Durkheim's argument is plausible, interesting, and relevant for today.
   After presenting the argument, discussing its structure and methodology,
   and evaluating its plausibility by drawing on related contemporary
   debates, it focuses on the problem of the perception of social justice
   and the possibility of ideological distortions. It concludes by
   sketching the research program that follows from Durkheim's argument.},

Abstract = {The pamphlet war which surrounded the debates of the proposed Union
   between Scotland and England in 1707 has frequently been dismissed as a
   mere sideshow to the main events that took place in the Scottish
   Parliament. Until recently, the accepted viewpoint was that as only the
   landed elites possessed the vote, it was only they who could decide the
   political destiny of the country - the wider populace was largely an
   irrelevancy. However, the political speeches of the Scotsman, John
   Hamilton, Lord Belhaven, and the response to those speeches, by English
   man of letters, Daniel Defoe, suggests that the poetry and prose
   generated by these intense debates had a purpose to speak directly to
   the people, and to galvanise them for a cause, despite their lack of a
   direct political voice. This article investigates the importance of
   Belhaven's speeches in an attempt to understand why they had so much
   resonance with the general public, and the extent to which his opponents
   attempted to contain his appeal to the people.},

Pages = {7+},
Abstract = {For centuries, the Russian Empire and the Ottoman Empire dominated vast
   areas of southern and south-eastern Europe. When territorial expansion
   turned small principalities into empires, the Ottoman Empire developed a
   pre-modern system of integration in the form of the Millet System
   through the issuing of rights and privileges to non-Islamic religious
   communities. The Russian Empire co-opted local elites, too, but it
   exerted stronger pressure for assimilation. The expansion of the Ottoman
   Empire to the northern shore of the Black Sea during the 15th century
   and the advance of the Grand Duchy of Moscow towards the south and east
   during the mid-16th century created the basis for competition between
   the two empires. From the second third of the 17th century onwards,
   Moscow and the High Porte waged an ongoing war that lasted for 200 years
   in the south of what is now Ukraine and in the Caucasus. In the long
   term, the Ottoman Empire was the weaker one. This was not so much the
   result of a more backward social order, but had to do with the fact that
   as a Christian state, the Russian Empire was better positioned within
   the European power system.},

Title = {DISTRICT VS REGION: RACE FOR POWER AND SELF-GOVERNMENT IN NOGAI
   DISTRICT OF DAGESTAN (Event Analysis of the 2017 Election Campaign)},
Journal = {POLIS-POLITICHESKIYE ISSLEDOVANIYA},
Year = {2018},

Pages = {112-126},
Abstract = {In the spring - summer of 2017 in the Nogai District of the Republic of
   Dagestan protest actions of the local public were held against the
   interference of regional (Dagestani) authorities in matters of local
   self-government, i.e. the election of the head of the municipal
   district. Agents of the regional authorities, using the procedure of
   competitive selection of candidates for the post of head of the
   municipal formation, tried to influence the outcome of the election
   campaign. These events became the reason for the ethnopolitical
   mobilization of the Nogai from all over Russia. Nogais living in other
   parts of Russia, as well as the diaspora living in Kazakhstan, expressed
   their solidarity for their fellow Nogais after the events in Dagestan.
   The escalation of the conflict was also influenced by the ethnically
   homogeneous district, which allowed accumulating the mobilization
   potential of the ethnic identity of Nogais. The present paper is an
   attempt to clear up the logic of development of contemporary
   ethnopolitical processes in the North Caucasus basing on the event
   analysis of the struggle for power and protests in the Nogai District of
   Dagestan.},

Title = {National heroes or coming anarchy? Vigilant youth and the ``war on
   terror{''} in Nigeria},
Journal = {CRITICAL STUDIES ON TERRORISM},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {11},
Number = {2},
Pages = {272-294},
Abstract = {In this article, I explore analytically how local youth vigilante groups
   in terror-stricken northeastern Nigeria - locally known as the Civilian
   Joint Task Force or yan gora ({''}youthwith sticks{''}) - are responding
   to threats to their communities posed by the terrorism of Boko Haram and
   the human rights abuses of the Nigerian security forces. The article
   argues that vigilantism has been a way for victimised local youth to
   reclaim a sense of control and agency in a context of risk, radical
   uncertainty, powerlessness and heightened fear. While one group of
   victimised and angry youth (Boko Haram) in northeastern Nigeria are
   violently resisting the state, another group of victimised and angry
   youth (yan gora) from the same region are joining forces with the state
   to protect members of their local communities and to restore peace to
   their troubled region. However, growing concerns that the yan gora are a
   ``coming anarchy{''} have compelled state-endorsed youth empowerment
   schemes geared at integrating the militia into Nigerian security
   service, while regulating their actions and instilling patriotism and
   discipline in its members. Yet, such hybrid security arrangements may
   end up reproducing the very insecurity they were meant to forestall.},

   Rights within the Spanish constitutional framework. Firstly, we set the
   main core of the right, both the substantive and procedural aspects.
   Secondly, we take a look to the implementation in Spain, in order to
   find how, why, and when the interpretation given by the Strasbourg
   Case-Law has been implemented by national authorities. Thirdly, to that
   extent, we study the national answers, paying attention to the
   Constitutional Case-Law and to some legal reforms. Lastly, we give a
   bunch of provisional conclusions.},

Abstract = {In the last years there has been a resurgence of the right in the
   western world. But what has caused that? Economic, cultural and
   religious disputes and immigration are some of the causes that may
   explain why a significant portion of the population of developed
   countries should credit the right-wing ideology with hope for the
   resolution of the problems that are present in the twenty-first century.
   In particular, on the religious question, Islamic fundamentalism can be
   cited, perhaps as the main factor that is strengthening the right in the
   northern hemisphere. This religious extremism has led to several
   terrorist attacks throughout the Western world. Thus, one begins to
   understand the reason for the election of right-wing leaders, like
   Donald Trump, in the United States of America. This is precisely the
   profile of the leader sought by those who defend this ideological
   current to serve as a buffer against the growth of terrorism. Someone
   outside the establishment, who fights against the traditional forces
   that have acted in the politics and economy of post-World War II;
   someone capable of guaranteeing the country's sovereignty in times of
   globalization. The speech of this new Right has in common the
   nationalism and the anti-liberalism. In order to substantiate this
   paper, the authors proceeded with qualitative and bibliographical
   research, carried out through national and foreign books and
   periodicals.},

Volume = {55},

Abstract = {The article reflects on the forming conditions of the subjects in
   political action assuming the centrality of the body as a tool for the
   analysis. We assume the hypothesis that the language of politics needs a
   body to materialize. There are two substantial parts. In the first part
   of the article, more theoretical, we revise some of the key milestones
   for the renewal of the concepts and its consequences for the formation
   of subjectivity. We propose a Spinozist concept of body understanding
   the body as a set of emotions, as an affected space in which emotions
   are materialized and, at the same time, as an active space in the
   production of meaning. In the second part we analyze a case study. The
   thesis is that the self-consciousness of ``national degeneration{''}
   that surrounded the political environment at the end of Nineteenth
   century in Spain was formed on the fear of the contaminated body, the
   dissemination of the feelings of disgust, or the shame and stigma of
   poverty. They were emotions that shaped the political bodies of the XX
   century mass society. More concretely, the socialist movement that broke
   into the political scene in 1890 as a mass movement is the result of the
   politicization of the abject body, the workers body, as a receiving and
   creating instance of signs and meanings.},

Abstract = {The popular Peruvian saying that ``one suffers, but enjoys{''}
   summarizes the year 2017 nicely. The year saw numerous social,
   political, and economic difficulties in Peru. The incumbent government
   had to face the ravages of El Nino, ministerial crises, and vacancy
   requests, among other things, while at the same time the economy was
   slowing down and poverty increasing. However, we believe that for most
   Peruvians, 2017 was also a joyous year, especially considering the
   agonizing classification of the Peruvian team in advance of the World
   Cup after 36 years of absence. In this article, we summarize the social
   and political context of 2017, focusing on the executive-legislative
   axis that determined the most important political events during the year

Journal = {LABORATOIRE ITALIEN-POLITIQUE ET SOCIETE},
Year = {2018},
Number = {21},
Abstract = {The study of the prophetic motives in the Vita civile by Matteo Palmieri
   highlights the religious and mystical foundations of this text, which is
   a significant product of Florentine political humanism of the first half
   of the 15th century. This prophetic basis allows the humanist to
   interlace the temporality of a ``rebirth{''} and the patriotic
   temporality. This intention, both political and cultural, is undoubtedly
   linked with Cosimo de' Medici's access to power, but it also reveals a
   structural dimension of Florentine humanism: its tendency to recover a
   remote and idealized past in order to break with a closer past, thus
   redefining and shaping the collective expectations of the political
   community. In that sense, Palmieri's civic uses of prophecy are
   testimony to how political humanism is involved in shaping a thought of
   civic cohesion which appears as a common experience of time. This
   experience is not only based on the exaltation of Antiquity but also on
   a lay prophetism elaborated with multiple elements of the Christian
   prophetic tradition.},

Abstract = {Presidential libraries hold a bounty of archival records, which is why
   National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) responses to Freedom
   of Information Act (FOIA) requests constitute a vital data source.
   However, standard protocols impose an inferential dilemma: researchers
   get the released sample without much information about the broader
   population, making it impossible to appraise the former relative to the
   latter. Drawing on a large FOIA request (and successful appeal) from the
   George W. Bush Presidential Library, this study affords such a test.
   Results show NARA archivists typically withheld outwardly unimportant
   records-e.g., weekends, holidays, and other uneventful days-though
   ``response set{''} may have occasionally affected their
   redact-or-withhold decisions. After demonstrating how even seemingly
   innocuous omissions can bias estimates of presidential behavior, the
   study concludes with practical advice for researchers submitting FOIA
   requests to presidential libraries.},

Journal = {CITIZENSHIP STUDIES},

Volume = {22},
Number = {2, SI},
Pages = {129-144},
Abstract = {Faced with unresponsive and intimidating bureaucracies, citizens across
   particularly the global south regularly rely on intermediaries to gain
   access to public services. Focusing on how such brokers arrange access
   to health care in Indonesia, this essay discusses the impact of brokered
   state-citizen interaction on the character and experience of
   citizenship. On the basis of extensive fieldwork in both urban and rural
   Java we argue that brokers not only enable the realization of citizen
   rights, they also transform the experience and interpretation of these
   rights. Brokers vernacularize' citizenship, in the sense that
   citizenship comes to be experienced and interpreted not just in terms of
   a formal relationship with a national state, but also in terms of the
   character of personal relationships and attendant obligations that exist
   between citizens, brokers and power holders.},

Abstract = {If it is a requirement of justice that everyone has access to basic
   goods and services, then justice requires that the work that is
   necessary to produce the relevant goods and provide the relevant
   services is performed. Two widely accepted views, however, together rule
   out requirements of justice to perform such work. These are, roughly,
   that the state cannot force people to perform it, and that individuals
   are not obligated to perform it voluntarily. Lucas Stanczyk argues that
   we should resolve this inconsistency by endorsing widely rejected
   coercive policies, such as compulsory service requirements. I argue that
   Stanczyk's proposal fails to fully resolve the inconsistency, and that
   any acceptable resolution will entail that individuals can be obligated
   to voluntarily perform the necessary work. I conclude that accepting
   even modest requirements of access to basic goods and services requires
   rejecting the view that principles of justice do not apply directly to
   individual conduct.},

Journal = {QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {13},
Number = {2},
Pages = {207-236},
Abstract = {In the last generation, congressional moderates have become
   ideologically more extreme over the course of their careers. We explain
   this ``ideological migration{''} of moderates as a side effect of close
   partisan competition for control of the US House since 1994. Competition
   for the House caused activists, donors and, indirectly, voters to focus
   on the battle for majority status. Increased attention to partisan
   competition reduced individual members' ability to escape blame for
   their parties' actions. Equivalently, it meant that members could
   deviate from their district preferences and pay a lower electoral
   penalty; they would be blamed in any event. Our empirical analysis shows
   that party-centeredness abruptly and dramatically increased after 1994,
   with the electoral penalty members paid for being out of step with their
   constituents correspondingly declining. This contributed to an
   important, albeit complicated, shift from local/personal to
   national/party representation.},

Abstract = {Traditional American Government textbooks are expensive and often
   unpopular with students. New technologies and Open Educational Resources
   (OERs) open up the potential for change, but questions of quality are
   ever present: can OERs really help students learn better, or are they
   just cheaper? I developed an OER based on original sources and compared
   student learning outcomes with the OER section to those in a free
   digital textbook section. While the OER I created did not work as well
   as I had hoped, I nonetheless developed a redesign of my course and my
   approach to teaching, which is the true benefit of adopting OERs.},

Title = {Seneca's De Clementia. An Overlooked Chapter in the Genealogies
   of Representation and Sovereignty},
Journal = {POLITICKA MISAO-CROATIAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {55},
Number = {4},
Pages = {36-58},
Abstract = {In the article, Seneca's figure is rehabilitated as relevant to
   understanding the emergence of sovereignty and modern representation.
   The idea put forth by the author of De Clementia would become one of the
   bases for Bodin's writings and is also present in Hobbes' work. During
   the Renaissance, De Clementia promoted monarchical forms.
   In De Clementia, this Stoic philosopher presents Nero in a
   depersonalised form. He is not only the sovereign capable of shaping a
   multitude, representing it in its whole and giving it the character of
   ``people{''}, but also one who secures peace and rules with justice.
   Thus, in Seneca, one can discern a proto-theory of sovereignty and
   representation, with decisionism as its result.
   If these readings of Seneca are plausible, genealogies of modern
   concepts that interpret their emergence as a revolutionary Trennung
   (e.g. Schmitt and early Conceptual History) (Lehmann and Van Horn
   Melton, 1994; Lehmann and Richter, 1996) could be facing a problem of
   omission. The conceptual support for the process through which the
   medieval social and political world was destroyed and substituted by
   modernity does not come from Cicero's republican tradition, but from a
   monarchical notion of unity among the governor and the governed; an idea
   defended by Seneca, according to which absolute sovereignty would
   guarantee private property, contracts, and a sui iuris apolitical soul.},

Abstract = {It is a conventional claim in Argentine history analysis that the
   agrarian production is economically and politically dominated by large
   landlords who, on this basis, have the capacity to decisively determine
   the course of the national economy. This article critically examines the
   empirical basis and arguments underneath this conception. To this end,
   this article firstly examines the arguments and main empirical evidence
   presented in the specialized literature that support the idea of an
   economically powerful landlord class' existence. In the second part, it
   focuses on the political potentiality of what is commonly recognized as
   the main political organization of the Argentinean land-owning class:
   Argentine Rural Society. As result of both analyses we conclude that
   there are neither solid arguments nor empirical evidence to support the
   existence of an economically and politically powerful landlord class in
   Argentina.},

Abstract = {This essay was written in honor of Stephen Resnick. It places his work
   in the tradition of activism and performativity of theory associated
   with Luis Althusser, and it situates his work in a particular political
   and theoretical conjuncture (as it situates Althusser's work in its own
   conjuncture). It argues that Resnick's theoretical practice was
   designed, as Althusser's had been, to give class-struggles an epistemic
   value, that this practice is best understood in terms of the Gramscian
   notion of a war of position (applied to theory), and that this war of
   position entailed a rhetoric of confrontation and an acceptance of risk.
   It argues finally that the legacy of Stephen Resnick can be secured only
   by the continuation of a politically grounded practice of theory.},

Abstract = {Social movements are builders of what are known as ``grammars of
   democracy{''}, that is, values, participatory experiences, political
   cultures, languages and structures for articulating demands. This
   article analyses the 15M or indignados (outraged) movement in Spain; a
   collective action that went beyond classical protests in response to the
   economic crisis and proposed changes in democratic practices. Social
   movements, particularly from the 1990s onwards, have focused on
   democracy as both a means and an end in order to address what they
   perceive as authoritarian globalization. The article approaches 15M
   mainly as a space for mobilization articulating the heterogeneity of the
   movement as well as its effects in Spain (anti-eviction struggles, PAH,
   social tides, etc.) with a direct reference to the master frame of
   `radical democracy'. Methodologically, this work is based upon
   interviews, focus groups and participant observation conducted from May
   2011 to June 2012 during the occupation of public squares and subsequent
   mobilizations. The text situates this phenomenon in the core of the New
   Global Movements, and connects it with a decade of similar collective
   actions in Spain and other parts of the world. Finally, aspects such as
   the role of the Internet as a tool for and driving force of new models
   of democracy and the scale of assemblies in relation to deliberative
   democracy are also discussed.},

Abstract = {The exercise of political repression in urban areas in Argentina and
   Guatemala from the mid-1970s to the mid-1980s, specifically the forced
   disappearance of people, has several similarities. My argument is that
   these similarities are explained by the Argentinean collaboration in the
   countersubversive struggle in Guatemala, in particular with state
   entities that produced forced disappearance, such as civilian and
   military intelligence. The transfer of resources, knowledge and
   experiences from Argentina to Guatemala was carried out not only through
   diplomatic and official channels, but also through civil and military,
   secret, informal and clandestine connections, such as the right-wing
   transnational network called Confederacion Anticomunista Latinoamericana
   (CAL). I illustrate one of the conditions for making this resource
   transfer possible: the participation of the extreme right in Guatemala
   within the CAL and its connections with Argentina. In doing so I use
   declassified documents from the Historical Archive of the Argentinean
   Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Center for Documentation and the
   Archive for the Defense of Human Rights of Paraguay.},

Abstract = {This article intends to analyze changes surrounding the comprehension of
   madness after the irruption of the antipsychiatry movement and examine
   the adaption processes of its approaches within the framework of
   neoliberalism's rise and upswing. In accordance with the critical
   observation of the postulates of the ``ex-patient{''} or ``survivor of
   psychiatry{''} movement and the recovery model in mental health, the
   ideological transformations of the comprehension and approach of madness
   in contemporary mental health are described. Finally, this paper
   examines the relevance of antipsychiatry in a neoliberal context in
   Willis of acknowledging the importance of defending citizen rights,
   strengthening of autonomy and construction of political alliances, as
   well as the transfonnative potential of community spaces and social
   movements that vindicate madness as the basis of their collective
   identity.},

Abstract = {Right-wing political parties are often viewed as ``parties of the
   rich,{''} deprived of grassroots activists. This article deconstructs
   this representation by referring to a piece of field research carried
   out in the Paris region during the 2014 local elections. How do members
   of the working and middle classes in a suburban city where the left-wing
   vote is dominant come to support a right-wing party such as the UMP? The
   right-wing vote is primarily explained by the social trajectories of the
   activists. Some of them achieved upward social mobility through small
   business -owning and entrepreneurship, while others are blue-collar
   workers and low-level employees coming from a higher social background
   who wish to regain their former social status. These two types of
   trajectories led the members of the studied group to campaign ``for the
   right{''} and to develop a legitimist social conscience that values the
   economic elite while disparaging the inferior layers of the working
   classes, as well as middle-class intellectuals.},

   theory. Chasi, who follows a Metzian interpretation of Tutu's ethics,
   concluded that Tutuism offers little guidance for war ethics. In this
   article, I wish to respond to Chasi and argue that his interpretation of
   Tutuist ethics is not charitable enough. I present two sets of arguments
   to support this view. Firstly, Tutuist Ubuntu can morally justify
   violence when this promotes social harmony. Secondly, Tutu's moral
   reformation theory can be used as guidance for an ethics of war, to the
   extent that a principle derived from it is that morally acceptable acts
   of war are those acts that can restore peace following conflict.},

Abstract = {Direct primary elections were introduced in the United States to limit
   the power of parties, to favor entry of new candidates, and to foster
   competition. However, a majority of incumbents faces no competition in
   their primary. We propose a formal model of primaries to rationalise
   this fact and analyse its welfare consequences. The party of the
   incumbent can influence the challenger's entry cost in the primaries.
   Primary challengers choose strategically to enter only when the
   incumbent is of low competence. Voters, who are poorly informed about
   the competence of candidates, use the competitiveness of the primary to
   update beliefs. We identify three sources of uncontested primaries: a
   lower bound on the challenger cost of entry; an absence of commitment to
   set this entry cost by the party of the incumbent; and an imperfect
   observability of the entry cost by voters. Regulation favoring
   challenger entry can benefit voters and even the party of the incumbent.},

Journal = {REVISTA INTERNACIONAL DE PENSAMIENTO POLITICO},
Year = {2018},
Number = {13},
Pages = {235-255},
Abstract = {Max Stirner has always been considered a minor thinker in modern
   political theory. One of the reasons for this oblivion is maybe due to
   the vitriolic attack that Marx and Engels directed in the long section
   ``San Max{''} in The German Ideology, where Stirner is described as the
   quintessence of the idealistic philosopher who ignores the relations of
   force and power that govern reality, reducing it to a mere
   representation of consciousness. ``Against{''} Marx and Engels, this
   paper will defend the thesis according to which Stirner, far from
   ignoring the material factors of the ideology, reveals the hidden
   technique of the new liberal governamentality: the transformation of the
   individual into a believer. The stirnerian analysis of submission to the
   sacred as an essential condition for domination will then follow. From
   there, we will see how, in modern times, the sacred has been
   reconfigured under the form of new ``spectres{''} that demand obedience
   from the individual. Finally, I will explore stirnerian proposal of
   insurrection as a technique of emancipation from the sacred and, first
   of all, from the psychological need to believe.},

Title = {The conservative political logic: a discourse-theoretical perspective},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF POLITICAL IDEOLOGIES},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {23},
Number = {1},
Pages = {10-29},
Abstract = {In contrast to other core constituents of modern politics, conservatism
   has not been the object of much discursive-constructivist rethinking.
   Inspired by Laclau's work and by Glynos and Howarth's
   discourse-theoretical development of the notion of logics, this article
   sets out to identify the conservative political logic. Conservative
   politics, it argues, articulate demands as conservation, envisaged as a
   process of ensuring the desirable continuity of the social order between
   past, present and future, in opposition to a (demand for) change that is
   argued to constitute a dislocatory threat to the continuity of the
   social order. The conservative political logic interpellates citizens as
   members of that threatened social order, and presents conservative
   politics as the way to protect this threatened social order. Building on
   a critical discussion of dominant approaches to conservatism, the
   article proposes to identify the more formal logic that structures
   conservative rhetoric as an alternative for a substance-based
   ideological definition of conservatism. The distinctiveness of the
   discourse-theoretical perspective on conservative politics becomes more
   pronounced as the article moves on to argue that conservatism
   discursively constructs changes as threats to the social order, and,
   finally, shows how conservative politics discursively construct and
   reproduce the social order they (cl) aim to conserve.},

Journal = {REGIONAL AND FEDERAL STUDIES},

Volume = {28},

Abstract = {Regional elections in Romania are more important politically than it
   would generally be the case in a highly centralized country. Despite the
   limited regional autonomy of the territorial units named judete
   (counties) which host those elections, regional elections have become
   more and more important because of their electoral forecasting
   potential. As explained in this elections report, county elections have
   grown up as barometer elections, turning, through their capacity to
   accurately indicate the outcome of the national elections into a
   `subspecies' of second-order elections. The report will therefore
   emphasize their special relationship with national elections due to
   election timing, constituency design and electoral formula similarities.
   Finally, the report evaluates the 2016 elections outcomes, by
   strengthening the concept of barometer elections as a type of
   second-order elections in the framework of a highly nationalized
   party-system.},

Abstract = {This paper considers how magic power - as a political resource, and as a
   metaphor for political power - is implicated in current and past thought
   about sovereignty and domination. Shakespeare's treatments of politics,
   magic, sovereignty and domination are an illuminating source, relating
   as they do to the Machiavellian tradition, and to later treatments of
   the themes by Hobbes and Weber. The question is raised how articulated
   scepticism about political power relates to scepticism about alleged
   magic; and how the conduct of Shakespeare's magicians casts light on
   their conduct qua political actors.},

Volume = {30},
Number = {2},
Pages = {232-255},
Abstract = {This essay examines key Marcusean themes through the lens of Italian
   (post-) autonomist thinker Franco ``Bifo{''} Berardi. Bifo criticizes
   Marcuse's argument that repressed ``authentic{''} human qualities need
   to be ``liberated{''} to bring about universal human happiness, because
   what Bifo calls ``semiocapitalism{''}-global capitalism in the age of
   digital networks, financialization, and computerization-effectively
   ``subsumes{''} desires and libidinal energies vis-a-vis the production,
   circulation, and consumption of ``infocommodities.{''} Yet Bifo also
   glosses over Marcuse's anticipations of certain postautonomist ideas,
   such as Marcuse's use of Marx's Grundrisse (an iconic text for the
   autonomist and post-autonomist traditions) and his evocation of the
   ``general intellect{''} in One-Dimensional Man, as well as the
   theorization of the subsumption of desire via what Marcuse termed
   ``repressive desublimation.{''} Bifo's criticisms, as well as
   unanticipated congruences between Marcuse and autonomist thought, none
   of which have been addressed in the extant literature, thus constitute
   this essay's central focus.},

Abstract = {Although the number of Twitter users is significantly lower than other
   social networks in our country (primarily, Vkontakte and Facebook), its
   social and political significance is quite high, due to both the
   network's technical features, and the specificity of public and
   political communication in modern Russia. Against the background of the
   strict state control over the key social media, Twitter is an
   independent and efficient platform for interactive exchange of
   information. During the protests on March 26, 2017, and immediately
   thereafter, Twitter not only supplemented (or even replaced) the federal
   media's role in disseminating important information, but also acted as a
   channel for social and political discussion and construction of offline
   networks.
   The article attempts to show how one can draw conclusions about the
   evolution of the Russian protest politics on the basis of the analysis
   of Twitter communication. The authors focus on whether Twitter messages
   shed light on the mechanisms of socio-political mobilization and protest
   potential in general.
   The conducted research shows that Twitter can be viewed as an effective
   tool of social and political mobilization, which opens up opportunities
   for overcoming collective action problem in the process of social
   movements formation. Twitter communication can help strengthen
   solidarity and crystallization of offline networks, by creating
   favorable conditions for collective action. At the same time, similar to
   other social networks, it can be used to mobilize not only the
   opposition, but also the loyalist segment of the society.},

Abstract = {This essay describes the ambitious claim of modern constitutionalism and
   distinguishes it from mere juridification of public power. It shows the
   challenges of constitutionalism that follow from the loss of identity
   between state power and public power. The essay asserts that the
   necessity to regulate public power persists, regardless of whether it is
   exercised by state authorities or international organizations. However,
   it raises doubts that the fragmented public power on the international
   level can be regulated in a way that would satisfy the demands of
   constitutionalism. What can be observed is an ongoing juridification
   which, however, lacks basic features of constitutionalism. How a full
   compensation could look like is an open question.},

Abstract = {There is great interest in co-creation of welfare production between
   municipalities and the civil society in the Nordic countries. Using
   linking social capital as a theoretical point of departure and examining
   a qualitative case study in Norway, I critically assess the concepts of
   co-creation and `Municipality 3.0'. It is suggested that even in
   countries with high trust in the authorities, building linking social
   capital in the shape of interorganizational networks is a complex
   process fraught with potential barriers related to trust, network
   building, municipal resources, and statutory laws and regulations. And
   while outcomes are promising, they are far from certain.},

Abstract = {This paper examines German and American responses to international
   terrorism from the end of the cold war to today. While terrorism was not
   a priority for much the 1990s, the 9/11 attacks generated a long list of
   domestic counterterrorism measures in both countries. In the
   international realm, the German government ended up participating in
   many US initiatives designed to hunt down al-Qaeda operatives and
   prevent them from launching another attack inside the United States.
   However, German support was often secret and cooperation in the context
   of the war on terrorism' was considered controversial at home. When
   comparing German and US counterterrorism approaches, the paper takes a
   unique approach by analysing how parliamentary and presidential
   government structures affected responses in terms of content and scope.
   The comparative analysis illustrates various similarities between German
   and US decision-making processes and argues that checks and balances
   continue to balance executive power gains in both countries.},

Abstract = {On September 5, 2017, the Trump Administration announced that it would
   rescind the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program.
   Initiated in 2012 via an Executive Order, DACA sought to provide a
   provisional fix to the legal status of the nation's growing number of
   ``Dreamers{''} - the approximately 1.2 million young adults who have
   lived the majority of their lives in the United States, but were brought
   into the country without proper entry documentation. The termination of
   DACA has presented unique challenges for the 241,000 Dreamers currently
   enrolled in US colleges and universities. While several institutions
   proudly declared themselves to be ``sanctuary campuses,{''} this paper
   focuses on a restrained if not conservative, land-grant university,
   detailing how two faculty members incorporated scholar-activist and
   community organizing strategies to support a Dreamer-driven
   institutional response.},

Abstract = {This chapter poses the fundamental question of whether the European
   Union (EU) is likely to be strengthened by the departure of its most
   awkward member, or else be greatly weakened and potentially even
   collapse. To answer this question, the chapter first reviews the ways in
   which the EU has developed in the past, and argues that the ensuing
   ``sui generis{''} structure, with its mix of supranationalism and
   inter-governmentalism, has never been properly understood within the UK.
   The chapter concludes that a weakening of the EU is more plausible than
   a major new advance in EU integration but that neither a federal Europe
   nor the collapse of the EU look very likely at present. An updated
   narrative for the EU will, however, be required.},

Abstract = {Researchers agree that racial disparities exist in Brazil's political
   arena, but disagree about the underlying causes. Some scholars suggest
   that the racial gap between the electorate and those elected in Brazil
   is explained by differences in candidate entry, social class, and
   campaign resources while others believe racial discrimination is at
   play. In this paper, I test these competing explanations for
   Afro-Brazilian underrepresentation using data from Brazil's 2014 federal
   deputy elections. My results indicate that candidate entry,
   socioeconomic status, campaign resources, and other factors only
   partially explain racial disparities in electoral outcomes. When I
   control for theoretically important non-racial candidate
   characteristics, there remains a strong association between candidate
   race and electoral outcomes. This finding suggests that racial
   discrimination is a major contributing factor to Afro-Brazilian
   political underrepresentation.},

Abstract = {The article analyzes how the Russian media cover activities of Alexei
   Navalny, an opposition politician. On the basis of the data from the
   company Medialogy, the author examines the intensity and tone of the
   discussion about Navalny in print and electronic newspapers, blogs, and
   also on the three largest federal channels - ``Channel One{''},
   ``Russia-1{''} and ``NTV{''}. Her research shows that the tendency to
   ignore Navalny's activities is almost an exclusive feature of
   television, which seeks a trade-off between silencing this activity and
   discrediting the politician, while other types of media cover it quite
   widely. According to the author's conclusion, Navalny attracts
   heightened attention due to both state actions directed against him, as
   well as his own political and anti-corruption activity.
   Despite a slight increase in the share of positive messages in the
   discussion about Navalny, it is predominantly of a critical nature.
   Curiously, the tone of the discussion depends on the communication
   channel itself rather than the occurring events. Different types of
   media cover the politician's activities in a different way: the same
   information can trigger criticism of Navalny in the traditional
   (pro-governmental) media and a campaign in his defense in the Internet
   publications and blogs.},

Abstract = {The European Union (EU) frequently accentuates its position as the
   largest provider of Official Development Assistance (ODA). Together with
   the EU institutions, EU Member States represent 21 of the 30 members of
   the OECD's Development Assistance Committee (DAC) that sets out rules
   and standards for what can be reported as ODA. Following the EU Treaty's
   requirement for the EU to work together in international organisations,
   research has detected a tentative yet positive trend to this end in
   different international organisations (IOs). This article's empirical
   analysis shows no such trend can be detected in the EU's engagement in
   the DAC. Explanatory factors include divergent development cooperation
   approaches inside the EU, discrepancies between the established image of
   and everyday practice in the DAC, and the EU's full DAC membership. The
   findings add to the literature on international organisation governance
   by exploring different behaviour expectations of non-state membership
   vis-a-vis that of states.},

   Backsliding States: Gender Equality Policy in Central Eastern Europe},
Journal = {POLITICS AND GOVERNANCE},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {6},
Number = {3},
Pages = {90-100},
Abstract = {Trends of de-democratization across Europe and the Americas are
   emerging, along with opposition to gender equality and threats to
   previous gender equality policy gains. Yet de-democratization has been
   barely analysed through the lens of gender equality, and so far, efforts
   to systematically analyse the implications for inclusive democracy and
   the representation of gender interests are lacking. Backsliding in
   gender policies, and new forms of feminist engagement with hostile
   states and publics, also raise new challenges to the literature on
   gender and politics. In this article we explore gender equality policy
   backsliding in fragile democracies. Backsliding and de-democratization
   processes in these contexts pose a series of important challenges to how
   we have thought about gender policy change in progressive, mainly
   Western democratic contexts until now. We propose a conceptual framework
   discussing these two conceptually interesting realms: backsliding in
   gender equality policies, and feminist responses to backsliding. We
   illustrate our framework with empirical observations from four
   backsliding or temporarily backsliding Central and Eastern European
   countries: Croatia, Hungary, Poland and Romania. With our article we aim
   to contribute to the understanding of gendered aspects of
   de-democratization both in gender and politics literature and in
   mainstream democratization literature.},

Title = {Using Data Combination of Fundamental Variable-Based Forecasts and
   Poll-Based Forecasts to Predict the 2013 German Election},
Journal = {GERMAN POLITICS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {27},
Number = {1},
Pages = {25-43},
Abstract = {In this paper I present an election forecasting approach to predict the
   vote share of the governing coalition in German national elections. The
   model is composed of two independent prediction components: the first is
   based on poll data, the second on fundamental variables. Both approaches
   have their advantages and disadvantages when used in isolation. The
   basic idea is to use both and find a better informed overall forecast.
   The predictions are combined using a shrinkage estimator, where the
   predictions are weighted by their respective prediction uncertainty. The
   uncertainty of the poll prediction is modelled time-dependent. The
   result is a dynamic model allowing for predictions longer before the
   elections highly relying on fundamental variables. With the elections
   coming closer predictions rely more and more on the polling data.},

Title = {Political repression in a sub-national hybrid regime: the PRC's
   governing strategies in Hong Kong},
Journal = {CONTEMPORARY POLITICS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {24},
Number = {4},
Pages = {361-378},
Abstract = {Existing literature has long recognised that the Beijing government has
   utilised different strategies to suppress the opposition in Hong Kong.
   However, with the rise of localism against the Chinese government, the
   implications of such political repression require new exploration and
   insight. This article adopts Hale's analytical framework on political
   repression and argues that the Beijing government can comparatively
   tolerate an opposition fighting for democratisation, but the localists
   who advocate self-determination or separatism are harshly condemned and
   suppressed. In Beijing's approach, this red line' was adopted to place
   national security, territory integration and sovereignty as the top
   considerations. Theoretically, this paper contributes to distinguishing
   between two types of opposition groups within sub-national hybrid
   regimes and analyzes different responses from the sovereign state.
   Empirically, the case of Hong Kong will help enrich the existing
   literature by comparing Beijing's strategies of repression in regard to
   the democratic opposition and localists.},

Abstract = {The article is devoted to new applied methodic for foreign policy and
   international relations forecast ``scripted round table{''} elaborated
   in Centre for Asia-Pacific Studies IHAE FEB RAS. All of existing
   methodic and their development and application contexts analysis
   permitted us to draw a conclusion, that interpretation of modern world
   transformation needs a new one based on a broad trans-disciplinary
   convergence. According to J. Topolski W. Wrzosek approach it had been
   provided with four steps: dialog of methods, effective ones' isolation,
   finding new methodological base, elaboration and approbation of a new
   methodic. As U.S. decision-making process is well studied it had been
   chosen as an subject of the research. Existing methods of analysis
   demonstrated a necessity for a new theoretical methodological base to
   transform them into flexible set of researching tools. Principals of
   mathematical function and modern physical picture of the world in
   correspondence with political and social world realities had been chosen
   as the one. The result permitted to elaborate scripted round table
   methodic. It means preparation of several lists of issues to he analyzed
   by experts. All of them had been spread among participants of scripted
   round table. The list of issues to be discussed had been prepared and
   spread beforehand as well. In accordance with elaborated procedure all
   the speakers mutually exchanged their papers not later than two days
   before the gathering. All its participants had been divided to speakers
   and ``experts without paper{''}, who took part in discussion only. It
   permitted to make the one strict, to form condition for non-standard
   suggestions to be expressed and to draw an integrated picture combined
   general trends an unique phenomena's ones. Results of scripted round
   tables had been represented in final analytical documents.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF POLITICAL POWER},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {11},
Number = {1, SI},
Pages = {46-55},
Abstract = {Does `noumenal power' adequately represent `the real and general
   phenomenon of power,' as the capacity to secure the compliance of
   others? Does it include what is relevantly similar and exclude what is
   not? Forst's concept is, appropriately, interagentive, but errs in
   insisting that power is intentionally `exercised' thereby excluding
   countless ways in which compliance can be otherwise secured. Does
   `noumenal power' offer the best explanation of how power functions? In
   claiming that it must involve the recognition of reasons to act
   differently than one otherwise would, it does not address the role of
   emotions, overstates the role of reasoning, and excludes various
   significant ways in which power bypasses conscious awareness: through
   unconscious intuitions and inferences and taken-for-granted cultural
   schemas, by occlusion, excluding thoughts from consideration, and by
   signaling, in ways that mimic reasons.},

Title = {Explaining incumbent re-election in authoritarian elections: evidence
   from a Chinese county},
Journal = {DEMOCRATIZATION},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {25},
Number = {7},
Pages = {1291-1309},
Abstract = {Despite the burgeoning comparative literature on authoritarian
   elections, less is known about the dynamics of competition in
   authoritarian subnational elections where opposition is not allowed to
   organize into parties. Local elections without partisan competition in
   single-party authoritarian regimes provide considerable advantages to
   the incumbents and may well turn the incumbent advantage common in
   liberal democracies into incumbent dominance. What economic factors can
   break incumbent dominance in such competition without parties? With
   quantitative and qualitative evidence from grassroots elections in
   China, this article illustrates that economic growth and industrial
   economic structure offering more economic autonomy help to break
   incumbent dominance and increase the prospects of successful challenge
   to incumbency by non-party outsiders. The examination of the findings in
   a broad context in China and against the backdrop of local
   democratization in the developing world suggests that though we may
   observe successful challenge to incumbency, liberalization of the
   political system requires not only competition, but also a relatively
   autonomous economy to sustain liberalization prospects. The findings
   contribute to the literature on electoral authoritarianism, subnational
   democratization and China's grassroots elections.},

Journal = {AFRICAN SECURITY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {11},
Number = {3},
Pages = {223-251},
Abstract = {South Africa has been at the forefront of peace diplomacy in Africa as
   seen by its commitment to peacekeeping and its various conflict
   resolution activities such as mediation, negotiation, and postconflict
   reconstruction. Participation in peacekeeping has stood out as one of
   the pillars of South Africa's Afrocentric stabilization agenda,
   positioning the country as a leader in both African Union and United
   Nations missions on the continent. In 2012, the white paper on South
   Africa's participation in international peace missions was revised to
   align South Africa's policies and strategic objectives with the evolving
   global peace operations environment. In spite of South Africa's growing
   experience in peacekeeping, challenges abound in the form of operational
   shortfalls such as shortage of skilled personnel and outdated equipment
   and strategic drawbacks such as the lack of adequate and sustainable
   funding. This article serves as an appraisal of South Africa's approach
   to peace operations vis-a-vis contemporary challenges and trends in
   peace operations at the global and regional levels.},

Title = {WOMEN AND REGIONAL POLITICS: POLITICAL DETERMINANTS OF WOMEN'S
   DESCRIPTIVE REPRESENTATION IN THE CZECH AND SLOVAK REGIONAL ELECTIONS OF
   2000-2017},
Journal = {POLITICKE VEDY},

Abstract = {Although there is an extensive comparative research focusing on the
   influence of various factors contributing to the increase of female
   representation at the national level, relatively little space is devoted
   to a similar research at (sub)state levels of governance. Hence, the
   main objective of this article is to analyse the determinants of women's
   descriptive representation in Czech and Slovak regional elections. We
   show that women's representation at the regional level is lower not only
   in comparison with the national but especially with the local level. Our
   results confirm that women are significantly advantaged in the regions
   where women held a much higher representation in the previous electoral
   term. However, other factors show only little positive (expected)
   influence on women's representation in the Czech Republic (district
   magnitude), while we find negative influence of economic development
   (unexpected) and Catholicism (expected). On the contrary, in Slovakia,
   most factors influence women's representation in the expected way. We
   find higher women's representation in the regions characterized by
   higher economic development, higher district magnitudes, higher
   difference in salaries between men and women and a lower share of
   Catholics and Hungarians. Furthermore, electoral system proves to be a
   strong factor as a proportional system, together with higher magnitudes,
   strongly increases women's representation. Generally, while the results
   from the Czech Republic indicate that women's representation is
   influenced rather by institutional variables, together with greater
   openness for women based on previous experience, in Slovakia the
   relation among various factors is much more complex, influenced by all
   types of variables.},

Abstract = {This article analyzes the 2015 Venice Biennale titled, All the World's
   Futures, an exhibition that consciously centralized nations outside of
   the West. In contrast to the desire to produce order in the previous
   Biennales of the modern era, All the World's Futures sought to express
   global conditions described as a complex network of financial, cultural,
   and political interdependence. Through discursive and textual analysis
   of the cultural artifacts, articles, and interviews of participating
   members of the 2015 Biennale, this article identifies the
   characteristics of 1) a growing awareness of the changing and variable
   dimensions of labor and capital, 2) a central concern with perspectives
   informed by historical legacies rooted in Africa, the African diaspora
   and the Middle East and, 3) a prominence placed on the affordances of
   digital technologies in collaborative production and distribution. These
   characteristics are examined within the context of gallery exhibitions,
   specifically, the Venice Biennale.},

Abstract = {The philanthropic work of fundraising is characterized by an important
   relational dimension. The professionalization of the sector has led to
   the emergence of techniques to improve the effectiveness of fundraising.
   Among them is cultivation, which aims to establish a personal
   relationship with individual donors to engage them or to get them to
   give more. This article aims to analyze the philanthropic relationship
   between donor and recipient in the context of cultivation, to understand
   if this relationship is characterized by a form of domination. To do so,
   we will focus on a particular form of philanthropy, that of American
   Friends groups of French cultural institutions (American Friends of the
   Louvre, American Friends of Versailles and so on). The American Friends
   are American organizations that benefit from 501(c)(3) status, which
   allows American patrons to make tax exempt gifts to foreign
   institutions. This analysis is based on qualitative research carried out
   in France and the United States and based on observations, interviews,
   and analysis of documents and archives.},

Title = {Trading Places: Securitising Refugee and Asylum Policies in Germany and
   the United States},
Journal = {GERMAN POLITICS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {27},
Number = {2, SI},
Pages = {244-264},
Abstract = {Given their radically different historical approaches to immigration and
   refugees, one would expect Germany and the United States to have adopted
   diverging policies in these domains following the 9/11' attacks. More
   surprising is the extent to which they have traded places' regarding
   their respective leadiator' and laggard' roles concerning asylum rights.
   Although both countries embraced restrictive practices during the 1980s,
   US law now concentrates on security first', relying heavily on
   exclusionary border control and national security framing. Whereas the
   old FRG used complex, exclusionary laws to limit all forms of migration
   prior to 1998, united Germany has redefined itself as a welcoming
   culture', upholding human rights, open borders and pro-active
   resettlement policies. Focusing on the `migration-security' nexus, this
   study compares fundamental changes in the admission and resettlement
   policies each now applies to persons seeking international protection.
   It reviews securitisation dynamics in the USA, followed by a treatment
   of developments at the European level that have conditioned reforms in
   German since 2005. The refusal of some EU member states to accept their
   fair share of the humanitarian burden invoked by the 2015-2016 refugee
   crisis has ironically contributed to Chancellor Angela Merkel's new
   image as Lady Liberty, lifting her lamp besides the golden door'.},

Year = {2018},
Volume = {9},

Abstract = {This article is devoted to the analysis of the growing importance of the
   Eurasian direction in Japan's foreign policy, the causes and
   consequences of the duality and inconsistency of this policy, the
   influence of internal political reasons on Japan's alignment with its
   policy towards the Central Asian states. The process of building up a
   new system of Japan's foreign policy behavior in Central Asia in this
   case has developed in a reactive as opposed to a proactive manner.
   Eurasian direction of Japan's diplomacy demanded a serious revision
   because by the new project ``One Belt, One Road{''}, which is an
   unprecedented regional initiative of Beijing - the primary foreign
   policy opponent for Tokyo. The regional agenda of Tokyo is also
   influenced by the new approaches of Donald Trump's administration to the
   multilateral cooperation's forms. Tokyo's attempts to pursue its
   relations with the Central Asian states as a whole region and the
   Japan's experience of using the dialogue ``Central Asia plus Japan{''}
   as a promising model for the cooperation between non-regional actors and
   its Central Asia's partners, are also of interest. In addition, the
   article deals with the preconditions for coordinating actions in the
   Eurasian direction between Japan and its friendly states, including
   Turkey and India, and the process of diversifying the economic partners
   of the Central Asian region as a whole. Since the reasons for the
   interest of the Central Asian states in the implementation of economic
   and other forms of cooperation with Tokyo have not lost their relevance,
   Russia could be of significant value to Tokyo.},

   rereading its proposals from a critical point of view. Against certain

   from the private and political spheres, can not sympathize with such
   orientation. At the beginning, we look at how Arendt thinks about this
   separation of spaces, to analyze in a second moment why this separation

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL CRITICAL THOUGHT},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {8},
Number = {2},
Pages = {193-209},
Abstract = {In The Economic and Philosophical Manuscripts of 1844 (completed in
   August 1844), Marx takes two crucial steps in the formation of his
   worldview. The first relates to his rejection of all ``old{''}
   materialism, including Feuerbach's, and the adoption of his own version,
   which he called ``communist,{''} ``practical.{''} This view was later
   presented definitively in the first thesis on Feuerbach (spring of 1845)
   and elaborated in The German Ideology (1845-1846). The second step
   relates to Marx's synthesising of the philosophical standpoint that he
   had developed up to this point (around the spring of 1844) with
   political economy. Up to this point, he had spoken of alienation in
   largely philosophical terms; now it is rooted in the process of
   production. On both counts Adam Smith was an important influence. This
   claim provides the focus of this paper. To make this point successfully,
   the author has found it necessary to trace briefly the development of
   Marx's philosophical standpoint up to the writing of the Manuscripts,
   and to distinguish between the two methodologically distinct aspects of
   Adam Smith's thought: the one that Marx accepted and the other that he
   rejected.},

Journal = {NEW POLITICAL SCIENCE},

Abstract = {Nearly two hundred fifty years into its existence, the American polity
   faces a conundrum over a core founding principle: religious liberty.
   Multiple debates have emerged over the extent and limits of religious
   liberty, including arguments over how far any one person's religious
   liberty extends into the public sphere as well as into the private lives
   of other citizens. Highly influential on James Madison's crafting of the
   First Amendment, John Locke's Letter Concerning Toleration outlines a
   strong conception of both religious toleration and of religious liberty.
   In the ``Letter,{''} Locke's reasoning is sympathetic to the concerns
   and convictions of believers while remaining cognizant of the calamities
   to which religious differences can give rise. Further, he provides a
   robust explication of the mutually exclusive domains of ecclesiastical
   and civil authorities, now known more colloquially as the division of
   church and state. In the following article, I illustrate how the
   principles put forth by Locke offer guidance in adjudicating religious
   liberty claims in the cases of Kim Davis, religious freedom laws,
   vaccine refusal, contraception mandate exemptions, and ultrasound
   requirements.},

Abstract = {The Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons is historic not only in

   states free from nuclear weapons; based on humanitarian evidence and
   imperatives; involved civil society, hibakusha and survivors of nuclear
   testing to a degree that is unprecedented in the nuclear field; and is
   the first nuclear disarmament treaty negotiated through the UN General
   Assembly, with the process proving both effective and efficient, despite
   fierce opposition from a number of nuclear-armed states, whose lack of
   commitment to nuclear disarmament was made very plain. The International
   Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons (ICAN) became the main civil society
   partner for governments leading and supporting the `Humanitarian
   Initiative' which resulted in the negotiations. ICAN's principles,
   strategy and work are discussed in the context of the `stigmatise -
   prohibit - eliminate' approach which has proven effective for other
   inhumane and indiscriminate weapons.},

Abstract = {Theopolitics is related to the interaction between theos (god) and
   politics, or to that between theology - the systematization of the major
   ideas of a given religious faith and politics. Theopolitics is a broad
   attempt to understand and extrapolate political action through the
   multidimensional lens of geopolitics and theology. Theopolitics, like
   geopolitics, includes analysis of geographical, historical, and cultural
   characteristics that influence political behavior. Theopolitics, unlike
   geopolitics, extrapolates political action based on further
   philosophical and theological premises that God exists and acts in human
   history. This research paper appropriates historical scholarship on
   religious iconography and theology where it helpfully reminds theology
   of matters requiring theology's attention, as well as where it
   identifies nuances in the phenomenon of religious identity formation of
   which theology should be mindful. However, it is primarily a history of
   religion endeavor. The authors engage what they perceive as a
   significant representation of the other in the 16th century Orthodox
   Christian theopolitical iconography.},

Pages = {18-36},
Abstract = {The Nabucco pipeline has been the largest and, arguably, the most
   ambitious project promoted to ``wean Europe from the Russian gas
   stranglehold.{''} Both the EU and the United States were strong
   proponents of the plan. Meanwhile, Gazprom launched its giant South
   Stream project in strategic partnership with some of the most
   experienced European energy companies. Despite declarations by both
   Russia and the EU that Nabucco and South Stream were not competitors,
   they were designed to provide gas to the same sluggish southeastern
   European markets. At this writing both projects have been canceled. This
   paper provides an overview of the debate surrounding the Nabucco
   pipeline's cancellation. Conventional wisdom holds that Nabucco failed
   for political reasons, but the real cause of its failure was the
   emergence of two more economically viable pipeline plans.},

Abstract = {In Weimar Germany, the Catholic Church vehemently warned ordinary
   parishioners about the dangers of extremist parties. We establish that
   constituencies' religious composition is a key empirical predictor of
   Nazi vote shares-dwarfing the explanatory power of any other demographic
   or socioeconomic variable. Even after carefully accounting for
   observational differences, Catholics were far less likely to vote for
   the NSDAP than their Protestant counterparts. The evidence suggests that
   this disparity was, in large part, due to the sway of the Catholic
   Church and its dignitaries. At the same time, we show that attempts to
   immunize Catholics against the radical left failed to achieve the
   desired result. To explain the puzzling asymmetry in the Church's
   influence at the ballot box, we develop a simple theoretical framework
   of elite influence in electoral politics.},

Abstract = {This article explores how mobile solidarities are forged through
   precariousness at City Plaza, a disused hotel and collective refugee
   accommodation space in Athens, which has become a notorious site of
   resistance in the midst of the so-called ``European migration
   crisis.{''} Drawing on qualitative research carried out during 2016, the
   article explores how solidarities are created at this space in terms
   that not only challenge the abandonment of lives rendered disposable
   through camps, but also the rendering of lives vulnerable through
   humanitarian accommodation initiatives that seek to integrate those most
   in need of protection. While pointing to the significance of critical
   analyses of abandoned and disposable lives in the context of current
   migratory conditions across Europe, the article highlights the
   limitations of a frame of vulnerability specifically. It draws on the
   work of Judith Butler to argue that the relations of solidarity which
   are forged at City Plaza are better understood in terms of a form of
   precarity or precariousness that is shared, yet unevenly distributed.},

Journal = {TOCQUEVILLE REVIEW},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {39},
Number = {2},
Pages = {15-33},
Abstract = {This article re-examines the origins and implications of Raymond Aron's
   brand of political realism. Its starting point is the private
   correspondence between Aron and Henry Kissinger in the wake of the
   Chilean coup of 1973 and the demise of the Greek military dictatorship
   the following year. At issue in this exchange was the idea that an
   authentic political realism must take values seriously. The article
   traces the origins of this vision of political realism to Aron's
   peripheral involvement in neo-radical and neo-socialist political
   movements in the late 1920s, thereby challenging the view that Aron's
   arrival at intellectual maturity' required a radical break with his
   early politics. It then returns to the Greek and Chilean crises so as to
   illustrate and problematize Aron's theory of international relations as
   applied to real world politics before finally considering how Aron's
   response to these crises was informed by his views on earlier crises of
   French democracy in 1934-7 and 1958.},

Abstract = {This article examines the impact of Brexit on British-Irish relations to

   that strong British-Irish intergovernmental relations are essential to
   manage the challenges. A formalised institutional framework is and will
   be essential in the absence of common EU membership. To this end, the
   Good Friday Agreement's British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference
   should be revitalised.},

Abstract = {This article describes how the internet has come to play a central role
   in terrorist financing endeavours. Online channels allow terrorist
   financiers to network with like-minded individuals, in order to increase
   support, raise funds, and move wealth across the international system.
   For instance, the Islamic State, Hezbollah, and other groups have become
   adept at using these channels to finance their activities. Therefore,
   increased examination is required of the ways in which terrorists use
   the internet to raise and move funds. This study assesses some of the
   current trends and risks associated with online terrorist financing.
   Some policy options are also outlined, in order to reduce the threat of

Title = {BALANCE OF STATE INTERESTS AND HUMAN RIGHTS IN PERCEPTION OF RUSSIANS:
   EMPIRICAL ANALYSIS},
Journal = {POLIS-POLITICHESKIYE ISSLEDOVANIYA},
Year = {2018},
Number = {5},
Pages = {134-149},
Abstract = {The article is devoted to the analysis of the current state and dynamics
   of Russians' views on the relationship between state interests and human
   rights from mid-1990s through 2017. On the basis of a series of
   all-Russian representative surveys it is shown that in the 1990s,
   despite the state's refusal to fulfill some of its key functions,
   domination of the norm of the priority of the state interests over human
   rights (traditional for Russia) still remained due to the inertia of the
   norms and values system. However, in the late 1990s the process of
   changes in Russians' attitude to the right of the state to realize its
   interests at the cost of human rights (and, consequently, its right to
   legitimize violence against citizens), as well as to the right of
   individual to have his own interests and to protect them in any way, was
   initiated. In the 2000s, this process accelerated, and now, for the
   first time in the recent history of Russia, the norm of the priority of
   state interests over human rights has lost its dominance. The Russian
   society is currently split into two polar groups comprising about 20\%
   of population each, while the rest of the population forms the ``silent
   majority{''} without any clear position on this issue. For Russia, such
   situation marks the beginning of a ``silent revolution,{''} the
   consequences of which can be enormous, since in neo-etacratic societies
   the norm of priority of the state interests over human rights lies in
   the foundation of their ``institutional matrix{''}. It is also
   demonstrated that interest in political rights and democratic freedoms
   is not a feature of supporters of the human rights priority in Russia;
   for them, it is primarily about socio-economic rights. Moreover, they,
   like Russians in general, are largely convinced that the Western way of
   development is unsuitable for our country.},

Journal = {POLITICS GROUPS AND IDENTITIES},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {6},
Number = {4},
Pages = {838-851},
Abstract = {The Black Lives Matter movement gained national prominence after highly
   publicized protests turned the spotlight on police violence in the US.
   We explore how this complex, multi-vocal movement is framed in the media
   using an original dataset of over 500 editorial cartoons by
   award-winning syndicated cartoonists. We find that every cartoonist in
   our sample increased their frequency of cartooning about racism in the
   BLM period with the greatest increases from those who had previously
   drawn the least about racism. Cartoons of this period also focused on
   police brutality to a hitherto unprecedented extent. When they did so,
   they emphasized the systemic nature of police brutality. Cartoons about
   movements having an impact on racism significantly increased. Movements
   were usually portrayed in a sympathetic light. Despite these gains for
   the advocacy of BLM activists, the engagement with the movement was
   superficial, indicated most clearly in the exclusion of women from
   cartoonists' framing of the movement. Nevertheless, the cartoons drawn
   in the wake of BLM demonstrate a dear break, in imagery and meaning,
   from the presence of post-racial tropes typical of editorial cartoons in
   the preceding period.},

Abstract = {This paper seeks to expand the work of Marxist-feminist scholars
   Rosemary Hennessy and Nancy Fraser by placing it into conversation with
   the emerging work of scholars of asexuality and asexual identity. In
   resisting the tendency to reify the identity category of ``asexual{''}
   as a newly emerging and dialogically structured identity which stands in
   opposition to the ``allosexual,{''} this paper will rather attempt to
   determine its nature as a historically structured and contingent
   emergence of a particular moment in neoliberal capitalism. From this, it
   will argue that there need not be a tension between the notions of
   ``compulsory sexuality{''} and ``sexusociety{''} developed by scholars
   such as Elizabeth Emens and Ela Przybylo. It will be demonstrated that
   asexuality can be used as a positional tool in order to illuminate the
   totality of sexuality as a reified and commodified entity under late
   capitalism, one which is useful for understanding and resisting the
   capitalist historical (re)organization of human potentials for sensation

Title = {Leonardo's prophetic mind},
Journal = {LABORATOIRE ITALIEN-POLITIQUE ET SOCIETE},
Year = {2018},
Number = {21},
Abstract = {The present contribution aims to analyze a corpus of writings by
   Leonardo, entitled Pronostico or proudly signed as ``Profezia di
   Lionardo da Vinci{''}. The earliest examples are from the last decade of
   the 15th century, at the time of the quick decline of the Duchy of
   Milan, in whose service Leonardo was operating. A conjecture is proposed
   with reference to a possible meeting with Savonarola in Florence in the
   summer of 1495, as a decisive circumstance in involving Leonardo in the
   prophetic genre, whose evolution is then followed throughout his career:
   from the first courtly attempts to conceive prophetic riddles for the
   Sforza, to the ambitious project of a novel written in the form of a
   letter, focused on the appearance of a ``novo profeta{''} in Armenia,
   announcing the ``stupenda e dannosa maraviglia{''} of a natural
   cataclysm (c. 1500-1502). Some prophetic writings of the time of
   Leonardo's return to Florence under the patronage of Soderini (c.
   1503-1504), such as the prophecy entitled Un comune, are discussed in
   the light of their ethical and political value.},

Abstract = {We analyze geographic dimensions of African voting to suggest that the
   salience of previous explanations of vote choice, including clientelism,
   performance evaluation, and local strong-arming varies across different
   types of constituencies. Analysis of Government-to-Opposition Swing
   (GOS) voting in seven countries over time reveals that GOS varies not
   only across the urban-rural divide but also across different types of
   rural constituencies. While GOS is uncommon in rural parts of the
   president's home region, we discover significant variation across other
   types of rural constituencies: GOS is most likely in densely-populated
   rural constituencies and less likely in sparsely populated rural
   constituencies that are often among the poorest in the country. We infer
   that political and economic geography shapes prospects for autonomous
   vote choice, performance voting, and quality of democracy.},

Pages = {1016-1032},
Abstract = {Since the restoration of multi-party democracy in Kenya in 1991,
   elections have witnessed intra-party violence during the primaries for
   selecting parliamentary and civic seats candidates. This article
   addresses the question of why electoral violence occurs during party
   primaries in Kenya and argues that violence is an outcome of the
   organization of political parties, which has revolved around
   personalities identified with ethno-regional interests rather than
   institutionalism. The upshot has been the absence of party
   institutionalization to establish structures for recruitment of members
   and organization of primaries. Such organizational weaknesses have
   denied parties the capacity to match the intense competition for tickets
   of ethno-regional dominant parties that guarantees nominees to win seats
   in their strongholds. Intra-party violence has followed. The article
   submits that intra-party electoral violence in Kenya is a function of
   the politics of clientelism and ethnicity, both of which have severely
   hampered the institutionalization of political parties and their
   capacity to cope with the stiff competition for the tickets of
   ethno-regional dominant parties.},

Abstract = {Martha Nussbaum's political theory of compassion offers an extensive and
   compelling study of the potential of employing compassionate emotions in
   the political realm to further social justice and societal ``love{''}.
   In this article, two pitfalls of Nussbaum's affirming theory of a
   politics of compassion are highlighted: the problem of a dual-level
   hierarchisation and the ``magic{''} of feeling compassion that
   potentially removes the subject of compassion from reality. I will argue
   that Hannah Arendt's thoughts on pity provide substantial challenges to
   a democratic theory of compassion in this respect. Following these
   theoretical reflections, I will turn to Hillary Clinton's 2016
   US-American presidential election campaign, to her video ads ``Love and
   Kindness{''} in particular, in order to provide fitting illustrations
   from current realpolitik for these specific pitfalls of the political
   employment of compassionate emotions.},

Abstract = {This article investigates accountability in South Africa's dominant
   party system by studying how the African National Congress (ANC) reacts
   to electoral incentives at the local level. It compares the ANC's degree
   of responsiveness to voters across municipalities with different levels
   of political competition. The analysis focuses on whether and under
   which conditions the ANC is more likely to renominate better quality
   municipal councillors. It examines the relationship between renomination
   as ANC municipal councillor and local government performance - as
   measured by voter signals, service delivery and audit outcomes. The
   results show that the ANC does indeed adapt its behaviour to electoral
   incentives. In municipalities where the ANC has larger margins of
   victory, performance matters little for renomination. In contrast, in
   municipalities with higher electoral competition, local government
   performance is strongly correlated with renomination. These results
   suggest the need to expand dominant party research to topics of voter
   responsiveness and sub-national behaviour.},

Abstract = {In Robert Dahl's work on `polyarchy', democratic `freedom' is liberty
   from the abuses of the state and freedom for citizens to formulate and
   express their preferences. This meaning of freedom is central to
   contemporary scholarship on democratization. At the same time, freedom
   has also been a key concept for activists and leaders involved in
   Myanmar's long democratic struggles. Yet, when freedom is referred to by
   Burmese activists and democratic leaders, does this entail support for
   liberty or freedom of the type outlined by Dahl? This article argues
   that Berlin's distinction between `negative' and `positive' freedoms can
   help to clarify overlaps and divergence in notions of freedom. When
   exploring `negative' democratic freedoms, such as freedom from
   government restrictions on speech or association, there is considerable
   overlap between the visions of Burmese activists and democratic leaders
   and the key elements of Dahl's democratic freedom. In considering
   `positive' freedoms, however, there is more divergence. Amongst
   activists and democratic leaders in Myanmar, there is a focus not on
   freedom as the exercising of own entitlements but rather on freedom for
   moral conduct; freedom to bear to the responsibilities and discipline of
   democracy.},

Abstract = {The contentious nature of national identity has been welldocumented, and
   the difficulties and challenges associated with self-understanding,
   particularly in a `stateless nation' context, have undergone profound
   scholarly exploration. As part of this exploration, the idea of
   `multiple identities' is prominent; one nation member can simultaneously
   hold a number of ideas, for example, Welsh and British. This had also
   led scholars to suggest that the same nominal identity, for example
   Welsh, may in itself have multiple meanings. Yet this accepted
   multiplicity of the same nominal identity often masks the hard truths:
   it is plausible that certain nation members may rank each other on a
   continuum, or sliding scale, of national identity, wherein some are
   considered more or less worthy of claiming that identity than others.
   This paper explores this concept in relation to Wales and the Basque
   Country. It begins by situating this phenomenon within the relevant
   theoretical context, subsequently exploring its analytical purchase
   through examination of focus group discussion in both nations. Finally,
   it considers the consequences of a continuum, or sliding scale, of
   identity for national unity, in particular its implications for the
   on-going development of a coherent national consciousness.},

Abstract = {This article reverses the direction of the causal link between
   corruption and media, in particular, journalism, as it has been commonly
   investigated in communication studies. Few existing studies have
   explored the effects of corruption on journalists' practices and
   self-conceptions. Based on a comparative survey of 1,764 journalists in
   12 European countries and two Arab states, conducted in 2011 and 2012,
   this article investigates how perceived corruption-considered as an
   extra-media macro determinant-affects journalists' perceptions of Media
   Accountability Instruments (MAI) impact and of governmental pressures on
   journalism quality. The empirical results obtained show that the more
   widespread corruption is in a country's public sector, the lower the
   journalists' perceptions of the MAI impact and the higher their
   perceptions of government pressures.},

Abstract = {This paper studies how voters' demand for economic reforms affects the
   probability that successful or populist reforms are adopted. We study a
   model of electoral competition with rationally ignorant voters in which
   the success of a reform is tied to a politician's unobservable
   competence. We show that when voters' demand for reform is high,
   candidates engage in a form of populism and propose reformist agendas
   regardless of their ability to successfully carry them out. As voters
   are then faced with either risky reformers or policy inaction, the
   relationship between demand for reform and the probability that any
   (i.e., genuine or populist) policy change is implemented depends on how
   harmful botched reforms are. Our results help organize the mixed
   empirical evidence regarding the impact of crises on the likelihood of
   reform. They also suggest that the rise of populism may cause political
   disenchantment rather than the other way round.},

Abstract = {Objective Methods This study tests U.S. citizens' attitudes toward
   immigrants and immigration. Immigrants and immigration educe strong,
   divergent sentiments in the U.S. population. While these sentiments,
   which are tied to public policy, have been examined in prior studies, it
   is important to test them regularly in empirical studies to observe any
   changes in attitudes toward immigrants and immigration. I rely on the
   2014 General Social Survey and employ hierarchical multivariate
   regression models to test the effects of patriotism, nationalism,
   xenophobia, and ``world citizenship{''} on pro-immigration attitudes.
   Results Conclusion Appendix Females, respondents with higher education,
   and respondents who were more patriotic were more likely to hold
   pro-immigration attitudes. Conversely, older respondents and respondents
   who held greater xenophobic attitudes were less likely to hold
   pro-immigration attitudes. Finally, respondents who viewed themselves
   more as citizens of the world than citizens of a particular country were
   more likely to hold pro-immigration attitudes. The study's results are
   generally consistent with findings from prior research, and point to a
   general invariability in Americans' views about immigrants and
   immigration. The policy implications of the findings are discussed.},

Abstract = {Public attitude surveys provide invaluable data for assessing how people
   view their countries' democratic progress and government performance, in
   addition to a range of other outcomes. Yet, these data are vulnerable to
   substantial biases deriving from interviewer effects. Apart from social
   desirability bias resulting from a (non)coethnic interviewer, this
   article demonstrates that the perception of a government interviewer is
   another crucial mechanism that generates bias in the African context.
   The evidence suggests that fear of the state, rather than social
   desirability, leads people in less open societies to provide more
   positive assessments of democratic and government performance and
   underreport corruption. In identifying this new source of bias, the
   article discusses potential improvements to survey protocols and modes
   of administration.},

Abstract = {This article focuses on the gendered aspects of the institutional
   framework surrounding the protection, control over, and transfer of
   property before 1914 in the area that became Romania in the twentieth
   century, from inheritance to marriage divorce, dowry, and widowhood.
   During the period covered here, these territories were part of several
   distinctive administrative regimes-the Habsburg Empire, Russia, and the
   Ottoman Empire-that also treated property ownership and transfer in
   various ways. Therefore, my analysis is comparative and offers insights
   into broader major historical questions, such as the relationship
   between religious dogma and secular law; the impact of ecclesiastical
   courts in relation to lay institutions in administering law and
   preserving property rights; and the impact of such institutions in
   enforcing specific gender norms.},

Abstract = {This study analyzes the creation of primary unit cohesion among the
   Kurdish Peshmerga soldiers fighting the Islamic State in northern Iraq
   and among Hezbollah fighters active in Syria. For this comparative
   study, Kurdish soldiers were interviewed on three fronts outside Mosul,
   Erbil, and Kirkuk in February 2015 and May 2016, and Hezbollah fighters
   were interviewed in Lebanon in March 2016. In contrast to many studies'
   depictions of unit cohesion as relating to shared experiences of
   training and battle, this study argues that the Kurdish soldiers also
   import into their units various ideas relating to Kurdish identity.
   These include ideas about nationalism and religion produced through
   discourses within the Kurdish military and society. However, Hezbollah
   seeks to minimize political damage in the multisectarian political
   context in Lebanon while conducting domestically contested military
   operations abroad. This has led to a downplaying of the sectarian
   aspects of the conflict, which could be imported from the Shia community
   to increase unit cohesion, and to an ideological framing of the
   conflict. The general ideas circulating in society and the political
   context therefore matter for the strategies that can be used to increase
   primary unit cohesion and soldiers' fighting power.},

Abstract = {Empirical evidence has shown that married men generally earn more and
   married women earn less than their unmarried counterparts. However, the
   control group of ``not married{''} differs between studies, over time
   and between countries, such that the message remains somewhat fuzzy. It
   is not clear whether the type of union or the fact of being in a union
   is responsible for these wage penalties and premiums. This article aims
   to analyze whether marriage pays more than cohabitation in a country
   such as France, where cohabiting and married partnerships have both
   coexisted for years. Thanks to a rich dataset with information on both
   the marital and work history of both partners, we are able to estimate
   the effect on hourly wages of being married relative to being in a
   cohabiting union. Taking into account selections into marriage (rather
   than cohabitation) and into the labor market with a possible
   differential in sharing of paid work within the couple, our results show
   that the men's marriage premium is due entirely to a positive selection
   into marriage. While the process of within-couple marital specialization
   strongly reduces a woman's hourly wage, there is no evidence of any
   additional marriage penalty for women. The within-couple gender wage gap
   is similar for married and cohabiting partners, after controlling for
   selection into marriage.},

Abstract = {Since the late eighties, governments have designed telecommunication
   policies aiming at introducing competition. This implies new regulation
   framework and privatization of State Owned Enterprises (SOEs). This
   paper empirically assesses the effect of reforms sequences in the
   telecommunications sector on the sector performance, by using a sample
   of 17 Middle East North African (MENA) countries for the period
   1995-2010. Countries are free to choose how to proceed notably whether
   to establish an Independent Regulatory Authority (IRA) before or after
   privatizing the SOEs, as well as they can create an IRA before
   introducing competition rather than after. We assume that the choices of
   reforms sequences are affected by institutional, political and economic
   variables. We use IV-2SLS estimation to analyze the outcome of reforms
   sequences in terms of telecom performance (access, prices, productivity
   and quality). We find that an IRA established before privatizing the
   incumbent operator improves the sector access but with an increase in
   fixed prices. However, the effect of an IRA before introducing
   competition differs between the fixed and the mobile sector. Regulation
   still works as an imperfect substitute for competition in the fixed
   market, which is no more the case for the mobile market.},

Abstract = {Using a representative survey of German university students, we confirm
   that proclaimed support for environment protection policies depends on
   socio-cultural factors and political ideology. Unlike most related
   studies for other countries, we find that the environmental policy
   stance of German partisans does not follow the left-right cleavage. Only
   about 25\% of the social-democratic partisans wholeheartedly support
   environment protection policies, whereas 50\% of the green partisans,
   who, in Germany, also belong to the political left, do so; and when
   controlling for sociocultural influences, social-democratic partisans
   become undistinguishable from Christian conservative and market-oriented
   partisans. Focusing on behavioral influences, we find that some of the
   respondents' psychological traits are not filtered through their
   political ideology but directly influence their proclaimed attitudes
   towards environment protection policies. We identify as important
   behavioral determinants the locus of control and psychological traits
   that capture the respondents' susceptibility to making use of expressive
   rhetoric.},

Abstract = {We investigate the relation between elicited social preferences and
   attentional contribution in a pro-social environment. For this purpose,
   we propose a new experiment, namely the ``dustbin task{''}, where
   subjects invest real attention to reduce uncertainty in a discrimination
   task. We compare three different incentivized environments where the
   subject's accuracy: do not impact on thier or other subjects' payoffs
   (T0), impact their payoff only (Self-Interested treatment T1) and impact
   other subjects' payoff only (Prosocial treatment T2). Our results show
   that both incentives ( T1 and T2) increase the amount of allocated
   attention, regardless of the subject's intrinsic motivation. We elicited
   subject social preferences and find that they cannot explain attentional
   contribution in pro-social environments ( T2). This latter result, in
   contradiction with economic theory, provides new insight about
   social-preferences and attention allocation.},

Abstract = {Using survey data from the World Values Survey and the Comparative
   Manifesto Project, we empirically study attitudes towards the proposal
   that government compensation should be provided for individuals
   adversely affected by globalization. We include roles for personal
   experience with globalization and ideology of individuals and political
   parties, noting also the general problem of expressiveness in survey
   data, where responders who favored compensation did not actually have to
   pay to help. Findings indicate that attitudes to actual compensation
   depend on exposure to globalization but are substantially qualified by
   ideology.},

Abstract = {This article examines whether the voting age should be lowered to 16.
   The dominant view in the literature is that 16-year-olds in the United
   Kingdom are not politically mature enough to vote since they lack
   political knowledge, political interest and stable political preferences
   (Chan and Clayton, 2006). I reject this conclusion and instead argue
   that the voting age should be lowered to 16. First, I look at Chan and
   Clayton's empirical claims and show that these features of 16- and
   17-year-olds are in fact created by exclusionary social practices and
   therefore that these features cannot be used to justify their exclusion
   from the vote. Second, I evaluate preliminary evidence from Austria
   which suggests that 16- and 17-year-olds, when actually given the vote,
   are politically mature. Third, I show that, on a balance of harms,
   considering that some 16- and 17-year-olds are mature, we still should
   lower the voting age even if some 16- and 17-year-olds are not
   politically mature. I conclude that the voting age should be lowered to
   (at least) 16.},

Abstract = {This article analyzes the extent to which diverse institutional logics
   (stock market, privately held, civil society, public) are linked to the
   exercise of one important mode of media ownership power: public service
   orientation. The research draws on a content analysis of a total of
   fifty-one news organizations in Sweden, France, and the United States,
   representing, respectively, Hallin and Mancini's democratic corporatist,
   polarized pluralist, and liberal models. We find that two types of
   institutional logicsaffordance and homogenizationshape the amount and
   type of public-service-oriented news. On average,
   public-service-oriented news was highest at civil-society-owned media,
   but there was significant variation within this category: We call this
   kind of institutional logic an affordance logic because it affords but
   does not guarantee a certain kind of news content. Public media, on the
   other hand, exhibited the least deviation across outlets within each
   country, thus exemplifying a strong homogenization logic. All forms of
   ownership, but especially privately held and civil society media,
   exhibited significant variations across individual organizations.
   Economic field dominance, as in the United States, did not produce
   greater homogenization across ownership fields as predicted by field
   theory.},

Abstract = {In the political economy of education policy, interactions between
   policymakers and public opinion can create discrepancies between
   political awareness and action. While a large literature studies public
   opinion on different aspects of the welfare state, research has only
   recently started to investigate the public's attitudes towards education
   policy. We survey this emerging literature with a particular focus on
   public preferences for education spending in different sociodemographic
   subgroups, policy trade-offs, support for specific education reforms,
   and the importance of information for public preferences. While the
   available evidence is multifaceted, there is some general indication
   that citizens place high priority on education policy, show substantial
   willingness to reform, and are responsive to information and adequate
   reform designs.},

Abstract = {This article proposes an original review of the literature on tax
   competition, and provides new evidence concerning different types of
   footloose capital: the intensity of strategic interactions is three time
   stronger for financial assets than for less mobile capital (e.g.
   industrial buildings). We also present tax optimization techniques used
   by Multi-National Firms (MNFs) and document some case studies regarding
   the foregone tax revenue due to evasion. Amounts saved by firms are
   comparable to the annual contributions to the EU budget by countries
   like the UK, Ireland, the Netherlands or Luxembourg. We estimate that
   the total revenue losses for the EU governments due to corporate tax
   avoidance amount to almost 100 billion (sic). After this description of
   the failure of the current system of taxation, this article analyzes
   alternative schemes such as the Common Consolidated Corporate Tax Base
   (CCCTB) and concludes with the outlook of a European corporate income as
   a genuine own resource for the EU budget.},

Abstract = {The present work reconstructs the way in which the concepts of
   `propaganda' and `public opinion' were defined and perceived by American
   intellectuals and policy-makers during the first years following the end
   of the Great War. The documentary sources analyzed for this study were
   produced by social scientists (academics works), journalists (press
   articles) y politicians (presidential speeches) of that time. The
   central thesis of the research is that, as for the interpretation of the
   notion of `propaganda' and `public opinion', a radical interpretative
   shift took place in that period as a consequence of the propagandistic
   experiences of the war, the recurrent radical movements' informative
   campaigns and the emergence of new and more efficient mass media. It is
   stated that these first scholarly postulates constituted the breeding
   ground for the emergence of the well-known debate on the manufacture of
   consent that characterized the interwar period.},

Abstract = {ObjectivesThis study addresses whether relative deprivation theory
   explains why some blacks perceive that the civil rights movement and
   black elected officials failed to improve the lot of the black
   community, including their own life chances.
   MethodsWe use data from a nationally representative survey of black
   adults, collected approximately 15 years after the passing of landmark
   civil rights legislation.
   ResultsNet of control variables, we find that relative deprivation
   associates significantly and positively with perceived inefficacy of
   black elected officials. However, relative deprivation does not predict
   perceptions of the civil rights movement as ineffective.
   ConclusionsWe know too little about mechanisms that produce variation in
   blacks' perceptions of race-related social change. Today's economic and
   sociopolitical climate provides a unique opportunity to explore and
   explain such variation.},

Abstract = {The study contributes the first detailed exploration of parliamentary
   experience in Australian ministerial careers. It examines how a
   dimension of parliamentary experience holding the office of
   parliamentary committee chair features in the careers of a single cohort
   of ministers and parliamentary secretaries appointed during the
   Coalition government 1996-2007. The study maps parliamentary experience
   on two dimensions and finds a typology of five different career paths,
   depending on positions held and the speed of movement between positions.
   Taking the analysis further, the second part of the study tracks the
   appointment of the five subgroups of ministers over time. This reveals
   patterns in the Prime Minister's ministry-making over the life of the
   government. At different times particular types of ministers were
   selected, in response to varying political needs and the demands of
   career management that John Howard faced over the government's
   lifecycle. The study considers the argument that elite grooming
   processes, where aspiring leaders are tested and trained, are weakening
   in Australia. It does not find evidence for this proposition based on
   the patterns of parliamentary experience of ministers at this time.},

Abstract = {ObjectiveMarriage is considered to protect health via multiple
   mechanisms, but this effect may have weakened as marriage has become
   deinstitutionalized in the United States. This article tests for
   cross-cohort decline in the protective effect of marriage.
   MethodsChange in the association between marital status and subjective
   general health over three birth cohorts was estimated using the
   1984-2011 Panel Study of Income Dynamics (N = 12,373). Analyses included
   least-squares, random-effects, and fixed-effects regression models,
   representing increasingly conservative approaches to ruling out
   selection bias.
   ResultsDespite associations between marriage and better health among
   both men and women, estimated by least-squares and random-effects
   regression, the fixed-effects models found health improvement relative
   to remaining unmarried only in very long (10 year) marriages, and only
   among women. This effect was completely attenuated among women in the
   youngest birth cohort.
   ConclusionThe modest benefit of marriage for women's subjective health
   has eroded in recent cohorts.},

Abstract = {Theories of team reasoning in game theory build on the assumption that
   best-reply reasoning is not the only reasoning mode agents may endorse.
   Instead, they may make choice on the basis of team preferences and/or as
   participants in a mutually beneficial practice. This paper reflects on
   the way to account for the rationality of endorsing team reasoning in a
   strategic decision problem. I focus on the particular issue of the
   rationality of making choice on the basis of team reasoning rather than
   other reasoning modes. I argue that the endorsement of team reasoning in
   specific contexts can be interpreted as a commitment that can be
   rationally assessed from an agent-subjective perspective. This
   necessitates making a distinction between preferences, conceived as
   individual interests, and values, defined as broader motivations and
   reasons to act. I suggest that this account of the rationality of team
   reasoning has significant normative implications, in particular
   regarding the relevance of standard welfare economics.},

Title = {Order please! How cultural framing shapes the impact of neighborhood
   disorder on law-and-order voting},
Journal = {POLITICAL GEOGRAPHY},

Abstract = {Local conditions shape voting behavior. Extant research has primarily
   scrutinized one specific relationship: the association between the share
   of ethnic minorities in a local context and voting for right-wing
   populist or anti-immigration parties. The electoral relevance of
   neighborhood disorder, another potentially salient local factor, has
   been unexplored, even though this social problem has received much
   attention in the field of criminology. We therefore assess whether
   neighborhood disorder underlies support for law-and-order parties. In so
   doing, we incorporate insights from the literature on cultural framing
   and theorize that the electoral relevance of neighborhood disorder is
   not the same for everyone, because different individuals may have
   different interpretations of the same local conditions. We thus
   hypothesize that neighborhood disorder more strongly inspires
   law-and-order voting among residents with an authoritarian disposition,
   that is, an aversion to diversity and difference and an inclination
   toward social conformity. Multilevel logistic regression analyses of
   nationally representative Dutch data (1678 Dutch natives in 180
   neighborhoods) corroborate this hypothesis: while we find no overall
   effect of neighborhood disorder on law-and-order voting, there is
   evidence of a strong positive effect among residents with a very
   authoritarian disposition. We discuss the relevance of these results and
   provide suggestions for further research.},

Abstract = {The southern parts of Yugoslavia, especially Macedonia, experienced
   massive emigration by non-Slavic Muslims in the 1950s after an agreement
   was concluded between Yugoslavia and Turkey in 1953. The movement raises
   questions of ethnic belonging and policy towards minorities in socialist
   Yugoslavia, especially regarding the Albanian population in Kosovo. It
   also raises questions regarding the entanglement of (migration) policy
   and emigration and the character of state intervention in an on-going
   emigration process. Thus, the author's aim is to analyse the pillars of
   migration policy, the legal and regulatory framework as well as the
   extent, causes and consequences of state intervention on emigration
   processes to Turkey. The author further questions the emigration factors
   and their ethno-political dimensions, also examining how the mass
   emigration of Muslims influenced different fields of society in the
   region of origin as well as the Muslim lifeworld in the region.},

Abstract = {We compare the results of two recent statewide recounts in Wisconsin-the
   2011 Supreme Court election and the 2016 presidential election. Using
   the measure of absolute differences between the original tally and the
   recount, we find an error rate at the reporting unit level of 0.21\% in
   2011 and 0.59\% in 2016. The 2016 error rate drops to 0.17\% when
   write-in votes are removed from the analysis. We also find that paper
   ballots originally counted with optical scanners were counted more
   accurately than ballots originally counted by hand. To reach these
   conclusions, we address the methodology of measuring differences in
   election night and recounted vote tallies. The most commonly used
   measure to compare election-night and recounted tallies, the net
   difference, significantly understates the magnitude of errors in the
   original tally. We also develop a regression-based technique that
   estimates what the error rate should be if a ballot-by-ballot recount
   were possible. We conclude by discussing the implications for requiring
   post-election audits.},

Title = {Could Internet Voting Halt Declining Electoral Turnout? New Evidence
   That E-Voting Is Habit Forming},
Journal = {POLICY AND INTERNET},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {10},
Number = {1},
Pages = {4-21},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {The hopes that e-voting would increase voter turnout have not really
   materialized; any turnout increases in those countries where Internet
   voting has been introduced have been negligible. But the effect of one
   mechanism by which this mode of voting might influence turnout is still
   largely unknown, namely its potential to keep voters voting at higher
   rates than paper voting, and thus if not reversing, then at least
   putting a halt to further decline in turnout. This article examines the
   degree to which people who vote on the Internet once carry on doing so,
   thereby testing the hypothesis that e-voting is more habit forming than
   paper voting. We test if e-voting displays traits typical of a habit,
   that is, being a self-reinforced behavior detached from its original
   motivations. Survey data are analyzed from five consecutive and
   e-enabled nationwide elections in Estonia between 2009 and 2015. The
   results suggest e-voting to be very sticky; a first time e-voter is very
   likely to stay e-voting in subsequent elections at consistently higher
   rates than a typical paper voter is to stay paper voting, or a nonvoter
   to remain a nonvoter. The results call for a re-examination of the
   association between Internet voting and turnout.},

Title = {River leaders in China: Party-state hierarchy and transboundary
   governance},
Journal = {POLITICAL GEOGRAPHY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {62},
Pages = {58-67},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {It is generally agreed that traditional territorial-fixed systems face
   transboundary difficulties that characterize a territorial mismatch
   between flowing materials and political boundaries. Hierarchization, a
   process of forming a hierarchy to generate transboundary power to
   transcend the territorial mismatch, is commonly founded in terms of
   transboundary river governance. For example, the existing literature
   discusses the hierarchization of river governance in either the
   establishment of a new governmental agency or creation of an ad hoc
   committee. However, the river leader policy introduced nationwide in
   China in 2016 is distinct from these two approaches. River leadership is
   assigned to certain prefecture level cadres, whose career advancement
   depends on achieving specific goals related to the quality of rivers for
   which they are made accountable. River leaders' transboundary powers to
   coordinate their subordinate officials and resources are not a function
   of their government positions but rather their cadre rank hierarchy
   within China's Leninist-style authoritarian party-state mechanism. We
   call this process hierarchization through partification'. With an
   empirical focus on the river leader policy of Dian Lake in Kunming,
   capital of Yunnan Province, we present a detailed discussion of
   hierarchization through partification in China, including its
   characteristics, advantages and limitations. This study depends on
   secondary data like official documents and news reports, along with
   first-hand site visits on river landscapes and field interviews with
   officials and citizens. This paper's core contributions are to enrich
   the theoretical discussion of different types of hierarchization that
   deal with transboundary affairs and to improve understanding how the
   authoritarian states like China initiate their own forms of river
   governance that are not properly examined by the existing transboundary
   governance literature. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Spain's economic crisis became a political crisis from 2011, when
   protest movements erupted in response to the direct effects of the
   former and the austerity regime that followed. However, this chapter
   suggests that the particularities of developments from 2011 are
   explicable not simply with reference to the proximate economic crisis
   but require an examination of Spain's broader transition from
   dictatorship from the 1970s and its Europeanisation thereafter.
   Prioritising stability, that transition was built upon the
   marginalisation or incorporation of non-mainstream groups and the
   formation of a narrow two-party system. It is against this backdrop that
   this chapter traces post-2011 events: the emergence of the `indignados'
   movement, the growth of separatism in Catalonia and the institutional
   challenges to the status quo at both local and national levels.},

Abstract = {In the last 15 years, a new generation of TV series based on complex
   storytelling and frequently focused on politics has emerged. Critics and
   commentators have identified this as a new golden age for television,
   frequently emphasising the accuracy and originality of this generation
   of TV series, and highlighting its capacity to represent different
   aspects of our world in an effective and innovative manner. Peculiar and
   original characters in political TV series are also being recognised in
   academic studies; in particular, these programs have attracted diffused
   interest in cultural and political studies and more recently also in
   popular geopolitics. The aim of this article is to contribute to this
   debate by analysing the ambivalent geopolitical perspectives transmitted
   within these forms of contemporary media products. By focusing on the
   political and legal series The Good Wife, produced by CBS between 2009
   and 2016, the paper shows how original and challenging representations
   of politics and society pair well with very traditional and stereotyped
   geopolitical representations. Consequently, the paper suggests that in
   many cases, the acclaimed originality in the form of TV series conceals
   old and stereotyped contents.},

Abstract = {For a political economy of metropolitan scale: the role of
   public-private relations. Territory, Politics, Governance. The
   metropolitan scale of urban development and governance has received
   increasing attention in urban research. Such a scale can be articulated
   in spatial, economic and political terms. This paper builds on the
   rescaling thesis and its practical expectations and investigates the
   engagement of economic players in political activities through which
   metropolitan scales are constructed. The cases of Paris, Rome and
   Shenzhen provide evidence of the determinants of how public-private
   relations shape the metropolitan scale under different conditions. The
   comparative analyses conclude that the role of global processes, the
   kind of firms and the role of national contexts are important in
   determining the ways public-private relations affect metropolitan-scale
   development.},

Abstract = {Locating the global financial crisis: variegated neoliberalization in
   four European cities. Territory, Politics, Governance. This paper looks
   at the variegated impact of the 2008 global financial crisis and the
   different ways in which local strategic actors imagined and responded to
   it through a comparative study of Barcelona, Brussels, Leeds and Turin.
   Drawing on cultural political economy, we see crisis moments as fertile
   territory for the analysis of variegation in urban neoliberalization
   processes as they can break path dependencies and open up alternatives.
   Inspired by the comparative turn in critical urban studies, our case
   studies are not offered as representative samples but as dense sites to
   explore the various interpretations and uses of the crisis, particularly
   at the elite level. This analysis suggests considerable variegation in
   how the crisis was both felt and interpreted locally across the four
   cities. The local elites did not regard this as a crisis of or in their
   own urban growth models, but as something external. However, as the
   global financial crisis morphed into national sovereign debt crises and
   austerity programmes, the experience in each city has been relatively
   similar. The paper concludes by emphasizing the continuity function of
   specific local actors through the processes of meaning-making in which
   they engage, something that existing work on variegated
   neoliberalization has so far overlooked.},

Abstract = {The paper deals with the issue of interbank interest rate pass-through
   into client interest rates offered by banks in the condition of Slovak
   Republic between 2004 and 2016. We provide an overview of studies of the
   interest rate relationship analysis in the bank and interbank market. We
   investigate the interest pass-through from money market rates to various
   loan and deposit rates. The analysis is carried out using the
   methodology of cointegration error-correction model, which take into
   account both the long-term and the short-term aspect of interest rate
   development. Our results point to considerable differences in the size
   of the pass-through with respect to either different loan and deposit
   rates. It has also shown a low rate of immediate transmission, the
   incompleteness of the pass-through, higher efficiency in the process of
   interbank interest rates pass-through into the interest rates on loans,
   and we can conclude that the process of interest rates pass-through in
   our conditions is relatively stable.},

Title = {In the Space between Exception and Integration: The Kokang Borderlands
   on the Periphery of China and Myanmar},
Journal = {GEOPOLITICS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {23},
Number = {1},
Pages = {147-179},
Abstract = {In 2015, the isolated border region of Kokang in Myanmar experienced
   armed conflict reported around the world. Most of the estimated 100,000
   refugees from the conflict crossed the border to China, while
   hostilities continued for six months. Unlike other ethnic minorities
   fighting Myanmar's government forces all along the extensive,
   mountainous border with China, the Kokang is largely of Han Chinese
   origin with a well established and nurtured relationship with China.
   Based on 458 questionnaires and interviews, media reports and official
   government releases, this article explores the varying imaginaries of
   territory, security and geopolitics of distant Kokang, from refugees now
   in China, Chinese from adjacent Yunnan and other provinces, as well as
   analysts viewing the conflict from afar. The study offers a lens for
   border studies to view the multi-scalar and extended geopolitics of
   nation states and their peripheral sub-national components.
   Specifically, the article addresses the changing role of the border
   under conditions of conflict and security enhancement and the malleable
   definition of borderlands territory. The study reveals how borders are
   utilised creatively by territorial inhabitants, their neighbours and
   their governments, how borders work in remote places, and how
   cross-border culture operates even in conflict situations to mediate
   borders. It enlarges our understanding of evolving borders in the space
   between exception and integration emerging in simultaneous globalisation
   and localisation.},

   Issue Attitudes},
Journal = {POLITICAL COMMUNICATION},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {35},
Number = {3},
Pages = {333-352},
Abstract = {We know much about how opinion leaders drive mass partisan polarization
   with position-taking cues but little on how different message types
   polarize citizens, and who responds most to those messages attributes.
   This article contributes new insights by investigating how exposure to
   common violent metaphors interacts with audience personality traits to
   polarize partisans on issues. Building from research on conflict
   orientations, we theorize that aggressive rhetoric primes aggression in
   aggressive partisans, motivating greater intransigence on party
   positions. As a consequence, aggressive partisans are pulled further
   apart on issues, thereby reducing prospects for compromise. We find
   support for our predictions in two large nationally diverse survey
   experiments conducted in very different political contexts. Our results
   demonstrate the subtle power of aggression in public opinion and
   highlight the important moderating role of individual differences in the
   communication of partisan conflict.},

Abstract = {This research explores the extent to which campaigns are consistent
   across communications channels in the issues that they emphasize. We
   compare the issue agendas in candidates' television advertising, tweets
   and emails from dozens of U.S. Senate races in 2014, creating a measure
   of issue convergence for each candidate. We find moderate levels of
   issue consistency, though issue agendas match more strongly for
   television ads and Twitter, two channels that speak to a more general
   audience. Our findings speak to the ability of campaigns to foster a
   common understanding of issue priorities among the public and the
   ability of voters to hold candidates accountable for their promises once
   in office.},

Title = {Investment in the Transmission Mechanism of Inflation Targeting -
   Verification of Sources of Investment Variability in the Czech Republic},
Journal = {POLITICKA EKONOMIE},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {66},

Pages = {201-217},
Abstract = {The paper is devoted to the topic of investment with emphasis on their
   position within the transmission mechanism of inflation targeting. It
   briefly discusses starting-points of inflation targeting regime,
   individual transmission channels of monetary policy, and routes through
   which the central bank may influence the investment. There are mentioned
   selected investment theories. Other factors, whose changes may induce
   changes in investment, are derived using these theories. Using available
   data, sources of investment variability are verified for the Czech
   Republic. Correlation analysis is performed and the vector error
   correction model is compiled. It seems that rise of aggregate demand is
   transformed into rise of investment. Similarly in case of asset prices.
   Appreciation of CZK is reflected in decline of investment. All three
   relations are consistent with the theory. On the contrary, sensitivity
   of investment to changes in market expected real interest rates is not
   clear.},

Abstract = {The introduction of the concept of capital in Capital - with the words
   `we find' - has provoked a great deal of discussion about the precise
   relation between the categories of simple circulation and the concept of
   capital. In this article, I argue that Marx derives the concept of
   capital by way of an analysis of the immanent contradictions of money,
   and that this dialectical derivation can be understood as a conceptual
   movement in which the concepts of money and capital progressively change
   their modal status. Furthermore, I examine the development of this
   transition to capital throughout Marx's writings from the period 1857 to
   1872, arguing that the same arguments can be found in all the relevant
   writings. Finally, the article provides a critical review of the
   literature on the transition to capital.},

Abstract = {Peace has re-emerged as a theme in political geography in the past few
   years, but it has a longer history in the discipline. Different
   positions on peace are epitomized by both the International Geographical
   Union, whose founding was proposed in London exactly a century ago, and
   by Halford Mackinder. That historical discussion, related to what was
   often called political realism', has been overtaken in recent years by a
   different disciplinary focus on geographies of peace understood as about
   much more than conditions of non-war between states. This insists that
   space and place are not the mere stage on which the real political
   dramas unfurl, but are active ingredients in peace. However, some
   critics claim these new studies don't adequately deal with the
   geographies of contemporary peacemaking in particular. Simultaneously
   current global politics suggests that authoritarian conflict management
   is the emerging global pattern that emphasizes maintaining the existing
   order, rather than dealing with larger issues of justice and the sources
   of violence. Inspired by Martin Luther King, Jr's global geographical
   ethic of peace, we consider how, looking forward, these contemporary
   issues are now especially pertinent for political geographers as
   accelerating environmental changes pose new challenges to the
   possibilities for peaceful societal transformation in the next phase of
   the Anthropocene.},

Abstract = {For a long time, social and public policies have presented upward social
   mobility as an unambiguously progressive process. However, there is a
   relatively new line of academic research that concerns the dilemmas, or
   `hidden costs', of upward mobility. Still, apart from a few inspiring
   exceptions, there is a lack of empirical studies, especially in Hungary,
   that explore the personal experiences of the impact of moving class
   through educational mobility. Academic literature about stigmatised,
   disadvantaged minorities such as Afro-Americans and Mexicans in the U.S
   or the Roma in Europe suggests that the professional middle class of
   these groups - those who have demonstrated an exceptional range of
   intergenerational mobility - have adopted a distinctive upward mobility
   strategy to overcome the challenges that are unique to them. These
   challenges emerge from the difficulties of maintaining intra-class
   relations with poorer `co-ethnics' (people from the communities they
   were brought up in), but also managing interethnic relations with the
   `white' (non-Black in the U.S, non-Roma in East-Central Europe)
   majority. As part of this minority culture of mobility, the Roma, as
   with other stigmatised minority groups, create and join ethnic
   professional organisations to enable them to culturally navigate both
   worlds. Throughout this paper, we focus our attention on influential
   ethnic support groups or organisations and address the question what
   effect they have on the costs of upward mobility in the case of our Roma
   professional middleclass sample.},

Journal = {INTERSECTIONS-EAST EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF SOCIETY AND POLITICS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {4},

Pages = {51-71},
Abstract = {In 2015 and 2016, the Czech Republic experienced a massive mobilization
   of a new anti-Islam and anti-immigration movement. Drawing on the
   concepts of the post-foundational discourse theory of the Essex School,
   the theory of populism of Ernesto Laclau and the model analysis of the
   EuroMayDay Movement provided by the German philosopher Oliver Marchart,
   this paper engages with the question of how the identity of this
   movement changed during the initial and later phases of the
   mobilization. The author distinguishes between two waves of
   mobilization, which differ regarding the construction of the identity of
   the movement as well as the number and variety of the collective actors,
   who succeeded in mobilizing. Whereas at the beginning of the year 2015
   the identity of the movement was constructed against Islam as an
   antagonistic Other, in the middle of the same year a deep chasm between
   the movement (representing the `people') and the `powerful' emerged. At
   this point, following Ernesto Laclau's definition of populism, the
   movement transformed into a populist movement. Moreover, this
   transformation was accompanied by the mobilization success of new
   organizations participating in the movement, including the exponents of
   the extreme right.},

Abstract = {This paper discusses how concreteness of place and locality matter for
   Roma in negotiating belonging and in engaging with home-making
   practices. The idea of `fluid identities' or `flows' permeated
   Roma/Gypsies related scholarly approaches and migration studies to a
   point that corporeality and materiality of movement and settlement
   became rather marginalised. Criticising this trend, the translocality
   perspective (Brickell and Datta, 2011) emerged as an agency-oriented
   approach that sheds more light on how local-to-local connections are
   made. To tackle these facets, in this article I analyse a walking tour
   in Zamora with Lina. With the ability to stimulate embodied, exploratory
   and relational experiences of space (O'Neill and Hubbard, 2010), this
   walking episode enabled Lina, a Romanian Roma woman, to reflect on the
   places that mattered to her life abroad. Based on her reflections, the
   article discusses how Lina dwells simultaneously `here' and `there', and
   imagines dwelling translocally.},

Abstract = {Assembling the Antipodes: migration, finance and territoriality across
   Australia and New Zealand. Territory, Politics, Governance. Australia
   and New Zealand's historically close cultural and economic ties have
   deepened since the neoliberal reforms of the 1980s. This paper develops
   an exploratory account of an emerging form of Antipodean territoriality
   that contributes another exemplar to interpretations of how public
   authority and private interests coalesce in the governance of space.
   Drawing on publicly available empirical material on contemporary
   migration and financial flows across the Tasman Sea and concepts from
   assemblage thinking, it is argued that these flows are stabilized
   through different institutional adjustments and enmeshments with
   cultural norms in both territories. Australian banks now supply
   financial capital to undergird a property (real estate) boom in New
   Zealand, the profits from which are returned to Australia. Concurrently,
   there has been mass migration of New Zealand citizens to Australia
   facilitated by the Special Category Visa, who are in turn replaced by
   mass migration into New Zealand. This research reveals how
   Australian-located power and interests exert a, albeit fragile and
   mutable, spatial reach into New Zealand territorial space to regulate,
   at a distance, migration into Australia while simultaneously
   legitimating the logics of financial extraction.},

Title = {Estimates of Tax Evasions in the Czech Republic Based on Analysis of
   Non-observed Economy},
Journal = {POLITICKA EKONOMIE},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {66},
Number = {5},
Pages = {569-587},
Abstract = {The aim of the paper is to estimate the total tax evasion in the Czech
   Republic in 2008-2015. For this purpose, an analysis of non-observed
   economy as an alternative method of tax evasion estimation is used. The
   presented method works as follows: the detailed segmentation of
   non-observed economy enables to match various types of hidden or
   concealed income with corresponding liable taxes and therefore to
   estimate the amount of tax due. The results show that tax evasion is
   increasing in the Czech Republic (with the exception of 2012) reaching
   71 bn CZK in 2008 and more than 120 bn CZK in 2015. This approach also
   allows us to divide the total tax evasion between direct and indirect
   taxes. From this point of view, the higher share belongs to direct taxes
   in the Czech Republic. This, however, may be caused by the nature of
   non-observed economy which does not cover all types of tax fraud, namely
   carousel frauds. That is why the presented estimates should be regarded
   as a bottom level of the total tax evasion in the Czech Republic.},

Abstract = {In international politics, the strategic narratives of different
   governments compete for public attention and support. The Russian
   government's narrative has prompted western concern due to fears that it
   exerts a destabilizing effect on societies in Eastern Europe and
   elsewhere. However, the behavior and thought processes of news consumers
   targeted by contradictory strategic narratives are rarely subjected to
   analysis. This paper examines how Ukrainian news consumers decide where
   to get their news and what to believe in a media environment where
   propaganda and disinformation are regarded as major threats to national
   security. Evidence comes from thirty audio-diaries and in-depth
   interviews conducted in 2016 among adult residents of Odesa Region.
   Through qualitative analysis of the diary and interview transcripts, the
   paper reveals how participants judged the credibility of news and
   narratives based on their priorities (what they considered important),
   not just facts (what they believed had happened). The attribution of
   importance to different foreign policy issues was associated, in turn,
   with varying personal experiences, memories, and individual cross-border
   relationships.},

Abstract = {The aim of our article is to inquire into the interconnectedness of
   local social context, mobility processes and social transformations. We
   argue that migratory patterns of the local Roma population in ethnically
   mixed communities are shaped by the degree and modes of maintenance of
   social distance between the Roma and local majority. While social
   distance can shape the ways migrant networks develop, it also influences
   the way remittances are invested at home. The analysis focuses on the
   comparison of two rural communities from Transylvania where we carried
   out community studies and a household survey which also included
   attitude questions related to ethnic groups. Our study reveal that the
   most visible aspect of the local separation is the housing segregation.
   While this is present in both cases, in one of the villages Roma use
   their upward mobility to challenge social segregation and to reduce
   physical distance (i.e. moving inside the village). Here in spite of
   physical closeness social distance between the majority and Roma remains
   high. In the other locality the importance of social ties increase
   during migration and social distance is reduced, while the ethnic groups
   maintain their relative residential separation.},

Title = {Social-spatial narrative: A framework to analyze the democratic
   opportunity of conflict},
Journal = {POLITICAL GEOGRAPHY},

Abstract = {Conflicts and contention increasingly challenge the capacity to govern
   the city. Social conflicts are not only problematic but also reveal a
   sense of active citizenship and engagement. Agonistic theories argue
   that governments should embrace contention to improve democracy, but
   this notion has rarely been made tangible in a framework of analysis.
   This paper proposes the `social-spatial narrative' (SSN) framework to
   analyze if, when, where, and how conflicts can create opportunities to
   strengthen urban democracy. The SSN framework analyzes the social
   geography and political significance of street-level encounters in
   processes of urban conflict. It unravels exactly how the micropolitics
   of citizenship interacts with policy practices at the street-level.
   Narratives reveal the perspectives of stakeholders, but in order to
   study how some actors establish power and others get excluded, I argue
   for a social-spatial approach to critical moments. Critical moments may
   create liminal moments to (re)negotiate meaning, relationships and
   repertoires of action. The potential of conflict lies in the dramaturgy
   of these critical moments, which are therefore pivotal vantage points
   for critical reflection on the repertoire of urban politics. The paper
   coalesces theories from conflict studies, geography, and public policy
   to examine conflict empirically through case studies. I illustrate the
   framework with a case study in Amsterdam that addresses when and where
   opportunities to engage plural voices in decision making have emerged,
   and how local officials have missed these opportunities. (C) 2017

Abstract = {`No sovereign nation, no reservation': producing the new colonialism in
   Cayuga Count(r)y. Territory, Politics, Governance. Since 1980, the
   Cayuga Nation has worked through various US politico-legal mechanisms to
   establish sovereignty over land taken from them by European settlers and
   their descendants in what is today New York State beginning in the
   1700s. When, in 2005, the US Supreme Court refused to review a lower
   court's dismissal of their case, the Cayugas began purchasing land they
   claim from local (non-Cayuga) property owners. Relatedly, they
   petitioned the US Bureau of Indian Affairs to place the land that they
   collectively own into federal trust, which would exempt them from
   various taxes. These efforts have engendered strong opposition from
   elements of the non-Native population, particularly the organization
   Upstate Citizens for Equality (UCE). This article interrogates the
   discourse of UCE, and its allies and antecedents, one that effectively
   nationalizes the Cayugas by producing them as `normal' US citizens, as
   well as that of the federal courts. It illustrates how a discourse
   emphasizing equality, fairness, (US) nationhood and private property
   obfuscates the Cayuga's dispossession and the nature of their land
   claim, to reproduce a colonized space, and to give rise to what we call
   `the new colonialism', producing an impasse whose overcoming requires a
   far-reaching rethinking of territory and sovereignty.},

Title = {When anger meets joy: how emotions mobilise and sustain the anti-coal
   seam gas movement in regional Australia},
Journal = {SOCIAL MOVEMENT STUDIES},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {17},
Number = {6},
Pages = {635-657},
Month = {NOV 2},
Abstract = {In many countries, the expansion of unconventional gas exploration and
   development has been met with grassroots resistance; the scale and depth
   of which has surprised even movement organisers. An often-remarked
   feature of the movement's success is the teaming up of farmers and
   environmental organisers, historically at odds with one another on other
   environmental issues. This paper explores the role of emotions in
   building alliances, and mobilising opponents of coal seam gas (CSG) in a
   particular rural setting in Australia. Drawing on interviews with
   anti-CSG movement participants, the paper argues that emotions help to
   explain how the movement has mobilised and sustained alliances despite
   differences between movement participants. We find that while anger
   plays a central role in mobilising various anti-CSG actors, it is the
   combination of anger with joy which helps to sustain the anti-CSG
   movement in regional Australia. Our analysis reveals three key sites
   (individuals, within groups, and the public arena) where these emotions
   are expressed and negotiated, and emphasises the influence of the rural
   context in this process.},

Abstract = {Many contributors to debates about professional conscience assume a
   basic, pre-professional right of conscientious refusal and proceed to
   address how to `balance' this right against other goods. Here I argue
   that opponents of a right of conscientious refusal concede too much in
   assuming such a right, overlooking that the professions in which
   conscientious refusal is invoked nearly always operate as public
   cartels, enjoying various economic benefits, including protection from
   competition, made possible by governments exercising powers of coercion,
   regulation, and taxation. To acknowledge a right of conscientious
   refusal is to license professionals to disrespect the profession's
   clients, in opposition to liberal ideals of neutrality, and to engage in
   moral paternalism toward them; to permit them to violate duties of
   reciprocity they incur by virtue of being members of public cartels; and
   to compel those clients to provide material support for conceptions of
   the good they themselves reject. However, so long as (a) a public cartel
   discharges its obligations to distribute the socially important goods
   they have are uniquely authorized to provide without undue burden to its
   clientele, and (b) conscientious refusal has the assent of other members
   of a profession, individual professionals' claims of conscience can be
   accommodated.},

Abstract = {This paper studies the incidence, determinants, and pricing of
   unprotected oral sex in the London sex services market. The analysis is
   based upon matched sex worker-client panel data, which were collected
   from `field reports' on PunterNet. com website over the 1999-2009 time
   period. We find a steady increase in the incidence of unprotected oral
   sex during this period, rising from < 20\% to over 50\% of all
   transactions. We show that the average premium for unprotected oral sex
   amounts to about 10-14\% of the transaction price, and that this premium
   is higher if a sex worker has agency affiliation. Agency affiliated sex
   workers are also less likely to engage in unprotected oral sex compared
   to independent sex workers.},

Abstract = {Surveys indicate that between 70\% and 80\% of people consider judges to
   be too lenient. This current research confirms the inadequacy of this
   general measure of public opinion by contrasting it with alternative
   opinion-based measures of court sentencing across specific criminal
   cases. The article also explores the impact of public's experiences of
   the criminal justice system on their opinions about the courts. Having
   been a victim or attending a criminal case where the punishment was seen
   as being too lenient seems to cause greater dissatisfaction, whereas
   contact with people working with victims or who have been in prison
   improves the level of satisfaction.},

Abstract = {The existence of the risk of the securitized assets on the bank balance
   sheets was one of the specificities of the 2007-2009 crisis. Asset
   markets have frozen, in the wake of the confidence crisis, linked to the
   asymmetry of information between banks, sellers of these securitized
   assets and investment funds, their buyers. In this context, this paper
   proposes a sequential equilibrium in which the central bank can
   intervene to revive the asset market. However, this role of the central
   banker is that of a risk taker of last resort due to the fiscal cost.
   The paper then shows that the mission of supplying liquidity must be
   supplemented by a risk management policy of the central bank balance
   sheet, on the extreme risks of the assets. The risk management policy
   defines a macroprudential policy. A comparison is made between the
   normative model and the practical management of the crisis by the
   central banks.},

Title = {Does Racial Discrimination Exist Within the NBA? An Analysis Based on
   Salary-per-Contribution},
Journal = {SOCIAL SCIENCE QUARTERLY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {99},
Number = {3},
Pages = {933-944},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Objective. To explore whether racial discrimination exists in athlete
   pay within the National Basketball Association (NBA). Methods. I use the
   ratio between annual salary and standardized contribution to establish a
   salary-per-contribution index as a basis for comparison of salary
   differences between black and white NBA players. According to theory of
   social equity (Adams, 1965. Advances in Experimental Social Psychology
   2(4): 267-99), when considering salary equality, it is necessary to
   consider differences in both inputs (here, contributions) and outputs
   (salaries) (Scully. 1974. American Economic Review 64(6): 915-30).
   Results. For the period 1999-2016, salary-per-contribution is
   significantly higher for black players overall than for white players
   overall, being higher before 2006 (but not after). It is also higher for
   American (but not international) and non-rookie (but not rookie) black
   players than for white American and nonrookie players (respectively). A
   higher games started rate increases between black and white players.
   Conclusion. Given poor fit of measuring salary discrimination, existing
   literature exploring racism in the NBA from the perspective of salary
   may have inaccurate conclusions.},

Title = {A counter-mine that explodes silently: Romano and Schmitt on the unity
   of the legal order},
Journal = {ETHICS \& GLOBAL POLITICS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {11},
Month = {JUL 22},
Abstract = {This contribution is intended to provide an answer to a controversial
   question: Why does Carl Schmitt - perhaps the firmest advocate of the
   state unity - not only mention and praise Santi Romano's book on the
   legal order - a work that can be rightfully considered an uncompromising
   defence of legal pluralism - but even list him among his inspirers?
   While a given (and essentially flawed) interpretation of Romano's
   institutional model, like that provided by Schmitt, actually makes his
   concrete-order thinking better suited to cope with the legal pluralism
   of modern social theory (and this is a possible answer to the opening
   question), it ultimately reveals the serious deficiencies of what can be
   defined as Schmitt's institutional decisionism. Contrary to what Schmitt
   believes, indeed, Romano's social ontology decisively contributes to
   demonstrate how the argument Schmitt uses in his general attack on
   social pluralism can also be re-deployed in its defence. Yet, Schmitt's
   reappraisal of Romano's concept of institution, questionable as it may
   be, addresses and tackles a crucial issue - probably, the crucial issue
   of both the entire book and his legal institutionalism as a whole - that
   Romano himself appears to be unable to solve and that still remains an
   open and challenging question for most social theorists.},

Abstract = {Many central banks now publish transcripts or summaries of meeting
   discussions and record policy preferences of individual members of
   policymaking committees. We present an econometric model of committee
   decisions for Sweden's Riksbank that uses individual preference data
   pooled over committee members and meetings. Estimates indicate that
   members attach a small weight to their own preferences when voting;
   instead, members tend to defer to the perceived committee consensus.
   These results contrast with some previous findings that members deferred
   to the committee chairman when voting.},

Abstract = {Starting from a discussion of three new books, the article examines
   recent developments in Habsburg historiography, which have important
   implications for the ways historians explain nineteenth-century European
   history as a whole, and the Empire's relationship to its many
   nationalities in particular. Wolfram Siemann's monumental new biography
   of Metternich makes a crucial contribution to reassessing the historical
   context from which the Habsburg monarchy emerged. At the centre of this
   work is the statesman's political thought and his dramatic experience of
   political change between the French Revolution and the aftermath of
   1848. Pieter Judson's history of the Habsburg monarchy exemplifies a
   substantial new body of research that has shifted attention from the
   antagonistic relationship between the Empire and its nationalities to
   the compatibility between a sense of national belonging and imperial
   loyalty. Both works complement the discussion of hybridity and national
   indifference during Emperor Franz Joseph's long reign, which Michaela
   and Karl Vocelka examine in a new biography.},

Abstract = {This study examines the religious-secular party cleavage in German
   morality politics from a new perspective by tracing politicization
   patterns at the individual level. It builds on the idea of issue
   competition and explores whether conflicts between Christian Democrats
   and secular parties align with the traditional denominational divide
   between Catholics and non-Catholics or with religiosity. By means of
   logistic regressions of Member of Parliaments' politicization behavior
   in the German Bundestag (1998-2002) with regard to three morality
   policies, the study provides evidence that German politics is still
   structured by a conflict between Catholics and non-Catholics, whereas
   the influence of religiosity is secondary. If party competition is at
   work, non-Catholics draw attention to morality policies, while Catholics
   refrain from doing so. This finding contradicts research pointing to a
   decreasing significance of Catholicism for Christian Democracy.
   Moreover, the study proposes an innovative way to re-examine party
   cleavages at the individual level and in between elections.},

Abstract = {ObjectiveWe extend prototype theory to explain why nonmembers who are
   socially connected to group members hold political attitudes that differ
   from nonmembers lacking that connection. We anticipate that the
   intensity of nonmember attitudes varies by connection to a prototype or
   periphery group member.
   MethodsUsing data from the 2006 Cooperative Congressional Election Study
   (CCES), we model group-salient political attitudes for veterans, union
   members, and their family members.
   ResultsWe find social distance from group members is theoretically
   linked to within-group variation that distinguishes prototype from
   periphery group members.
   ConclusionAnalysis of political attitudes is enhanced beyond the
   traditional member/nonmember dichotomy by accounting for nonmembers'
   social distance from group members.},

Abstract = {Past research largely has ignored the effects of political parties on
   states' default risks. This paper addresses that question by analyzing
   the response of credit spreads to weekly polling data from 17
   gubernatorial elections between 2009 and 2012, during the 6 months prior
   to Election Day. The findings are that political affiliation has a
   significant effect on states' default risks. The estimated effect of
   electing a Republican governor is a 6\% reduction in the credit spread
   of the state. The effect prevails regardless of the party in control of
   the state legislature, and it is larger when gubernatorial elections are
   contested closely. Set in the context of case law, the paper links
   higher tax levels to greater credit risk. Moreover, an analysis of the
   candidates' campaign promises suggests that stronger positions against
   tax increases are associated with less default risks. The results of the
   paper are therefore consistent with the empirical evidence suggesting
   that Republicans prefer lower taxes.},

Abstract = {A unique struggle over conscription was a defining characteristic of the
   Australian experience of the Great War. The labour movement was at the
   center of opposition to conscription, and arguments from liberty were
   central to its stance. But anti-conscriptionists had to make their
   arguments in an environment shaped by powerful competing appeals to
   loyalty. This article examines the ways in which labour
   anti-conscriptionists sought to minimise the impact of these loyalist
   appeals, while pressing ahead with their central liberal arguments. Two
   ways of interpreting these arguments enabled them to do this. The first
   emphasised the Britishness of the liberal tradition and the close
   relationship between conscription and continental despotism. The second
   emphasised the affinity between the liberal tradition and the New World
   and drew on other comparisons, especially with North America.},

Abstract = {ObjectiveRecent works on anti-Americanism have indicated a link between
   anti-American and anti-Semitic resentments but neither an explication of
   the underlying mechanisms nor satisfying empirical data regarding such a
   relationship exist. This article offers historical insights and
   theoretical reflections as well as quantitative data for the case of
   Germany with which the theoretical assumptions are tested.
   MethodsThe sample of the study consists of 1,201 respondents randomly
   selected from the German population older than 18 years
   (computer-assisted telephone interviews survey). The data are analyzed
   using seemingly unrelated regression models.
   ResultsAnti-American and anti-Semitic attitudes correlate substantially.
   Multivariate models show that this correlation can be explained via the
   common function of both to rationalize social change.
   ConclusionThe historical ties of European anti-Semitism and
   anti-Americanism are still prevalent today. They combine into a
   comprehensive symptom that is constituted by the uncertainty caused by
   globalization and an accelerated capitalism.},

Abstract = {This article illustrates how Gilgit-Baltistan in northern
   Pakistan-bordering Afghanistan, China, and India-has been part of an
   ``assemblage of marginality{''} since the region was incorporated in
   1947 and 1948. We situate our case amidst recent scholarship that seeks
   to go beyond mere location at the territorial limits of the nation-state
   as the defining feature of a border area. In addition, we emphasize the
   temporal aspects of how marginality in Gilgit-Baltistan has been
   assembled through four constituent processes: (1) the continuity of the
   colonial legacy in the western Himalaya, poignantly highlighted by the
   ongoing dispute between India and Pakistan that has resulted in
   Gilgit-Baltistan's constitutionally ambiguous status today; (2) the
   pervasiveness of nationalist histories and cultural tropes about
   Gilgit-Baltistan that have been constructed for the post-colonial state;
   (3) a local political economy subservient to a centralist agenda that
   has been amplified by the introduction of the China-Pakistan Economic
   Corridor (CPEC); (4) the formation of local identities in
   Gilgit-Baltistan, marked by exclusion from the state, which offers
   insights into marginality as identity. In sum, we argue that this
   assemblage of marginality goes far beyond Gilgit-Baltistan and provides
   ample points of comparison with marginal spaces in other locations
   around the globe. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {ObjectiveWhile scholars treat neighborhoods as important contexts of
   inequality, few studies explore the social processes that create
   disparities in neighborhoods' political capacities. How does
   neighborhood social organization affect rates of political
   participation?
   MethodsWe combine surveys from the U.S. Census and Boston Neighborhood
   Survey (BNS), and administrative data from the City of Boston.
   Accounting for spatial dependence, we fit a series of regression models
   investigating the relationship between neighborhood social structure and
   four forms of political engagement: community meeting attendance,
   contacting local government for services, and voter turnout in a local
   and a national midterm election.
   ResultsWe find higher rates of political participation in more stable
   neighborhoods, and lower rates of participation in neighborhoods with
   higher concentrations of immigrants. The relationship between collective
   efficacy and rates of political participation is not statistically
   significant in our models. We find a positive association between
   concentrated disadvantage and city election turnout, but this
   association is nonlinear: beyond a certain threshold, increases in
   disadvantage are associated with decreasing rates of participation.
   ConclusionWe argue that neighborhoods are indeed political places, and
   residential stability, immigrant concentration, andto a lesser
   extentconcentrated disadvantage are important factors affecting the
   civic capacity of urban communities.},

Abstract = {ObjectivesThis study examines the contribution of general human capital,
   social capital, and financial management practices to the individual's
   relative financial well-being following bankruptcy.
   MethodsMultivariate logistic regression models were estimated using
   secondary data from the Survey of Consumer Finances 2004 and 2007.
   ResultsIndividuals who possess higher general human capital and greater
   access to social capital are significantly more likely to achieve net
   worth parity with nonfilers following bankruptcy compared to similar
   individuals with lower levels of general human capital and social
   capital.
   ConclusionHuman and social capital are relatively more important factors
   contributing to attaining net worth parity with peers following
   bankruptcy than financial management practices and attitudes when
   controlling for ownership of protected assets. Congressionally mandated
   financial management training and counseling would likely have
   substantially better outcomes on bankruptcy filers' financial well-being
   over the long term if additional human-capital-buildingand consequently
   income-buildingprograms are integrated into the mandated financial
   management training.},

Abstract = {Regional and national identities are significant determinants of
   people's support for secession. Most previous works, however, have
   implicitly assumed that national identity has a linear unconditional
   effect. We complement previous works by showing that the relationship
   between identity and support for secession changes as a function of the
   context in which an individual interacts, an effect particularly
   important among those with mixed national and regional identities. The
   first stage of our empirical analysis is based on a pool of 22,000
   individuals in the context of Catalonia (Spain). Findings confirm that
   dual-identity individuals are especially affected by their immediate
   surroundings: the probability to vote in favour of independence among
   them substantially increases when the percentage of people speaking
   Catalan increases. On a second stage, we explore the existence of a
   social interaction mechanism by employing a survey that measures the
   preferences of people's close networks. We show that individual's
   interaction in like-minded networks modifies the relationship between
   identity and secession, with the effect being again strong among
   dual-identity individuals. This group is six times more likely to vote
   for secession when having only pro-secession close contacts, as compared
   to having none. These results have implications for studies on
   regionalism and preferences for territorial decentralization. (C) 2018

Abstract = {Understanding why states voluntarily cede power to international
   institutions, and if those institutions fulfill their stated goals,
   remain a pressing question in international relations. In order to
   evaluate the material and normative logics that may drive this type of
   behavior, this paper considers state commitment to and compliance with
   the Special Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS) initiative launched by
   the IMF in 1996. This effort seeks to enhance the availability of
   comprehensive economic data based on best dissemination practices to
   facilitate pursuing sound macroeconomic policies. Using panel data on
   120 countries during the 1996-2011 period, we find that commitment to
   the SDDS occurs when costs for states are low, and that compliance with
   the SDDS initiative is associated with increased data transparency after
   controlling for self-section bias. Our results are robust to controlling
   for endogeneity, alternative sample, and estimation methods.},

Abstract = {Considerable interest among academics and practitioners alike centers
   around identifying ways to improve voter turnout and voting parity
   across various subgroups in the U.S. population. Many scholars have
   investigated convenience voting and found mixed results in terms of its
   effects on turnout and its composition. A relatively new but unstudied
   method of voting is via ballot drop box, a method states and voters have
   increasingly turned to. We exploit the placement of over 30 new drop
   boxes in King County, Washington, the home of Seattle, during the 2016
   election to investigate their effect on turnout. We find that distance
   to the closest ballot drop box increases one's probability of voting but
   primarily in off-year elections and primaries. We find mixed results for
   heterogeneous treatment effects. Implications are discussed.},

Abstract = {We live in an era characterised by a complex and dynamic relationship
   between financial innovation, the state and patterns of investment. At
   its core is the little understood issue of shadow money-a `promise to
   pay' backed by high-grade collateral, usually government bonds, which
   means that government debt now plays a key role in the stabilisation of
   the financial system. Central banks' growing appreciation of how shadow
   money can generate destabilising dynamics has necessitated them to take
   preventative actions, and new forms of central bank-led systemic
   stabilisation have materialised. This new and complex dynamic requires a
   new social contract, the investment state-a compact between the state
   and financial markets and between the stabilisation and investments arms
   of the state.},

Abstract = {Portugal's economic crisis was characterised by the experience of `all
   of the signs of overheating. without any acceleration of GDP' (Deutsche
   Bank 2010). This chapter traces how the introduction of European
   Community/European Union (EU) facilitated `structural reforms'
   throughout the 1980s and 1990s contributed to the development of new and
   dangerous patterns of debt-led growth. In the 1990s, a rejuvenated
   private banking sector drove the expansion of economic growth in
   Portugal's non-tradable sector, damaging the country's competitiveness
   and creating some of the highest levels of private debt in the EU. This
   trajectory of economic growth contributed to a decade of recession in
   the 2000s, ensuring that Portugal was particularly vulnerable to
   contagion from the Greek and Irish crises from 2010 onwards.},

Abstract = {Candidates for political office in the United States can appeal to
   constituents in either English or in Spanish. We investigate the
   consequences of this choice in a series of survey experiments conducted
   on large, diverse samples of both monolingual and bilingual Americans.
   We take advantage of parallel advertisements produced in both English
   and Spanish by real candidates for national officeone presidential and
   two congressional. Because our design holds constant candidates' policy
   positions, we can attribute the effects on vote choice directly to the
   choice of language over and above other candidate attributes. In two of
   our three experiments, the Spanish-language advertisements increased
   candidates' electoral support by 5 percentage points among bilinguals.
   We find the opposite pattern of results among English-speaking
   monolingual Americans, who respond very negatively to Spanish-language
   advertisements. Our results shed light on the strategic calculus of
   candidates who must appeal to multiple linguistic communities at once.},

Abstract = {This paper examines panel data from two waves of the Youth Participatory
   Politics Survey, a nationally representative sample of young people in
   the United States. It employs a cross-lagged design to investigate the
   extent to which common forms of online activity create pathways to
   online and offline forms of political activity. Specifically, we examine
   the influence of Friendship-Driven (FD) and Interest-Driven (ID) online
   activity on online participatory politics and on offline forms of
   political action. Our findings reveal that FD and ID activity relate to
   political engagement, but in different ways. In addition, we find that
   the size of young people's social networks interacts with both FD and ID
   online activity to promote political activity. This indicates that
   having exposure to weak-ties (resulting from large social networks)
   promote higher levels of political engagement. These findings
   demonstrate the need to specify the kinds of online activities in which
   youth are engaged and, more broadly, the political significance of
   social media and social networks},

Abstract = {Since the creation of the European Union, anti-immigration rhetoric has
   traditionally been directed at non-European citizens. However, in recent
   decades hostility towards migrants has been extended to the rejection of
   EU citizens, to whom the European treaties ostensibly guarantee freedom
   of movement. In particular, the migration of the largest European ethnic
   minority, the Roma, within the EU has been accompanied by inflamed media
   reports and populist discourse laden with explicitly racist sentiments.
   Whereas the dynamics of Romani migration in the original Member States
   has received substantial political and academic attention, the movement
   of Roma people across newer Member States continues to be overlooked. An
   intrinsic assumption that Romani migration is a solely westward
   phenomenon has led to a failure to examine the role of Central and
   Eastern European states in generating exclusionary policies. Despite
   urgent calls from human rights activists about the intensifying
   violation of the legal rights of Romani migrants the situation has yet
   to be acknowledged or scrutinized by international organizations and
   academics. To shed analytical light on this under-researched area, the
   article presents an analysis of the impact of Polish immigration regime
   on Romani migrants and long-time residents from Romania. Drawing on data
   from official documents, activist reports, and semi-structured
   interviews the article traces the neoliberalization of Polish migration
   regime: one that mobilizes aggressive attitudes and behaviors towards
   the poorest and most marginalized European citizens. In turn, it argues
   that the deterrent tactics employed against migrants by the Polish State
   has its roots in the increasingly restrictive EU immigration policies
   and economic determinism of the Freedom of Movement and Residency
   Directive.},

Abstract = {Political economies of transnational fields: harmonization and
   differentiation in European diplomacy. Territory, Politics, Governance.
   Focusing on Europe, this paper analyses diplomacy as an uneven
   transnational field. The field is uneven not only along the predictable
   lines of big and small states, but also along the lines of wealth and
   tradition that are customarily overlooked in diplomatic studies. The
   political economy of European diplomacy cannot be read off the map of
   states without considering cross-national patterns of economic and
   symbolic capital. The field is transnational in the sense that national,
   international and supranational elements blend in daily practice to
   create qualitatively new forms of diplomatic knowledge production. By
   analysing such uneven transnationalism, the paper brings greater
   empirical and conceptual specificity to our understanding of
   bureaucratic knowledge production. The empirical material focuses on
   diplomatic training. It is drawn from web-based sources and over 100
   interviews with the professionals of diplomacy in Brussels and five
   national capitals. This `peopled' lens enables a high-resolution
   analysis of diplomatic practice and thereby illuminates socio-spatial
   patterns that remain invisible in traditional state-based accounts. By
   unpacking in concrete terms what the oft-used phrase `beyond the state'
   means in diplomatic training, the paper advances the study of
   bureaucratic knowledge production in geography and cognate fields.},

Title = {Beyond Spheres of Influence: The Myth of the State and Russia's
   Seductive Power in Kyrgyzstan},
Journal = {GEOPOLITICS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {23},
Number = {2, SI},
Pages = {404-435},
Abstract = {This article questions the analytical value of spheres of influence for
   understanding power and the state in the post-Soviet region and beyond,
   based on a critical deconstruction of the ontological and
   epistemological assumptions inherent in the concept. It proposes an
   alternative reading of power and the state, drawing on the concept of
   seductive power at a distance and Timothy Mitchell's state effect.
   Rather than the concept of a sphere of influence, a highly politicized
   concept that conveys an ontology that flattens and divides space,
   essentializes the state, and relies on an intentionalist account of
   power, we need an analytical framework that can help us make sense of
   the multiple, varied spatialities and historical legacies that produce
   the state and power. I demonstrate this through an extended discussion
   of Russian power in Kyrgyzstan, a country often described as a Russian
   client state. Mobilizing recent re-conceptualizations of state and power
   in anthropology and political geography, I present an analysis of
   Russia's seductive power in Kyrgyzstan and the way it contributes to
   producing Kyrgyz state-ness. I also show how Russia's Great Power myth
   is itself evolving and conclude that the differentiated, relational
   production of space and power in either Kyrgyz or Russian myths of the
   state is not captured by a the concept of a return to spheres of
   influence.},

Title = {Social Mobilities in the Transnational Migration of Romanian Roma to
   Italy},
Journal = {INTERSECTIONS-EAST EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF SOCIETY AND POLITICS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {4},
Number = {2},
Pages = {126-148},
Abstract = {The article can be included in the contemporary debate about the role
   that transnational migrations play in modifying the European social
   order. There is general agreement about the fact that, in the modern-day
   global framework, while transnational migration can improve the living
   conditions of some, they can also make things worse for others and can
   contribute to creating new forms of inequality rather than curtailing
   old ones. Scholars agree that international migration can lead to
   profound social changes through social remittances or cultural
   mobilities, but they are skeptical about the possibility of considerable
   re-stratification both in receiving and origin countries.
   The article therefore investigates changes in status within some
   Romanian Roma migrant networks in Italy based on a set of qualitative
   and ethnographic data compiled during the European project The
   Immigration of Romanian Roma to Western Europe: Causes, Effects and
   Future Engagement Strategies - MigRom. This article demonstrates how
   Romanian Roma migration is only able to produce status changes in
   migration partially, and highlights how these changes are the result of
   a diverse combination of factors, such as Roma migrants' motivation,
   ambition, and opportunities, but above all migration policies and
   anti-Gypsyism in the origin and receiving countries.},

Abstract = {We study how shocking news affects cognitive performance. Identifying
   these effects makes societies more resilient by helping to adjust policy
   responses to reduce indirect costs of future atrocities. Our analysis is
   based on a school shooting that coincided with national matriculation
   exams, allowing a difference-in-differences analysis. We find a
   substantial negative effect on males: their average performance dropped
   by seven percent. The average performance of females was unaffected. Our
   findings suggest that a shocking event may call for psychological
   support for young people even in communities that are not directly
   affected.},

Volume = {23},

Pages = {307-329},
Abstract = {As conduits for ideas, values and geographical knowledge, the mass media
   contribute to the construction of regional order. Moscow-based media
   organisations with audiences in post-Soviet republics have been
   described as soft power tools' or information weapons' which aid the
   Russian state in its pursuit of regional dominance. However, a heavy
   focus on the agency of the Russian state obscures the important role
   that local actors and their motives often play in delivering Russian
   media content to large audiences in neighbouring countries. This article
   examines several major news providers which export content from Russia
   to Belarus and Ukraine, reaching large audiences thanks to partnerships
   that serve particular local interests and accommodate some local
   sensitivities. These news providers resemble mechanisms of neo-Gramscian
   regional hegemony, where actors in the periphery' are involved in
   perpetuating norms from the centre'. The article argues that Russia's
   political leadership, despite promoting consensual hegemony as its
   preferred regional order, has in fact undermined the type of media
   mechanisms that might have helped to sustain such an order. As the
   Russian state has projected narratives without regard for negative local
   reactions, it has made itself more reliant on coercive means to secure
   its declared sphere of interests' across formerly Soviet territory.},

Abstract = {The aim of the present study is to examine the communication strategies
   used by Greek mayors in Twitter across different periods of an electoral
   cycle (pre-campaign, campaign, and post-campaign). Moreover, this study
   tries to delineate the effects of Twitter strategies on users'
   engagement and identify the most effective ones. To that end, a content
   analysis is performed on 32,810 tweets of Greek mayors for a six-year
   period. Moreover, quantitative metrics such as the number of favorites
   and retweets are also obtained for each tweet. Results suggest that
   Greek mayors mainly use Twitter as a press release bulletin board for
   dissemination of information about the main events taking place in
   municipality. Moreover, they also use impression management strategies
   to promote a distinct personal, political and professional image.
   Results also show that during different periods of an electoral cycle
   mayors utilize a different mix of Twitter strategies. Furthermore,
   aggressive (attacking opponents), interactive (direct communication),
   and mobilization (requesting feedback) strategies are found to be the
   most effective in enhancing followers' attitude expression (favorites)
   and advocacy behavior (retweets). The present study provides valuable
   practical implications for social media political marketers as well as
   politicians.},

Abstract = {The experience of a migration crisis (2015 and 2016) on the edge of
   Schengen and EU territory has demonstrated two divergent development
   perspectives. From both the EU and its Member States, there has been
   increasing demand to protect the EU's external borders. This requires
   trust in both national and EU (Frontex) authorities that are supposed to
   be the guardians of national and European security. At the same time,
   however, negative sentiments towards migrants have increased and
   continue to arise from different cultural backgrounds within Member
   States. These diverging perspectives are struggling to develop hand in
   hand with the current and requested role of the Frontex agency. There
   are rising tensions concerning the legality of measures introduced on
   external borders in order to protect the EU territory effectively. There
   is enormous disparity between the requested norms and standards, and EU
   and international law, which mirrors the strong anti-migrant sentiment
   within CEE Member States. This paper analyses the disparity between EU
   and international norms with the measures being introduced on the EU's
   external border with the Western Balkan states. It also aims to analyze
   the medium-term impact of this disparity at a national and EU level from
   the perspective of efficiency, solidarity and legality. The migrant
   influx may be addressed as an example of crisis management in the
   context of how these three principles of EU law are implemented within
   CEE Member States as a part of the (political, geographical and
   cultural) map of Europe.},

Abstract = {This paper explores the potential causal influence of Western television
   programming on crime rates. We exploit a natural experiment involving
   access to West German TV within the German Democratic Republic (GDR) in
   which only geography and topography determined the allocation of
   individuals to treatment and control groups. Focusing on violent and
   property crime (as these domains were most likely to be affected by the
   marked differences in TV content), we find that in the
   post-reunification decade in which TV content was harmonized, regions
   that had access to Western TV broadcasts prior to the reunification
   experienced lower rates of violent crime, sex crime, and theft, but more
   fraud.},

Abstract = {This paper studies the effect of lobby groups on electoral competition
   and equilibrium policy outcomes employing a `money for policy favours'
   model of lobbying. Our results show that when a lobby group seeks to
   influence an electoral outcome, it will make a financial contribution to
   only one political party whose policy is closely aligned to its own
   ideal policy. When misappropriation of campaign funds occurs, political
   parties that divert more funds for personal gain stand on more
   independent platforms and require larger contributions from lobby
   groups. Greater electoral competition could reduce policy distortions
   but this, in turn, sparks more intense lobbying thereby increasing the
   scope of misappropriation of funds. In the case of multiple lobbying,
   political parties either demand different levels of campaign
   contributions or leave them with different levels of satisfaction.},

Abstract = {The fostering of a critically engaged citizenry and robust civil society
   are championed as cornerstones of democratisation and development,
   particularly in partially free or unfree democracies. The role,
   dispositions and practices expected of both citizens and civil society
   organisations are often contested, demonstrating differing approaches
   towards and understandings of public participation in political life and
   the public sphere. This paper explores the social and normative
   construction of civility as a tool of governmentality. Drawing upon
   evidence regarding the role, functioning, and challenges facing civil
   society in efforts to entrench an open public sphere and engaged
   citizenry in two partial democracies, Uganda and Singapore, we reflect
   upon the ways in which such efforts respond to and are shaped by the
   developmental state model, and how discourses of in/civility are
   deployed to constrain more critical interventions and enactments of
   citizenship and civil society. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {On survey data from 1999 to 2001 and 2010 to 2012, we estimate the
   demand for commercial sex among British men. We estimate a zero-inflated
   count model, which takes into account the probability of not
   participating in the sex market and number of times with a prostitute.
   We find that sex education in school has a negative and significant role
   in the demand for paid sex. We also find that men with a typical
   middle-class income are more likely to buy sex. Travelling abroad or
   living in London increases the likelihood of British men buying sex.},

   Relationship Stability?},
Journal = {SOCIAL SCIENCE QUARTERLY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {99},
Number = {5},
Pages = {1599-1613},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Objective Building on previous analysis conducted by Schober (2012), we
   explore how paternal involvement in different childcare and housework
   tasks affects the probability of relationship breakdown between parents.
   Methods We use logistic regression on the U.K. Millennium Cohort Study
   to predict parental relationship breakdown from nine months to seven
   years post-childbirth. Paternal involvement in four childcare and three
   housework tasks during the first year of parenthood, are used as
   explanatory variables. Results The amount of time the father spends
   alone, caring for the baby during the first year of parenthood, is
   associated with the stability of the parental relationship but the
   effect of involvement in other tasks is moderated by ethnicity and the
   mother's employment status. Conclusion These nonlinear relationships
   suggest further research is needed to explore the different associations
   between paternal involvement in childcare and housework and relationship
   breakdown, which are complex and variable according to different
   characteristics.},

Abstract = {This paper demonstrates one way to reconsider pluralism in international
   relations theory through Japan's appropriation of European geopolitics.
   It is argued that the absence of non-Western theory often suggests the
   absence of non-Western subjectivity in world politics. In this debate,
   Japan, the sole non-Western country that abuses geopolitics to become a
   colonial empire, is a conundrum, particularly in terms of the relation
   of power and space. This paper shows how geopolitical theory can be
   differently interpreted by local political practices and its historical
   language, and how such mutations have been overlooked in the wider
   debate by examining conceptual divergence in the theory. Japanese
   geopolitics during the Second World War, called Daitoa Chiseigaku
   (Greater East Asia Geopolitics), envisaged the state as a territory
   without borders, in contrast to common assumptions in Anglophone
   international relations theory that modern Japan followed the European
   imperial order of territorial states. By excavating this story of
   Japanese geopolitics, this paper neither wants to assert another
   Japanese exceptionalism, nor to exhaust the hidden richness of Japanese
   theory to propose an alternative geopolitical discourse. Rather, it
   wants to reconsider the ways in which even state-centric geopolitical
   theory can be diverse in order to better understand the complex
   development of the map of modern states.},

Abstract = {Students wish to increase the probability of being admitted to a
   prestigious school. Job candidates are interested in the probability of
   getting desirable employment. Defendants are concerned about the
   probability of being acquitted. In all such binary settings, the
   probability of the desirable outcome to individuals can be affected by
   their reputations. Applying the classical Condorcet Jury Theorem
   framework in which decision makers are assumed to be non-strategic, we
   focus on how the nature of the applied decision-making rule affects the
   individuals' incentives to invest in improvement of their reputations.
   Our main results establish that, within the family of democratic
   majority voting rules, simple majority rule (a rule of unanimous
   consent) ensures that the marginal productivity of reputation is largest
   (smallest) and that it increases (decreases) with the size of the
   decision-making committee.},

Abstract = {This paper discusses the legal debates of nineteenth-century Greece and
   the attempts to produce a legal framework following the establishment of
   the modern Greek state. These debates had both a practical significance
   since such a framework was essential for the creation of a modern state,
   and an ideological one since the chosen framework would be a statement
   about how the new state perceived itself, its history, and its place in
   Europe. These questions were particularly relevant in the case of civil
   law as Greek legal scholars contemplated whether to accept the use of
   customary law, or to reject it, and if so what laws should replace it.
   In this paper, I examine this debate within the context of European
   legal developments and the process of codification undertaken throughout
   Europe from the late eighteenth to the nineteenth centuries, as well as
   the ideological and practical implications of the debate. I argue that,
   despite the belief that the efforts of Greek legal scholars led to the
   elimination of the use of customary law from the Greek judicial system,
   my research in the archival material of the Appeals Court of Athens
   indicates that customary law was still dominant a generation after the
   establishment of the modern Greek state. I conclude that a
   re-examination of the role and practices of the Greek courts in the
   nineteenth century is much needed as their flexibility thirty years
   after the creation of the Greek state is closer to the legal pluralism
   of the courts of the Ottoman period than to the model advocated by the
   contemporary legal scholars who demanded a `modern' judicial system to
   assist the renaissance of the Greek nation.},

Abstract = {It is difficult to underestimate the importance of cohesion for armed
   groups or organizations specialized and engaged in organized violence.
   This article argues that the recent debate on military cohesion has been
   far too narrow as it focused on Western state militaries during the 20th
   and 21st centuries, and even then only on the microlevel. It is
   necessary to broaden the perspective in order to construct theories that
   encompass even the vast majority of armed groupsthe non-Western,
   nonstate, and nonmodern. This article advocates two ways of doing so:
   the investigation of cases that belong to these three types and
   broadening analysis to two new levels of analysisthe meso-level of armed
   groups and the macro-level, which contains state and society. Cohesion
   is established through harmonizing these three levels, which
   necessitates including them in the analysis in the first place.},

Abstract = {This article analyzes the effects of patronage networks on cohesion in
   the Armed Forces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. It shows that
   while patronage networks provide support to individual military
   personnel, they undermine both peer and commander-subordinate bonding.
   They promote unequal service conditions and statuses and link these to
   extra-unit and extra-military forms of social identification, which are
   further reinforced by soldiers' living and generating revenue among
   civilians. Furthermore, they impair meritocracy and frustrate the extent
   to which commanders live up to their subordinates' expectations. As they
   fuel internal conflicts, often around revenue generation, and foster bad
   service conditions and distrust toward the political and military
   leadership, patronage networks also undermine institutional cohesion.
   The article concludes that cohesion formation in the FARDC follows
   different patterns than in well-institutionalized and well-resourced
   militaries. Given that cohesion impacts combat performance and norm
   enforcement, these findings are relevant for defense reform efforts and
   military cooperation.},

Abstract = {This paper studies the effect of refugee resettlement on human capital
   accumulation. The analysis is performed in a growth model with
   endogenous fertility. I show how refugee resettlement from a more

   indigenous populations in both countries. I also derive conditions for
   the proposed resettlement policy to stimulate human capital accumulation
   and hence economic growth in both economies.},

Abstract = {The aim of this paper(1) is to explain why there is insufficient
   long-term capital investment despite the abundant savings collected by a
   booming financial sector. Special attention is given to understanding
   the role of today's accounting and prudential requirements, to grasping
   their limitations and to underscoring the need for reform to foster
   long-term capital spending in Europe. This paper shows that
   International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) can affect different
   financial intermediaries in different ways, and that current prudential
   rules are likely to prove even more detrimental to long-term investment
   financing.},

Abstract = {We investigate, within a Schumpeterian growth model, how intellectual
   property (IP) law and public sponsorship of research and development
   (R\&D) activities may provide appropriate incentives simultaneously to
   fundamental (or basic) research and to applied R\&D. In order to
   consider and to distinguish between these two types of research, we
   merge the seminal models of Romer {[}1990] and Aghion and Howitt
   {[}1992]: knowledge accumulation stems from a series of inventions
   (horizontal / fundamental knowledge accumulation) and from a succession
   of innovations (vertical / applied knowledge accumulation) building upon
   each of these inventions. Then, we study a decentralized economy in
   which the creative destruction mechanism does not deter investments in
   fundamental research through an IP law design that induces
   profit-division between an inventor and his following innovators. We
   show that providing optimal incentives to fundamental research requires,
   not only a design of IP law that ensures a sufficient positive transfer
   from innovators to inventors, but also public policies in form of
   subsidies supporting both fundamental research and applied R\&D
   activities.},

Title = {Dynamics of exclusion and everyday bordering through Schengen visas},
Journal = {POLITICAL GEOGRAPHY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {66},
Pages = {180-188},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Turkey is the only European Union candidate country whose citizens are
   obliged to obtain a Schengen visa. The difficult visa procedures, often
   seen as unjust and discriminatory, are a longstanding source of
   frustration and humiliation among Turkish citizens, as they reproduce
   both symbolic and physical borders between the EU and Turkey and seem to
   reiterate the `Fortress Europe' thesis. These perceptions of the visa
   process and the consequent feeling of `otherness/non-Europeanness'
   hinder the process of Turkish integration into the EU. Bordering no
   longer occurs merely in the border areas separating two states, but
   rather through a wide range of practices in multiple locations within
   and beyond the state's territory. This complexity has recently been
   augmented by the introduction of intermediary companies. The offices of
   these intermediaries have become an example of bordering sites located
   away from the border area. Moreover, in these offices border work is
   carried out by non-traditional actors: in other words, not by border
   guards or immigration officers of the EU but by Turkish employees.
   Treating those offices as significant nodes where border work is done,
   this paper draws on material collected at visa offices in Ankara to
   understand the multifaceted construction of borders between the EU and
   Turkey. Using a situated intersectional framework, this paper elucidates
   not only perceptions from both sides of the border - Turkish nationals
   applying for visas and Turkish nationals doing border work - but also
   how the differentiated social positionings and purposes of travel shape
   these interactions. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Managing through ad hoc measures: Syrian refugees and the
   politics of waiting in Lebanon},
Journal = {POLITICAL GEOGRAPHY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {66},
Pages = {67-75},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {This paper explores how the ad hoc and uneven implementation and
   enforcement of policies in the context of the Global South particularly
   in situations of large-scale refugee crises creates forms of waiting and
   precarity amongst refugees. This exploration is initiated by questions
   about how states in the Global South manage mass displacements of people
   whilst adhering to the principles of non-refoulement, a customary
   international law forbidding countries from forcibly returning refugees
   to conditions that may endanger their lives. How is this complicated in
   situations where states are not party to the Refugee convention and
   where refugee crises become protracted? How does this then lead to
   immobilizing refugees and compelling them to wait? I focus on the
   practices of the Lebanese state in response to the Syrian refugee crisis
   that has continued on from 2011. Lebanon has changed its regulations and
   decisions towards the large number of Syrians living in the country over
   the course of the crisis whilst adhering to the principle of
   non-refoulement. However, the policies enacted by the government are
   arbitrarily implemented and enforced at different scales of governance
   creating legal anxieties and immobilities for Syrians in the country. I
   draw on the work of critical legal and political geographers to argue
   that the ad hoc nature of the law, creates a fragmented landscape of
   mobility for Syrians, exacerbating conditions of precarity and poverty
   and, importantly, colonizing their futures.},

   definition of plagiarism and known cases. This work investigates what,
   if anything, has changed in regards to how journal editors react to
   suspected plagiarism and if the definition of plagiarism has changed. In
   addition to surveying editors of economics journals, we have surveyed
   many more editors, including political science, sociology, and others,
   to contrast differences that might exist. There is great variation
   within disciplines regarding the appropriate definition of plagiarism or
   punishments but fairly consistent agreement across disciplines.},

Abstract = {While the free expression of ideas is considered essential for
   democratic life, some citizens think that it is important to silence
   those with whom they disagree. In this article, we conceptualize the
   belief in the importance of silencing others as an individual difference
   and define it as people's belief that it is not only legitimate but also
   important and necessary to tell other people to refrain from expressing
   their political views. We propose a scale for measuring this construct,
   and test its validity and psychometric properties in two studies in
   Israel. Study I (n = 485) is a 2-wave study, with Wave I conducted in
   the midst of the Israel-Gaza 2014 conflict and Wave 2 conducted 3 months
   after the war. We established that the scale was reliable, stable, and
   distinct from relevant and related constructs such as political
   intolerance, authoritarianism, and support for government censorship but
   also logically correlated with them. In Study 2 (n = 177), convergent
   validity was demonstrated using a set of responses to online comments to
   a news story. Those scoring high on the scale tended to support writing
   to the editor and requesting the removal of comments with which they
   disagreed. They also favored writing to the authors of these comments
   and making clear to them that their views were unacceptable.},

Abstract = {Through the lens of veterans studies, we know a great deal about the
   fate of those soldiers who have recently returned home following a
   period of deployment in Iraq and Afghanistan, yet counterintuitively we
   know nothing about the plight of the private military contractors who
   worked alongside them. Addressing this blind spot, the article explores
   the socioeconomic trajectories of ``private military veterans{''} from a
   life-course perspective. Specifically, it addresses three questions
   regarding their status in the civilian labor market. What occupations do
   they work in? To what extent do they work in similar occupations to
   public military veterans? To what extent do they work in similar
   occupations to the general population? Focusing on the U.K. case, it
   reveals that private military veterans are significantly overrepresented
   in the ``protective service occupations,{''} where they primarily work
   in the private security industry, and offers a multilayered explanation
   for this distinctive clustering effect.},

Abstract = {There is a lively debate on the relative impacts of Islam, oil wealth,
   and Middle Eastern institutional legacies regarding democratization and
   the spread of liberal values. We examine this issue using religious
   repression. We argue that oil-wealthy rulers use religious monopoly to
   control dissent. Our results show that oil wealth increases religious
   repression above the effects of Muslim dominance and a host of sundry
   controls. The Middle East and North Africa region seems to matter more
   than Islam. Interestingly, the conditional effect of oil and the Middle
   East and North Africa region is positive on religious freedom. The data
   suggest that several Gulf monarchies have more religious freedoms than
   other Muslim dominant states, such as Saudi Arabia and Iran, or even
   Israel and Jordan. The worst religious repression is among oil producers
   in Central Asia. The results are robust to a host of intervening
   factors, different measures of oil wealth, alternative data on religious
   freedom, and estimating method.},

Abstract = {ObjectiveThis article tests how income inequality mediates and moderates
   the relationship between racial diversity and social capital. We posit
   that racial diversity leads to higher levels of income equality, which
   reduces social capital. We also hypothesize that racial diversity has a
   stronger negative effect on social capital in places with high levels of
   income inequality (a compounding effect).
   MethodsDrawing upon data from U.S. counties, we test these models using
   a series of regression models.
   ResultsDiversity and income inequality have negative effects on social
   capital. There is also evidence of both mediating and moderating
   effects. Income inequality partially mediates the negative relationship
   between diversity and social capital. As income inequality increases,
   the negative relationship between diversity and social capital
   decreases. Furthermore, we find that population growth moderates these
   relationships.
   ConclusionThe relationship among social capital, income inequality, and
   diversity is complex. Although the direct effect is negative, there is
   some evidence for key mediating and moderating effects. More conceptual
   and empirical work is needed to assess the relationship between these
   concepts.},

   a critical survey},
Journal = {PUBLIC CHOICE},

Number = {3-4},
Pages = {393-428},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {This critical survey demonstrates for the first time that the underlying
   tenets of the resource curse/blessing are borrowed directly from
   ``staple theory{''}. It also focuses uniquely on appropriability with
   two key issues in mind: (1) state appropriability of assets, and (2) the
   mobility of assets to thwart appropriation. In the previous resource
   curse literature, mobility has been framed using the concept of
   lootability. Appropriability is related to non-lootable assets, such as
   oil, that can be seized by the state or rival private oligarchs. Recent
   resource curse research has addressed appropriability by distinguishing
   between point-source resources and diffuse-source resources. This survey
   demonstrates that this distinction is borrowed from staple theory, and
   that point-source and diffuse-source resources are defined in terms of
   geographical concentration/dispersion rather than institutional
   characteristics. By establishing that political institutions, markets
   and incentives are the most important elements for determining
   appropriability, the resource curse/blessing literature could support a
   general positive theory of the predatory state.},

Abstract = {Australian electoral politics historically have been described as
   stable, with hung parliaments rare and changes of government infrequent.
   However, the 2015 Queensland election, where a government with the
   largest parliamentary majority in Australian history was defeated after
   a single term in office, seriously challenges assumptions of Australian
   electoral stability, and determining the causes behind this result is
   therefore of significant scholarly interest. While many journalistic
   analyses of the 2015 Queensland election argue that the distinctive
   leadership style of Liberal-National Party leader Campbell Newman was
   wholly or principally responsible for the government's defeat, this
   article argues the result emerged from a confluence of factors, with two
   a contentious LNP policy to lease major government-owned assets, and
   Campbell Newman's combative leadership style of relatively equal
   significance as principal determinants.},

Abstract = {Until the beginning of the 20th century, monarchy was the predominant
   constitutional form and is still in place today in many countries.
   However, although a voluminous body of research is concerned with the
   consequences of constitutions for human development and institutional
   quality, research on the consequences of monarchy is almost
   non-existent. This paper explores the effects of monarchy on economic
   institutional quality and provides evidence that monarchies are
   associated with significantly better institutions. Robustness checks
   indicate that this result cannot be explained through alternative
   channels such as monarchies being on average richer or smaller.},

Abstract = {In commemorations of human lives lost in terrorism, European and
   American memorials increasingly appeal to the aesthetics of `nature' to
   symbolise societal regrowth. This article interrogates the ironic and
   ontological registers involved in commemorating human life through
   vegetal symbols, paying particular attention to the World Trade Center
   site in Manhattan. Memorials traditionally conceive of human life as
   distinct from material and living ecologies, rarely commemorating the
   deaths of non-humans. As such, the use of trees and vegetal landscaping
   to represent and memorialise the dead human involves a complex and
   ironic ontological relationship. Post disaster place-making through
   vegetal symbolism equates vegetal and human being, on one level, but it
   also ironically emphasises the fundamental gulf between them. Survivors
   and visitors are confronted with regenerating vegetal life which evokes
   idealised ecological conceptions of networked human and non-human lives.
   But we do not live or die in the same way as a plant, so vegetal
   symbolism simultaneously invokes human alienation from the natural
   world. The aesthetic registers of the survivor trees bring a complex,
   unresolved and ironic reflection on human mortality to memorial
   landscapes. (C) 2018 The Author. Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

Abstract = {Using federalism as a guide, this research explores the conflicted,
   complementary and unique natural gas policy paths of the U.S. federal
   government, Wyoming and Colorado and analyzes how policies facilitate
   and respond to booms. Federal policymaking has consistently focused on
   gas ownership, leasing, interstate dispute resolution and fiscal
   mechanisms to stimulate and manage development. At the state level,
   policies are designed to enable exploration and production while
   protecting fuel mineral rights, minimizing waste and generating revenue.
   During the most recent gas boom, driven in part by technological
   advances like fracking, policies are being tested from local to national
   levels. Colorado demonstrates that states can balance economic benefits
   with environmental and social costs of gas booms, thus providing an
   example for other gas producing states. Whether states serve as stewards
   or laggards is a function of federalism and choice, but the direction of
   federal and state natural gas policy remains a long-term play.},

Abstract = {Recent contributions have used combinatorial algorithms to determine the
   likelihood of particular social choice violations in rank sum scoring.
   Given the broad importance of rank sum scoring (e.g., in non-parametric
   statistical testing, sporting competition, and mathematical
   competition), it is important to establish the level of ambiguity
   generated by this aggregation rule. Combinatorial likelihoods are na <
   ve, however, in that they assume each possible outcome sequence for an
   event to be equally likely. We develop a computational algorithm to
   extend upon previous combinatorial results as to the likelihood of a
   violation of transitivity or independence in rank sum scoring. We use a
   similar computational scoring approach to analyze the
   empirically-observed likelihood of each such violation across fourteen
   NCAA Cross Country Championships. Within the data, rank sum scoring
   fails to specify a robust winning team (i.e., one that also rank sum
   wins against each possible subset of opponents) in 4 of 14 cases.
   Overall, we find that empirical likelihoods of social choice violations
   are consistently (significantly) overestimated by combinatorial
   expectations. In the NCAA data, we find correlated ability (quality)
   levels within team (group) and discuss this as a cause of lower
   empirical likelihoods. Combinatorial analysis proves reliable in
   predicting the order of empirical likelihoods across violation type and
   event setting.},

Abstract = {While many have remarked upon Prime Minister John Howard's use of the
   Anzac legend for political purposes, our understanding of the nature and
   dynamics of such use remains fragmented and underdeveloped. Using the
   area of foreign policy as a case study, this essay approaches Howard's
   Anzac Day and related ceremonial rhetoric as examples of the epideictic
   genre, which presents speakers with a combination of unique rhetorical
   opportunities and strict generic constraints. While often perceived as
   apolitical and inconsequential, the genre embodies a form of
   argumentation that serves not only to increase the intensity of
   adherence to certain values, thus laying the groundwork for later
   deliberative appeals, but also creates a disposition to act at the
   appropriate moment. This paper will argue that Howard's employment of
   Anzac was bounded and defined by the nature and dynamics of the
   epideictic genre, of which Howard proved to be a savvy user.},

Abstract = {ObjectiveThis article examines the impact of disasters on social capital
   in the context of Hurricane Katrina.
   MethodOne hundred eighty-two counties affected by Hurricane Katrina are
   included in the study. Disaster-related data, social capital, and
   community characteristics of these counties three years before and three
   years after the disaster are analyzed using a longitudinal fixed-effect
   model.
   ResultsHurricane Katrina slowed down the growth of social capital, but
   growth gradually recovered following the disaster. After controlling for
   community characteristics, areas that received more federal government
   assistance experienced stronger growth in social capital post-Katrina.
   Additionally, metropolitan areas with a higher percentage of senior
   population, higher ethnic diversity, more per capita housing units, and
   lower population density appear to have had higher levels of social
   capital.
   ConclusionDisasters could hinder the growth of social capital and
   federal disaster assistance could potentially alleviate the negative
   impact.},

Abstract = {A lack of gender parity amongst candidates for public office is of
   perpetual concern to political reformers. One reform that is suggested
   as a partial solution is the full public subsidy of election costs. In
   theory, clean election{''} laws should dramatically lower the perceived
   costs of campaigns to potential candidates outside of traditional
   fundraising networks. If the perceived costs are lowered to a
   significant enough degree, public subsidies could encourage more women
   to run for office. Using panel data of potential candidates from
   Connecticut and Massachusetts, this article finds that the Citizens'
   Election Program may have led to some progress towards that goal.
   However, women's emergence decisions and attitudes concerning
   fundraising are more dependent upon active recruitment by civil society
   organizations and political parties, factors well beyond the reach of
   clean election laws.},

Abstract = {On February 15, 1905, the mass-circulation Petit Parisien reported that
   one Georges Toquet, a colonial administrator, had been charged with
   ``assassination and violence against several natives{''} from the French
   Congo. The following day all the major Parisian papers and several
   provincial ones led with a much larger story of what the Petit Parisien
   was already calling France's ``Scandales Coloniaux{''}. Two colonial
   administrators ``laid their hands on a young black man, whom they bound
   tightly with rope{''}. They then inserted ``a stick of dynamite. in the
   African's anus and blew him up{''}.
   The structure and style of these stories closely resembled the typical
   fait divers, or miscellaneous (crime) story, of the Belle Epoque. Only,
   unlike most mainland faits divers, the Congo story had potentially
   serious political consequences. ``It was the prelude{''}, as the Petit
   Parisien declared, ``to an enormous scandal in the colonial world{''}.
   Sociologists define scandal as an event that implicates important people
   and often members of the government. It involves transgressions, or
   perceived transgressions, against widely accepted moral standards and as
   such could call the reputations of key individuals into question.
   Scandals could change the relations of power in a society, or reaffirm
   existing values and mores. Although the Congo scandal would ultimately
   serve to reinforce prevailing ideas about the merits of colonialism in
   France, government officials could not, at the outset, be confident that
   such would be the case.},

Abstract = {Few studies have examined political content on YouTube, especially in
   comparison to the traditional television spots. Relying on both
   audience- and platform-based theories, we develop expectations of
   differences in content between political ads posted online and aired on
   television. We use content analysis to compare both online political ads
   and televised political ads from the 2012 presidential campaign, relying
   upon data from YouTube and the Wesleyan Media Project. We find that
   negative ads are more likely to be sponsored by groups than candidates
   on both television and YouTube. Online ads are less negative and less
   policy focused. By comparing ads made for TV uploaded to YouTube and
   those only on YouTube, we find that there is no difference in viewership
   between the two types, but online ads are more likely to be shared.},

Abstract = {The end of the 19th century saw a lot of spectacular scandals throughout
   Western Europe. There were revelations of corruption and colonial
   violence, of adultery and homosexuality, and of abuse of power in
   politics and the conduct of members of the elite. By analyzing two dozen
   scandals in Great Britain and Germany, this article asks who initiated
   these scandals and how they were communicated. Furthermore, it discusses
   the consequences of different types of scandals. It reveals that it was
   often not the new popular press but rather politicians who actually
   initiated scandals. Influenced by the popular press, they chose new
   forms of communication that changed political culture. Tabloids were
   less significant in respect to political press than it has been assumed.
   Moreover, this article shows that scandals shaped norms and influenced
   political actions. The scandals were an expression of contemporary
   political culture and were at the same time transforming it.},

Volume = {23},

Pages = {378-403},
Abstract = {In the nineteenth century, as well as during the Cold War, spheres of
   influence were created and legitimized to pursue and sustain order in
   world politics, as well as to avoid direct confrontation between the
   great powers. Nowadays, they are considered as belonging to a past
   characterized by confrontation, power politics, balance of power and
   coercion. Yet, spheres of influence still constitute part of the
   present-day political vocabulary, and several regional dynamics are in
   fact framed and analysed by using this concept. Are spheres of influence
   returning, or have they simply evolved? How do spheres of influence look
   like in contemporary international relations? With a specific focus on
   Russia and Central Asia, this article adopts an English School approach
   to the study of spheres of influence and offers a conceptualization of
   contemporary spheres of influence as structures of negotiated hegemony
   between the influencer' and the influenced' where norms and rules of
   coexistence are debated, contested and compromised on. The implications
   of this are multiple. First, the approach allows for seeing spheres of
   influence as social structures where norms and rules of coexistence are
   in play. Second, it allows for an analysis of the implementation and the
   legitimacy of spheres of influence through history. Third, by stressing
   the evolutionary character of spheres of influence, it puts the notion
   of their return' into question.},

Abstract = {Taking Mina Loy's articulation of femininity in her poem `One O'Clock at
   Night' as a point of departure, I examine a false dichotomy facing
   contemporary feminism: should we identify with or reject the gender
   imposed upon us? In conjunction with a materialist analysis which posits
   women as a class, this paper argues that Loy's discussion of gender
   could provide a useful framework with which to critique the `soft
   abolitionist' approach trending today; a largely online movement which
   assumes that the individual can permanently sever themselves from the
   confines of gender and construct an autonomous political subjectivity
   from this shared (and often openly traumatised) `non-identity'. I
   discuss criticisms by trans theorists of the notion that liberation can
   be located from within gender, and explore ways in which the
   identification-versus-rejection question has been engaged with in
   historical feminisms. This includes Monique Wittig's partial rejection
   of the term `woman, and a strand of 197os radical feminism termed (by
   its critics) `the anti-woman line'. In its conclusion, this paper looks
   to the present - using the feminist-activist group Sisters Uncut as a
   case study. It asks whether a dialectical praxis, looking to the
   conversations around `identity' had within historical feminist
   movements, could inject contemporary feminisms and struggles with a
   politics of solidarity or political subjecthood, cutting through debates
