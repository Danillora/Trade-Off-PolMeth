Abstract = {What accounts for geographic variation in organized criminal violence?
   In Honduras, a country with one of the highest homicide rates in the
   world, the intensity of violence rivals many civil wars. Yet violent
   crime varies across cities and neighborhoods. Armed groups seeking to
   control territory use violence for different purposes, including
   competing against rivals, coercing residents and state officials, and
   exploiting the public for profit. Variations in community organization,
   defined as the density of interpersonal ties and the prevalence of
   shared expectations for collective action, affect the utility of
   violence for each of these purposes. Community organization can raise
   the cost of controlling territory, reduce the benefits of coercive
   violence, and generate pressure to protect residents from exploitation.
   These dynamics are examined through a comparison of nine neighborhoods
   in three of Honduras's most violent cities, drawing from disaggregated
   homicide data and ethnographic research. The comparison shows that
   neighborhoods with denser community organization experienced lower
   levels of violence. Narrative evidence points to specific ways in which
   community organization mediates effects of competition among criminal
   groups and their interaction with state officials. Community
   characteristics thus affect the way non-state armed actors exercise
   authority in areas of limited state presence.},

Title = {Shaking up and making up China: how the party-state compromises and

Abstract = {A growing chorus of observers has warned of threats to regime stability
   in China in recent years. In spite of these concerns, the party-state's
   grip on power in many respects appears as strong today as at any time
   since 1989, making it a remarkable outlier in a shrinking pool of
   long-surviving authoritarian regimes. This article addresses the debate
   over the resilience of the Chinese party-state by suggesting that one
   source of this resilience lies in the regime's distinct functions in
   citizens' experience of ontological security. Ontological security
   refers to a basic need of individuals for a sense of continuity and
   order in events. The main argument is that China's party-state has
   developed a mode of rule that both compromises and creates ontological
   security for its citizens. On one level, the party-state undermines
   individuals' ontological security. The regime has engineered profound
   transformations of Chinese society, producing conditions that compromise
   its subjects' ontological security. At the same time, the party-state
   provides individuals with resources to buttress their ontological
   security. Official discourses function as anchors that assist
   individuals in this pursuit. A survey of research on Chinese politics
   supports these conclusions.},

Abstract = {In the early 1990s, the Russian public held overwhelmingly favorable
   attitudes toward the United States; in recent years, attitudes toward
   the United States have been overwhelmingly unfavorable. Analysts often
   trace this dramatic change to (1) the emergence of Russian-American
   conflicts such as those in former Yugoslavia and (2) Russian leaders'
   attempts to escape blame for their country's failures by attributing
   them to a powerful external enemy. We point to another major factor of
   Russian anti-Americanism that preceded the international conflicts and
   the government-led anti-American propaganda: (3) disillusionment, or an
   emotional and ideological dissatisfaction with the outcome of
   pro-Western reforms that started among the liberal elites and then
   spread among the general public. Using data from the New Russian
   Barometer surveys, we analyze the dynamics of attitudes toward the
   United States from 1993 to 2009. We find that mass disappointment in the
   perestroika outcomes preceded the spread of anti-Americanism in Russia
   and that anti-American sentiment was stronger and occurred earlier among
   the elite than among the mass public. Furthermore, those (especially
   better-educated) people who express disappointment with the outcomes of
   pro-Western reforms prove significantly more anti-American. Our findings
   illustrate a general ideological phenomenon that may explain the growth
   of anti-Americanism in unsuccessful democracies worldwide.},

Abstract = {The literature on policy convergence has identified numerous facets and
   causal drivers of convergence. Distinguishing four dimensions of
   convergence (object, benchmark, drivers and directed process) helps
   clarify why and in what form policy convergence may occur (or not).
   Thus, depending on, for example, the object of analysis (policy outcome
   or instruments used), the same empirical case may give rise to opposing
   assessments. Furthermore, both economic and political drivers are
   necessary to account for successful policy convergence: economic
   convergence partly explains why countries may face similar problems, and
   political mechanisms explain why they might choose similar policies to
   solve a given problem. This article illustrates the multifaceted
   character of convergence for the dynamic field of renewable energy
   policies in the European Union. The empirical results indicate temporary
   convergence in the case of policy support instrument choices and
   conditional convergence in terms of renewable shares. However, the
   results suggest divergence of public R\&D subsidies targeting
   renewables.},

Abstract = {Russia's government has adopted an information-based strategy to promote
   discord and call into question the legitimacy of democratic institutions
   in the USA and Western Europe. Measures adopted include providing
   financial support to extremist groups, conducting cyberattacks, hacking
   information on political parties and government agencies, and promoting
   a socially conservative ideology critiquing Western liberal values. This
   strategy resembles Soviet-era disinformation campaigns, though social
   media and the Internet have magnified the impact of contemporary
   information warfare. The article examines specific measures Russia has
   implemented to put liberal democracy on the defensive, and assesses how
   these actions impact domestic political processes in the USA, by using a
   conceptual framework of democratic erosion and democratic breakdown. The
   article evaluates motivations behind Russian interference in America's
   2016 elections, and the extent to which these efforts weaken liberal
   democracy and advance Russian national interests.},

Abstract = {Many American state governments have made extensive promises to pay for
   employees' health care and other benefits in retirement. Currently
   estimated at over \$1 trillion in unfunded liabilities, these other
   postemployment benefits (OPEB) are creating a major fiscal problem for
   state governments. In this article, we examine the politics of OPEB. We
   seek to explain the variation in the generosity of OPEB across U.S.
   states. We argue that party competition theories do not adequately
   explain the outcomes we observe. Instead, we draw on the emerging
   Schattschneiderian approach to the politics of public policy to show
   that public union strength conditions a party's incentives to represent
   unions' interests. In states where public sector unions are strong,
   unions can find their way into either party's coalition. We find that
   Republicans are more responsive to public union interests than either
   their ideological brand or prior research would suggest. It is only in
   states where public employees are weak that Republicans can act
   unilaterally and enact their preference for less government spending. To
   test our theories, we carry out an empirical analysis using a newly
   assembled data set of per capita OPEB liabilities across 49 states.},

Abstract = {Private-heavy welfare systems, in which low or moderate state benefits
   are topped up by private welfare arrangements, are expected to undermine
   political support for the extension of social rights and perpetuate
   benefit fragmentation over time. And where low state benefits are means
   tested, political support is expected to be particularly prone to
   erosion. In this article I develop the argument that the combination of
   private pensions and means-testing does not always perpetuate
   fragmentation. Rather, it structures the policy preferences of pension
   industry representatives and right-of-centre parties such that these
   actors push for reforms to make the state pension more universal. I make
   my argument by examining the reform history of nine private-heavy
   pension systems in the three decades since 1980. A fuzzy-set qualitative
   comparative analysis maps the conditions under which universalizing
   reforms have occurred, and two case studies link institutional
   conditions to reform outcomes via the policy preferences of key
   political actors.},

Abstract = {The covenant connection thesis forms an important basis from which to
   understand the religious source of federalism. Yet with its
   Judeo-Christian roots, to what extent does it apply to Asian countries
   that have different religious traditions? In this article, we explore
   whether the covenant connection thesis is relevant to Asian federalism
   in the context of Muslim-, Hindu-, and Buddhist-majority countries. We
   find that while the presence or absence of a covenantal tradition within
   a religion can partially explain acceptance of, or resistance to,
   federalism, there are other religious features that also play a role.
   These include the extent to which traditional religious organizations
   are internally centralized, the extent to which religion and state
   governance are intertwined or separate from each other, and the extent
   to which a religion that constitutes the core national identity is
   threatened by other religions that are or may be empowered by federal
   arrangements.},

Abstract = {The category `middle class' was used increasingly throughout the 2010s
   to identify social changes occurring in African countries, including
   Ethiopia. However, the category itself is hard to define and has been
   employed to describe very diverse socio-economic dynamics. This article
   offers an original way of considering the `middle class', focusing on
   what the category is expected to produce for the different actors
   utilizing it. We argue that the debate on `middle class' social
   composition cannot be undertaken before deconstructing and discussing
   why, how and by whom the category is being used. As the notion of the
   middle class is subjectively and locally produced in every country, we
   focus on the perceptions and narrative of the category by external and
   internal actors and the specific political implications of such views in
   the Ethiopian context. By analyzing the international discourses and the
   Ethiopian leadership's views, we demonstrate the fluidity of a notion
   deeply rooted in and interpreted based on specific institutional,
   ideological, and social backgrounds, and at the same time serving
   specific economic and political ambitions. In this regard, the Ethiopian
   case reveals how divergent actors have been promoting that same category
   with great differences in their interpretation and expectations. We thus
   argue that the category `middle class' remains analytically useful only
   if not considered as an objective socio-economic category, but rather as
   a politically constructed category.},

Abstract = {Dutch Latin American studies as a field of academic teaching and
   research emerged in the late 1960s and became consolidated in the 1970s
   and 1980s. It began as a purely academic endeavor, but in a changing
   Dutch and global society in the 1970s it rapidly became connected to and
   influenced by social and political processes in Latin America. The
   strong Christian and social-democratic traditions in the Netherlands
   allowed for strong links between academic researchers and civil society
   organizations. This resulted in the productive coexistence of academic
   and more political objectives and activities and allowed Dutch Latin
   American studies to grow into a dynamic field. A review of this
   experience calls attention to the importance of local conditions for
   understanding the consequences of the Cold War for academic research.
   Los estudios holandeses sobre Latinoamerica emergieron como un campo de
   investigacion y ensenanza academica a finales de la decada de 1960,
   consolidandose durante los setenta y ochenta. Comenzaron como una
   actividad puramente academica, pero en la cambiante sociedad holandesa y
   global de los anos setenta, rapidamente se vincularon a y fueron
   influenciados por los procesos politicos y sociales de America Latina.
   La fuerte tradicion cristiana y social-democratica de Holanda dio lugar
   a poderosos vinculos entre investigadores academicos y organizaciones
   civiles. Esto llevo a la coexistencia de metas y actividades academicas
   al igual que aquellas de indole mas politica, transformando a los
   estudios holandeses sobre Latinoamerica en un campo dinamico. Un vistazo
   a esta experiencia resalta la importancia de las condiciones locales
   para una debida comprension de las consecuencias de la Guerra Fria en la
   investigacion academica.},

Abstract = {Corruption is a persistent problem in developing countries, and recent
   scholarship suggests that middlemen play an important role in corrupt
   acts. Yet, while intermediaries can reduce transaction costs in illicit
   exchange, they also increase agency costs and reduce benefits to others.
   The involvement of middlemen may thus vary. I argue that middlemen are
   most likely to engage in, and benefit from, the subset of corruption
   transactions that are repeated frequently, but not by the same parties.
   I test the implications of this argument using survey experiments
   administered to a large sample of politicians and bureaucrats at
   multiple levels of government in India. I show that middlemen are
   critical, but far from ubiquitous. Intermediaries are more relevant
   where corrupt deals are frequent but involve unfamiliar potential
   principals. My results suggest that anticorruption efforts must pay
   greater attention to the type of corruption and the incentives of
   middlemen.},

Title = {International agreement design and the moderating role of domestic
   bureaucratic quality: The case of freshwater cooperation},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF PEACE RESEARCH},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {55},

Abstract = {Much of international cooperation research has long assumed that
   building and deepening (i.e. institutionalizing) international
   agreements can substitute for weak domestic bureaucratic capacity when
   it comes to promoting cooperative policies between countries. Qualifying
   this assumption, we argue that domestic bureaucracies are a key piece of
   international cooperation: the cooperation-inducing effect of
   international institutions is conditional on the quality of domestic
   bureaucracies. We examine this relationship in the context of the
   politics of interstate cooperation over transboundary rivers, an
   important test case given concerns about looming water conflict in the
   face of increasing water scarcity. Using data on freshwater-related
   events, 1984-2006, on the level of institutionalization of river
   treaties, and on the quality of domestic bureaucracy, we find that
   domestic bureaucracies moderate the ability of international
   institutions to elicit cooperative interstate behavior. The finding is
   robust to a multitude of specifications and provides important
   implications for institutional research and policy approaches to
   cooperation problems beyond freshwater.},

Abstract = {Sometimes, in order to provide themselves better living conditions, the
   residents of a certain municipality may be willing to pay an additional
   fiscal levy besides ordinary taxes. In this paper, the authors deal with
   a self-imposed contribution as a possible resource of local budgets,
   comparing the regulation and concept of such a contribution in Slovenia
   and Serbia. By analysing the characteristics of such a levy in these two
   former Yugoslav states, the authors based their main hypothesis on
   proving that self-imposed contribution is, according to its legal
   nature, also a type of a tax, even if it is introduced under a
   referendum and the funds are earmarked for specific local purposes.},

Abstract = {This article examines the impact that rebel and state leaders have on
   civil war duration. It argues that leaders' incentives to avoid
   punishment at the hands of internal audiences and opponents influence
   their strategic decision-making during war. Specifically, leaders who
   bear responsibility for involvement in the war have a higher expectation
   of punishment should they perform poorly, particularly for rebel and
   high-risk state leaders. As a result, these leaders have incentives to
   gamble for resurrection, extending ongoing wars in the hope of turning
   the tide and avoiding punishment. This suggests that civil wars are less
   likely to end when responsible leaders hold power, especially if the
   responsible leader is highly vulnerable to punishment. These
   propositions are tested using original data on all rebel and state
   leaders involved in civil conflicts between 1980 and 2011. Results
   support the hypothesized relationship between leader responsibility and
   war duration.},

Abstract = {Latin American studies in Germany from the 1960s on developed in two
   waves with (partial) crises and periods of stagnation in between.
   Whereas in the communist GDR they were affected by the limited scope of
   academic endeavors and their instrumentalization for state and party
   politics and policies, in the Federal Republic interdisciplinary Latin
   American studies had two tiers (within the universities and outside as
   independent research institutes) and were shaped by the particular
   structure of funding schemes and agencies and by triggers such as the
   Cuban Revolution, the Chilean coup, the arrival of exiles, and the
   presence of the Latin American revolutionary experience in the debates
   of the West German student movement after 1968. While many of the West
   German features were shared with other Western countries, significant
   differences emerged because of Germany's short colonial tradition, the
   Cold War rivalry between the Federal Republic and the GDR, and the fact
   that political foundations such as the Konrad Adenauer Foundation and
   the Friedrich Ebert Foundation played a key role not only in designing
   and implementing government-financed development aid projects in Latin
   America but also in helping to promote and shape a new takeoff for Latin
   American studies (a uniquely German constellation). A partir de la
   decada de 1960, los estudios alemanes sobre Latinoamerica se
   desarrollaron en dos oleadas, con crisis (parciales) y periodos de
   estancamiento en el proceso. En la RDA comunista, la investigacion se
   vio afectada por el alcance limitado de los esfuerzos academicos y su
   instrumentalizacion para politicas estatales y partidarias. En la
   Republica Federal, los estudios interdisciplinarios latinoamericanos se
   desarrollaron en dos ambitos (universidades ademas de lugares externos
   como institutos de investigacion independientes) y obedeciendo a
   estructuras y agencias de financiamiento particulares, asi como factores
   detonantes (por ejemplo, la Revolucion Cubana, el golpe de estado en
   Chile, la llegada de exiliados y la presencia de la experiencia
   revolucionaria latinoamericana en los debates del movimiento estudiantil
   de Alemania Occidental despues de 1968). Mientras que muchas de las
   caracteristicas de la Republica Federal eran compartidas por otros
   paises occidentales, surgieron diferencias significativas a partir de la
   corta tradicion colonial alemana, la rivalidad entre la Republica
   Federal y la RDA durante la Guerra Fria, y el hecho de que patronatos
   politicos como la Fundacion Konrad Adenauer y la Fundacion Friedrich
   Ebert desempenaron un papel clave no solo en el diseno e implementacion
   de proyectos gubernamentales de ayuda al desarrollo en Latinoamerica,
   sino tambien en promover y encaminar los estudios latinoamericanos (en
   una constelacion exclusivamente alemana).},

Abstract = {What explains business views regarding policy preferences in the
   Eurozone crisis? Although recent literature examines the impact of the
   crisis on citizen views, few studies examine business preferences
   towards adjustment policies. We present unique data from a new
   representative survey of 500 high-level firm representatives from Spain
   to test theories about such preferences, in particular views about the
   euro, fiscal austerity, and wage devaluation, as well as plausible
   mechanisms for such preferences. We test three broad families of
   theories to explain such preferences, focusing on the role of structural
   firm characteristics, economic hardship, and political leanings of firm
   managers. We find that first, there is a strong conservative position
   regarding all of these policies. Second, we find that contra
   conventional approaches to explaining preferences, for the domestic
   policies (but not for euro views), the political leanings of firms
   matter much more than baseline structural characteristics. Third, we
   find that surprisingly economic hardship does not cause firms to demand
   more left-wing policies, as it might for voters; in fact, firms that
   have suffered are likely to be more skeptical of suchmeasures. These
   findings indicate the need to better measure political orientations of
   firm respondents and suggest that this is a larger division among firms
   than previously recognized.},

   Do senior managers perceive less strategic policy autonomy when faced

Abstract = {Through recurrent structural reform programmes governments are on a
   quest to design public organizations that will stand the test of their
   environment. One of the approaches to uncertain or sensitive issues has
   been to create various forms of (semi-)autonomous organizations with
   substantial strategic discretion. However, while governments repeatedly
   experiment with designs, one might simultaneously expect that such
   interference through repeated structural change may limit the degree of
   strategic policy autonomy perceived by senior managers. More
   specifically, we propose that intense structural reforms may
   inadvertently reduce strategic policy autonomy perceptions through two
   mechanisms. First, intense sequences of structural reforms may lead to
   perceptions of relatively controlling political principals. Second, they
   may reduce an organization's ability to accrue resources beneficial to
   autonomy, such as a strong internal culture, network embeddedness and
   expertise. Results indicate that strategic policy autonomy perceptions
   will indeed be detrimentally affected for organizations that experience
   intense sequences of structural reform.},

Abstract = {Recent interventions suggest that the discipline of international
   relations has moved beyond ``grand theories{''} and ``great debates{''}
   toward middle range theorizing and quantitative hypothesis testing. At
   the same time, scholars argue that the field is fragmenting into insular
   camps. I subject these claims to an analysis that borrows from
   scholarship on the sociology of science. I apply network analytical
   methods to dissect the structure of the discipline: its dominant camps,
   the relationship among them, and their relative role in the discipline.
   I identify several citation camps, primarily delineated by theory, but
   also methods and subfields. The realist, liberal institutionalist, and
   constructivist camps continue to occupy a central role in the field. All
   three ``isms{''} are identifiable as separate communities. But they are
   also more closely intertwined and cross-contaminated than the
   fragmentation thesis suggests. At the margins of the isms, connecting
   via constructivism, we find three theoretical camps: post-structuralism,
   English School, and neo-Marxist critical theory. Separate from the
   theoretical region, we find two camps of formal modeling, methods, and
   quantitative studies of inter-and intra-state conflict. The most-cited
   works in the field include both those engaged in grand theorization and
   quantitative hypothesis testing, but it is still the theoretical camps,
   the three isms in particular, that give international relations its
   distinctive sociological structure.},

Abstract = {On May 25, 2016, the government of Ecuador recognized that chronic child
   malnutrition was still a public problem for the country. After 7 years
   of an intervention to eradicate this phenomenon, not only the
   established goal was unfulfilled, but the speed at which chronic child
   malnutrition had been reduced until 2006 have decreased. What failed and
   how did this failure occur? This article seeks to answer these questions
   from the analysis of public policies approach. A qualitative methodology
   is followed and a case study is presented where the analytical technique
   is the pattern matching. The findings show that an interaction of the
   government's legitimation objectives on the design of the public policy
   instruments helped to shape the failure.},

Title = {Assessing Change in World Politics},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL STUDIES REVIEW},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {20},
Number = {2},
Pages = {177-185},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {This introductory paper of the presidential issue examines IR theory's
   problems and prospects in understanding when and how change happens,
   especially peaceful transformations in world politics. The ISA 2017
   Baltimore conference was aimed at taking an assessment of our
   understanding of change, its different manifestations as well as
   implications. The papers in this special issue deal with important
   questions on different markers and manifestations of change in world
   politics. The implications might range from epochal transformations to
   limited changes in the international system, especially within and
   between regions to incremental changes in how international treaties and
   global governance initiatives are promulgated, which in turn produce
   long-term and/or short-term changes in the architecture of world
   politics. It also addresses the following questions: How do different IR
   paradigms address change? What are their strengths and weaknesses? Can
   we understand change sequentially or cumulatively or combining their
   insights? How do material and ideational factors link together in
   generating change?},

Abstract = {Policy advocacy is an increasingly important function for many nonprofit
   organizations, yet their advocacy activities have largely escaped
   theoretical grounding. The literature on nonprofits has described how
   they engage in policy advocacy, without linking them to theories of
   policy change. The policy studies literature, on the other hand, has
   explained how various forms of influence result in policy change, but
   has largely ignored organizational perspectives on those processes.
   These two literatures remain largely disconnected. Drawing upon
   interviews with a purposive sample of policy advocacy directors at 31
   nonprofit organizations, this study applies Q-methodology to identify
   and describe six distinct policy advocacy strategies employed by the
   organizations, and their resonant theoretical views of policy processes.
   These findings suggest strategic approaches for nonprofits seeking to
   influence policy processes. They also enhance the academic literature on
   policy processes by adding the advocates' views and expectations.
   Implications for further research are also identified.},

Abstract = {Public opinion in postconflict societies toward international missions
   is widely believed to be important. We offer a theory that local
   satisfaction critically depends on an individual's perception of whether
   the mission is furthering the wartime political agenda of his or her
   social group. To test this theory and competing hypotheses, we examine
   Kosovo Albanian satisfaction with the United Nations Mission in Kosovo
   (UNMIK). We use data from seventeen different representative surveys
   conducted in Kosovo from 2002 to 2007 as well as focus group and other
   primary and secondary sources. Consistent with our theory, we find that
   aggregate satisfaction over time reflected UNMIK's growing acceptance of
   Kosovo's independence and individuals with more radical views tended to
   be less satisfied with UNMIK. Our analysis implies that missions can
   achieve greater local satisfaction by doing what is possible to be
   responsive to, or at a minimum recognize, the wartime political agendas
   of the key social groups.},

Title = {Repression and refuge: Why only some politically excluded ethnic groups

Abstract = {This article asks why ethnic exclusion from executive-level state power
   leads to armed conflict in some cases but not in others. To resolve this
   puzzle, it focuses on the possible role of five additional,
   qualitatively coded factors that have been considered by either
   grievance or opportunity theories of civil war but for which
   quantitative data are not readily available. To assess the combined
   relevance of these factors, the authors use qualitative comparative
   analysis (QCA) to explore the diverging conflict trajectories of 58 most
   similar' ethnic groups. These groups have a uniformly high conflict
   propensity because they are politically excluded, situated in poor
   countries, live geographically concentrated, and comprise substantial
   parts of the population; yet, only 25 of them actually experienced
   violent conflict. The results show that the resentment created by
   ethno-political exclusion translates into violent conflict if the state
   reacts against initial protests and mobilization with indiscriminate
   violence, and if there is a refuge area either within or outside the
   country that allows regime opponents to organize armed resistance.
   Moreover, a more processual analysis of conflict dynamics reveals that
   the conditions conducive to ethnic rebellion appear in a particular
   temporal sequence with a clear and universal escalation pattern.},

Abstract = {In contrast to recent waves of ad hoc social-media-fueled protest,
   Brazil's leftist social movements consider new media unreliable,
   supplementary, and dominated by hegemonic actors. Owing to a shift in
   power relations online, these virtual spaces pose an approximation to
   their capitalist adversaries, a degree of institutionalization, and a
   breach of traditional trenches of resistance, leading anticapitalist
   movements to restrict their use of new media. Their wariness counters
   resurgent cyberoptimism that regards the Internet as a politically
   neutral or autonomous space favored by marginalized and alternative
   political actors.},

Abstract = {This article explores a much theorized but rarely empirically
   investigated temporal component to the structuring of life chances at
   the apex of the class structure. By following 21 complete birth cohorts,
   I utilize sequence analysis and systematically explore pathways that
   lead to the Norwegian upper class during 10 years of adulthood. Separate
   analyses of each cohort map these trajectories at different stages of
   adult life and cross-cohort similarities are found. The analysis reveals
   that durable access is differentiated from long-range vertical mobility
   and a stepping stone function of middle-class attachment. Trajectories
   are also shown to be highly capital specific, thereby indicating that
   capital conversion within social space rarely traverses horizontal
   divisions. I argue that elite research and class analysis would benefit
   from approaching questions of processes of group formation in a manner
   that entails a systematic account of temporality while acknowledging the
   class structure in a multidimensional way.},

Abstract = {Linked to the image of a wild and still-to-be-explored territory, as
   well as to images of the region as one of new economic opportunities,
   discourses on the Arctic also tie in with issues of climate change,
   cooperation and conflict, Arctic governance, international law and the
   situation and rights of indigenous people, as well as Great Power
   politics. Taken together, these aspects characterize a region whose
   formation is different from regionalization processes in other parts of
   the world. As the regional peculiarity of the Arctic is reflected by a
   variety and plurality of representations, discourses, perceptions and
   imaginaries, it can usefully be analyzed as a region of unfolding
   governmentality. The present article argues that the prospects for the
   Arctic are strongly intertwined with perceptions and depictions of it as
   an international region subject to emerging practices of
   governmentality. By drawing on both Foucault's texts and governmentality
   studies in international relations (IR), we discuss how the Arctic is
   affected by governmental security rationalities, by specific logics of
   political economy and order-building, as well as becoming a subject for
   biopolitical rationalizations and imaginaries. The discourses and
   practices of governmentality that permeate the Arctic contribute to its
   spatial, figurative and political reframing and are aimed at making it a
   governable region that can be addressed by, and accessible for, ordering
   rationalities and measures.},

Volume = {62},

Abstract = {This article considers how domestic protests influence coups. Protests
   signal regime illegitimacy, which incentivizes coups and provides a
   favorable climate for postcoup reforms. Protests also ease coordination
   obstacles among coup plotters and make international actors less likely
   to punish coup leaders. We expect these signaling processes to be
   strongest when protests take place near the capital or are nonviolent.
   Our empirical analyses introduce event-level protest data from the
   Social, Political, and Economic Event Database project into the coup
   literature. Examining a global sample of coup attempts from 1951 to
   2005, we find strong support for our theoretical expectations. Our
   discussion provides implications for scholars studying coups and
   nonviolent movements more generally. It also speaks to the influence of
   external actors on social uprisings and highlights the importance of
   geographical disaggregation in the study of dissident behavior.},

Abstract = {This article focusses on the concept of decision and its significance
   for identity politics. Constructivist scholarship established long ago
   that identity and foreign policy are mutually constitutive and that
   difference and othering are key for the production of identities. As a
   consequence, constructivist literature on EU foreign policy has focussed
   on the role of specific others and explored how interaction with them
   shapes the EU's identity. Our article turns the attention back inside
   and looks at the hegemonic struggles around the purpose and meaning of
   the European project. By analyzing the EU's reaction to the Libyan
   events in 2011, we demonstrate how a major international crisis
   dislocates the identities involved and unleashes a struggle for hegemony
   between conflicting discursive articulations. Eventually this conflict
   is resolved through a political decision, which reconfigures the entire
   `global' outlook on Europe and its role in the world. By defining
   decision along poststructuralist lines, as distinct from the
   conventional literature on decision-making, we demonstrate that the use
   of this conceptual prism helps deepen our understanding of how othering
   and bordering work to produce and reshape identities. By doing that, we
   seek to contribute to a better understanding of how identities change in
   time.},

Title = {Multicultural public administration: Effects of language diversity and
   dissimilarity on public employees' attachment to employment},
Journal = {PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {96},
Number = {1},
Pages = {84-103},

Abstract = {A major part of research in public administration focuses on the impact
   of ethnic diversity on outcomes such as performance and turnover, and on
   the management of diversity with regard to different employee groups.
   Recent research, however, shows the relevance of relational demography
   in the context of employee inclusion in public organizations. So far,
   most studies have been based on ethnic differences in countries that can
   be described as mononational and monolinguistic. The current study
   advances this stream of research by investigating how diversity and
   dissimilarity measures affect public employees' attachment to employment
   in a multicultural public administration in Switzerland. Evidence from a
   hierarchical multilevel analysis revealed that language diversity and
   the support for diversity from supervisors affected individuals'
   attachment. However, our findings on individuals' language dissimilarity
   related to the inclusion of minorities did not support the assumed
   crowding-out effect between diversity and dissimilarity. Implications
   and avenues for future research are discussed.},

Abstract = {This paper explores the implementation and experience of refugee
   resettlement in Brazil and Chile by focusing on the main limits and
   opportunities of regional solidarity', the principle on which the
   programme is based. By analysing how the notion of solidarity is
   understood in the context of resettlement in Latin America, I review the
   programme at two levels. First, at the regional level, I focus on the
   programmes in both Brazil and Chile, to assess resettlement as an
   instrument of international cooperation and responsibility sharing. At
   the local level, I look at refugees' residency status and access to
   rights. I focus here on the resettlement of Colombian and Palestinian
   refugees in both countries. Exploring resettlement through the lens of
   solidarity, allows us to understand the nuances and multiple dimensions
   of resettlement. This is timely, as countries of the Southern Cone of
   Latin America are identified as emerging resettlement countries' and
   expected to increase their resettlement intake. The findings discussed
   in this paper show that resettlement should aim for a complementary
   understanding of solidarity in order to improve the quality of the
   programme, as well as expanding its scope and capacity.},

Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Recent theoretical re-conceptualisations of political representation and
   contemporary empirical analyses of parliamentary representation have
   largely neglected the representation of parliaments as institutions. As
   a consequence, relatively little attention has been focused upon what is
   being communicated to citizens about parliaments and upon the nature of
   the parliamentary institutions that citizens are expected to engage
   with. This is the neglected institutional dimension of parliamentary
   representation. Using official documents and interview data from 39 key
   actors in the Scottish, Westminster and European parliaments, we analyse
   who act as claim-makers' on behalf of parliaments, the nature of these
   claims in different political contexts, and the symbolic intent' and
   claims associated with the architectural design of parliamentary
   buildings. We identify a basic paradox of institutional representation
   in that those who speak for' (most loudly and most persistently) and act
   for' parliaments as institutions are not primarily elected
   representatives but rather non-elected officials.},

Abstract = {International capacity cooperation () exports China's Keynesian project
   system, offshoring its excess industrial capacity as fixed-capital
   investment. Leveraged against foreign exchange reserves, the central
   policy banks and sovereign wealth funds push credit through a variety of
   purpose-built infrastructure investment funds to provincial governments,
   state-owned enterprises and ultimately to offshore projects. This paper
   explores the historical institutional development of funds used to
   channel central government funds through China's financial bureaucracy
   into target countries. We explore the export of the policy bank model,
   provincial implementation and recipient regional industrial policy, and
   examine the role of international capacity cooperation in China's
   international trade and investment strategy and its implications for
   China's domestic industrial policy. We conclude with post-Keynesian
   analyses of China's export of industrial overcapacity while maintaining
   a closed financial model which is likely to introduce excessive risk to
   the global capital pool.},

Abstract = {Torture can be opposed on the basis of pragmatic (e.g., torture does not
   work) or moral arguments (e.g., torture violates human rights). Three
   studies investigated how these arguments affect U.S. citizens' attitudes
   toward U.S.-committed torture. In Study 1, participants expressed
   stronger demands for redressing the injustice of torture when presented
   with moral rather than pragmatic or no arguments against torture. Study
   2 replicated this finding with an extended justice measure and also
   showed the moderating role of ingroup glorification and attachment.
   Moral arguments increased justice demands among those who typically
   react most defensively to ingroup-committed wrongdoings: the highly
   attached and glorifying. Study 3 showed that the effect of moral
   arguments against torture on justice demands and support for torture
   among high glorifiers is mediated by moral outrage and empathy but not
   guilt.},

Abstract = {The theory of social construction and policy design is insightful for
   exploring the circumstances in which the allocation of policy benefits
   and burdens is attributed to the feed-forward effect of degenerative
   policy that institutionalizes bias and reinforces the prevailing
   categorization and embedded social meaning regarding target populations.
   However, this theoretical framework has not been broadly adopted to
   analyze the environment-related phenomena. With a nationwide,
   block-group-level sample, this study examines the extent to which
   degenerative policies pertaining to immigrants influence state agencies'
   environmental regulatory outputs for predominantly Latino communities.
   Results show that in the states with moderately to most restrictive
   immigrant policy and high levels of Latino representation in
   legislatures, the rigorousness of government agencies' compliance
   monitoring activities decreases for Latino neighborhoods of
   environmental justice concern, as states' policy stance toward
   immigrants becomes more unfavorable. More Latino elected officials do
   not bolster policy implementation efforts for the vulnerable communities
   or offset the backlash effect of immigrant policy.},

Abstract = {Britain's parliament has historically lacked formal war powers. Since
   2003, however, MPs have voted five times on military action, including
   famously vetoing intervention in Syria in 2013. A new convention
   developed thatregardless of the legal positiongovernments should permit
   the House of Commons the opportunity to veto certain military
   deployments. This article explores what we now knowand what we do
   notabout the British War Powers Convention. It identifies apparent
   exceptions, including non-combat, Special Forces and drone operations.
   It highlights areas lacking clarity: for example, who decides what
   constitutes an emergency'? It argues that most governments probably will
   allow the House of Commons to have its say before using force abroad,
   that a government politically able to bypass MPs without punishment need
   not fear involving them, while one unable to win support will be
   punished for avoiding a vote. Finally, the article considers the
   implications, both positive and negative, of parliamentary war powers
   for Britain.},

Abstract = {This study investigates the implementation of U.S. environmental
   protection laws under American Indian tribal governance. The landmark
   laws of the 1970s that form the core of America's environmental policy
   regime made no mention of American Indian tribal lands, and the
   subsequent research literature on environmental policy has given them
   little attention. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has primary
   implementation responsibility for environmental protection laws on
   tribal lands, which offers a unique opportunity to study direct federal
   implementation apart from typical joint state-federal implementation.
   Further, because Indian reservations are homes to a disproportionately
   poor, historically subjugated racial group, analysis of environmental
   programs on tribal lands offers a unique perspective on environmental
   justice. We analyze enforcement of and compliance with the Clean Water
   Act (CWA) and Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA) to compare the
   implementation of environmental policy on tribal lands with nontribal
   facilities. Analysis reveals that, compared with nontribal facilities,
   tribal facilities experience less rigorous CWA and SDWA enforcement and
   are more likely to violate these laws.},

Abstract = {The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) were designed to build on the
   success of the fifteen-year experimentation with Millennium Development
   Goals (MDGs). The focus of these development goals has been on
   Earth-based sustainable development-tackling issues that deal with
   sustainability only on Earth. However, in the post-2030s at the end of
   the present SDGs, it is envisaged that humans would have moved far
   beyond low Earth orbit. By then it is expected that public and private
   space entities would have extended human presence further into the solar
   system, possibly on the Moon, near Earth asteroids and Mars for
   exploration and exploitation of resources with the prospect of making
   humans a multi-planetary species. When this happens the goals contained
   in the present SDGs would no longer be adequate and would require some
   levels of adjustment to accommodate these developments. This document
   discusses the implication of the post-2030 Earth and extra-terrestrial
   regimes as well as the role of sustainability at the end of the present
   SDGs, it also highlights areas where these changes could be effected.},

   a French agency},
Journal = {CRITICAL POLICY STUDIES},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {12},
Number = {3},
Pages = {314-334},
Abstract = {As in many countries, in France, drug authorization is supposedly
   carried out by `independent' agencies using `evidence-based medicine'.
   French Health Ministers, however, have recently destabilized this system
   by intervening directly to remove specific drugs from the market.
   Drawing upon a study of one such decision concerning antidiabetics, this
   article refutes an explanation of ministerial intervention in terms of
   the `heroic action' of politicians. Instead, drawing on concepts from
   sociology and policy analysis, a generalizable analytical framework is
   proposed to capture deep shifts in power relations between
   representatives of four `fields' (medical science, administration, party
   politics and journalism) which underlie ministerial intervention of this
   type. Specifically, the claim tested is that power struggles within and
   between those fields strongly structure actor behavior, but also create
   contingency. Indeed, in the case studied, these struggles coincided in
   such a way as to prompt and legitimate ministerial coercion. Rather than
   perpetuate the illusion of agency independence, social science should
   therefore shed light upon the intra and inter-field frictions which
   inevitably occur around the authorization of drugs.},

Title = {Deterrence or taboo? Explaining the non-use of nuclear weapons during
   the Indo-Pakistani post-tests nuclear crises},
Journal = {CONTEMPORARY SECURITY POLICY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {39},
Number = {3, SI},
Pages = {441-463},
Abstract = {The literature on the India-Pakistan nuclear conundrum has neglected the
   impact of the international normative environment on India and
   Pakistan's nuclear behavior. This article fills that gap, by looking at
   the impact of the nuclear taboo on Indo-Pakistani strategic interactions
   during the 1999 Kargil war and the 2002 border standoff. The nuclear
   taboo, rather than nuclear deterrence, explains the non-use of nuclear
   weapons. During both crises the nuclear taboo entered the
   decision-making process instrumentally, in the form of perceived
   reputational ``costs.{''} The Indian and Pakistani emerging nuclear
   doctrines endanger a fragile nuclear taboo that would be strengthened by
   a bilateral non-first use accord. Whether India and Pakistan can move
   from an instrumental to a substantive acceptance of the nuclear taboo
   will depend on whether the United States and the other nuclear weapon
   states, included in the Nonproliferation Treaty, play the role of norm
   entrepreneurs and strengthen the nuclear taboo at the global level.},

Abstract = {In 1984, full diplomatic relations between the Vatican and the United
   States were re-established. Macintosh's ``1984{''} commercial, directed
   by Ridley Scott, was aired. Amid growing Congressional dissatisfaction
   with American military presence in Lebanon in the wake of attacks on US
   military barracks, President Reagan ordered the US Marines to withdraw
   from Lebanon. Miners in the United Kingdom began a year-long strike.
   President Reagan announced his support for an international chemical
   weapons ban. Operation Meghdoot was begun by India, leading to the
   Siachen Conflict between India and Pakistan over part of the Kashmir
   region. In response to the US boycott of the 1980 Olympics in Moscow,
   the Soviet Union refused to participate in the Summer Olympics in Los
   Angeles. Bruce Springsteen released his album Born in the USA. Burkina
   Faso became the new name of the republic known as Upper Volta. During a
   radio sound check, President Reagan joked about having signed a law that
   would ``outlaw Russia,{''} concluding, `` We begin bombing in five
   minutes.{''} P. W. Botha took office as State President of South Africa.
   Two of Indira Gandhi's Sikh bodyguards assassinated her; her son Rajiv
   took her place.},

Abstract = {Proscription of individuals and groups potentially linked to terrorism
   in the form of targeted sanctions have become increasingly controversial
   in recent years, especially in Europe. Initially considered the less
   violent alternative when countering terrorism, individual proscriptions
   have become contested for their impact on due process rights and
   democratic space. This paper focuses on a key aspect of proscription
   measures that goes relatively unnoticed: its discourses and practices of
   time and temporality. It analyses in some depth the rationalities of
   time evoked, debated, accepted, and rejected in two court cases on
   individual sanctions. It focuses on two elements at work in these cases:
   first, the relation between the precautionary and the punitive; second,
   the politics of establishing and examining terrorist intention. In this
   manner, it contributes to broader literatures on proscription in two
   ways. First, it advances the debate on security temporalities in general
   and the discussion of future-oriented sanctions in particular, by
   focusing on recent cases and case-law. Second, the paper brings a focus
   on legal practice to proscription debates. The paper concludes that the
   juridical repertoire of establishing and assessing intentions is not
   just broadened but fundamentally altered in the current proscription
   regime.},

Pages = {503-518},
Abstract = {This article deals with the effectiveness of power-sharing arrangements
   and how they influence the identity building process in the particular
   case of Kosovo Serbs. Based on original data collected during a
   nine-month fieldwork conducted by the author in Kosovo Serbs villages,
   this paper aims to present local dynamics of everyday resistance to
   power-sharing arrangements and their implications. I argue that ordinary
   people's everyday resistance to power-sharing provisions engenders a
   marginalization process, which contributes to the emergence of multiple
   Serbian identities within the Kosovo entity.},

Title = {Emergent publics of alcohol and other drug policymaking},
Journal = {CRITICAL POLICY STUDIES},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {12},
Number = {1},
Pages = {61-81},
Abstract = {Alcohol and other drug (AOD) policy is developed within complex networks
   of social, economic, and political forces. One of the key ideas
   informing this development is that of the `public' of AOD problems and
   policy solutions. To date, however, little scholarly attention has been
   paid to notions of the public in AOD policy making. Precisely how are
   publics articulated by those tasked with policy development and
   implementation? In this article, we explore this question in detail. We
   analyze 60 qualitative interviews with Australian and Canadian AOD
   policymakers and service Providers' arguing that publics figure in these
   interviews as Preexisting groups that must be managed - contained or
   educated to allow policy to proceed. Drawing on Michael Warner's work,
   we argue that publics should be understood instead as made in policy
   processes rather than as preceding them, and we conclude by refraining
   publics as emergent collectivities of interest. In closing, we briefly
   scrutinize the widely accepted model of good policy development, that of
   `consultation,' arguing that, if publics are to be understood as
   emergent, and therefore policy's opportunities as more open than is
   often suggested, a different figure - here that of `conference' is
   tentatively suggested - may be required.},

Abstract = {In what ways has the expansion of the Internet transformed local
   governance in China? Through analysis of over 2000 leaked official
   emails from a district-level Internet propaganda office, the article
   finds that the Internet has served more as a tool to enhance control
   rather than to improve governance at the local level. In particular,
   local authorities have prioritized Internet commentating tasks assigned
   from upper levels while keeping a close watch on negative publicity of
   both national and local problems. Their occasional responses to online
   complaints are often more likely meant to satisfy superiors and pacify
   the public rather than to address citizens' concerns. Such a ``ruling by
   the Internet{''} strategy may bring short-term gains such as preserving
   social stability on the surface, but may harm the regime in the long run
   with accumulated social dissatisfaction.},

Abstract = {This article investigates whether migration policies in Organization for
   Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries have become more
   liberal or restrictive over the last decades and whether or not these
   policies have converged, especially among European Union (EU) countries.
   Owing to a lack of data, the few existing studies in this field have
   mostly focused on policy outcome data. Various and sometimes
   contradicting statements have therefore largely remained untested. This
   article analyses data from the Immigration Policies in Comparison
   (IMPIC) project that includes measures for different policy fields
   between 1980 and 2010 in all OECD states. We find that the conditions
   and criteria for entering and staying in a country have become more
   liberal. At the same time, however, we observe that more restrictive
   control mechanisms have been put in place. We also find that there is a
   general convergence trend in the migration policy field that varies in
   intensity, however, across policy fields. We only partially observe any
   Europeanization effects.},

Title = {Neighbourhood Effects on Jihadist Radicalisation in Germany? Some
   Case-Based Remarks},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONFLICT AND VIOLENCE},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {12},
Abstract = {About twenty young people travelled from a small German former mining
   settlement named Dinslaken-Lohberg to become fighters with al-Nusra and
   ISIS. They drew particular attention, with media reports about
   ``members{''} of what they termed the ``Lohberg Brigade{''} killed in
   the fighting, or in air strikes by the anti-ISIS coalition, or in
   spectacular suicide attacks claiming many victims. Drawing on that case,
   the article explores how neighborhood can effect the emergence and
   persistence of radicalisation to jihadi neo-Salafism. The author
   presents a series of local elements that interfere with one another to
   strengthen each others persistence and effects and thus promote the
   emergence and persistence of the radicalisation phenomenon at hand.The
   interference of elements is not an automatic but a social process,
   enacted by neighbors telling stories of conspiracy, of discrimination
   and recounting experiences of spirituality, heroism, masculinity, and
   femaleness. It is performed by neighbors setting, crossing and avoiding
   symbolic boundaries. And finally it is played by neighbors simply
   following their routines. The author shows how explaining space-related
   radicalisation processes means more than adding up spatial factors. His
   approach rejects the idea of isolating a single social fact - such as
   local structures, events, processes or social actors that existed,
   occurred or acted prior to the emergence of radicals in their
   neighbourhood - as definite cause for radicalisation.},

Abstract = {This chapter responds to the invitation of the editors to reflect on the
   contributions to the volume, as well as to present some of our own
   findings on some of the questions addressed by the book and to give an
   account of our thoughts on a future research agenda. Following the
   thematic structure of the book, the chapter looks at the positioning of
   the Commission relative to other EU institutions, changes in the
   Commission's internal organization, and the Commission's role and
   influence in policy making. The findings reveal a variety of experience,
   but generally contest the view that the Commission is in decline. The
   chapter then considers the broader research agenda, focusing in
   particular on questions relating to the Commission workforce, including
   the educational and professional backgrounds of staff, and their
   attitudes, beliefs and values. In so doing, it challenges a number of
   accepted wisdoms about the people who work for the organization. The
   conclusion suggests avenues for future enquiry related mainly to the
   Juncker Commission. It also warns that neither the Commission nor the EU
   is yet out of the woods.},

Abstract = {The discovery that Iraq had no weapons of mass destruction (WMD) in 2003
   raised the question of why Saddam had prevented UN weapons inspectors
   from fully accounting for his disarmament. The leading explanation for
   Saddam's behavior is that he valued ambiguity as part of a strategy of
   deterrence by doubt'. This article argues that Iraq's obstruction of
   inspectors in the late 1990s was motivated by his desire to shield
   Iraq's regime security apparatus from UNSCOM's intrusive
   counter-concealment inspections. The failure to understand how strongly
   Saddam's concerns about his personal safety drove Iraq's contentious
   relationship with UNSCOM set the stage for the invasion of Iraq in 2003.},

Abstract = {Populist parties have been gaining ground in European political systems.
   Against this backcloth, Portugal stands out as the only Southern
   European country in which traditional mainstream parties have not faced
   a sharp rise in populist challengers. This article relies on content
   analysis of election manifestos to examine the use of populist claims by
   the main Portuguese parties before and after the crisis (1995-2015). Our
   findings reveal that populist rhetoric has been used mainly by left-wing
   radical parties as a wedge to disrupt a decade-old status quo. Moreover,
   we did not find a significant increase in the frequency of populist
   rhetorical elements after the crisis, either in mainstream or challenger
   parties. Overall, in the Portuguese case, ideology is the most important
   factor that explains the adoption of a populist discourse.},

Abstract = {The relationship between art, law, and politics reached its zenith in
   the 1930s. This essay takes as its point of departure Walter Benjamin's
   celebrated essay on the subject, and draws it into a dialogue with two
   key events that occurred at the same time and that shed new light on
   Benjamin's work. This intersection has not previously been explored. A
   year before Benjamin's essay was published, the Mexican mural movement
   was already wracked by a debate that prefigures his central themes and
   concerns. A year after Benjamin's essay, the Paris World's Fair
   perfectly exemplifies his thesis and his prognosis. Yet both these
   episodes invite us to reconsider Benjamin's too-reductive contrast
   between `fascism' and `communism.' Instead, the interplay between 1935,
   1936, and 1937 reflects a much more universal shift in the dynamic
   between aesthetics, nation, politics and law. In particular, the real
   distinction lies in how the work of art relates to the `here and now',
   to time and place. Reading these three events together illuminates the
   importance of different modes of temporal and spatial instantiation if
   we are to resist an `aestheticizing politics,' by `politicizing art'.},

Abstract = {The European Union's approach to civil-military cooperation (CIMIC) in
   crisis response incorporates two different perspectives. The EU's
   official concept is shaped after NATO's military-centred vision and is
   subordinated to the achievement of military goals. However, the
   application of CIMIC in EU-led crisis response resembles the UN
   civilian-centred approach, aiming at supporting civilian environment and
   protection of humanitarian space. This article discusses this complex
   nature of the EU's approach to CIMIC in the context of the Union's
   strategic culture.},

   Cures Act, and Laboratory-Developed Tests},
Journal = {REVIEW OF POLICY RESEARCH},

Abstract = {In 2014, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) proposed taking a
   more active role in the regulation of laboratory-developed tests (LDTs).
   Meanwhile, the U.S. House of Representatives embarked upon the 21st
   Century Cures initiative to develop legislation to expedite the
   development of new biotechnology innovations. During that initiative and
   in the public comments responding to the draft guidance, there was
   significant disagreement as to whether the increased FDA regulation of
   LDTs was beneficial or detrimental to biotechnology. Both the FDA
   guidance document and the 21st Century Cures Act came about due to the
   opening of a window of opportunity created by the convergence of
   circumstances. The question is whether the windows of opportunity are
   competing and how to resolve this competition. This study will
   investigate these questions through a qualitative case study. It will
   also provide recommendations for resolving policy disputes involving
   wicked problems like biotechnology policy.},

Pages = {438-460},
Abstract = {Does a great power need to formulate a long-term Grand Strategy to guide
   its foreign policy actions? While some scholars continue to debate the
   competing merits of various grand strategies, a growing literature now
   emphasizes emergent learning and improvisation as the keys to success,
   as opposed to implementing a long-term design. In this article, I
   explore these scholarly arguments by framing the debate as one between
   two schools of thought, Grand Strategy and Emergent Strategy. After
   presenting the main arguments and the historical examples associated
   with each school, I evaluate the two approaches across four categories:
   the type of international security environment each of them is most
   suited for, the way each approach deals with short-term vs. long-term
   priorities, the domestic political conditions needed for each approach
   to be successful, and the type of presidential management qualities each
   school demands. Lastly, I discuss the implications of these arguments
   for the scholarship and the practice of foreign policy and national
   security strategy.},

Abstract = {The European Union has gone through major crises of its two flagship
   integration projects of the 1990s: the euro and Schengen. Both crises
   had structurally similar causes and beginnings: exogenous shocks exposed
   the functional shortcomings of both integration projects and produced
   sharp distributional conflict among governments, as well as an
   unprecedented politicization of European integration in member state
   societies. Yet they have resulted in significantly different outcomes:
   whereas the euro crisis has brought about a major deepening of
   integration, the Schengen crisis has not. I put forward a
   neofunctionalist explanation of these different outcomes, which
   emphasizes variation in transnational interdependence and supranational
   capacity across the two policy areas.},

   from the Taiwanese Legislature},
Journal = {ETHNOPOLITICS},

Volume = {17},

Pages = {461-484},
Abstract = {The Republic of China on Taiwan has long reserved legislative seats for
   its indigenous minorities, known collectively as yuanzhumin, providing
   an important avenue of influence in national politics for these
   historically marginalized peoples. In practice, however, these
   legislators have struggled to provide effective pan-indigenous
   representation. A key reason is that they are chosen via the
   personalistic single non-transferable vote electoral system, under which
   parties making pan-indigenous appeals have repeatedly failed to win any
   seats. Cooperation among indigenous legislators has been consistently
   hampered by socioeconomic, factional, tribal, constituency, and
   especially partisan divisions. At a few critical moments, yuanzhumin
   representatives have managed to overcome these divisions and use their
   collective bargaining power to win important changes to state policies.
   Nevertheless, the legislative achievements of the indigenous
   representatives as a whole have been relatively modest. The Taiwan case
   thus provides a cautionary tale for indigenous and other minority group
   representation: the mere creation of reserved seats, however
   well-intentioned, is not enough to ensure that collective group
   interests are well-articulated in representative institutions.},

Abstract = {This paper seeks to resolve one of the key tensions in the literature on
   populism: whether populism is a threat to democracy or the best means of
   renewing and deepening democracy. The author argues that, rather than
   defining populism in terms of certain definite outcomes, we should view
   populism as a symptom of crisis, and one capable of producing a variety
   of possible effects, some positive and some negative. The argument is
   pursued in terms of highlighting certain shortcomings in terms of the
   dominant approaches to the issue, and also through exploring recent
   Spanish politics, which has seen an increase in various kinds of
   populist parties and movements. The renewal of democracy in Spain is
   offered as an example of how populist initiatives can have beneficial
   outcomes, as well as detrimental ones.},

Abstract = {In the wake of the July 2016 putsch and the subsequent purge of
   followers of the outlawed Turkish cleric Fethullah Gulen in every sphere
   of Turkish life under the ruling AKP government's state of emergency,
   the Gulen movement (GM) is in disarray and crisis. A fruitful way to
   bring some analytical order to this issue is through the frame of
   diaspora, which we contend provides some useful analytical purchase on
   understanding the movement historically and in transition. The GM as it
   stood prior to 2016 is, we contend, best conceived as a transnational
   parapolitical network-a `diaspora by design'-dedicated principally to
   the service, not of humanity, but of power. Based on interviews with
   over 70 key members of the movement conducted between 2012 and 2018, we
   show how, from the late 1990s Gulen and his supporters crafted a complex
   transnational structure that has combined extensive financial operations
   with a distinctive organizational morphology. We map out the contours of
   this structure and show how it emerged over time via instrumentalization
   of Gulen's parapolitical ideology and the steady accretion of
   politically directed, corporate projects outside Turkey. Finally,
   drawing again on the notion of diaspora, we offer a framework for
   thinking about how the movement may evolve in future as it transitions
   to a fragmented community in transnational in political exile.},

Abstract = {The role of resources in war has been much debated. What happens when
   foreign patrons provide lavish amounts of cash to rebels, without
   mechanisms of accountability? This article analyzes three major sources
   of funding and their micro-level effects on insurgent-groups in the
   Syrian civil war. Recipients of funding demonstrated opportunism in
   actions, alliances, and ideologies, directly related to the funding
   source. Funders thus set the agenda of the war, promoting Islamist
   ideologies and regional over local issues. Private donors rivaled state
   sponsors, in what may be a harbinger of future globalization trends.},

Abstract = {A recent study commissioned by the United States Agency for
   International Development to assess the effectiveness of its spending on
   democracy in its programs worldwide found that such aid works-with the
   sole exception of programs in the Middle East. What explains this
   exception? I argue that previous studies on democracy aid pay
   insufficient attention to the fact that such programs often develop as
   negotiated deals. Because authoritarian regimes may choose how to accept
   assistance, democracy aid may reward economic interests tied to
   incumbent regimes. I explore these dynamics through case studies of US
   democracy programming in Egypt and Morocco.},

   Response to Martha Nussbaum},
Journal = {HUMAN RIGHTS QUARTERLY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {40},
Number = {4},
Pages = {859-904},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {This article asks ``the intersectional question{''} about women's
   progress. The purpose is to understand whether the successes of the
   women's movement and women's human rights have improved the conditions
   of women who are disadvantaged not only because of their sex or gender
   but also disadvantaged by their race, color, caste, religion, region,
   disability, age, sexual orientation, etc. It takes its cue from an
   account of the matter laid out by Martha Nussbaum. I contend that
   Nussbaum's view of women's progress, especially under CEDAW, does not
   consider the substantive and strategic implications of intersectionality
   and thus is not transformative in nature. The central argument then
   espouses a normative vision of women's progress which is intersectional
   such that it reflects and improves the lives of all women in the
   specific ways in which they are affected by multiple and overlapping
   systems of disadvantage and in turn subverts and transforms these
   systems.},

Abstract = {In recent years, the work of a diverse range of thinkers has been
   grouped together under the label `new materialism'. This article offers
   a critical introduction to new materialism that challenges its
   understanding of historical materialism. It aims to demonstrate not that
   historical materialism is superior to new materialism, but rather that
   the latter would benefit from engaging with rather than ignoring or
   dismissing the former. It begins by defining new materialism in relation
   to its reappraisal of science, its concept of agency and its underlying
   ontology. Second, it locates new materialism by demonstrating how and
   why many new materialists are hostile to historical materialism.
   Finally, it responds to new materialist criticisms of historical
   materialism, arguing both that there are potential areas of agreement
   between the two materialisms and that historical materialism offers
   valuable resources for analysing historically specific and asymmetric
   power relations.},

Abstract = {The rise of the radical New Right' (NR) across much of the global
   political landscape is one of the most striking political developments
   of recent years. This article seeks to foster international theory's
   critical engagement with the NR by providing an overview of its thinking
   about world politics and the challenges it presents. We argue that in
   many ways international theory is in fact uniquely positioned to provide
   such an engagement, and that it is essential that international theory
   comes to terms more fully with its political vision and theoretical
   claims if it is to engage effectively with this increasingly potent and
   often deeply troubling intellectual and political movement.},

Abstract = {Privatization is an ever more dominant model of economic and social
   rights (ESR) realization. Thus far, however, there has been relatively
   little attention paid to privatization in ESR scholarship and practice,
   resulting in a significant lacuna from both a normative and an empirical
   perspective. Taking as its starting point the delineation of ESR
   obligations in terms of the tripartite typology of respect, protect, and
   fulfill, this article critiques how that framework (and the treaty
   bodies which employ it in their work) addresses privatization from an
   ESR perspective. The author outlines a new approach- focused on the
   obligation to fulfill-which would contribute significantly to the
   ability of ESR law as it stands to capture and address the scope of
   state decision-making and (in)action at issue in privatization
   situations.},

Abstract = {The robust economic growth of developing countries revived discussions
   about the need for a global financial architecture that is more
   representative of today's economic and political realities. The world is
   now markedly different from the moment the Bretton Woods institutions
   were created. The BRICS now account for a substantive share of global
   GDP, however, this was not reflected in equivalent voting power in
   existing multilateral institutions. As a response, they created
   institutions like the New Development Bank (NDB) and the Contingent
   Reserve Agreement (CRA), symbolizing a shift of economic and political
   power towards emerging countries. Against this backdrop, this paper
   explores the growing importance of BRICS countries as contributors to
   the global economy and to global governance. Using NDB as a case-study,
   the paper explores the origins of the Bank and attempts to answer why a
   new institution was needed, elaborating on five practical examples in
   which NDB could contribute with innovations to the modus operandi of
   multilateral development banking. The authors argue that out of all
   multilateral development banks created in the past decades, the NDB has
   the largest potential to catalyze changes in the Bretton Woods
   institutions and to grow as an alternative to them.},

Abstract = {This article explores the reproduction of Egypt's post-revolutionary
   political economy under the military regime. Through an examination of
   tax and fiscal policy, the authors argue that a strategic wedding of
   seemingly contradictory state types allows the current regime to create
   a hybrid they call `statist neoliberalism'. The article argues that this
   hybrid form is not accidental, but is an intentional project that allows
   the state to sustain neoliberal reforms, whilst maintaining its
   long-standing control over society and the economy.},

Abstract = {Scholarly works on development studies in the past indicated that the
   penetration of multinational corporations (MNCs) into the economies of
   developing countries would herald stable economic growth and social
   cohesion. But so far, outcomes have worsened economic inequality and
   even led to violent conflicts. These myriad problems have brought huge
   concerns regarding the relevance of MNCs. It is against this backdrop
   that the article demonstrates the role of multinational oil corporations
   (MNOCs) in the political economy of Niger Delta, the subordination of
   the role of the state to the interests of MNOCs, and the effects of the
   triple alliance between foreign capital, national capital and state on
   the region.},

Abstract = {Our study of UK higher education institutions (HEls) offers insights
   into the role of institutional logics in the adoption of organisational
   practices - specifically outsourcing. We identify two logics prevalent
   within HEls: a public service `state logic' and a `market logic'. White
   adherence to the market logic supports commercial-based practices such
   as outsourcing, organisations enact competing logics in complex ways.
   Outsourcing is mainly limited to peripheral activities segmented from
   the core while a nascent cooperative solution is emerging as HEIs co-opt
   practices and discourse of outsourcing to justify hybrid relationships
   that marry competing logics in a process of selective coupling.},

Abstract = {The article reviews the changing approach on the nature of local
   governance in Hungary. During the Democratic Transition the evolvement
   of the Hungarian municipal system was based on the paradigm and approach
   of the European Charter of Local Government. Thus one of the most
   autonomous local government system of Europe evolved in Hungary.
   Although the municipal reforms were basically successful, several
   dysfunctional phenomena could be observed and the request for the
   municipal reforms was strong from the late 1990s in Hungary. The new
   constitution of Hungary, the Fundamental Law introduced a new model. The
   approach of the local governance has been transformed: the autonomy of
   the municipalities have been limited. Thus the autonomous nature of the
   Hungarian model changed and new challenges have appeared in the field of
   the implementation of the regulation of the Charter.},

Abstract = {Why do private banks lend preferentially to politically connected firms?
   Focusing on the case of Egypt during the later years of Mubarak's rule,
   we identified politically connected firms, and we documented, using the
   Orbis corporate data on large firms in Egypt, that they received a
   disproportionate amount of the loans going to the private sector during
   2003-11. We then investigated the determinants of their borrowings, and
   we found evidence that connected firms were more attractive to banks
   both because they made larger profits, and because they were seen to be
   implicitly guaranteed by the state against failure. We also found
   evidence that non-connected firms had a lower demand for loans.},

Abstract = {What factors explain variation in the tenure of political leaders who
   survive a coup d'etat? Our main hypothesis is that leaders who survive a
   coup attempt take the opportunity to purge known and potential rivals
   while also deterring future coup conspirators. The severity of the purge
   is also hypothesized to be positively associated with longer post-coup
   tenures, as potential rivals are eliminated or deterred from future coup
   attempts. After introducing the topic of the failed coup, and presenting
   the dataset we developed to measure the level of punishment associated
   with a failed coup attempt, we offer an analysis of the effect of purges
   on the survival time of leaders who survive a coup attempt. We find
   that, conditional on regime type, purging has an effect on lengthening
   leader tenure, with more severe purges being associated with longer
   authoritarian tenures. Democratic leaders gain no advantage. Changes in
   military expenditures do not increase subsequent tenure. We conclude
   with a discussion of the results as well as what a broader dataset might
   reveal.},

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL STUDIES QUARTERLY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {62},
Number = {3},
Pages = {593-605},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Theories of balancing are under assault. On theoretical and historical
   grounds, realists and non-realists challenge the claim that states
   balance against shifts in aggregate material capabilities. In addressing
   these claims, this article presents a more granular and finely tuned
   theory of balancing. It contends that states do, in fact, balance
   effectively. While foreign policy leaders regularly ignore aggregate
   power developments, they do disaggregate power to identify threatening
   states and target their balancing against specific threatening elements.
   Targeted-balancing theory explains why some historical cases coded as
   under-balancing are really instances of appropriate balancing; why a
   more powerful state's military buildup, or alliance formation against a
   weaker state, can constitute balancing; and why some instances of non-or
   missing-balancing against a more powerful state do not undermine
   balance-of-power theory. I provide support for my claims through an
   analysis of Britain's balancing against Germany and Italy between 1936
   and 1939. Rather than under-balancing, or failing to balance altogether,
   London target-balanced against the specific threatening elements of
   German and Italian power. Given that power is rarely fungible across
   elements, London ranked other components of their power as secondary,
   and even last, in terms of Britain's rearmament priorities.},

Abstract = {To what extent did the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) succeed in
   becoming a reference point for public debates, academic inquiry, and
   policy-focused research? We explore this by considering three empirical
   questions. First, were there discernible trends in the extent of media
   references to the MDGs - by year, publication, and geography over the
   relevant period? Second, were there discernible trends in MDG references
   across a sample of relevant academic journals and disciplines? Third,
   how does the pattern of MDG media references compare to the emerging
   early pattern of Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) media references? In
   our sample, we find that newspapers in the UK, India and Nigeria had
   much more frequent MDG references than those published in Australia,
   Canada or the United States. We also find that The Lancet had a notably
   high frequency of MDG-referencing articles, potentially helping to
   explain the distinctive patterns of acceleration on health MDGs. We
   further find that UN summits were a key driver of MDG coverage, with
   2005 as the year of peak MDG attention. News coverage for the SDGs in
   2016 was similar to latter year coverage of the MDGs, although
   considerably higher than related coverage in 2001 and 2002.
   The Millennium Development Goals have sometimes been described as a
   uniting force for the global development policy community, but little
   attention has been paid to their role in affecting public conversations
   or the research that might inform policy.},

Abstract = {The state of Rio de Janeiro has become a hub for oil and gas production
   and infrastructure since Brazil entered the global oil market in the
   2000s. Observers have anticipated increasing tensions between
   environmental activists and oil companies. These predictions have not
   been fulfilled, despite increasing evidence of environmental degradation
   caused by oil production. What could be hindering environmental
   mobilization in defense of the environment and affected populations and
   against the unrestrained expansion of oil infrastructure in the state? A
   longitudinal case study of environmental activism in defense of the
   Guanabara Bay ecosystem suggests that answers must consider the combined
   effects of democratization, political and regulatory decentralization,
   and neoliberal reforms on socioenvironmental activismspecifically, its
   weakening as civil society organizations confront increasing burdens of
   participation in policy making, deeply fragmented institutional and
   regulatory frameworks for environmental governance, and the expansion of
   opportunities to engage in collaborative arrangements with corporations.},

Abstract = {How frontline employees cope with perceived work pressure may be of
   direct influence on policy outcomes. This study contributes to the
   street-level bureaucracy literature in several ways. First, we study
   both passive client-oriented and active system-oriented coping. Second,
   we analyse how these coping behaviours relate to work pressure and work
   autonomy. Finally, this article analyses whether these relationships are
   conditioned by the performance regime. Using a unique set-up of hospital
   employees (n = 979) working in external and internal performance
   regimes, we find a higher level of system-oriented active coping than
   client-oriented passive coping. Moreover, we find that autonomy matters
   for system-oriented coping and work pressure for client-oriented coping,
   and that these relationships are context-dependent.},

Abstract = {Deliberative democrats have long considered the trade-off between norms
   of inclusion and efficiency. The latest attempt at reconciliation is the
   deliberative systems model, which situates and links individual sites of
   deliberation in their macro context. Yet, critics argue that this move
   to scale up leaves inclusive practices of citizen deliberation
   vulnerable. Here, we seek to mitigate these concerns via an unlikely
   source: bureaucracy. Drawing on the notion of policy feedback, with its
   attendant focus on how policies (re)make democratic politics, we
   envision a deliberative bureaucracy where implementation and service
   delivery are imbued with norms of justification, publicity and, most
   radically, inclusion. Looking at promising contemporary governance
   practices, we argue that a deliberative bureaucracy, with the rich
   public encounters it might foster, can reconcile the desire to scale up
   deliberative democracy to whole systems with the desire to hold on to
   the benefits of scaled-down citizen deliberation.},

Abstract = {The postmaterialism thesis contends that newer cultural and social
   justice issues will supplant traditional, class-based economic concerns
   as societies become increasingly wealthy. Although macrolevel evidence
   broadly supports this prediction, individual-level evidence for the
   theory in the United States has been sparse. Moreover, alternative
   theories predict that postmaterialism will not travel well to the
   American context because religious cleavages that divide the major
   parties will be most salient. We test the postmaterialism thesis at the
   individual level using unique data that enable us to evaluate citizens'
   value-preference structures across income levels, as well as the
   conditional effect of income on the relationship between individuals'
   ranked value preferences and political attitudes and behavior.
   Consistent with the theory, greater income strengthens the association
   between egalitarianism and ideology, partisanship, evaluations of
   President Obama, and presidential vote choice, and weakens the
   relationship between moral traditionalism and these same variables.
   However, income does not moderate the association between economic
   security and individuals' identities, evaluations, or behavior.
   Additionally, value-preference hierarchies are quite similar across
   income groups after controlling for partisanship and ideology. The
   results lend insight into the nature of value- and income-based
   cleavages in American politics.},

Abstract = {Although coups remain a pressing concern for rulers across the globe,
   the mechanisms through which common coup-prevention strategies operate
   have not been well theorized or rigorously tested. This article analyzes
   how counterbalancing the military with other security forces prevents
   coups. Using new cross-national time-series data on state security
   forces along with evidence from sixteen case studies, the article
   demonstrates that counterbalancing reduces the likelihood that coup
   attempts will succeed and that it does so primarily by creating
   incentives for some soldiers to resist the coup, rather than by creating
   barriers to coordination between forces. However, counterbalancing is
   not associated with fewer coup attempts. In fact, the creation of a new
   security force increases the odds of a coup attempt in the following
   year. These findings highlight potential costs associated with
   counterbalancing and explain why it is not more widespread.},

Abstract = {Funding for social welfare depends on citizen support. Drawing on
   evolutionary psychological approaches to politics, we study two types of
   need that might shape citizens' welfare support by regulating their
   feelings of compassion. One type of need is a recipient's absolute need.
   The other type is acute need created by sudden misfortune, such as
   sudden job loss. Across four studies, we find that absolute and acute
   needs independently affect compassion and welfare attitudes. This leads
   to potential inefficiencies in judgments: People who have fallen far are
   judged more deserving of compassion and access to welfare even when they
   are not in an absolute sense the most impoverished.},

Abstract = {This article is part of the special cluster titled Parties and
   Democratic Linkage in Post-Communist Europe, guest edited by Lori
   Thorlakson, and will be published in the August 2018 issue of EEPSIn an
   article written in 1995 titled What Is Different about Postcommunist
   Party Systems? Peter Mair applied the method that he called ex adverso
   extrapolation. He matched his knowledge of the process of consolidation
   of party systems in the West with what was known at that time about
   Eastern European history, society, and the emerging post-communist party
   politics. Considering factors such as the existence of fluid social
   structures, the weakness of civil society, or the destabilizing impact
   of the so-called triple transition, his article predicted long-term
   instability for the region. In the present article, we evaluate the
   validity of Mair's predictions, thereby also contributing to a lively
   debate in the current literature about the scale and nature of East-West
   differences and about the trajectories of the two regions. Going beyond
   the identification of cross-regional similarities and differences, we
   also differentiate between individual party systems, establish
   subgroups, and describe changes across time. Using four major dimensions
   (i.e., party system closure, party-level stability, electoral
   volatility, and fragmentation), the article finds that Mair's
   predictions were largely, though not in every detail, right. Ironically,
   however, we also find that changes in the West tend to match over time
   the trajectory of the East.},

Abstract = {The trial of Khieu Samphan and Nuon Chea in Case 002 at the
   Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia (ECCC) is widely seen
   as a landmark case in international criminal law. While the defendants
   were convicted of crimes against humanity in the first half of the case,
   Case 002/01, they were cleared of charges for sexual crimes by the trial
   chambers, disappointing observers and advocates who considered them to
   have facilitated mass sexual violence between 1976 and 1979 in
   Democratic Kampuchea (DK), as Cambodia was known at the time. Case
   002/01 raises important questions over the prosecution of sexual crimes
   as acts of state, especially when that state's official policy is to
   prevent and punish sexual violence. The conclusion of this article
   discusses the court's ruling that DK policies and laws against sexual
   violence indicate that the defendants intended to prevent sexual
   violence. The ruling is deeply flawed, especially when we consider that
   murder was also outlawed under the DK criminal code. Yet, these laws
   against murder were not considered a barrier to charging Khmer Rouge
   leaders with murder in the context of war crimes, crimes against
   humanity, and genocide. This, in turn, raises a question as to what
   exactly constitutes state policy in the context of mass violence
   committed by state actors: the policy of governments, laws, and decrees
   of the state or the actions of the state and government?},

Abstract = {How should prime ministerial and party leadership be understood and
   assessed? One leading approach posits that we should assess them in
   terms of whether they achieve statecraft, that is, winning and maintain
   office in government. This article supplements and then assesses that
   theory by drawing from Pawson and Tilley's concept of the realistic
   interview, in which practitioners are deployed as co-researchers to
   assess and revise theory. Unprecedented interviews with British party
   leaders were therefore undertaken. The article provides new empirical
   support for the framework because many of the key generative mechanisms
   identified within the neo-statecraft model were present in an analysis
   of the interviews. The interviews also allowed the limitations of the
   model to be demarcated. Statecraft focuses purely on cunning leadership
   where the aim is to maximise power and influence. This approach differs
   from leadership by conscience where the aim is to achieve normative
   goals.},

Title = {The ``Alternative for Germany': The rise of right-wing populism at the

Journal = {POLITICS},

Volume = {38},
Number = {3, SI},
Pages = {295-310},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {This article charts the rise of the Alternative for Germany'
   (Alternative fur Deutschland or AfD) from its inception in late 2012 to
   its unexpectedly strong performance in the 2017 Federal election. In
   terms of the inward' aspect of Euroscepticism, the article considers the
   impact of the emergence of successively more hardline leaderships in
   2015 and 2017, which led to a shift beyond opposition to aspects of the
   European integration process to a more profound critique of German
   society and politics. In terms of the outward' aspect, it assesses the
   significance of these developments in the wider debates around
   Euroscepticism and populism. The article concludes that the AfD's
   Euroscepticism is now nested within an ideological profile that
   increasingly conforms to the template of an orthodox European right-wing
   populist party. It argues that the widely unanticipated level of
   electoral support for the AfD in the 2017 Federal elections and its
   status as the main opposition party in the Bundestag is a systemic shock
   and potential critical juncture in the development of the German party
   system and the contestation of European integration in the Federal
   Republic.},

Abstract = {One of the main criticisms of agonistic democracy (and of
   post-structuralism more generally) is that it fails to get beyond a
   purely negative assessment of alternative theories. The article takes up
   this challenge. First, it seeks to specify the core commitments of
   agonistic democracy, focusing on the concepts of contestation,
   contingency and interdependence. Second, it analyses how these
   commitments might be institutionalised through models of perfectionism,
   adversarialism and inclusivism. Third, it considers how agonistic
   principles can suffuse broader processes of democratic design, drawing
   on insights from critical institutionalism. The article argues that
   agonism can become more than a thought experiment or critique. An
   agonistic design process is possible. Such a process has five key
   characteristics: it is processual, collective, contextual, contestable
   and always provisional.},

Title = {Challenging the Odds: Incumbency Disadvantage, Local Ties, and Electoral
   Performance in Hungary, 1994-2010},

Abstract = {Most empirical studies of the effect of incumbency conclude that being a
   defender of the seat is an advantage and that newcomers and challengers
   alike have increasingly lower probabilities of winning. Yet, the
   majority of these studies in Eastern Europe have been based on
   tumultuous political environments in which electoral rules change
   frequently. A test of the theory of how candidate traits such as
   legislative and local political experience increase incumbents'
   electoral performance has not been done in an environment in which the
   electoral rules are stable. Furthermore, these studies are based in
   proportional representation (PR) systems, which amplify the role of the
   party leadership in determining candidate fate through candidate
   rankings. I examine Hungary's mixed-member system using candidate-level
   panel data that covers Hungarian national elections from 1994 to 2010,
   and contains basic information on all candidates running in SMDs. I find
   that Hungarian SMD incumbents perform worse at the elections than their
   challengers. However, in the long run, legislative experience in SMDs
   neutralizes this effect. Additionally, local politicians, such as
   mayors, manage to increase their vote share at national elections.},

Abstract = {This article alerts to the emergence and limitations of a depoliticised
   problem-solving approach to security governance that relies primarily on
   informal steering through networks of selected stakeholders and the
   generation of expert knowledge. It argues that such an understanding -
   as visible in both academic discourse and political practice - reaches
   its limits when being applied to highly erratic and contentious security
   issues, such as terrorism and radicalisation, for which there is no
   scholarly and political agreement to build upon. In these cases,
   adopting a strategy of depoliticisation not only raises problems from a
   normative democratic standpoint, but also fails to achieve its own
   practical and political goals. Rather than facilitating technical
   consensus and smooth implementation, this kind of security governance
   cannot escape the uncertainty and contestation inherent in the issues at
   hand. Therefore, eventually, it gets bogged down in the contingent
   security politics and myopic ad-hocery that it has sought to overcome.
   This examination focuses specifically on the case of EU internal
   security governance and it substantiates its arguments through two
   empirical illustrations using EU policies to protect critical
   infrastructures and prevent radicalisation.},

Abstract = {In light of their nineteenth-century political economies, why did poor,
   agricultural Denmark become a leader in public, mass primary education
   (1814) and a multiple-track education system that included vocational
   training, while rich, industrial Britain did not create public, mass
   schooling until 1870, and embraced a one-track, academic
   secondary-education system? The author argues that literary narratives
   shed light on these cross-national differences. Danish narratives
   imagined education as social investment for a strong society; diverse
   educational tracks were necessary to meet the varied skills needs of the
   economy. British narratives portrayed schooling as essential to
   self-development and to cultivating the ideal individual. The author
   uses a close reading of texts and computational linguistics analyses of
   521 Danish and 562 British works of fiction from 1700 to 1920 to
   document the different portrayal of education in the two countries. Case
   studies show that writers are crucial political actors in important
   reforms and understudied political agents in policy development stories.
   The method allows the author to evaluate empirically the complex
   relationship between culture and political outcomes, to falsify cultural
   claims, and to improve on thin, vague, national cultural arguments. The
   article shows fhow literature helps to reconcile the contradictions
   embedded in diverse models of governance. Literature provides a site for
   reworking cultural symbols in response to societal struggles over
   exogenous change, and provides a source of continuity at moments of
   institutional change.},

Abstract = {A variety of theories attempt to explain why some individuals radicalize
   along religious lines. Few studies, however, have jointly put these
   diverse hypotheses under empirical scrutiny. Focusing on
   Muslim-Christian tensions in Kenya, we distill salient micro-, meso-,
   and macro-level hypotheses that try to account for the recent spike in
   religious radicalization. We use an empirical strategy that compares
   survey evidence from Christian and Muslim respondents with differing
   degrees of religious radicalization. We find no evidence that
   radicalization is predicted by macro-level political or economic
   grievances. Rather, radicalization is strongly associated with
   individual-level psychological trauma, including historically troubled
   social relations, and process-oriented factors, particularly religious
   identification and exposure to radical networks. The findings point to a
   model of radicalization as an individual-level process that is largely
   unaffected by macro-level influences. As such, radicalization is better
   understood in a relational, idea-driven framework as opposed to a
   macro-level structural approach.},

Abstract = {Political appointees from different parties from that of their
   ministercross-partisan appointees (CPAs)are increasingly found in the
   core executive. Ministerial advisory scholarship has overlooked CPAs,
   while the coalition governance literature sees them as spies' and
   coalition watchdogs'. This article argues theoretically and demonstrates
   empirically that this conceptualization is overly limited. The empirical
   basis is a large-N survey of political appointees from two Norwegian
   coalitions, and a qualitative follow-up survey of CPAs. The results show
   that CPAs monitor on behalf of their party, provide cross-partisan
   advice to their minister and perform many of the same tasks as regular
   partisan appointees, including exercising independent decision-making
   power. In this research context, most CPAs act as coalition liaison
   officers who, rather than create tension and negative dynamics,
   contribute to building trust between coalition partners.},

Abstract = {While the foundational claim that PSM attracts individuals to the public
   sector is well established in the research literature, much uncertainty
   still exists about its influence on the choice between the public versus
   the nonprofit sector, which also frequently exhibits a strong public
   service mission. Little is known also about how discrete dimensions of
   PSM differ in their effects on such job preferences. This article
   addresses these shortcomings by drawing on a study that combines the
   measurement of separate dimensions of PSM with a policy-capturing design
   that allows disentangling the effects of sector from those of other job
   attributes that usually correlate with it: the service orientation of
   the job and job security. Results show that dimensions of PSM display
   relevant differences in their effects on preferences across job
   attributes. These findings have important implications for the choice of
   PSM measurements in scholarly research and job selection.},

Abstract = {The use of social networks and other Web 2.0 tools has gained great
   importance in the public sector since it enables a new form of
   communication between the administration and the citizens. Appropriate
   metrics and methodologies are needed to determine its impact. This work
   illustrates the application of different metrics of Facebook use at the
   municipal level, both by city councils and citizens, taking a sample of
   Spanish councils and public data. The results show that a considerable
   percentage of city councils do not use Facebook to communicate with the
   citizens. Also, municipalities that use Facebook reach modest levels of
   awareness and interaction and don't use the media or content that
   generates the most impact on users. Therefore, local administrations
   must rethink their strategies regarding the use of these tools to
   improve their interaction with the citizens.},

Abstract = {This article discusses the changing attitudes of African states towards
   the governance of their mining sectors, with states seeking to assert
   their sovereignty through a greater agency in their mineral resources.
   These attitudes are strongly echoed by regional governance norms such as
   the Africa Mining Vision an initiative led by the African Union since
   2009. I suggest that the main drivers of these changes are collective
   agents that transcend the realm of the state. Building on Tom Long's
   tripartite categorization of small state power ({''}derivative
   power{''}, ``particular-intrinsic power{''}, and ``collective power{''})
   to the analysis, I highlight Africa's current mining reforms as the
   outcome of a collective power to shape its mining sector vis-a-vis
   global structures. The article discusses these changes primarily through
   IR scholarship on the `Rise of the Rest' and on small states agency.},

Abstract = {Previous literature demonstrates that when street-level bureaucrats
   believe that the policy as designed is not desirable, they utilize
   various strategies to change the situation. This study suggests that
   when street-level bureaucrats believe that fixing a policy through the
   manner in which it is implemented is not enough, they will try to
   influence the design of the policy directly. Three factors promote this
   decision: public perceptions revealed in their interactions with
   clients, professional ethical values and a supportive organizational
   environment. We test this argument using Israeli public social workers
   in the context of urban renewal. We discuss the problems and benefits of
   involving street-level bureaucrats in policy design and view such
   actions as related to welfare reform and changes in the state's
   responsibility for its citizens. We maintain that in this changing
   environment, street-level bureaucrats' involvement in policy design
   should be formally institutionalized.},

Abstract = {While regulators, firms, and the courts must all be able to interpret
   regulations to best address economic and social issues, regulatory
   interpretation may vary greatly across parties. After introducing a
   framework to explain the impact of the complexity of written regulations
   and the complexity of the regulatory environment on regulatory
   interpretation, this paper utilizes regulatory examples to explore the
   challenges associated with regulatory interpretation. Several recent
   initiatives designed to improve regulatory efficacy are examined to
   assess potential methods available to reduce challenges associated with
   regulatory interpretation. When considered with the public policy
   implementation literature and research on networks in public policy,
   several implications emerge from the consideration of regulatory
   interpretation and recent regulatory initiatives. Regulators should
   pursue strategies to minimize the number of possible interpretations in
   the design of regulation and seek improved regulatory mechanisms to
   alleviate regulatory interpretation challenges. Furthermore, theoretical
   models should acknowledge regulatory interpretation to better assist in
   the design and implementation of regulation.},

Abstract = {China is considered as a significant development partner in Nigeria; yet
   relations between the two countries have been marked by episodes of
   oscillations. This paper engages three interconnected questions: (i)
   What is the history of Sino-Nigeria relations? (ii) How has Nigeria's
   political elites and ordinary Nigerians reacted to Chinese presence?
   (iii) To what extent is Sino-Nigeria relations beneficial to Nigeria?
   This paper while identifying and discussing the benefits and
   underbellies of Sino-Nigeria relations, draws attention to aspects of
   the relations less discussed in the literature. It concludes that beyond
   the more popular yet simplistic Janus-headed explication of Sino-Nigeria
   relations as positive or negative, significant focus is needed to
   understand the instabilities capable of impacting on the developmental
   potential of China in Nigeria.},

Abstract = {An assumption runs through this symposium that peaceful change is
   desirable and ought to be encouraged. We do not believe it is that
   simple. The term ``peaceful change{''} itself is not well defined. The
   article, therefore, narrowly defines peaceful change as a process
   whereby a hegemon voluntarily cedes its dominant geopolitical role to a
   challenger in one or more regions. Drawing on neoclassical realism, we
   hypothesize that a declining hegemon will only accept peaceful change
   if: (1) it has high confidence change is inevitable because it lacks the
   military, economic, or political means to resist it; or (2) when
   domestic political or economic costs of resistance of prohibitively
   high; or (3) when the leadership of the hegemonic state faces domestic
   constraints in its ability to enact policies to resist the challenger.},

Abstract = {Security, as expressed by the security policy of a state, is one of the
   most fundamental aspects of a foreign and defense policies of a state.
   Together, they create a foreign orientation of the state which may alter
   with time, space and under the influence of political decision-making.
   This paper presents the sources of the strategic orientation of Slovakia
   that emerged in reaction to historical events that the faced country
   Slovakia gradually integrated into the European and Euro-Atlantic
   structures with the emphasis on coalition changes in the governance of
   the state. This paper, through analysis and comparison, shows the
   dominant changes in the Slovakian security environment. In any case, it
   has been the destiny of small countries to maintain their security
   through cooperation and integration. (C) 2018 The Regents of the

   for Village Elections},

Abstract = {After roughly two decades of village elections, to what extent are high
   quality local elections consolidated in rural China? While attitudinal
   and behavioral evidence tell a mixed story, this paper leverages
   experimental data to understand how the procedural quality of village
   elections, specifically the methods used to nominate candidates, affects
   support for elections in rural China. After establishing that procedural
   fairness has a significant effect on whether villagers support village
   elections, we explore why this is the case. Using democratic
   consolidation as an analogy, we explore both instrumental and intrinsic
   motivations for procedural fairness. Some types of people - namely
   farmers and wealthy villagers, may value procedural fairness for
   ego-tropic, instrumental reasons. Alternatively, some may value
   procedurally fair elections for the expected collective outcomes, such
   as increased public goods provision. Finally, some individuals likely
   appreciate procedural fairness as an inherent good. We assess each
   motivation by interacting nomination procedures with measures of
   profession, income, village level public goods provision and egalitarian
   core values. With the exception of farmers, each interaction is
   significant, suggesting that multiple constituencies value high quality
   village elections in the countryside, likely, for diverse reasons.},

Abstract = {Small Arms and Light Weapons (SALW) are the principal tools of armed
   violence, but the development of a global `regime' has been a fragmented
   and fragile process that reinforces sovereignty more than it regulates
   violence. This article argues that rather than a settled regime, the
   global processes on SALW are better understood as a `global assemblage'.
   Drawing on new materialism and process philosophy, the article does not
   seek to explain a regime through power but to explain power through its
   assemblage. It shows how powers are produced as a global collective for
   action on SALW is composed. This composition of powers operates not only
   by producing agreements, but by creating and proliferating the
   possibilities to disagree, re-composing the meanings of decision and
   consensus, and generating objects for cooperation that constitute
   particular modes of global action that render guns governable.},

   on YouTube and Twitter in the case of the disappearance of 43 students
   in Ayotzinapa, Mexico, allows the identification of the codes of
   representation being disputed in this emblematic case of violation of
   fundamental rights. Digital storytelling that goes viral and across
   media offers the possibility of organizing protest in the offline world.
   Its reflective attributes favor the visibility of injustice and
   permanence on the local and global agenda and in some cases exert
   pressure on social actors and authorities to establish mechanisms to
   resolve the conflict.},

Abstract = {Policy diffusion literature generally studies the adoption of similar
   policies across jurisdictions, but often overlooks how opposing policies
   or legal constraints may influence the enactment of rigid state
   constitutional amendments. The current study models the spread of state
   constitutional amendments designed to prevent future policy change.
   Using conditional event history analysis on all states from 1999 to 2011
   the empirical models analyze the spread of same-sex marriage prohibitive
   amendments across the United States. Findings suggest that the nearby
   adoption of opposing policies encourage state legislatures to introduce
   prohibitive amendments. The regional diffusion effect suggests that
   policymakers protect their jurisdiction from nearby diffusion forces or
   seek electoral gains by symbolic protection by committing an already
   existing policy into the rigid state constitutional framework. Regional
   policy diffusion may, therefore, be explained by a countermovement
   mechanism unique to the state constitutional amendment process. This
   protective strategy among state legislatures and citizens may explain
   why many policy areas are frequently codified in state constitutions.},

Abstract = {In terms of accountability for the crimes of the past, El Salvador has
   long been a laggard in Latin America, effectively failing to hold anyone
   accountable for ordering crimes against humanity committed during its
   armed conflict from 1980 to 1992, or implementing any meaningful
   transitional justice process. Yet the victims' long struggle for truth,
   justice, and reparations has picked up steam in recent years, most
   notably through the 2016 overturn of the amnesty law which had blocked
   investigations or prosecutions of wartime crimes since 1993. In early
   2017, in response to pressures from civil society in El Salvador and the
   United States, and at the urging of some members of the US Congress, the
   Salvadoran government committed to the creation of a commission to
   locate the remains of the estimated 5-10,000 Salvadorans forcibly
   disappeared during the war. The success of such efforts will rely upon
   access to government information, yet efforts to secure relevant files
   from Salvadoran government institutions have thus far been fruitless. In
   this context, due to extensive United States involvement in the
   Salvadoran conflict, US records may help fill the knowledge gap. This
   article assesses the extent to which relevant information has already
   been declassified by the US government, and the likely extent to which
   useful information remains unavailable. It finds that, contrary to the
   recent assertions of the US State Department, a great deal of
   information which could aid in these investigations remains classified,
   particularly in the files of military and intelligence agencies.},

Abstract = {This article examines the embrace of Chinese finance under the United
   Kingdom's 2010-2015 Coalition government. The article argues that the
   City of London's centrality within British capitalism has been
   reinforced, not displaced, since the Global Financial Crisis.
   Geo-economic rebalancing towards China, not the Coalition's professed
   spatial and sectoral rebalancing' ambitions, prevailed. To explain the
   City's renewed pre-eminence in the wake of the crisis, the article draws
   upon a modified version of the City-Bank-Treasury nexus' theory of
   British capitalism. Breaking from structuralist approaches that
   underplay the City of London Corporation's role within economic
   policy-making, the article illuminates the Corporation's agency as a key
   parastate institution that reoriented the City-Bank-Treasury nexus
   towards Chinese finance under the Coalition.},

Title = {On the Front Lines of Implementing Environmental Regulation: The
   Perspective of the Regulated Community in Montana},
Journal = {REVIEW OF POLICY RESEARCH},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {35},
Number = {3},
Pages = {422-438},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Although discussions about environmental policy often focus on the
   federal level of decision making and action in the United Slates,
   implementation occurs predominately at the stale level. The individuals
   largely responsible for implementation are the state regulators and
   members of the regulated community as they constitute the front lines in
   environmental regulation. Much of the existing research on regulatory
   interactions investigates the regulatory enforcement styles of
   regulators and the compliance motivations of firms. It is equally
   important to consider the perceptions and actual experiences of
   regulated community members. To examine this perspective, this
   exploratory study utilizes a mail survey to investigate the perceptions
   and experiences of members of the regulated community in Montana. The
   survey respondents report positive and cooperative interactions with
   environmental regulators. This survey provides much-needed insight into
   the perspectives of some members of the regulated community, challenging
   traditional viewpoints that the regulated community is hostile toward
   regulation, and promotes adversarial relationships with regulators.
   Accordingly, this research encourages debate about the fundamental
   assumptions surrounding the, interactions of regulators and the
   regulated community in U.S. environmental policy.},

Title = {Managing Resource-related Conflict: A Framework of Lootable Resource
   Management and Postconflict Stabilization},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CONFLICT RESOLUTION},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {62},
Number = {5},
Pages = {1044-1071},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {States endowed with valuable lootable natural resources tend to
   experience longer armed conflicts, more intense fighting in extractive
   regions and face a higher risk of recurring conflict than states without
   such resources. At the same time, many states defy resource-fueled
   conflict traps and set up institutional arrangements that seem to
   alleviate the risk of recurring conflict. However, policy makers and
   academics alike lack a sound understanding of the link between
   postconflict stabilization and strategies of resource management that
   often escape the paradigm of good resource governance. This article
   contributes to the questions of how to conceptualize diverse
   institutional arrangements in the resource sector and how to link these
   emerging institutions to postconflict stabilization. I develop a
   theoretical framework that predicts the risk of recurring armed conflict
   based on lootable resource management strategies and conditioning
   factors. The framework is then tested on a unique event history dataset.
   Results support the stabilizing effects of inclusive and publicly
   accountable modes of resource management as advocated for by proponents
   of good resource governance. Alternative resource management strategies
   either increase the risk of conflict recurrence or interact with other
   variables, changing the prospects of postconflict stability in important
   ways.},

   post-war Europe, when the Communist system of power was exhausted and
   those deprived of power under it were beginning to know each other and
   cooperate with each other in a new kind of underground. I describe the
   spiritual condition of a certain kind of young person in this
   underground, eager to find another cultural identity than the one
   offered by the official ideology and anxious to live in truth. I suggest
   that the sudden collapse of Communism and the advent of a new consumer

Abstract = {Performance data allows politicians to exert accountability over public
   organizations, even as ideological biases can affect how they interpret
   such data. However, we know little about how motivated decision-makers
   prioritize goals when facing multiple pieces of contradictory
   performance data that reflect the competing goals of public services.
   Such goal conflict is an inherent aspect of public management. To
   understand its implications for the use of performance data, we develop
   a theory of goal reprioritization. We start by assuming that elected
   officials have preferences between specific policy goals, and about
   governance processes-such as a preference for public or private service
   provision. When elected officials face contradictory pieces of
   performance data, governance preferences drive performance evaluations
   to the point that they are willing to reweight their goal preferences to
   minimize cognitive dissonance. We offer experimental evidence of this
   process, showing that elected officials asked to evaluate school
   performance reprioritize between two distinct policy goals for
   schools-test scores and student well-being-to fit with their governance
   preferences. Reprioritization is an attractive strategy since it allows
   elected officials to claim they are using performance data, even as
   underlying governance preferences lead them to set aside the evaluative
   goal-based criteria by which they would otherwise make performance
   evaluations. In other words, preferences concerning the nature of
   government can trump goal preferences when decision-makers use
   performance data.},

Abstract = {This study analyses how important is the influence of the procedure type
   and a number of received bids on the duration of the public procedure
   process. Efficiency and speed of public procurement process diminish
   inventory turnaround times, direct and indirect costs of procurement,
   hastens and improves manageability of core processes in the
   organizations obliged to the public procurement process. Our study
   focuses on the quantitative analysis of the influence of the procedural
   public procurement framework mostly determined by the central
   government, and describes potential other factors of efficiency which
   can be influenced at the local level. Dataset was obtained from the
   Public procurement Office of Serbia, and it included 42,850 cases of
   public procurement after the correction of missing and ``dirty{''} data.
   Using statistical methods we have presented two linear models, where the
   type of procedure and number of received bids account for roughly 23\%
   of the variability in the dependent variable. This paper provides
   suggestions for improvement of efficiency of public procurement, as well
   as for data that needs to be tracked to develop more comprehensive,
   accurate and reliable prediction model of the duration of the public
   procurement process.},

Abstract = {The civilian right to life is a central concept in just war theory and
   international law. It plays an important role in restraining wars, as it
   is the basis for the principle of civilian immunity and the jus in bello
   principle of discrimination; yet, it is generally interpreted as only
   establishing a first-order duty, according to which belligerents must
   avoid harming civilians. In this essay, we argue that, in addition to
   this duty, the right to life also entails a second-order duty to
   compensate civilians whose right to life has been breached. We propose
   that states should have to pay compensatory damages to individual
   civilians harmed by their military actions and we discuss the standards
   of liability that can be used to determine when payment is owed.},

Abstract = {Besides being discussed as an environmental or economic issue, climate
   change has increasingly been evoked as a security problem as well.
   However, research on the securitisation of climate change focuses mostly
   on the global level and on countries and actors in the Global North.
   Thus, there is a growing sentiment in the field of Critical Security
   Studies that there is a need to include countries from the Global South
   into the analysis as they are often the target of climate security
   constructions. Using a revised securitisation framework that
   distinguishes between different climate security discourses, this paper
   takes a closer look at the attempted securitisation of climate change in
   Mexico. The analysis shows that several foreign actors have linked
   climate change to human security and risk conceptions. Yet, because of
   the prevalence of other security issues, a diplomatic misunderstanding
   and a successful politicisation of climate change as environmental
   issue, its impact on Mexican policy has remained limited. By focusing on
   a defined national context in the Global South, the paper shows the
   specific difficulties that securitisations encounter in such a context
   and the role that different discourses and actors play in their
   relationship to the host country's authorities.},

Abstract = {Although research interest in project management is increasingly
   directed at analyzing development trends in different business
   environments, the public sector in this respect has received
   surprisingly little intention. This paper analyzes the perception of the
   relevance of particular project management critical success factors
   among project managers and other project stakeholders in the public
   sector with relatively high organizational project management maturity.
   The main focus of research is the city of Vienna and its construction
   projects. An extensive quantitative survey showed the changing
   perceptions of the key projects' success factors-namely, strengthening
   the importance of developing soft skills and stakeholders' management.},

Abstract = {Political theorists have long contemplated the concept of
   cosmopolitanism, yet almost no empirical studies have investigated how
   individuals can be encouraged to act as ethical cosmopolitans in
   practice. This article reports the findings of an experiment designed to
   investigate the effect of empathy on cosmopolitan-helping behavior. The
   extent to which empathy may be useful in motivating cosmopolitan
   behavior has been the subject of substantial debate among political
   theorists. Empathy was manipulated using a perspective-taking technique
   adapted from social psychological research, and the extent to which
   individuals were willing to engage in cosmopolitan helping was measured.
   Results showed that perspective taking increased cosmopolitan helping
   and that empathy mediated that effect. Furthermore, empathy was found to
   predict cosmopolitan helping even after controlling for several related
   constructs. Overall, results indicate that increasing empathy by
   encouraging people to take the perspective of distant individuals is a
   promising way to foster cosmopolitan helping.},

Title = {Coordination and Coherence Problems of the Public Policy for
   Modernization at the Executive Branch of Peru},
Journal = {REVISTA DEL CLAD REFORMA Y DEMOCRACIA},
Year = {2018},
Number = {70},
Pages = {127-162},

Abstract = {Since the 1990s, the structure of the Executive Branch in Peru tended to
   organize through the creation of specialized agencies in different
   sectors. This produced an organizational and functional fragmentation in
   the way public interventions are managed, substantially increasing the
   challenges of intra and intersectoral coordination and coherence in the
   management of public policies that political authorities must perform.
   This division of labor produces a management style that is unlikely to
   focus in an articulated way on the causes and solutions of public
   problems, particularly those that have a multi-causal dimension and
   require an intersectoral approach such as the policy of modernizing
   public management. This policy aims to introduce changes in the general
   rules that organize the management of public policies and organizations
   and has multiple actors involved in its design and execution. Some of
   them are ministerial divisions and agencies dependent on the Prime
   Minister's Office and the Ministry of Finance, which are part of the
   center of government.
   To analyze the case of the modernization policy, semi-structured
   interviews were conducted to 13 managers and advisors in charge of
   directing, designing and implementing the respective policy, in addition
   to a review of the regulations and the different consultancy management
   reports. Most of the senior officials involved agreed that this policy
   has weak levels of coordination and limited coherence in the programs
   developed by the stakeholders of both sectors. This is reflected in the
   lack of a shared vision, the lack of mechanisms for exchanging
   information and rules of interaction between the stakeholders, and the
   diffuse awareness that the general objective of this public policy
   cannot be achieved if the institutional objectives of each actor are not
   aligned. The paradox is that these actors, as part of the center of
   government, have the coordination of priority public policies among
   their main functions. In this context, the agency model that promotes
   organizations mainly focused on an institutional objective, with greater
   administrative autonomy, seems to have contributed to a centrifugal
   logic in the development of this policy. The operation of these
   stakeholders is not aligned to the theoretical assumptions that support
   their prevalence in the current State structure.},

Abstract = {This article examines disenchantment with democracy and the role of
   emotions in politics. Its contribution is to develop our understanding
   of emotions in situations of political disenchantment. It is argued that
   (1) there are a wide variety of emotions involved in political
   disaffection which need explication, (2) it is important to consider the
   dynamic of political motivation and demotivation and (3) we should be
   concerned about political disenchantment, not only because citizens are
   becoming negative and disengaging but because the concerns of some raise
   important issues with justice and equality in democracies. Greater
   attention to the cultivation of emotions, such as hope, in public life
   might help us to understand, (re)kindle, and sustain people's affection
   for, and engagement in, politics.},

Abstract = {This article examines the origins of the Stalinist secret police force,
   the StB, in Czechoslovakia between 1945 and 1954. By focusing on the
   biographies of its officials, it argues that there was not one, but two,
   secret police forces in this period, each recruited from a different
   generation of local communists. In pointing to the social conflicts and
   ideological tensions that characterized the communist secret police
   force in this period, it forwards a new interpretation of the party
   purges and motivations of secret police officials responsible for the
   radical political violence in Stalinist Europe in the early 1950s.},

Abstract = {International law prescribes conditions for attribution of private
   persons' conduct to a state. If those conditions are not met, the state
   shall not be responsible for actions of individuals. This attribution
   problem may be misused by states for denial of their responsibility. The
   following article approaches this phenomenon by using the concept of
   lawfare. Lawfare describes misuses of international law as a weapon to
   achieve military advantage.},

Abstract = {This article studies whether the action-reaction model holds on an
   ``embryonic{''} terrorist group like Galician Resistance (REGA). After
   presenting an overview of REGA's history, structure, financing,
   terrorist campaigns, and the police measures adopted against them, the
   text empirically contrasts whether deterrence is an efficient measure in
   reducing an incipient terrorist group's actions. Our results show that
   deterrence does in fact reduce the number of attacks when aimed at the
   group's periphery. However, it causes a backlash of new attacks when
   aimed at the group's core. In addition, we prove that an increase in the
   number of attacks also causes a reaction by police forces and a higher
   number of detentions of core members. Our results give some meaningful
   insights into the design of counter-terrorism strategies aimed against
   ``embryonic{''} groups.},

Abstract = {This article examines how the institutional design of borders affects
   international trade. The authors explore variation in the effects of
   borders by comparing new international borders that follow precedent and
   thus have a prior institutional history with new international borders
   that lack such an institutional history. The former minimally disrupt-
   or restore-previous economic networks, while the latter fundamentally
   disrupt existing economic networks. A variety of empirical tests show
   that, consistent with this institutional perspective on borders, new
   international boundaries that follow precedent are associated with
   significantly faster recovery and greater increase in subsequent trade
   flows. By contrast, when new international borders are truly new, they
   disrupt local economic networks, introduce new transaction costs, and
   impose higher adjustment costs on states, which the authors show to have
   long-term deleterious effects on trade.},

Abstract = {This paper highlights the importance of local context, the timing of
   development, and the trade-off between growth and equity in shaping
   strategies of development. We compare the `Guangdong Model' and
   `Chongqing Model' of development, two alternative strategies of
   development in contemporary China. The former emphasized market-oriented
   reforms, international linkages, and a relatively open environment for
   civil society; the latter emphasized state-led initiatives to produce
   economic growth, reduce economic inequality, and reprise traditional
   practices of the Chinese Communist Party. This paper contrasts the
   ideological aspects of the two models, along with the political
   strategies of the leaders most associated with them and the results of
   their policies. Although China remains a one-party political regime, the
   Guangdong and Chongqing models are also the most recent manifestation of
   different localities pursuing different economic models. Rather than
   providing alternative models for China's future development, they reveal
   trade-offs between economic and social goals and how best to achieve
   them. Their experiences also have implications for other developing
   countries trying to balance competing developmental goals.},

Abstract = {Closed-circuit television footage can be used to assemble an
   often-complex picture of an incident and aid in the identification of
   suspects after a crime or terrorist attack has occurred. For example,
   such footage allowed the police to not only identify the 7/7 London
   bombers but also to piece together the details of the bombers' movements
   prior to the attack. In the case of the London bombers little attempt
   was made to disguise their identities but where such identities are
   concealed it is possible to identify suspects based on other unique
   biometric characteristics such as the style of walk, referred to as
   gait. Gait feature-based individual identification has received
   increased attention from biometrics researchers. In this article, we
   propose a novel gait biometric methodology that could contribute to the
   counterterrorism effort and the identification of individuals involved
   in crime.},

Title = {Thick populism: democracy-enhancing popular participation},
Journal = {POLICY STUDIES},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {39},
Number = {3},
Pages = {334-351},
Abstract = {This article posits that some forms of popular participation offer
   important resources for democratic renewal. It develops a conceptual
   distinction between thin and thick varieties of populism. Thin populist
   movements mobilize popular support to replace elite leaders by
   undermining or corroding the deliberative and inclusionary principles of
   representative government. In contrast, thick populist movements seek to
   modify or alter the practices and conventions of representative
   government by offering democracy-enhancing and trust-building
   organizational forms and political practices. This distinction between
   thin and thick populism helps identify a swath of normative and
   practical common-ground occupied by populists and deliberative
   democratic reformers and innovators, who have also held deeply critical
   views of representative democracy. The article discusses four
   contemporary examples of democratic innovation (broadly understood) to
   illustrate how thick populism can take root in organizations,
   institutions, campaigns, and in the efforts of everyday citizens.
   Consideration is given to the lessons that contemporary forms of thick
   populism offer for advocates of participatory and deliberative
   democratic innovation.},

Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL POLITICS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {27},
Number = {5},
Pages = {782-803},
Abstract = {Tackling China's grave environmental problems increasingly turns on
   questions of sub-national interjurisdictional relations. What are the
   conditions under which neighbouring localities cooperate in stewardship
   of the natural environment? What factors give rise to
   interjurisdictional conflict such as pollution spillovers? Through a
   combination of empirical and theoretical reflections, a research agenda
   to better understand these issues is outlined. First, China's recent
   innovative approaches to the promotion of interjurisdictional
   cooperation are examined. An in-depth case study of interjurisdictional
   ecological protection `redline' zones underscores the difficulties of
   inculcating environmental neighbourliness between local governments.
   Yet, a precise diagnosis of the problem remains elusive because too
   little is known about the underlying drivers of interjurisdictional
   relations in China. An analytical framework that draws insight from
   contemporary China studies and comparative environmental governance
   scholarship is offered for the study of interjurisdictional
   environmental relations in China.},

Abstract = {This article analyzes Sweden's foreign policy 2011-2018. The article is
   part of a special issue on how the Nordic countries have responded to
   recent geopolitical change. The international context in which Sweden
   finds itself has in a number of ways changed drastically during the time
   of analysis. The foundations of Sweden's foreign policy, however, have
   seen less change. The Swedish policy adjustments we see are rather the
   effects of radical change taking place in the previous two decades: the
   EU membership, the partnership with NATO, and the abandonment of the
   policy of neutrality. Sweden is thus learning how to adapt to this
   transformation of its international orientation during a turbulent time
   in global politics. The article includes an overview of Swedish foreign
   policy and the literature on the topic. We discuss the major actors,
   institutions, tools and frameworks in the foreign policy making process.
   A detailed analysis of the Foreign Minister's Statement of Government
   Policy provides a temporal comparison over the last decade.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF EUROPEAN INTEGRATION},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {40},

Pages = {295-308},
Abstract = {The newly established European Banking Union has introduced a unique
   accountability framework of the European Central Bank vis-a-vis the
   European Parliament (EP), but also vis-a-vis national parliaments, in
   the form of Banking Dialogue. The ECB was thus far held to account for
   its monetary policy actions by the EP in the framework of the
   long-existing Monetary Dialogue. However, some shortcomings have become
   apparent in this procedure, especially with the economic crisis. Beyond
   this, the recent attribution of new competences to the ECB calls for a
   reflection as to the accountability mechanisms in place to control its
   actions. Based on an empirical and normative analysis of both types of
   dialogues, we contend that the Banking Dialogue could serve as a model
   to reform the Monetary Dialogue to enhance the legitimacy of the ECB's
   actions and of the EU as a whole.},

Abstract = {The rising tide of populist majoritarianism in Greece can be reflected
   through the amendments of the 1975 constitution. The 1986 constitutional
   amendment allowed for an open discussion of the merits and weaknesses of
   reinforcing the majoritarian elements of Greek democracy. Similar
   discussions could be traced in the constitutional amendments of 2001 and
   2008. The 2016 initiative of the SYRIZA-ANEL coalition government to
   launch a constitutional amendment process has brought once again
   majoritarianism to the forefront.},

   Turkish democracy confirms its negative impact on the quality of
   democratic institutions, transparency and accountability. Boosted by

   prevented the development of social trust, which in turn can become a
   crucial opportunity structure for the success of populist political
   parties. The multilevel crises that both Greece and Turkey have faced in

Abstract = {Lack of a comprehensive approach to municipalities' revenue sources in
   the form of macro-economic system, changes and interventions,
   self-reliance and self-sufficiency policy enforcement have put financial
   sector of municipalities in unsustainable situation. Continuing of this
   situation will have undesirable consequences on cities and urban
   management. Access to favorable and sustainable revenue sources leads
   municipalities to play a more active role in urban environment and
   properly meet the needs of citizens. In this regard, this research
   intends to analyze Shabestar Municipality's revenue sources in terms of
   sustainability measures during 2004-2014. Type of the research is
   applicable and the method is descriptive-analytic and exploratory. Data
   collection has been carried out either documentary or field survey by
   using scoring forms and interviews with Municipality officials. Data
   analysis has been conducted by using Excel, Shannon Entropy and TOPSIS
   techniques. The results obtained showed that the trend toward financial
   independence of municipalities and decentralization of sub-national
   authorities has had some trouble and now municipalities need financial
   support from central government to fulfill their obligations. Shabestar
   Municipality like many other municipalities in Iran depends strongly on
   low favorable and unsustainable revenue sources such as sale of
   municipal immovable properties, charges on surplus density, charges on
   removing parking etc.},

Pages = {276-291},
Abstract = {The UK's withdrawal from the European Union (EU) has enormous
   implications for Northern Ireland. All sides to the Brexit negotiations
   quickly agreed that it was vitally important to protect the peace
   process and to uphold the 1998 Good Friday (Belfast) Agreement. However,
   the question of how this was to be done soon became a point over which
   there were very apparent differences between the two sides; such
   differences are manifest within Northern Ireland in differing political
   views regarding European integration and national sovereignty. This
   paper explores the effects of EU membership on the peace process and the
   Agreement in light of the Brexit process. It provides an overview of the
   difficulties and frictions in finding a common approach from Northern
   Ireland to the EU and explains how this is manifest in the response to
   the Brexit referendum of June 2016. It concludes by considering some of
   the ways in which the Agreement itself offers means of navigating some
   of the more thorny issues arising as a result of the UK's withdrawal
   from the EU.},

Journal = {REVIEW OF AFRICAN POLITICAL ECONOMY},

Volume = {45},
Number = {157},
Pages = {378-392},
Abstract = {Based on in-depth interviews largely with women working as community
   health workers (CHWs) and documents, the article shines the spotlight on
   CHWs, who remain a blind spot in the literature on South African labour
   studies. Abandoned by mainstream unions and often ignored by labour
   scholars, the article reveals that CHW workers are crafting their own
   nascent organisational responses as women and as precarious workers to
   their conditions. New organisational responses led by women who carry
   most of the social and economic burden are beginning to contest their
   conditions of precariousness by using tools such as strikes.},

Abstract = {At European Union (EU) level, the importance of innovation is a key
   factor to European competitiveness in the global economy, undergoing
   deep transformation driven by innovative technologies and new business
   models. A key objective of the European Commission (EC) is to ``foster a
   globally competitive and innovative European space sector{''} to
   maintain and further strengthen a world-class capacity to develop and
   exploit space systems, opening up new opportunities to develop
   innovative products and services which can benefit the industry in all
   Member States. The new business and innovation ecosystem are supported
   at the European, regional and national levels by creating space hubs
   with the objective to open space up to non-space entrants. Innovation
   derived from space exploration, fosters economic growth and delivers
   high returns on investment. The involvement of space exploration
   applications to sustain the innovation and technological advancement
   goal could be proposed and achieved in the post-2030 Agenda by
   government, the private sector, civil society and individuals for a
   sustainable future. Currently, the European Space Agency (ESA) strategy
   outlines the long-term planning for Europe's participation in space
   exploration activities and is looking for innovative cases with a
   tangible business performance that can be matched with the innovation
   and technological advancement goal after 2030. Directly or indirectly,
   European space exploration activities could contribute to new knowledge
   and technical innovations, stimulating the creation of tangible benefits
   for Earth.},

Abstract = {Predictive analysis is rare in the field of Czech security studies. For
   this reason, scenarios of world politics by Institute of International
   Relations (IIR) (2012-2017) as well as predictions by the think-tank
   European values (2016) constitute pioneering works worthy of attention.
   The article analyses these scenarios, focusing on their methodological
   aspects. The articles concludes by noting that IIR's scenarios are a
   welcome contribution to the field but the same cannot be said about

Abstract = {What determines the recidivism of ex-combatants from armed conflicts? In
   postconflict settings around the world, there has been growing interest
   in reintegration programs to prevent ex-combatants from returning to
   illegal activities or to armed groups, yet little is known about who
   decides to go bad. We evaluate explanations for recidivism related to
   combatant experiences and common criminal motives by combining data from
   a representative survey of ex-combatants of various armed groups in
   Colombia with police records of observed behaviors that indicate which
   among the respondents returned to belligerent or illegal activities.
   Consistent with a theory of recidivism being shaped by driving and
   restraining factors, the results suggest that factors such as antisocial
   personality traits, weak family ties, lack of educational attainment,
   and the presence of criminal groups are most highly correlated with
   various kinds of recidivism and hold implications for programs and
   policies to successfully reintegrate ex-combatants into society.},

Abstract = {The world is running out of fresh water to support a growing population.
   Aquifers around the world on which whole communities depend are being
   depleted at a rapid rate. Apart from exploring new technologies to make
   more fresh water available, conservation efforts need to be stepped
   up-starting with awareness. Lack of awareness can seriously hamper water
   conservation efforts-take the example of Cape Town South Africa. The
   city is currently battling a severe water crisis that has put Cape Town
   on a road to a day, when the taps will literally run dry-{''} day
   zero{''}. The city stepped up efforts to create awareness of the
   increasingly dire situation through various channels. So why as of
   January 2018 with `` day zero{''} two months away, has 60\% of the
   city's population still not adjusted their usage? The study of water
   consumption is an active field that has produced concepts like virtual
   water, water footprint and water accounting which all can help to
   provide a deeper understanding amongst users regarding the impact of
   their usage. Technology creates a potential opportunity to collect and
   present usage data in such a way as to influence user behaviour to
   favour a sustainable approach.},

Journal = {CONTEMPORARY SECURITY POLICY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {39},

Pages = {234-257},
Abstract = {Recent tensions between Russia and the United States have sparked debate
   over the value of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). One
   controversy surrounds the extent to which NATO raises the risk of war
   through entrapment-a concept that scholars invoke to describe how states
   might drag their allies into undesirable military conflicts. Yet
   scholars have advanced different, even conflicting arguments about how
   entrapment risks arise. I offer a typology that distinguishes between
   the mechanisms through which entrapment risks allegedly emerge on the
   basis of their institutional, systemic, reputational, and transnational
   ideological sources. I use the 2008 Russo-Georgian War to illustrate how
   the purported mechanisms of entrapment fare in elucidating that
   conflict. In analyzing why entrapment risks emerge, and thinking
   counterfactually about The 2008 War, I argue that scholars need to
   disentangle the various mechanisms that drive both alliance formation
   and war to make sure that entrapment risks do indeed exist.},

Abstract = {The rise of right-wing populism (RWP) poses a challenge for the climate
   agenda, as leaders and supporters tend to be climate sceptics and
   hostile to policy prescribing action on climate change. However, there
   is a surprising dearth of research that investigates the nature and
   causes of this association. Two kinds of explanation are considered,
   drawing on the literature on populism. One is termed structuralist',
   drawing on accounts of the roots of populism in economic and political
   marginalisation amongst those left behind' by globalisation and
   technological change. A second focuses on the ideological content of
   RWP, especially its antagonism between the people' and a cosmopolitan
   elite, with climate change and policy occupying a symbolic place in this
   contrast. It is argued that there are limits to the structuralist
   approach, and that an ideologically based explanation is more
   compelling. An agenda for future research on RWP and climate science and
   policy is proposed.},

Title = {Regionalization with Europeanization? The rescaling of interest groups
   in multi-level systems},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF EUROPEAN PUBLIC POLICY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {25},
Number = {5},
Pages = {764-786},
Abstract = {The European integration literature reveals differentiated patterns of
   Europeanization. Meanwhile, the territorial politics literature has
   highlighted the emergence of regions with regionalism' due to ongoing
   decentralization reforms. If decentralization encourages the spatial
   rescaling of policy communities, does it also affect the Europeanization
   of a region's interest groups? To answer this question, we analyse 18
   regional interest groups in three regions in Spain, Italy and the United
   Kingdom. We find some evidence that interest groups operating in the
   context of more highly decentralized regions will Europeanize to a
   greater extent than those which do not. We call this slipstream
   Europeanization' as it is driven by functional and mimetic logics caused
   by (1) the regional government's own Europeanization, and (2) its
   knock-on effect on domestic mediating factors. The results are
   comparable across different dimensions of Europeanization and different
   group-types. Overall, this exploratory study illustrates how
   regionalization and Europeanization processes interact at different
   territorial scales.},

Abstract = {For the very first time in EU history, the 2014 EP elections provided
   citizens with the opportunity to influence the nomination of the
   Commission President by casting a vote for the main Europarties' lead
   candidates'. By subjecting the position of the Commission President to
   an open political contest, many experts have formulated the expectation
   that heightened political competition would strengthen the weak
   electoral connection between EU citizens and EU legislators, which some
   consider a root cause for the EU's lack of public support. In
   particular, this contest was on display in the so-called Eurovision
   Debate', a televised debate between the main contenders for the
   Commission President broadcasted live across Europe. Drawing on a
   quasi-experimental study conducted in 24 EU countries, we find that
   debate exposure led to increased cognitive and political involvement and
   EU support among young citizens. Unfortunately, the debate has only
   reached a very small audience.},

Abstract = {Numerous West European democracies are witnessing unprecedented levels
   of electoral support for the populist radical right parties. By focusing
   on four such parties in Austria, Denmark, Germany, and the Netherlands,
   we demonstrate that the issue of immigration is at the core of their
   populist appeal. We argue that these countries' electorates already came
   to be politically divided over immigration to the extent that one could
   talk about the emergence of a new cleavage-ethnic vs. civic citizenship.
   We further posit that immigration, intensified by the unrelenting
   process of globalization, will continue to affect political dynamics of
   the recipient states.},

Abstract = {Understanding the complicated relationship between energy, climate and
   security is vital both to the study of international relations and to
   ensure the continued survival of a world increasingly threatened by
   environmental change. Climate change is largely caused by burning fossil
   fuels for energy, but while discussions on the climate consider the role
   of energy, energy security debates largely overlook climate concerns.
   This article traces the separation between energy and climate through an
   analysis of US energy security discourse and policy. It shows that
   energy security is continually constructed as national security, which
   enables very particular policy choices and prioritises it above climate
   concerns. Thus, in many cases, policies undertaken in the name of energy
   security contribute directly to climate insecurity. The article argues
   that the failure to consider securing the climate as inherently linked
   to energy security is not just problematic, but, given global warming,
   potentially harmful. Consequently, any approach to dealing with climate
   change has to begin by rethinking energy security and security more
   broadly, as national (energy) security politics no longer provides
   security in any meaningful sense.},

Abstract = {This article contributes to the debate on liminality within
   International Relations (IR) theory by focusing on the actorness of the
   European Union (EU) and Hamas. The concept of liminality as a
   transitional process is applied to frame the situation of both the EU
   and Hamas as political actors in-between socially established
   categories. This article explores how the liminal identity of these two
   actors impacts, on the one hand, their relations with each other and, on
   the other hand, their relations of `self'. Exploring the procedural
   relations of the EU and Hamas, it argues for the necessity of
   recognising liminal categories in IR theory and practice, while, at the
   same time, it highlights the limits of such in-between categories in a
   world order still structured around the state.},

Abstract = {Even though the issue of protection of cultural property in the event of
   armed conflict has been stressing during last years in the matter of
   frequency and significancy, the substantive debate related to values of
   cultural property and motivations of actors causing that kind of
   destruction is absent. The article is based on literature review and on
   the international law codifications focused on answering the question
   what motivations of actors cause that kind of destruction? Revealed
   motivations are understood as theoretical explanations for this
   destruction verificated by five case studies.},

Title = {Military Service as Bargaining: The Case of Religious Women Soldiers in
   Israel},
Journal = {POLITICS RELIGION \& IDEOLOGY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {19},
Number = {2},
Pages = {158-175},
Abstract = {While religious women have always served in the Israel Defense Forces
   (IDF) as part of universal conscription, the Chief Rabbinate still
   opposes military service for women in general, and religious women in
   particular. In the twenty-first century, approximately 20\% of religious
   women graduates of the religious high school system in Israel enlist.
   They remain a part of their social group despite social disapproval.
   Interestingly, after many years of ignoring the subject almost
   completely within the majority of Israel's Jewish orthodox community,
   recently, there is a palatable change. Rabbis and public figures within
   the religious community have spoken more clearly about women's
   conscription and are no longer pretending that the issue does not exist.
   While religious women soldiers are still far from the norm, they are no
   longer the anathema they once were. The present paper will discuss this
   change and try to examine it as a process of bargaining, with religious
   women employing bargaining in non-traditional ways. In its conclusion,
   the article will suggest broader contexts within which these ideas can
   be viewed.},

Title = {Nuclear norms in global governance: A progressive research agenda},
Journal = {CONTEMPORARY SECURITY POLICY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {39},
Number = {3, SI},
Pages = {317-340},
Abstract = {We argue that the framework of norms has generated a progressive
   research agenda in the field of global nuclear politics, providing
   important insights that traditional realist and materialist analyses
   ignore or dismiss. These insights are not on the margins of nuclear
   politics; rather, they answer central questions about nuclear non-use,
   possession, and the nonproliferation regime at large. These findings are
   not a fluke; instead, they stem from the powerful analytical framework
   of norms, which provides complexes of linked propositions about actor
   expectations and behavior in global nuclear politics. This article
   examines three of those propositions: the importance of the logic of
   appropriateness, the role of norm contestation, and the changes brought
   about by norm entrepreneurs. Finally, we identify other norms-related
   ideas that can further illuminate the dire policy crises facing global
   nuclear governance, as well as specific areas of nuclear politics that
   would benefit from norms-related scrutiny.},

Abstract = {The Member States of the European Union (EU) have been engaged in highly
   divisive debates about whether and how to reform the rules for the free
   movement' of EU workers and their access to national welfare states.
   While some countries have argued for new restrictions on EU workers'
   access to welfare benefits, many others have opposed policy change. What
   explains EU Member States' different policy positions on this issue?
   Existing accounts have focused on populist political parties and the
   media. In contrast, this article provides a theoretical institutional
   analysis of how cross-country differences in the regulation of national
   labour markets and welfare states can contribute to divergent national
   policy responses to free movement. We argue and explain how labour
   market and welfare state institutions can affect national policy actors'
   positions on free movement directly, and/or indirectly via inter-actions
   with normative attitudes and the characteristics of EU labour
   immigration.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF STRATEGIC STUDIES},

Volume = {41},
Number = {1-2},
Pages = {6-32},
Abstract = {This article examines the transitory nature of cyberweapons. Shedding
   light on this highly understudied facet is important both for grasping
   how cyberspace affects international security and policymakers' efforts
   to make accurate decisions regarding the deployment of cyberweapons.
   First, laying out the life cycle of a cyberweapon, I argue that these
   offensive capabilities are both different in `degree' and in `kind'
   compared with other regarding their temporary ability to cause harm or
   damage. Second, I develop six propositions which indicate that not only
   technical features, inherent to the different types of cyber
   capabilities - that is, the type of exploited vulnerability, access and
   payload - but also offender and defender characteristics explain
   differences in transitoriness between cyberweapons. Finally, drawing out
   the implications, I reveal that the transitory nature of cyberweapons
   benefits great powers, changes the incentive structure for offensive
   cyber cooperation and induces a different funding structure for
   (military) cyber programs compared with conventional weapon programs. I
   also note that the time-dependent dynamic underlying cyberweapons
   potentially explains the limited deployment of cyberweapons compared to
   espionage capabilities.},

   what role for the EU in its pursuit of strategic autonomy?},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF EUROPEAN INTEGRATION},

Volume = {40},

Pages = {605-620},
Abstract = {Transatlantic security cooperation entered a new era after the 9/11
   attacks in America, the launch of EU crisis management/security
   assistance operations, and the release of the European Security Strategy
   (ESS) in 2003. Since then, years of practical experience have inspired
   the EU to enhance its ambitions in this realm by developing a
   Cybersecurity Strategy, a Maritime Security Strategy, and most recently,
   the 2016 EU Global Strategy (EUGS). As these efforts respect NATO's
   primary role in European defence, there is more scope for practical
   EU-US collaboration regarding crisis management and security assistance
   operations. However, although there have been some clear successes here,
   the EU is also increasingly willing to forge its own path in this realm
   and possibly diverge with US priorities. This article evaluates the
   recent record of, and prospects for, EU-US security collaboration
   regarding various problems mentioned as strategic priorities in the ESS,
   EUGS, and related documents.},

   between liberalism and Islam. It analyzes three general approaches to
   negotiating those tensions, and it outlines a fourth model that improves
   upon existing frameworks. The new model calls for a transformative
   approach, one that acknowledges and incorporates changes to liberal

Abstract = {Since the failed coup of 15 July 2016, for which it is held responsible,
   the Gulen Movement (GM) has been in crisis. With no foreseeable future
   in its homeland, the GM is now tasked with regrouping abroad. This
   article investigates the GM in London, a city that, for various reasons,
   is likely to become a significant centre for Gulenist activity in the
   post-coup era. Taking the Dialogue Society (DS) as its focus, it
   investigates the prospects of the GM's survival by analyzing its
   activities, both before and after the coup, in light of Mamdani's
   discussion of `good' and `bad' Muslims in the post-9/11 world. The
   article shows how the GM has established itself as a voice of `good'
   Islam in the context of British debates on Islam and radicalization. It
   suggests that the public presence the GM has established for itself
   through its public engagement activities in the UK could constitute a
   central part of its fight back against President Erdogan, and be
   catalytic to its creation of a dynamic future in exile.},

Abstract = {The paper offers a first-time investigation of populism at the mass
   level in Greece. Its objectives are to examine the socio-economic
   factors which facilitate the adoption of populist world views and to
   identify the ideological correlates of populism. Findings reveal that
   the strongest socio-economic predictors are (low levels of) household
   income and education. Populist attitudes are more pronounced among
   left-wing citizens and strongly associated with euroscepticism and
   opposition to economic liberalism. However, the relationship of populism
   with anti-immigrant and anti-democratic attitudes appears to be mediated
   by left-right ideology, thus providing evidence that mass-level populism
   in Greece comes in both left-inclusionary and right-exclusionary
   varieties.},

Number = {155},
Pages = {7-24},
Abstract = {The article considers the historiography of labour and class studies in
   sub-Saharan Africa in relation to the contemporary cultural turn' in
   sociological studies of class. It identifies three phases: from the
   1960s, a highly empiricist Marxist approach which drew on Fanon's notion
   of an aristocracy of labour; from the 1980s, a shift to a stress on
   culture, agency and identity, following E. P. Thompson; the final move
   has focused on the African middle classes, drawing on Pierre Bourdieu's
   theory of consumption. Research on a public sector manual workers' union
   in Botswana exemplifies, the author argues, the Thompsonian approach.},

Abstract = {The Bank of International Settlements (BIS) is known to be the `bank of
   central banks' and a confidential place where central bankers meet to
   discuss policies. However, this contribution shows that it is also far
   more. Economic research and policy-making are closely connected within
   the BIS. Researchers and analysts provide knowledge for financial
   regulation and introduce new approaches to policy-makers who meet within
   the BIS-hosted bodies, such as the Basel Committee of Banking
   Supervision. The Monetary and Economic Department of the BIS operates
   like a think tank in the field of financial policy-making. This is
   exemplified by the introduction of macroprudential regulation, a new
   approach that originated within the BIS. By combining post-structural
   discourse theory with the concept of discourse coalition, this paper
   shows how macroprudential regulation became a frame of reference
   promising to maintain financial stability and how the BIS benefits from
   this.},

Abstract = {In the wake of neoliberal reforms that devastated the country, Mexico
   and the World Bank converged on providing at least two social programs
   in the guise of humanitarian capitalism. Progresa, also known as
   Oportunidades and more recently Prospera, involves a workfare-based cash
   transfer program aimed at enhancing the human capital of future
   generations. The program has been criticized for its exploitation of the
   work of mothers. Seguro Popular involves extending basic health care to
   those employed in the informal economy. Both, with all their weaknesses
   and exploitative aspects, serve the function of providing skills and
   enhanced health status to the subproletariat in the hope that a
   competitive formal economy will expand and employ them; they are also
   intended to mute social protest.},

Abstract = {Given growing awareness for global power shifts' and the
   Western'-centrism of International Relations (IR), this article
   re-conceptualizes the phenomena subsumed under these two labels. By
   understanding global power shifts' and world order' as discursive
   phenomena, the article argues that discourses by fixing particular
   meanings and identities constitute the objects and subjects of which
   they speak. The discourses on Global power shifts' and Post-Western IR'
   are an expression of a hegemonic struggle over meanings and identities,
   resulting from the dislocation of existing meaning-systems and
   identities and enabling new' agents to assert particular representations
   of the world as universal. Drawing on the notion of discursive hegemony,
   developed by Ernesto Laclau and Chantal Mouffe, the article develops an
   analytical framework for conceptualizing the evolution and implications
   of this shift in representational power in the field of IR.},

Pages = {158-176},
Abstract = {This paper examines the rise of public-private partnerships in the
   longitudinal context of China's infrastructure finance system since
   1978. The system has been characterized by the use of alternative
   infrastructure finance, including land transfer fees, various types of
   indirect local government borrowing, and, more recently, the rise of
   public-private partnerships. While contributing significantly to the
   unprecedented infrastructure boom, alternative finance sources also
   raised concerns of fiscal sustainability in China. PPP cannot be an
   effective way to reduce local governments' high reliance on debt
   financing. It is time for the country to develop a more balanced capital
   structure with ongoing funding support to keep up its long-term
   infrastructure development.},

Abstract = {The concurrent strong waves of anti-EU integration and anti-immigration
   preferences sweeping across Europe, capitalized on by populist
   discourses, reflect citizens' economic anxieties brought about by the
   financial crisis, dormant cultural fears, widespread suspicion towards
   international institutions, and frustration with ``politics as
   usual.{''} Extant electoral and public opinion research provide
   fragmented and conflicted accounts about the psychological origins of
   these anti preferences. In this article, (1) we articulate a novel
   overarching theoretical framework that focuses on reaction as a
   political orientation, and (2) we provide an empirical test of the
   propose theory using data from the 2004 and 2014 European Social Survey.
   Explication of political reaction as a driver of political preferences
   can move forward research on challenges to democratic representation,
   particularly political disengagement, violent protests, and populist and
   antiestablishment party vote in the context of the financial crisis.},

Abstract = {Since the 1990s, the un has generated and disseminated a discourse that
   constructs the environment as a threat to international security. Such a
   process of securitization does not, however, have unanimous support
   within this international organization made up of multiple actors with
   different strategies. What are the obstacles to the securitization of
   the environment within the un ? What do they tell us about the
   securitization process ? How can they inform our understanding of the
   relationship between securitization and institutional logics ? This
   article seeks to answer these questions by examining the case of
   environmental securitization within the un. It explores the interactions
   between institutional logics and securitization, analyzing them with
   respect to the barriers encountered in discursive threat construction,
   the dissemination of the security framework, and securitization
   practices.},

Abstract = {In 2010, Kelly Greenhill published her highly acclaimed book Weapons of
   Mass Migration: Forced Displacement, Coercion, and Foreign Policy. In
   this article, I focus on the uses and implications of Greenhill's theory
   and specifically the metaphor Greenhill uses in place of ``coercive
   engineered migration{''}-{''}weapons of mass migration.{''} The metaphor
   unmistakably links refugees to ``weapons of mass destruction.{''} This
   should not be dismissed as just a phrase, considering that metaphors are
   one of the fundamental elements of thinking in international relations.
   Inquiring into the utility of the metaphor, I argue that associating
   refugees with weapons (1) weaponizes the metaphor against refugees, (2)
   frames the problem and possible solutions in a restrictive, securitized
   way that should be questioned, and (3) even undermines one of four
   policy options Greenhill her-self proposes. After highlighting the
   merits of Greenhill's analysis and its embrace among far-right
   ideologues and conspiracy theorists, using Paul Chilton and George
   Lakoff's delineation of three utilities of metaphors in foreign policy,
   I analyze the ``weapons of mass migration{''} metaphor. The article ends
   with a discussion of possible ways to mitigate the metaphor's effects
   and discusses alternative metaphors.},

Abstract = {Developing states furnish the vast majority of UN peacekeeping troops, a
   fact academics and policymakers often attribute (at least partly) to
   developing states' supposed ability to derive a profit from UN
   peacekeeping reimbursements. In this article, we argue that this
   peacekeeping for profit' narrative has been vastly overstated. The
   conditions for significantly profiting from UN peacekeeping are in fact
   highly restrictive, even for developing states. We begin by highlighting
   two potent reasons for re-examining the peacekeeping for profit
   narrative: developing states emerged as the UN's principal troop
   contributors in a period of stagnant reimbursement rates when UN
   peacekeeping was becoming less financially attractive; and the
   quantitative evidence scholars have presented as supporting the
   peacekeeping for profit narrative is flawed. We then identify the scope
   conditions within which peacekeeping for profit provides a plausible
   explanation for a developing state's UN troop contributions. First, the
   deployment and its attendant reimbursements must be significant not only
   in absolute and per-soldier terms but also in relation to the state's
   total armed forces and military expenditure. Second, the state must have
   an exceptional ability, compared with other troop contributors, to
   benefit from UN reimbursements. The scope for generalized profit-making
   from either equipment or personnel contributions is limited by intense
   political pressure against reimbursement rate increases. Individual
   states can nevertheless make a profit if they (1) invest in inexpensive
   and old but functional equipment, especially if deployed with usage
   restrictions, and/or (2) limit the deployment allowances (rather than
   salaries) they pay their peacekeepers. We establish that only a limited
   subset of developing states meets the plausibility conditions for the
   peacekeeping for profit narrative - and many top UN troop contributors
   do not.},

Abstract = {Recent research emphasizes the effectiveness of biased third parties and
   their use of leverage in resolving conflicts. However, scholars fail to
   explore systematically the conditions under which conflict management
   strategies straddle the confines between mediatory techniques and
   approaches more commonly associated with joining behavior. This article
   examines the threshold between neutral conflict management and overt
   joining by offering a model of third-party intervention based on the
   notion of international social proximity and situated within the
   familiar opportunity-willingness framework. Our arguments are tested
   with a novel combination of data on biased joining from Corbetta and
   Dixon and data on neutral mediatory efforts from Frazier and Dixon. Our
   findings reveal that the application of biased leverage and mediation is
   rare but salient, and asymmetrical ties between third parties and
   combatants explain their occurrence.},

Abstract = {The International Committee of the Red Cross has instituted a number of
   changes that seem to transform this old and widely respected
   organization. These changes involve an expanded role, a fuller
   relationship with for-profit corporations, a search for new partners
   beyond the business world, a willingness to use standards in addition to
   international humanitarian law, and new management practices for a
   larger agency with different personnel. This article reviews the nature
   of the changes and evaluates whether they are well considered. The
   conclusion argues: there is indeed much change at the ICRC, complete
   evaluation will take time, and particular attention should be paid to
   two issues: the ICRC's president being on the governing board of the
   World Economic Forum, and whether a humanitarian organization should
   urge others to make money in responding to disasters.},

Abstract = {Lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgendered, and intersex (LGBTI) rights have
   become central to the Western human rights (HR) agenda in Africa.
   Nevertheless, diplomatic responses to violations of LGBTI rights have
   appeared ad hoc and inconsistent. We explore the tools used for the
   promotion of LGBTI rights in Africa and theorize about the costs
   involved in promoting such rights in a resistant environment. We argue
   that engaging publicly in the promotion of LGBTI rights comes with
   significant political costs for Western donors. Consequently, donors
   avoid public criticism in cases in which diplomatic and economic
   leverage are low and pressure is unlikely to yield significant change in
   levels of repression. Our theoretical argument is supported by a
   comparative case study of donor involvement on issues of LGBTI rights in
   Malawi and Zambia. Our findings contribute to a burgeoning literature on
   the place of LGBTI rights promotion on the international HR agenda and
   adds to the understanding of the selective promotion of HR.},

Abstract = {When making decisions under uncertainty, it is important to distinguish
   between the probability that a judgment is true and the confidence
   analysts possess in drawing their conclusions. Yet analysts and
   decision-makers often struggle to define ``confidence{''} in this
   context, and many ways that scholars use this term do not necessarily
   facilitate decision-making under uncertainty. To help resolve this
   confusion, we argue for disaggregating analytic confidence along three
   dimensions: reliability of available evidence, range of reasonable
   opinion, and responsiveness to new information. After explaining how
   these attributes hold different implications for decision-making in
   principle, we present survey experiments examining how analysts and
   decision-makers employ these ideas in practice. Our first experiment
   found that each conception of confidence distinctively influenced
   national security professionals' evaluations of high-stakes decisions.
   Our second experiment showed that inexperienced assessors of uncertainty
   could consistently discriminate among our conceptions of confidence when
   making political forecasts. We focus on national security, where debates
   about defining ``confidence levels{''} have clear practical
   implications. But our theoretical framework generalizes to nearly any
   area of political decision-making, and our empirical results provide
   encouraging evidence that analysts and decision-makers can grasp these
   abstract elements of uncertainty.},

Title = {Street-Level Management: A Clientele-Agent Perspective on Implementation},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION RESEARCH AND THEORY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {28},
Number = {4},
Pages = {551-568},

Abstract = {It is now widely accepted that public policy is not merely about its
   formal wording but rather the ways it is implemented. Implementation
   portrayals are not uniform: some focus on street-level delivery while
   others refer to managerial actions of different administration levels.
   Although varied, current implementation research overlooks the distinct
   position of chief executive officers of street-level organizations, who
   are overarchingly in charge of, and accountable for, the direct delivery
   of multiple policies to a local target population. This study
   distinguishes them as a unique public management category, termed here
   ``street-level management,{''} and explores their contribution drawing
   on interviews with school principals, police station chiefs, and heads
   of social services bureaus (N = 78), as well as on official documents.
   Because street-level managers (SLMs) were found to approach their target
   populations as a collective endowed with contextual characteristics and
   a particular mix of policy preferences and needs, they are redefined as
   ``policy clientele.{''} To convey that policy clientele is the main lens
   through which street-level management is exercised, a
   ``clientele-agent{''} perspective is proposed as complementing
   state-agent and citizen-agent viewpoints on street-level implementation.
   A clientele-agent approach is evidenced in SLMs' ongoing efforts to
   facilitate reciprocal relationships with policy clientele and in four
   street-level managerial functions-translation, adaptation, mobilization,
   and articulation. Uncovering overlooked collective aspects of
   street-level implementation and the involvement of policy clientele in
   direct delivery arrangements, street-level management allows for a more
   nuanced understanding of the interstices between policy making and
   direct delivery.},

Abstract = {The Constitution of Ecuador of 2008 established new rights for migrants,
   among which political rights stand out. This paper begins with a
   theoretical reflection on political transnationalism and state
   anthropology to examine the behavior of the migrant vote in the last
   decade and the profile of Ecuadorians who go to the polls. With data
   from the National Electoral Council and a multisite survey conducted as
   part of this research in several cities around the world during the
   presidential elections of 2017, the text supports the thesis that the
   vote from abroad is a central element for observing the deployment and
   reconfiguration of the transnational State.},

Abstract = {The Syrian conflict has caused a humanitarian catastrophe with 6.1
   million internally displaced persons and more than 5 million refugees.
   Turkey is a key player in the conflict because of its military
   involvement and because it hosts 3.5 million registered Syrian refugees.
   This paper focuses on the humanitarian crisis and seeks to verify the
   relationship between the Turkish international protection system and the
   strategy to manage this crisis, which has been based on two premises: on
   the one hand, the temporary character of the refugees and, on the other
   hand, the provision of services, rather than the recognition of rights.},

Abstract = {Public-private partnerships (PPPs) are interpreted as `hybrid'
   organisations that combine the distinct organising principles of public
   and private sectors. This paper develops a spatial analysis of these
   `hybrid spaces' to understand how they transform the practices and
   identities of professionals and service users. Informed by Foucault's
   `heterotopia' concept, the paper considers how the juxtaposition of
   competing organising principles disrupts established identities, with
   patients recast as `consumer-travellers' and staff as `productive
   professionals'.The tensions between these organising principles,
   manifest in the spatial practices of professionals and patients, create
   opportunities for actors to reflexively contest prescribed practices and
   identities.},

Abstract = {A substantial aspect of scientific research involves linking concepts to
   observations using measurements. This exercise has raised questions
   among researchers of whether or not measurements ``truly{''} and
   ``reliably{''} capture ideas and observations. We address this question
   by setting out a methodological standard on how to assess the validity
   and reliability of measurements. We do this by examining measurements
   that evaluate public policy, arguing that this topic is gaining
   increasing attention from political science researchers and
   policymakers. The analysis concerns measurements of the level of
   transparency and accountability of lobbying laws, central to recent
   regulatory policy research. We conduct convergent validation, content
   validation and reproducibility tests on four indices applied to 13
   regulations found worldwide. By doing so, the article provides scholars
   with an evaluation of measurements of lobbying laws' robustness, while
   offering methodological and theoretical lessons of value to larger
   regulatory and public policy scholarship.},

Abstract = {Whilst much has been written on emergence of new norms in international
   politics, we know significantly less about changes to the ideas and
   assumptions that underpin such norms. Examined at micro-level, most
   norms consist of a set of ideas and assumptions that form the basis of
   what is considered as appropriate, legitimate or even the required thing
   to do. Far from being stable, ideational constitutions of norms can
   undergo significant changes in the course of the norm emergence process.
   Enquiring into such changes is important if we are to move beyond static
   and linear accounts of norm evolution. Using changes in the ideational
   constitution of the responsibility to protect - specifically, the
   de-emphasis of the responsibility to rebuild - as its vantage point, the
   analysis seeks to answer the following question: what drives change in
   ideational constitutions of international norms? The chief argument
   advanced in this article is that misalignments at the level of broader
   normative structures (external misalignments) and within norms (internal
   misalignments) result in changes in the ideational constitutions of
   emerging norms.},

Abstract = {This article explores the relationship between domestic concerns about
   regime survival in Russia and Vladimir Putin's muscular policy toward
   the Ukraine since 2013. After critically examining claims that the
   Ukraine crisis was caused by NATO enlargement, American diplomatic
   weakness or strategic folly, the authors consider the operational code
   construct as an alternative explanation to better explain Putin's
   decision-making. They attempt to show that Putin's intervention in the
   Ukraine was shaped, above all, by the political `rules' of an
   authoritarian regime, which viewed growing links between a significant
   `near abroad' state and the EU as a potentially destabilizing at home.
   Putin's political system assigns a prominent regime maintenance role to
   Russia's intelligence services and is one characterized by widespread
   corruption, stark inequality, the suppression of independent media
   organizations, and the systematic harassment and intimidation of
   political opponents.},

Title = {Mutual and Self Perceptions of Opposing Advocacy Coalitions: Devil Shift

Journal = {REVIEW OF POLICY RESEARCH},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {35},
Number = {5},

Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {In political conflicts, actors tend to assume that opponents behave
   maliciously. This phenomena is part of the ``devil shift,{''} which was
   introduced in advocacy coalition framework research. We present a
   multivariate analysis of the perceptions of motives and actions of
   opposing coalitions in a political conflict and thereby analyze a major
   dimension of the ``devil shift{''} and of its antonym ``angel shift.{''}
   The conflict concerning the German infrastructure project Stuttgart 21
   serves as a case study. We show that the radicalness of policy-specific
   beliefs is the most important predictor for the intensity of mutual
   misperception in the researched conflict. The results further point to a
   more systematic inclusion of an actor's deep normative core beliefs in
   future analyses of distorted perception. Another central finding relates
   to the importance of the personal environment: actors in the subsystem
   share the same policy core beliefs with the majority of people in their
   personal environment.},

Abstract = {This article examines the performance and party system diffusion of
   Euroscepticism of the French Front National (FN) during recent European
   crises. The article argues that Europe's successive crises since 2008
   have been essentially absorbed' by the FN into its existing Eurosceptic
   framework which is guided by its radical right-wing ideology. While
   allowing the FN to successfully mobilize issues and grievances about the
   European Union (EU), Euroscepticism is, however, significantly impeding
   its strategy of governmental credibility. The article identifies the
   main political outcomes of these crises and finds differences in impact
   between the different EU crises on party competition over Europe. These
   findings provide insight into the relationship between the radical
   Right, Euroscepticism, and party competition. They also inform our
   current knowledge of Euroscepticism in French politics, and changes that
   EU crises have triggered, according to party system location and whether
   FN influence can be postulated.},

Abstract = {Recent literature proliferates with studies examining the `curses' of
   aid, or `aid-dependent' relationships. This latter term, while widely
   used, is surprisingly underdeveloped conceptually and has generally been
   understood as some nebulous `large' threshold of aid. To conceptualise
   the term more concretely, this paper draws on the welfare dependence
   literature to suggest a complementary understanding of aid dependence
   based on aid persistence, specifically the duration of non-declining aid
   receipt. The paper finds evidence that this aid dependence is associated
   with negative macroeconomic performance, suggesting that more useful
   understandings of aid dependence may be predicated as much on the
   duration, as the quantity, of aid receipt.},

Abstract = {At the heart of political organization, we find weak and atomized
   individuals who aggregate their power to challenge concentrated power.
   Wine politics show us that within market economies we find the same
   political movements. Markets, like politics, consist of institutions
   that differentially embed, codify and distribute power. In the case of
   France, small, individually weak wine producers became powerful in the
   aggregate; unified French grape growers came together to force a deal
   with the economically dominant wine merchants. Their joint political
   power was institutionalized in power-sharing, state-backed corporatist
   producer organizations. In contrast, small Italian producers failed to
   cooperate systematically and aggregate their power. Stronger
   organization enabled the construction of an institutional comparative
   advantage and higher prices for regulated French terroir wines. Economic
   sociologists claim markets are `socially embedded'. This article
   demonstrates markets are `politically embedded': French market dominance
   results from effective power sharing mechanisms across the supply chain.},

   They argue that the basic problem for the slow expansion of this

   unwillingness of local political elites to be subjected to independent
   oversight in their work. This problem can be overcome by adopting a
   separate Law on Local Ombudsmen, which would systemically regulate their
   mandatory status, the procedure they conduct, as well as ensure further
   guarantees of their independence, in particular those of financial

   Change in the European Union},

Abstract = {How are processes of political development structured across space and
   time by preexisting institutions? This article develops a spatiotemporal
   theory of institutional change by analyzing the evolving infrastructural
   power of the European Union's legal order using geospatial methods.
   Specifically, the authors theorize that the pattern and pace of the
   domestic spread of EU law has been shaped by preexisting state
   institutions-particularly by the degree to which national judiciaries
   are hierarchically organized. To assess this claim, the article compares
   patterns of domestic judicial enforcement of EU law across France (a
   unitary state with a centralized judiciary), Italy (a weaker unitary
   state with a centralized judiciary), and Germany (a federal state with a
   decentralized judiciary). Developing a geospatial approach to the study
   of legal integration and historical institutionalism more broadly, the
   authors leverage an original geocoded data set of cases referred to the
   European Court of Justice by national courts to visualize how the
   subnational penetration of Europe's supranational legal order is
   conditioned by state institutions.},

Abstract = {The decolonial discourse of buen vivir in South America has declared the
   need to overcome Eurocentrism by tapping into indigenous knowledge. We
   compare the Bolivian version of this project with the conservative turn
   in Russian politics to demonstrate that they make a structurally
   analogous argument and they both end up with a false promise. The
   fullness of indigenous being that underlies such discourses is a
   Eurocentric, romanticist myth, which contributes to the silencing of the
   subaltern by imposing on them political categories not directly rooted
   in any genuine native experience. We reformulate postcolonial critique
   using Laclau's theory of populism to suggest that subaltern subjectivity
   can only emerge in a bottom-up manner, through the aggregation and
   universalisation of local demands. While it might still be true that the
   subaltern cannot speak, there is no way for the subaltern to come into
   being other than through speaking politically.},

Abstract = {We investigate to what extent local political parties have attention for
   ethnic minority interests. We are interested in whether party-related or
   context-related variables lead to higher levels of attention to ethnic
   minority interests. Our analysis is based on a broad scale survey among
   local party chairs in Belgium. The results show that mainly
   party-related variables explain variance in attention for ethnic
   minority interests: leftist parties and active parties are more likely
   to defend these interests. The presence of ethnic minority people in a
   party does not have a significant effect once we control for factors at
   the municipality level.},

Abstract = {Cross-border commercial activity raises issues in federations where
   multiple jurisdictions can claim the right to tax the same income. In
   the United States, this coordination problem is resolved by splitting
   the tax base according to the geographic distribution of firms' sales,
   capital and labour. The weight of each factor is determined on a
   state-by-state basis, which opens room for competitive legislative
   behaviour. In this complex issue area, however, policymakers must invest
   lot of resources to monitor competitors, evaluate policy alternatives
   and shepherd tax reform through the legislative process. This implies
   that highly professional legislatures should be more responsive to the
   policies of nearby states. We consider data on most American states over
   the period from 1986 to 2013 and find strong evidence of conditional
   spatial dependence. Our findings suggest that policy diffusion may often
   be moderated by institutional and political factors.},

Abstract = {In this paper we are investigating the political and social effects of
   Montenegro joining NATO. This issue is highly controversial and follows
   the political divisions in Montenegro, which motivated us to apply
   social cleavage theory. As method, we applied logistic regression
   clustered for standard error. We found that besides socio-demographic
   variables (ethnic division between Montenegrins and Serbs), the main
   line of the cleavage indicated by support of, or opposition to NATO
   membership falls along the issues of the independence of Montenegro, its
   relationship with the EU vs. Russia, as well as the attitude toward
   political power and party identification. (C) 2018 The Regents of the

Title = {A Century of International Relations Feminism: From World War I Women's
   Peace Pragmatism to the Women, Peace and Security Agenda},

Abstract = {We examine feminism in international relations from the emergence of
   women's peace pragmatism during WWI to the development of the United
   Nations (UN) Women, Peace, and Security (WPS) agenda a century later. We
   argue that feminism did not come late to international relations.
   Rather, international relations came late to feminism. Moreover, we show
   how the principles articulated by women peace activists at the 1915
   Hague Conference represent distinct contributions to the discipline.
   These principles reflect a pragmatic approach derived from women's
   experiences of promoting peace and inclusion. The pragmatism of these
   principles is echoed by, and further developed in, four pillars of the
   WPS agenda-as shaped by advocates of women's rights, working through
   processes of trial and error, to gain state support for advance
   principles of equal and lasting peace. States may have rejected
   discussion of women's rights as an appropriate matter for international
   negotiations in 1915. But with the evolution of women's political rights
   during the twentieth century, it is now possible to advance a feminist
   perspective on international peace and security. By recovering neglected
   aspects of the last century of international relations' feminism, this
   article helps further an alternative, pragmatist perspective on ways of
   knowing and doing international relations.},

Abstract = {Many advocates of interpretive approaches to the study of politics
   emphasize that what is at stake is a conflict between quantitative
   versus qualitative methods. By contrast, we begin by suggesting that
   political scientists are free to use whichever method they find most
   useful for their research purposes. Instead of methodological reasons
   for making the interpretive turn, political scientists have ethical
   reasons for adopting this paradigm. In particular, interpretive
   approaches give political scientists a better account of the nature and
   role of values in human life, a sense for how the historical past is
   ethically relevant, the ability to advance politically engaged
   sociologies, and a deliberative critique of technocracy. Political
   scientists should be free to critically engage, scrutinize, and even
   normatively evaluate human ethical positions.},

Title = {Does Policy Learning Meet the Standards of an Analytical Framework of
   the Policy Process?},

Abstract = {Reference to policy learning is commonplace in the public policy
   literature but the question of whether it qualifies as an analytical
   framework applicable to the policy process has yet to be systematically
   addressed. We therefore appraise learning as analytical framework in
   relation to four standards: assumptions and micro-foundations,
   conceptual apparatus, observable implications, normative applications.
   We find that policy learning meets the four standards, although its
   theoretical leverage varies across them. Since we are not aware of
   theories of the policy process that meet all of these standards all the
   time, we conclude that policy learning fares reasonably well and it's
   worth investing intellectual resources in this field.
   Resumen
   El aprendizaje politico cumple con los estandares de un marco analitico
   en el proceso politico?La referencia al aprendizaje politico es comun en
   la literatura de la politica publica, pero el interrogante de si esto
   califica como un marco analitico que se puede aplicar al proceso
   politico todavia tiene que ser sistematicamente abordado. Entonces
   evaluamos el aprendizaje como un marco analitico en relacion con cuatro
   estandares: las suposiciones y las micro fundaciones; los aparatos
   conceptuales; las implicaciones observables; las aplicaciones
   normativas. Hallamos que el aprendizaje politico cumple con los cuatro
   estandares, pero su ventaja teorica varia entre ellos. Ya que no estamos
   conscientes de teorias del proceso politico que cumplan con todos estos
   estandares todo el tiempo, concluimos que el aprendizaje politico se
   defiende razonablemente bien y tiene valor de inversion y recursos de
   inteligencia en este campo.},

Journal = {POLITICS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {38},
Number = {2},
Pages = {165-181},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {This article provides a historical materialist critique and response to
   Bob Jessop's Strategic-Relational-Approach (SRA) to the structure-agency
   debate. The critique is developed in four steps and four class-based
   solutions are given. First, the SRA provides no ontological entry-point
   to account for historically specific relations of power, while the
   researcher inescapably finds herself within them (e.g. class relations).
   Second, the SRA provides no method of articulation' to understand and
   explain why particular disruptive agencies exist within the
   structure-agency dialectic. Instead, Gramsci's philosophy of praxis'
   locates the researcher as a potential organic intellectual' in the
   confrontation and transcendence of class relations. Third, for the SRA,
   power is meaningless because agency can always be redefined' so that it
   is explained through structural determinations. In politicising power
   through historical materialism, this article provides a concrete
   emancipatory operationalisation of Jessop's dialectical ontology.
   Fourth, when studying uneven historical change, adopting a partisan
   approach may well suggest focusing on contingent action instead of
   structural necessities. Therefore, acknowledging the politics of power'
   may well be social scientists' first step when contrasting historical
   change with their own political views.},

Abstract = {Militant democracy relies on the idea that democracies ought to defend
   themselves from anti-democratic forces by constitutionalising repressive
   measures. We offer a criticism of this view by highlighting the
   exclusionary elitism on which militant democracy is built. In doing
   this, we consider two competing models of democratic self-defence: the
   procedural and the social. We suggest that the procedural model, while
   avoiding the exclusionary and other pitfalls of militant democracy, is
   detached from socio-political realities and fails to offer a
   comprehensive vision of democratic stability. The largely neglected
   social model of democratic self defence avoids this problem; it combines
   proceduralism's commitment to dissensus with a social-democratic logic
   in the design of democratic constitutions. We argue in favour of such a
   social democratic self-defence and further develop this model around the
   guiding principle of political and social non-domination.},

Abstract = {This article explores the impact of decentralisation on countries'
   fiscal outcomes paying attention to one aspect usually neglected in the
   literature: the relevance of local politics, proxied by party system
   nationalisation. Based on a wide sample of developed and developing
   countries over the period 1970-2011, our findings are threefold. First,
   both fiscal and political decentralisations have a virtuous effect on
   fiscal performance, improving general government primary balances.
   Second, there is no strong evidence that nationalisation by itself
   enhances national fiscal outcomes. Nevertheless, when fiscal
   decentralisation is coupled with a certain level of nationalisation, the
   former improves government fiscal balances. However, when
   nationalisation of party systems is extremely weak, all the disciplining
   effects of decentralisation tend to disappear.},

Abstract = {Since the adoption in 2000 of the landmark Security Council Resolution
   1325 a significant body of research has emerged analysing the importance
   of women's participation in peace negotiations. Participation'
   represents one of the core pillars of the Women Peace and Security
   Agenda (WPS) adopted by the Security Council to redress the exclusion of
   women from the realm of peace and security. This work has highlighted
   the benefits of including women and has highlighted the different roles
   that women play within peacebuilding. However it has largely overlooked
   the specific category of women in the role of mediator. This is despite
   clear policy commitments throughout WPS resolutions adopted by the
   Security Council that call for greater representation of women within
   high-level UN mediation teams. This article seeks to address this gap by
   focusing specifically on the role of mediator, and the relative
   invisibility of women in that particular role within UN mediation
   efforts. The article takes as its starting point existing legal and
   policy frameworks that call for the inclusion of greater number of women
   in mediation roles, and seeks to understand why these goals are not
   being achieved.
   Including more women as mediators is not simply a case of increasing the
   number of women in the role of Envoy but increasing the visibility of
   women at all levels in international mediation teams.},

Abstract = {Increased complexity and density of transnational problems create
   unprecedented challenges and opportunities for contemporary
   international governance. Issue linkage is one institutional arrangement
   through which states address these changing circumstances. In this
   article, we examine the widening scope of the nontrade agenda in
   preferential trade agreements (PTAs). Nontrade issues (NTIs) such as
   human rights, democracy, environment, corruption, and labor standards
   are increasingly linked to PTAs. This issue linkage has important
   implications for understanding changing patterns of international trade,
   including the shift to PTAs and the rise of NTIs. We show that (1)
   states' choices to commit to bilateral or plurilateral versions of
   traditional PTAs and to PTAs with NTIs are highly interdependent, (2)
   states increasingly incorporate NTIs into PTAs, as the associated costs
   of policy change are lowered through earlier agreements, and (3) network
   pressures favor the increasing adoption of bilateral and especially
   plurilateral NTIs over time. Using an original data set on NTIs covering
   522 PTAs and spanning the period 1951 to 2009, we evaluate states'
   motives behind the widening nontrade agenda of trade agreements using
   longitudinal network modeling. We employ multiplex coevolution
   stochastic actor-oriented network models in a novel design to account
   for interdependencies within and across states' decisions. Following a
   descriptive mapping of major NTIs, we evaluate our theoretical
   arguments. Testing against the alternative explanations of power and
   commitment, we find that endogenous cost considerations are the most
   significant factor explaining the inclusion of NTIs into PTAs.},

Abstract = {The most important international human rights norms are legalized or
   codified in international treaty law. Yet pernicious practices at odds
   with these norms endure and sometimes even increase after legalization.
   According to conventional wisdom, this is because agents commit to but
   do not comply with international law and the underlying norms. I develop
   a theory of evasion to explain why norm violations persist even when
   states technically comply with the law. Because legalization transposes
   social norms into international law imperfectly, it creates gaps between
   laws and underlying norms. Because of these norm-law gaps, legality and
   normative appropriateness will diverge. States caught between opposing
   pressures from pro-violation and pro-compliance groups exploit this gap
   through what I call evasionthe intentional minimization of normative
   obligations that technically complies with international law but
   violates underlying norms. I demonstrate the theory's empirical purchase
   in the cases of the French expulsion of Roma immigrants and the Czech
   school segregation of Roma children. Under the cover of technical
   compliance with the law, these states violated the norm of racial
   equality. The argument cautions that the good news about law compliance
   is not necessarily good news about norm compliance, broadens our
   understanding of norm violators' agency, and has practical implications
   for human rights advocacy.},

Title = {Protean Power and Uncertainty: Exploring the Unexpected in World
   Politics},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL STUDIES QUARTERLY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {62},
Number = {1},
Pages = {80-93},

Abstract = {This article introduces the concept of protean power as the basis for a
   better analysis of unanticipated events in world politics. Protean power
   is the effect of actors' agility as they adapt in situations of
   uncertainty. This definition departs from conventional definitions of
   power, which focus on actors' evolving ability to exercise control in
   situations of calculable risk and their consequent ability to cause
   outcomes these actors deem desirable. We argue that this conventional
   view is overly confining; inclusion of protean power in our analytical
   models helps us to better account for unexpected change in world
   politics. Notably, actors respond to shifts between risk and
   uncertainty, in both context and experience, with affirmation, refusal,
   improvisation, or innovation. In doing so, they create room for control
   and protean power as effects, rather than causes, of such practices.
   However, protean power should not replace control power. These two basic
   forms of power relate to one another, in a variety of ways, in complex
   contexts characterized by both risk and uncertainty.},

Abstract = {Rodolfo Stavenhagen's classic Seven Erroneous Theses about Latin America
   seems not only to have endured but to have gained explanatory power in
   relation to a variety of topics in Brazil today: the relationship
   between the middle class (and the elite) and the Southeastern states in
   the last election, the government's options vis-a-vis major projects
   such as Belo Monte, the Workers' Party advocates' rhetoric in defense of
   the growth of the middle class, the disputes over the rights of
   indigenous peoples, and even the discourse of social movement leaders,
   co-opted by the Lula administration. Although the fourth thesis appears
   to have lost its strength, it still substantiates one of the key
   arguments in the textthat internal colonialism is critical for
   understanding Latin America.},

Abstract = {Does violent repression strengthen the state? In this article we explore
   the legacies of repression by the Mexican government on subsequent
   patterns of state consolidation. We investigate how a particular form of
   state repression, forced disappearances of alleged leftist dissidents
   during the Dirty War', had path-dependent consequences for different
   dimensions of state capacity nearly 50 years later. To do so, we rely on
   data gathered from suppressed Mexican human rights reports of forced
   disappearances which, to our knowledge, have not been analyzed by social
   scientists before. Controlling for a rich set of pre-disappearances
   covariates we find that forced disappearances are positively correlated
   with contemporary measures of fiscal, territorial, and bureaucratic
   capacity. However, historical forced disappearances do not help the
   state to provide security, to consolidate its monopoly over the use of
   force, or to provide welfare-related public goods in the long run.
   Moreover, disappearances are negatively correlated with various measures
   of trust in the government. Forced disappearances committed by the state
   appear to have long-term yet heterogeneous effects on state
   consolidation.},

Abstract = {In line with psychological and economic discrimination theories,
   street-level bureaucracy studies show a direct effect of citizen
   characteristics on officials' judgements, or show how street-level
   bureaucrats employ stereotypical reasoning in making decisions. Relying
   on sociological double standards theory, this study hypothesizes that
   citizen-clients' status characteristics influence officials' evaluations
   not only directly, but also indirectly and more pervasively by
   influencing the interpretation of other signals. By means of a
   policy-capturing study among Dutch frontline tax officials, this study
   takes a first step in testing double standards propositions in the
   context of official-citizen encounters. The findings support only some
   hypotheses, but indicate that citizen-clients' level of education could
   serve as a moderating context affecting the interpretation of cues. The
   article provides important theoretical and methodological guidelines for
   future research on stereotyping at the front line.},

Volume = {62},
Number = {1},
Pages = {54-68},

Abstract = {This note analyzes the effectiveness of leadership targeting in
   deterring militant operations. It broadens how we think about their
   deterrence effects by including nontargeted groups. I argue that
   leadership decapitation of one group signals to other would-be
   aggressors a state's capability and determination to deploy such actions
   against them. Nontargeted groups are thus forced to recalculate the
   cost-benefit balance of conducting further attacks, which leads to
   indirect deterrence. Using the Global Terrorism Database from 1970 to
   2008 and Price's (2012) leadership decapitation data, targeted capturing
   is found to deter operations by nontargeted groups, and this effect is
   magnified when those militants form an alliance. While targeted killing
   is frequently executed through drone strikes, incurring lower costs and
   risk for the state, the findings indicate that killing a leader does not
   reduce militant operations. Policymakers should recognize the unintended
   effect deriving from one leadership decapitation and transform it into
   an intended outcome to maximize their expected payoffs.},

Abstract = {Scholars of mobilisation and policy influence employ two quite different
   approaches to mapping interest group systems. Those interested in
   research questions on mobilisation typically rely on a bottom-up mapping
   strategy in order to characterise the total size and composition of
   interest group communities. Researchers with an interest in policy
   influence usually rely on a top-down strategy in which the mapping of
   politically active organisations depends on samples of specific
   policies. But some scholars also use top-down data gathered for other
   research questions on mobilisation (and vice versa). However, it is
   currently unclear how valid such large-N data for different types of
   research questions are. We illustrate our argument by addressing these
   questions using unique data sets drawn from the INTEREURO project on
   lobbying in the European Union and the European Union's Transparency
   Register. Our findings suggest that top-down and bottom-up mapping
   strategies lead to profoundly different maps of interest group
   communities.},

Abstract = {In intense forms of public consultations, select groups of citizens,
   called mini-publics, are given a large amount of information and then
   asked to deliberate on policy directions and make recommendations.
   Government officials may refuse to act upon these recommendations,
   unless they are convinced that the recommendations have wider support in
   the populace. This article presents the results of two survey-based
   experiments that assess the impact of mini-publics on the opinions
   expressed by random digit dialing samples of the general public. The
   survey-based experiments were conducted in 2013 (n=400) and in 2014
   (n=400). Being informed about the mini-publics affected support for some
   policies, but not others. In both studies, respondents who were informed
   about the mini-publics reported higher levels of political efficacy
   compared to the condition where respondents were not informed about the
   mini-public. Hearing about these mini-publics helps to generate a sense
   of legitimacy in the political system.},

Abstract = {Research on the dispositional origins of political preferences is
   flourishing, and the primary conclusion drawn from this work is that
   stronger needs for security and certainty attract people to a
   broad-based politically conservative ideology. Though this literature
   covers much ground, most integrative assessments of it have paid
   insufficient attention to the presence and implications of contingencies
   in the relationship between dispositional attributes and political
   attitudes. In this article, we review research showing that
   relationships between needs for security and certainty and political
   preferences vary considerablysometimes to the point of directional
   shiftson the basis of (1) issue domain and (2) contextual factors
   governing the content and volume of political discourse individuals are
   exposed to. On the basis of this evidence, we argue that relationships
   between dispositional attributes and political preferences vary in the
   extent to which they reflect an organic functional resonance between
   dispositions and preferences or identity-expressive motivation to adopt
   a political attitude merely because it is discursively packaged with
   other need-congruent attitudes. We contend that such a distinction is
   critical to gaining a realistic understanding of the origins and nature
   of ideological belief systems, and we consequently recommend an
   increased focus on issue-based and contextual variation in relationships
   between dispositions and political preferences.},

Abstract = {The consequences of marginalized ethnic group emancipation for
   historically privileged groups are rarely examined, despite assertions
   that the disruption of traditional power balances leads to backlash.
   This article addresses identity change in a most probable case' of
   intergroup threat, examining reactions to indigenous empowerment in
   Bolivia. After translating theory on identity change into testable
   implications, it explores meso-level rhetoric of the Santa Cruz Autonomy
   movement through diverse sources and micro-level identification through
   time-series survey data. It finds evidence for the constructionist power
   of discourse: its ability to create societal consensus on collective
   identity in a relatively short time span.},

Abstract = {This study sheds new light on whether responses to public opinion polls,
   namely, preference falsification, can affect the level of election fraud
   by employing Kuran's model of preference falsification, which is
   empirically tested on the data collected from the most recent
   presidential campaign in Russia (2012). My research findings reveal the
   presence of a statistically significant effect of preference
   falsification on election fraud, thus enabling me to conclude that
   preference falsification is, indeed, conducive to election fraud. My
   findings can be generalised to a broad set of electoral autocracies,
   enabling scholars to get a better understanding of the mechanism by
   which survey polls can incentivise officials to commit election fraud.},

Abstract = {Categories are one of the primary ways by which people make sense of
   complex environments. For political environments, parties are especially
   useful categories. By simplifying political life, party categories
   enable people to make sense of politics. A fundamental characteristic of
   party categories is that they minimize perceived differences of members
   within a party (e.g., two Democrats) and maximize perceived differences
   between members of different parties (e.g., a Republican and a
   Democrat). In two-party systems, politicians in leftist parties will
   often be perceived as highly differentiated from politicians in
   right-wing parties. Yet, in multiparty systems there is greater
   complexity and potential for confusion since there are often multiple
   parties on the left and/or right. Spatial models of political
   competition predict that ideologically close neighboring parties will be
   perceived as similar, yet a categorical perspective holds that the
   public will perceive parties on the same side of the ideological divide
   to be dissimilar. In the present article, we review a research program
   investigating how political parties are treated as categories and
   present new data from seven democracies showing that people perceive
   parties to be highly differentiated regardless of where parties are
   located in ideological space.},

Abstract = {This article adopts a party-political' approach to studying legislative
   influence on security policy-making. It argues that legislative
   logrolling constitutes a key mechanism for the government to secure
   votes in parliament while facilitating the opposition to advance its own
   interests, especially when the government requires parliament's consent
   for security policy. The article investigates legislative logrolling in
   the context of weak executives, specifically looking at minority
   coalitions and majority coalitions with ideological and policy
   divergences. Logrolling is critical for these types of governments, as
   their structural and situational weaknesses force them to cooperate with
   opposition parties to maintain parliamentary support. Using the Danish
   and Dutch decisions to participate in the 2003 Iraq War, and Israel's
   2005 decision to unilaterally withdraw from Gaza, this article
   elucidates the ways in which legislative logrolling between the
   governing and opposition parties facilitates security policy-making in
   parliament.},

Abstract = {The concept of intersectional dialogue is developed in the article to
   analyze intersections of power in dialogue, specifically in analyzing
   the relations between the particular and the universal in the
   negotiations surrounding the Universal Declaration of Human Rights
   (UDHR). The drafting of the UDHR is reread to explore how power
   conflicts over values intersected when unique individuals met in
   dialogue characterized by conflicting consensuses rather than hegemonic
   Western domination. The concept of intersectional dialogue helps
   illustrate how people relate to different social affiliations, as power
   relations central to dialogue are not static but change with context,
   setting, and group dynamics.},

Abstract = {Analyzing original data from Latin America and Central and Eastern

   Committee (HRC) of the United Nations (UN) in the configuration of
   states' normative agendas and the roles they seek to play. Focusing on
   the HRC's reporting procedure, the article investigates whether states
   adjust the substantive content of their periodic reports to mimic the
   human rights agenda explicitly set by the HRC through its concluding
   observations reports. The article finds that states take the HRC
   seriously and play the role of good, committed members of the human
   rights regime, following in their periodic reports the agenda of rights
   previously set by the HRC. The article, therefore, offers a specific
   theoretical argument and systematic, original evidence on the potential
   and the limits of the influence of the organs of the international human
   rights regime.},

Abstract = {By 2013 the Gulen movement had opened over 100 schools in 50-odd
   countries across Africa. In so doing, it relied on collaboration with
   the AKP government, with each benefiting from the other's support. But
   this strategic alliance came to an end, and the crisis became
   international, when conflict flared up between the two in December 2013,
   especially in the wake of the failed coup of 15 July 2016, attributed by
   the AKP-government to what it calls the `Fethullahci Teror orgutu'. The
   Turkish government has sought to expand its repression of the Gulen
   movement to Sub-Saharan Africa. Countries that are politically weakest
   and most dependent economically are, I suggest, more likely to follow
   Turkey's recommendations. The Gulen schools in Africa were supposed to
   be taken over by a Turkish semi-public agency, the Maarif Foundation.
   One country that agreed to close the schools was Senegal, which I take
   as a case-study, arguing that transnational social movements based on
   secrecy and informality-while more exposed to the spread of
   repression-are also better suited to local re-appropriation and
   reconfiguration.},

   UK Devolution and the EU},
Journal = {ETHNOPOLITICS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {17},
Number = {3, SI},
Pages = {263-275},
Abstract = {The 20th anniversary of the signing of the Belfast Agreement comes at a
   time of great discord, both within Northern Ireland (where, at the time
   of writing, the power-sharing executive is suspended) and between the UK
   and the EU (where March 2019 is the date set for Brexit). Given the
   close political and economic relationships between Ireland and the UK,
   and the need for both states to ensure sustained prosperity within
   Northern Ireland to assist the maintenance of peace, any evaluation of
   the Agreement needs to be placed in the wider context of the island of
   Ireland and Britain and not just focused on Northern Ireland. The main
   economic aspects of the Agreement are summarised, as well as the
   historical background to island economic strategy and the operation of
   the Agreement itself, the disruptive role played by Brexit is assessed
   and some suggestions are made about what might be needed to deal with
   its outcome.},

Journal = {CONTEMPORARY SECURITY POLICY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {39},

Abstract = {Some U.S. military leaders have asserted that the United States, Japan,
   Australia, and India and the Republic of Korea are developing
   multilateral defense cooperation to deter aggression and uphold norms
   much like North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) has in Europe,
   Frequent military exercises and China's threats to freedom of navigation
   (FoN) and North Korea's nuclear missiles comprise the motive force for
   such cooperation. However, cooperation thus far has been trilateral and
   minimal, given divergent national interests and dispersed geopolitical
   locations. Cooperation among Japan, Republic of Korea (ROK), and the
   United States is increasing given the threat, but ROK's public opinion
   is divided about Japan. Australia, Japan, and India have increased
   cooperation with the United States but are reluctant to conduct FoN
   operations with the United States to challenge China's expansionism in
   the South China Sea. If China becomes more aggressive and blocks FoN or
   seizes territory, development toward an Asian NATO is possible.},

Abstract = {In 1972 ``The Troubles{''} continued as Bloody Sunday and Bloody Friday
   led to anti-British riots in Ireland. The Red Army Faction detonated
   bombs in Germany. African American Congresswoman Shirley Chisholm ran
   for President. Nixon took his goodwill tour of China and signed the
   first Strategic Arms Limitation Treaty. Military operations continued in
   Vietnam; Kissinger visited South Vietnam and said, ``Peace is at
   hand.{''} Jane Fonda toured North Vietnam and a photo of a Vietnamese
   boy burned with napalm running down the street became well-known and
   earned the photographer a Pulitzer Prize. At the Olympic Games in
   Munich, eleven members of the Israeli team were taken hostage and
   ultimately killed by Palestinians in what came to be known as the Munich
   Massacre. Congress voted to send the Equal Rights Amendment to the
   states for ratification. Financial derivatives were first sold on the
   Chicago Mercantile Exchange. The Godfather premiered. Comedian George
   Carlin was arrested for obscenity. Bobby Fischer defeated Boris Spassky
   to become world chess champion. In early June, arrests were made for the
   Watergate break-in that would eventually lead to Nixon's downfall.},

Abstract = {Democracy is generally beneficial for human rights whereas coercive
   capacity increases government repression. Using data for 161 countries
   between 1975 and 2010, I consider how different aspects of democracy
   interact with the size and scope of a country's military apparatus to
   shape respect for bodily-integrity rights. Does democracy ameliorate the
   negative effects of coercive capacity? Or, does a strong military
   overpower the positive impact of democracy? Multivariate analyses
   suggest that high levels of democracy neutralize the effect of coercive
   capacity on bodily-integrity violations. At the same time, high levels
   of coercive capacity increase human rights abuses even in the most
   democratic regimes, at least when different aspects of
   democracyexecutive constraints, competitive elections, and media
   freedomare evaluated in isolation. Regimes that combine respect for
   media freedom with constraints on executive authority or competitive
   elections are able to harness coercive capacity for protective purposes.},

Title = {Nine lives of uncertainty in decision-making: strategies for dealing
   with uncertainty in environmental governance},
Journal = {POLICY AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {37},
Number = {4, SI},
Pages = {441-458},
Abstract = {Governing complex environmental issues involves intensive interaction
   between public and private actors. These governance processes are
   fraught with uncertainties about, for example, the current state of
   environmental affairs, the relevant set of decision alternatives, the
   reactions of other actors to proposed solutions or the future
   developments likely to affect an issue. Uncertainty comes in different
   shapes and sizes and different strands in the literature, which has
   placed emphasis either on the substance of the issue (e.g. in
   environmental sciences) or on the decision-making process (e.g. policy
   sciences). In this paper, we bring together these different strands of
   literature on uncertainty to present a novel analytical framework. We
   build on the argument that the nature of uncertainty consists of three
   types: epistemic uncertainty (involving the lack of knowledge about a
   particular system), ontological uncertainty (irreducible
   unpredictability due to inherently complex system behavior) and
   ambiguity (conflicts between fundamentally different frames about the
   issue at hand). Scholars have also argued the importance of
   differentiating between three different objects of uncertainty:
   substantive uncertainty (uncertainty about the content of decisions or
   policy issues), strategic uncertainty (uncertainty about the actions of
   other actors in the strategic game of decision-making) and institutional
   uncertainty (uncertainty about the rules of the game in
   decision-making). The framework is useful for analyzing and addressing
   the nine lives of uncertainty in decision-making. Better understanding
   of the range of uncertainties is crucial to design more robust policies
   and governance arrangements and to deal with wicked environmental
   problems.},

Abstract = {This article focuses on the social dynamics of the Gulen Movement in
   Brazil, showing how participants negotiate their mission of hizmet in
   the changing circumstances after the 15 July coup. In Brazil, as in
   other countries in South America, community building and social action
   carried out by followers of Fethullah Gulen have been enabled by what I
   call `pious creativity', an `agentival capacity' for engaging in
   alternative forms of action. This creative capacity is a disposition
   embodied through the enactment of hizmet, which I define as a set of
   religious practices and morally invested worldly activities that shape
   moral subjects according to Gulen's ideals. The Islamic norms framed by
   their religious leader allow pious subjects to inhabit a morally
   grounded space to experience the world. Loss and suffering have been
   interpreted by followers as proof of their righteousness, reinforcing
   rather than undermining their sense of duty and belonging; financial
   difficulties have encouraged creativity in activism, extending
   materially and symbolically their connections within the host society.
   While there is a growing tendency to stay in Brazil, many may leave to
   other places through the space of hicret.},

Abstract = {Why has the European Union's (EU's) promotion of rule of law (RoL)
   triggered different and largely surface-thin reforms across countries
   subject to a similar frame of enlargement in the Western Balkans (WB)?
   We hypothesize that the domestic (non-)enforcement of EU-promoted rules
   depends on the mobilization of politically autonomous constituencies of
   change - organized advocacy groups and autonomous state institutions -
   which enable democratic accountability. The empirical investigation
   focuses on the prosecution of political corruption as empirical foci to
   assessing the travails of EU-promoted rules in the domestic context.
   Specifically, we trace the role of (1) EU's RoL promotion strategy, (2)
   political resistance and (3) domestic accountability in explaining
   different records of prosecution of political corruption in Albania and
   Croatia.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF EUROPEAN PUBLIC POLICY},

Number = {6},
Pages = {944-958},
Abstract = {Families and policies both are main vehicles of intergenerational
   transfers. Working-age people are net contributors; children and older
   persons net beneficiaries. However, there is an asymmetry in
   socialization. Working-age people pay taxes and social security
   contributions to institutionalize care for older persons as a
   generation, but invest private resources to raise their own children,
   often with large social returns. This results in asymmetric statistical
   visibility. Elderly transfers are near-fully observed in National
   Accounts; those to children much less. Analysing ten European societies,
   we employ National Transfer Accounts to include public and private
   transfers, and National Time Transfer Accounts to value unpaid household
   labour. All three transfer channels combined, children receive more than
   twice as many per-capita resources as older persons. Europe is a
   continent of elderly-oriented welfare states and strongly child-oriented
   parents. Since children are ever-scarcer public goods in aging
   societies, why has investment in them not been socialized more?},

Abstract = {Pumla Gobodo-Madikizela argues that much of what happens in dialogue
   encounters between victims and perpetrators remains implicit. She
   contends that the word `forgiveness,' which is used by victims
   themselves to describe their change of heart toward perpetrators, falls
   short of adequately capturing the complex and multi-layered process that
   unfolds when victims-and perpetrators-experience a change of heart
   toward each other. Taking a relational and intersubjective perspective,
   she argues that empathy is at the heart of the shifts that unfold in the
   victim-perpetrator dialogue, and that the phrase `empathic repair' more
   accurately defines the response that emerges than forgiveness does.
   First-hand experiences and interviews serve to illustrate
   Gobodo-Madikizela's position.},

Journal = {POLICY STUDIES},

Volume = {39},

Pages = {145-164},
Abstract = {This study explored Australian federal level policy instruments which
   influence and impact on women's reproductive choices and the
   consequences of those choices. A systematic policy search and mapping
   exercise was undertaken. Eighteen policy instruments were identified at
   the Federal level and were explored through a policy framework and
   thematic analysis. Findings indicate there are multiple layers of
   influence on women's reproductive choices and the consequences of those
   choices, and the policy instruments interact in multiple dynamic,
   interconnected and contextual ways. Yet, they also lack cohesion and
   congruency, failing to account for women's life circumstances while at
   the same time shifting the promoted position for women in each policy
   instrument. The policy instruments seek to regulate, control and
   selectively support women's reproduction while simultaneously silencing,
   marginalising and reprimanding some groups of women.},

Journal = {REVISTA BRASILEIRA DE POLITICA INTERNACIONAL},

Volume = {61},
Number = {1},
Abstract = {Brazil-European Union relations punch below their weight. Cooperation
   takes place at three levels: relations with European Union (EU) member
   states, Brazil's partnership with Brussels, and EU-MERCOSUR
   negotiations. This multilevel governance contrasts with poor results:
   there is no free trade agreement, development cooperation became
   irrelevant, and international positions rarely converge. The article
   explores the reasons for the underperformance by comparing foreign
   policy shifts in Brazil and the EU, and analyzing multilevel governance
   in selected sectors of cooperation. It is based on four assumptions:
   multilevel relations are uncoordinated, idealist inter-regionalism
   doesn't work, and crisis-driven, liberal realist foreign policies in
   Brazil and the EU facilitate bilateralism.},

Abstract = {The Global Financial Crisis of 2008 and the Great Recession that ensued
   had reverberations that were not only social, political and economic.
   The crises also led to increased doubt in the value and usefulness of
   policy expertise and in its producers. This `epistemic crisis' is the
   starting point of this thematic issue dedicated to think tanks in the
   aftermath of the Global Financial Crisis and Great Recession. The
   Introduction to the issue has four objectives. First, it gives a
   high-level overview of the challenges and opportunities think tanks have
   faced in the wake of these crises, given the paradox of growing demand
   for policy expertise precisely at the moment when such expertise and its
   makers became suspect for many. Second, the Introduction gives an
   overview of the research literature on think tanks and their role in the
   policy-making process and the public debate. Third, the articles
   comprising this thematic issue are introduced, and connections between
   them established. Fourth, the introduction gauges the effects of Global
   Financial Crisis and Great Recession, but also crises more generally, on
   think tanks and the environment they operate in, and speculates about
   the future of the think tank industry.},

   Eurolegalism in action?},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF EUROPEAN PUBLIC POLICY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {25},
Number = {11},
Pages = {1589-1609},
Abstract = {The current article responds to a key puzzle and a question. First, why,
   given the potential for rights talk' that has been seen in other
   countries and other policy areas, have environmental rights in the
   European Union (EU) legal order been relatively invisible until
   recently? And second, with Daniel Kelemen's influential work on
   Eurolegalism arguing that the EU has become much more reliant on United
   States-style adversarial legalism, including a shift towards
   rights-based litigation, do EU environmental rights fit the picture
   Kelemen has painted, or are they an exception? The article explores the
   visibility of EU environmental rights at EU level and then seeks to
   explain the possible reasons for visibility/invisibility.},

   False Propaganda Narratives},
Journal = {STUDIES IN CONFLICT \& TERRORISM},

Pages = {297-318},
Abstract = {As part of their common efforts to undermine public support for their
   militarily-stronger adversaries' war efforts, insurgents and other
   militarily weak actors often accuse governments of fighting in a brutal
   manner and of committing brutal acts such as deliberately targeting
   innocent civilians. While sometimes there is sufficient evidence to
   support this claim of the government's deliberate brutality, other times
   militarily-weak actors will lack sufficient evidence to support this
   allegation. In such situation of lack of evidence, instead of making
   only those minimal allegations which can still be support by existing
   available facts, some weak actors decide nevertheless to make
   unsubstantiated claims and resort to fabricating the necessary evidence.
   This behavior presents a challenge not only for many counterinsurgent
   governments but also for the larger international community (most
   notably by diverting attention away from real atrocities). We identify
   some of the most common evidence-forging techniques recently employed by
   weak actors designed to create the factual basis to support of their
   chosen (often false) narratives of government brutality. The study also
   discusses some implications for international actors to prevent
   rewarding faking of atrocities.},

Abstract = {This article seeks to provide a better understanding of why business
   power varies over time and between firms. It assumes that business
   influence derives from firms' ability to send credible information
   signals about policy costs, causing policy-makers to amend proposals.
   This structural-informational' power is mediated by two factors. First,
   the structure of the policy process enables policy-makers to assess the
   credibility of industry claims through institutional screening
   mechanisms, which vary over time. Second, the influence of individual
   firms is dependent on anticipated policy costs and past reputational
   damage, leading them to pursue different signalling strategies to
   maximize credibility. These claims are illustrated using the case study
   of United Kingdom banking reform between 2010 and 2013.
   Structural-informational power helps to explain why bank ring-fencing'
   reforms were agreed in the face of powerful industry opposition, but
   also why specific banks were subsequently able to extract important
   policy concessions.},

Journal = {POLICY AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {37},
Number = {3},
Pages = {386-404},
Abstract = {This article seeks to explain the differences in outcomes of social
   services reform in Croatia during the previous two decades. While the
   service management reform was based on the principles of effectiveness,
   efficiency and participation in one segment of social services, in the
   other segment, reform was used for the development of partisan patronage
   networks. Using the comparable case strategy, the article focuses on six
   social services and relies on interviews with policy actors and official
   documents to map and explain different reform outcomes. The article
   identifies two factors that led to differences in provision of reformed
   social services and affected the capacity of the patronage-driven
   political executive to use reform as an instrument of politicized
   allocation of public jobs. A sufficiently institutionalized setting in
   which services were provided prior to the reform reduces the ability of
   political parties to integrate political patronage into service
   management. In the case of minimal or non-existent institutional
   setting, the presence of empowered or represented beneficiaries acts as
   the bulwark against political capture.},

Abstract = {Recent criticism of representative liberal democracy has spurred
   democratic experiments involving citizen consultations in deliberative
   forums. However, more research is needed in order to understand the
   conditions necessary to make them work. The aim of this paper is to help
   mitigate this deficiency and at the same time contribute to an informed
   reflection over the specific conditions for deliberative democracy in
   Korea. The study focuses on a unique deliberative process organized in
   order to establish a Charter of Human Rights for Seoul Citizens. Several
   lessons from this democratic experiment are discussed. While the process
   worked surprisingly well, its legitimacy was questioned because of
   controversies over the representativeness of participants and the
   involvement of external stakeholders. Although a complete consensus was
   not reached, initially disrespectful attitudes changed within the
   process to a situation where diverging positions were better
   acknowledged. How ideas of deliberation can be implemented in real-world
   public policy-making is discussed based on these findings.},

Abstract = {Despite its lack of a military, the European Union's (EU's) use of soft
   power is increasingly influential in world affairs. Understanding the
   politics behind setting the EU's foreign aid priorities is a
   substantively important question. Applying a combination of factor
   analysis and time-series cross-sectional analysis of foreign aid
   received by 151 countries between 1981 and 2011, we examine the factors
   associated with EU foreign aid disbursement. We find that far from being
   a tool of the larger member states, EU foreign aid policy is most
   similar to the foreign aid policies of the smaller Nordic members,
   Ireland and the Netherlands. Moreover, we find that measures of the
   human rights records of potential recipients significantly predict the
   amount of aid the EU disburses to those countries. Our findings shed
   light on the sources of EU foreign policy actions as well as on the
   politics within the EU.},

Title = {Framing trans-border energy transportation: the case of Keystone XL},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL POLITICS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {27},
Number = {4},
Pages = {666-685},
Abstract = {Increasing discussion over the safety of natural resource extraction and
   transportation to facilitate international energy needs has given rise
   to controversy over the prospect of large quantities of bitumen and
   crude oil flowing through trans-national pipelines. This debate,
   incorporating the voices of industry, government and advocacy groups,
   has gained traction in the news media, alternately framed as an
   environmental, economic, trade, human rights or public safety concern.
   It is possible, however, that such coverage may vary substantially with
   regional interests and perceptions of costs and benefits, locally or
   nationally. To uncover how the framing of energy transportation varies
   with proximity considerations, regional and national media coverage in
   Canada and the United States of the Keystone XL pipeline from 2010 to
   2014 is analyzed. National and local papers frame the pipeline according
   to different considerations, as do cities near to and distant from the
   pipeline route.},

Abstract = {The article focuses on the new anti-neoliberal social movements in
   post-Socialist Serbia, most notably the Belgrade movement ``We Won't Let
   Belgrade D(r) own{''}. It does this by proposing an analytical framework
   for analysing the way they deploy their critique of what the authors
   term ``neoliberal instrumentalism{''}, a discourse of justification that
   legitimises the curtailing of democracy in the name of economic
   efficiency. The article also addresses Igor Stiks's ``disaggregation
   thesis{''} and suggests that, rather than being a ``failure{''}, the
   disaggregation of the movements such as ``We Won't Let Belgrade D(r)
   own{''} at the initial stage of their development can be an advantage
   for mobilising specific segments of the population.},

Title = {`Market justice' in China and Russia},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CHINESE GOVERNANCE},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {3},
Number = {3, SI},
Pages = {307-330},
Abstract = {Market justice is an important concept in neoliberal discourses
   legitimating unequal distribution of welfare within societies. This
   article explores the question of how useful it is for understanding
   distributive justice attitudes in Russia and China. It is based on a
   comparative literature review and an analysis of focus group discussions
   carried out in most provincial cities in both countries in 2012 and
   2013. The literature review shows that Russia is closer to a neoliberal
   state. China, by contrast, has never followed neoliberal prescriptions,
   either ideologically or as a matter of practical policy, pursuing
   instead the goal of a `socialist market economy'. The focus group
   discussions show that Chinese tend to view responsibility for welfare as
   shared between the state and individuals, whereas Russians, depending on
   their ideology, tend to view welfare as the exclusive responsibility of
   either the state or the individual. Russians are also more cynical about
   the way their economy works, suggesting their support for individual
   responsibility may sometimes shade into social Darwinism.},

Abstract = {Many scholars have assumed that suicide terrorism is the most lethal
   form of terrorism. Increasing lethality is important for the terrorists'
   expected ability to coerce target states and may explain the increasing
   popularity of suicide terrorism since the 1980s. This article analyses
   statistically the lethality of suicide terrorism and suicide bombings
   with 96,649 terror incidents in the Global Terrorism Database. The
   results corroborate the hypothesis that suicide terrorism inflicts more
   casualties than other terrorist tactics. However, suicide bombings are
   not associated with a greater increase in the casualty rates as compared
   with non-suicidal terrorist tactics involving, for example, the use of
   firearms. Moreover, neither suicide terrorism in general nor suicide
   bombings in particular are associated with an increase in the count of
   dead when there are many soft targets to choose from, such as in
   Palestine and Afghanistan. The lethality of suicide bombings is the
   greatest when there are many hard targets, such as in Israel.},

Abstract = {In the aftermath of civil war or violent internal conflict, one of the
   key peacebuilding challenges is the reconciliation of former enemies who
   are members of the same small-scale societies. A failure of social
   reintegration may contribute to what is known as a conflict trap. To
   detect lingering hostile attitudes among a community's various factions
   is crucial, but the approaches adopted in previous studies tend to focus
   on the impact of conflict on one or other aggregated indicator of social
   cohesion rather than on how violence-affected individuals regard and act
   towards their fellow community members. Here we demonstrate the value of
   concentrating on this latter dyadic component of social interactions and
   we use behavioural experiments and a social tie survey to assess, in an
   appropriately disaggregated manner, social cohesion in a post-conflict
   setting in northern Uganda. Whereas in self-reported surveys,
   ex-combatants appear to be well-connected, active members of their
   communities, the experiments unveil the continued reluctance of other
   community members to share or cooperate with them; fewer resources are
   committed to ex-combatants than to others, which is statistically
   significant. The dyadic nature of our analysis allows us to detect which
   groups are more prone to discriminate against ex-combatants, which may
   help facilitate targeted interventions.},

Abstract = {The state of centre-periphery relations reflects on the ``depth{''} of
   democratic consolidation. This is tested by applying the territorial
   dimension of democratisation, a neglected theme in regime change
   studies, utilising the ``partial regimes{''} approach, one especially
   justified with regard to regions disaffected with regime change. This
   approach is applied to the Latvian region of Latgale with a four-point
   analysis, looking in turn at the structural/institutional, intermediary
   actors, the socio-political and the external. Contrary to received
   opinion, it is found that, despite a pattern of socio-economic
   deprivation and continuing resentment towards Riga, systemic loyalty and
   societal stability there are fairly strong, that centre-periphery
   relations are essentially centripetal and that counter pressures from
   neighbouring Russia have had a limited effect.},

Abstract = {Despite the 2016 US Republican presidential contest being considered by
   many as ``one unlike no others{''}, this chapter posits that its outcome
   can be attributed, at least partly, to dynamics that had affected the
   unfolding of previous American electoral contests. In their chapter,
   Raynauld and Turcotte explore contemporary political messaging and
   marketing tactics deployed by candidates running for the presidential
   nomination. As the Republican electorate was fragmented due to different
   factors, candidates engaged in hyper narrowcasting in order to reach out
   and mobilize specific groups of voters. Through the statistical analysis
   of polling data from key primary states, Raynauld and Turcotte conclude
   that by occupying narrow political ``lanes{''}, Republican contenders
   collectively weakened their chances of winning, thus allowing Donald
   Trump to secure the nomination.},

Abstract = {This article analyzes the effects of European Union Public Diplomacy
   (EUPD) discourses, drawing on poststructuralist approaches, which
   emphasize the productive dimension of discourse. We argue that EUPD
   helps reproduce a hierarchized identity of the EU, which authorizes
   particular courses of action while limiting others. Through an analysis
   of EUPD documents, we identify three descriptors - ``EU as a zone of
   peace, prosperity and democracy{''}; ``United in Diversity{''}; and ``EU
   as a model{''} - which, together, form a meaningful narrative about EU's
   identity, infused with moral superiority, and constitute a dominant
   discourse with political effects internally and externally.},

Pages = {25-36},
Abstract = {It is widely recognized that justice matters for negotiation and
   conflict resolution. However, the pluralism of moral opinions and
   concepts of justice also introduces new fields of conflict. Rudolf
   Schuessler shows that considerations of procedural justice and
   meta-justice generally fail to offer a safe way out of this impasse,
   because they too are subject to a pluralism of approaches. It follows
   that justice in negotiations and conflict resolution needs itself to be
   negotiated. The guiding view of justice for a process of negotiation is
   to be established by negotiation in this process. This puts particular
   emphasis on the responsibility and conflict-mitigating attitudes of the
   negotiating parties and on norms of mutual respect that support a shared
   quest for mutually acceptable views on justice.},

Title = {Integration through the disintegration of law? The ECB and EU
   constitutionalism in the crisis},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF EUROPEAN PUBLIC POLICY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {25},
Number = {12},
Pages = {1874-1891},
Abstract = {Rather than halting European integration, the euro crisis, in some ways,
   has accelerated it. However, it is integration of a different type,
   which departs significantly from the rule of law-based model of
   integration that traditionally burnished the European Union's
   legitimacy. The crisis-induced transformation of the European Central
   Bank (ECB) captures this trend. Through schemes such as Outright
   Monetary Transactions, the Bank bolstered its capacity to stabilize the
   euro without having its mandate formally enlarged, thus confirming the
   ascendency of technocratic, and often ad hoc, governance over
   democratically and legally circumscribed alternatives. This article
   posits the ECB's expanded and politicized role as the manifestation of a
   new mode of integration - integration through the disintegration of law
   - which inverts the court-driven integration-through-law that
   consolidated the single market. However, the lack of a solid legitimacy
   base casts doubt on the long-term sustainability of this integration
   mode.},

Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL POLITICS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {27},
Number = {5},
Pages = {830-851},
Abstract = {The Chinese state is squarely `back' in the business of environmental
   governance with an increasing number of policy innovations or
   experiments to resolve environmental issues. These have been mostly
   enacted through the `experimentation under hierarchy' framework,
   undergirded by compensation-for-performance incentive structures for
   local agents. Based on on-site ethnography in local China, a critical
   analysis is presented of low-carbon city policy experiments - one of the
   most prominent environmental policies introduced in the past decade.
   Using lessons from the agency theory, it is hypothesized that outcomes
   of these policy innovations are contingent on different policy
   dimensions. Although a number of positive outcomes have been achieved in
   output-oriented dimensions, the fundamental difficulty of specifying all
   aspects of complex, multidimensional work tasks involved in low-carbon
   city development has frequently led to policy unmaking. The findings
   raise important questions about China's tendency to rely excessively on
   compensation-for-performance structures to promote environmental
   policies.},

Abstract = {Among a collaborative leader's most important duties is selecting a
   collaborative partner. Numerous perspectives, including resource
   dependency theory, institutional theory, transaction cost theory, and
   personality typologies, have been used to help explain this decision.
   Clearly, a collaborative leader would desire to work with an individual
   who has access to needed resources, has a personality that fits the
   network, and is familiar. However, such a perfect partner does not
   often, if ever, exist. Therefore, a collaborative leader must make
   trade-offs between the issues of resource access, personality, and
   familiarity. Using an experimental design, this study explores how
   collaborative leaders make these trade-offs when considering potential
   collaborative partners. The findings suggest that while prospective
   partner personality may be the most significant driver of the
   partnership decision, it is actually the combination of factors,
   especially personality and resource access that interact to determine
   partner desirability.},

Abstract = {The article begins by exploring the crisis of contemporary
   multilateralism in terms of three core elements: institutions, norms and
   negotiation. It then argues that in relation to these elements, the EU
   and the US occupy ambiguous positions and roles, and that these
   ambiguities, exacerbated by internal tensions and crises as well as
   external forces, pervade their changing roles in the multilateral
   system. The third part of the paper assesses the role of multilateralism
   in the development of transatlantic relations, drawing attention to the
   differentiation between `special relationships', modes of transatlantic
   governance and broader multilateral mechanisms, and to the ways in which
   this reflects the underlying ambiguities in the roles of the EU and the
   US. The paper concludes that the consequent tension between
   differentiation and disintegration will be a core element of
   transatlantic relations for the foreseeable future, and that EU-US
   relations are thus weakening in a foundational aspect of world order.},
