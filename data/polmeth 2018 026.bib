Abstract = {There is arguably no security crisis so great as the one that stems from
   climate change. For some time, the EU, rather than the US, has led the
   way in terms of far-ranging policies to reduce carbon emissions. But
   despite the fact that the EU has been able to bind itself to strong
   environmental norms internally, it has - up until COP21 - been a
   relatively weak norm entrepreneur externally when seeking to convince
   others, especially the US, to adopt stronger environmental policies. Why
   was the EU finally able to increase its influence in the lead up and at
   the 2015 UN summit in Paris? This article argues that while the EU's
   climate diplomacy has underperformed in the past, it has been quick to
   adapt since the 2009 Copenhagen summit through effectively broadening
   its epistemic community of climate diplomats, and engaging in a process
   of political learning.},

Abstract = {From the 1930s until the early 1970s, national industrialization
   programs in Latin America were part of an effort to introduce social
   policies that broadened the national market, indirectly creating
   employment opportunities. Yet, Celso Furtado and other structuralists
   found the pattern of investment in Latin America predetermined by the
   unequal composition of aggregate demand, skewed toward the
   landholding-industrial-financial elite and newly emerged professional
   strata, leading to constricted employment. In reaction to the inclusive
   policies urged by the structuralists, insurgent neoliberal policies
   created a new climate of hostility toward unions and indifference to
   employment. Neoliberal doctrines deconstructed labor's eminence, forcing
   flexibility and precariousness while labor laws and unions were conjured
   as market distortions. Social neoliberalist, neostructuralist, and
   neodevelopmentalist regimes arose in the early twenty-first century as a
   reaction to the failure of neoliberalism to create growth and employment
   security. These temporary regimes have focused largely on income
   transfer policies, deploying economic surpluses arising from
   reprimarization as serendipitous exogenous forces generated export
   income windfalls from the commodities boom. Fundamental issues such as
   the pervasiveness of informal work, the recent introduction of flexible
   employment regimes, and deunionization have not been addressed.},

Abstract = {There is a growing body of research on the impact of the electoral
   system `ballot structure' on the behaviour of politicians. We offer a
   clear, ordinal and rules-based three-way coding (closed, flexible, open)
   of the electoral systems used in European Parliament elections, taking
   into account both the ballot type and the intra-party seat-allocation
   rules. For the notoriously difficult group of flexible list-systems, we
   show how these operated in the 2004, 2009 and 2014 elections, and
   introduce an additional behavioural distinction between `weakly
   flexible' and `strongly flexible' subtypes at the party-list-level. We
   then illustrate how the type of ballot used in an election can influence
   individual policy representation by looking at the vote-splits between
   Members of the European Parliament (MEPs) in the European People's Party
   in a vote on tackling homophobia.},

Title = {``Everyday Democracy{''}: an ethnographic methodology for the evaluation

Journal = {EAST EUROPEAN POLITICS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {34},
Number = {3},
Pages = {297-316},
Abstract = {Comparative democracy indices such as Freedom House Nations in Transit
   underpin many scholars' perceptions of democratic progress and
   backsliding. However, these fail to account empirically for practices of
   deliberation, a central concern in contemporary democratic theory. They
   also fail to address the ideational nature of emergent global challenges
   to democracy. This article addresses these domains of empirical neglect
   by presenting an ``Everyday Democracy{''} approach to democracy
   evaluation, an ethnographic methodology rooted in an engagement with
   democratic theory. Data collected in Serbia and Bulgaria is contrasted,
   revealing a more vibrant and contested public sphere in Serbia, which is

   academic and practice-oriented terms. Although most of the made
   criticism is valid, it is still being disputed by Western academics with
   their epistemologies, ontologies and methodologies. The voice of
   researchers who live in post-conflict or conflict-affected societies is
   still very much restricted by structural, institutional or personal
   constraints. Consequently, by drawing mostly from the experience of
   local researchers in the Balkans, the paper analyses the main causes for
   the limited impact of local researchers in the liberal peace debates,
   and proposes several steps that could lead to their stronger involvement
   in this discussion.},

Abstract = {This article focuses on the political economy of Ethiopia since the
   ruling party EPRDF came to power in 1991 and argues that the country has
   seen the rise of oligarchy during this period. The party claims that its
   development strategy has reduced poverty, but it is evident that the
   country's inequality has been growing in the past decade. The briefing
   identifies the mechanisms of oligarchisation, most notably
   privatisation, land expropriation, phoney shareholding and corruption.
   The conclusion is that Ethiopia's growing inequality is related to the
   process of oligarchy formation.},

Abstract = {Departing from the hybridity literature on peacebuilding and electoral
   studies, this paper treats democratization in Afghanistan as a
   hybridization process. As a result, to understand the durability of
   corruption, fragile political parties, and non-democratic practices in
   the country, one should look more closely at the interplay between the
   current electoral system and how elites and local people respond to it.},

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONFLICT MANAGEMENT},

Pages = {213-235},
Abstract = {Purpose The purpose of this study is to examine social conflicts with
   co-workers (SCCWs) as a predictor of job satisfaction with co-workers
   (JSCWs) on a daily basis. Moreover, dispositional emotion regulation
   (ER) was suggested to moderate the within-person relationship between
   daily conflicts at work and JSCWs.
   Design/methodology/approach Ninety-eight employees from German civil
   service agencies completed surveys across five consecutive work days.
   Dispositional variables and controls were assessed in a general survey
   which was completed before the start of the daily surveys.
   Findings Hierarchical linear modeling showed that SCCWs at noon were
   significantly related to employees' JSCWs in the evening and that
   dispositional ER moderated this relationship, indicating that people
   with high abilities of ER reported higher levels of job satisfaction
   with their co-workers than people with low abilities of ER after
   experiencing SCCWs.
   Originality/value The present study links conflict research with
   organizational and personality research. The findings broaden the
   understanding of social conflicts in an organizational context and
   further highlight ER as an important factor which can buffer the
   negative effects of workplace conflicts.},

Title = {Politics and Islamic Revivalism in Bangladesh: The Role of the State and
   Non-State/Non-Political Actors},
Journal = {POLITICS RELIGION \& IDEOLOGY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {19},
Number = {3},
Pages = {326-353},
Abstract = {Bangladesh is an overwhelmingly Muslim majority country in South Asia.
   Islam is quite predominant in its political, social and cultural
   landscapes. While most classical and the contemporary sociologists
   predicted that religion would gradually fade in importance and cease to
   be significant with the advent of the industrial society, Bangladesh has
   instead witnessed a reemergence of the religious forces in its society.
   In order to address this theoretical exceptionalism and paradox, we have
   examined the role of both state and non-state or non-political actors in
   the Islamic revivalism in Bangladesh. Drawing on Islamic revivalism' as
   a theoretical construct and employing a triangulation of methods, we
   have critically investigated the contributions of five major independent
   regimes and key social, cultural and non-political organizations and
   groups to the Islamic revivalism in Bangladesh. We have found that
   Islamization in Bangladesh was actually initiated by the very first
   political regime in order to mobilize public supports and the subsequent
   regimes followed suit, albeit differently. None of the five independent
   political regimes in Bangladesh was however genuinely interested in
   establishing Islam and Islamic polity in society, but largely used Islam
   and Islamization to advance their political interests and legitimacy.},

Journal = {ETHNOPOLITICS},

Volume = {17},

Pages = {485-502},
Abstract = {The article seeks to analyze discourses of two Orthodox Churches
   Georgian (GOC) and Russian (ROC)-from the vantage point of their various
   interconnections with Europe and the ensuing representations of Europe
   framed in religious terms. Of particular salience are relations between
   ROC and GOC, on the one hand, and the Roman Catholic Church, on the
   other, as well as the positioning of both ROC and GOC within the global
   community of Orthodox Churches. The analyzed political circumstances
   force religious hierarchs of both institutions, even if they share the
   similar ambivalence toward the West, to differently reproduce the image
   of Europe. The broader geopolitical picture puts the GOC in the position
   of supporting government's foreign policy agenda which goes in
   opposition to the Kremlin, in spite of the fact that the former has a
   lot of common with the Moscow Patriarchate when it comes to criticism
   toward the Western liberal value systems.},

Title = {Why Negotiate When You Can Criminalize? Lessons for Conflict
   Transformation from Northern Ireland and South Africa},
Journal = {STUDIES IN CONFLICT \& TERRORISM},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {41},
Number = {8},
Pages = {619-637},
Abstract = {Research on negotiating with criminalized actors generally assumes the
   criminal label as a given, neglecting the significance of
   criminalization itself. This article addresses this gap arguing that the
   processes of criminalization and decriminalization embody important
   incentive structures affecting peace negotiations. Specifically, for
   conflict transformation to effectively occur, criminalization needs to
   be orientated away from a criminalization of actors and on to specific
   acts to legitimize nonviolent political expression and negotiations.
   These arguments will be advanced through a comparative study of Northern
   Ireland and South Africa, adopting a conflict transformation framework,
   and drawing on original interviews and archival material.},

Pages = {1501-1521},
Abstract = {It is often held that free movement within the European Union and the
   expansion of social rights of mobile citizens by the European Court of
   Justice place national welfare states under pressure, potentially
   leading to welfare retrenchment. Yet thorough empirical investigation of
   this claim has been surprisingly limited. In this article, we
   distinguish three possible responses to such pressures: embedding', the
   inclusion of Union citizens in the welfare system; quarantining',
   restrictive measures excluding mobile Union citizens; and retrenchment',
   general cutbacks in benefit programmes. Through a longitudinal
   comparative case study of generous non-contributory welfare benefits in
   Denmark and the Netherlands, we find general welfare retrenchment in
   response to Europeanisation strikingly limited. Instead, welfare states
   remain resilient by creatively quarantining mobile Union citizens from
   the coverage of social benefits. Legal cultures and degrees of
   politicization are important factors, shaping the pathways towards these
   creative but exclusionary responses.},

Title = {Are polish theatres autonomous? Artistic institutions in a bureaucratic
   system of culture funding},
Journal = {POLICY STUDIES},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {39},
Number = {1},
Pages = {1-18},
Abstract = {The culture funding systems based on the arm's length mechanism are
   generally believed to secure more autonomy of artistic institutions than
   bureaucratic' systems which directly involve politicians or public
   servants in the allocation of public funds. There is a wide range of
   academic literature that defend this approach. The aim of this paper is
   to readdress this view and show that it stems from typology-based
   preconceptions rather than real-life policy-making. To this end, the
   article analyses relations between public theatres and local funding
   bodies in Poland, where culture funding system is characterised by a
   bureaucratic decision-making. Mixed methods were applied using
   questionnaires and focus groups with public servants and theatre
   directors. The paper suggests that, although Polish local governments
   play a dominant role in the arts funding, their intervention in the area
   of culture has merely administrative nature and, in general, does not
   entail interference in the artistic activity.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF EUROPEAN INTEGRATION},

Volume = {40},
Number = {3, SI},
Pages = {358-373},
Abstract = {In the EU institutional architecture, parliamentary oversight of
   economic and fiscal policies is weakened by the existence of spheres of
   activity that tend to escape from the two ordinary channels of
   parliamentary representation. The consideration of existing gaps in the
   oversight circuit leads to investigate on the actual as well as the
   potential role of the Interparliamentary Conference on Stability,
   Economic Coordination and Governance (SECG). A representation of the
   actual pros and cons of this Conference is drawn by means of the SWOT
   (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities and Threats) analysis. On this
   basis, strategies suited to turn this Conference into a body
   instrumental to strengthened and effective parliamentary oversight are
   highlighted, considering interparliamentary cooperation not as an
   autonomous channel for representation, but as an instrumental dimension
   that could help the European Parliament and national parliaments to
   tighten their oversight capacity, in their respective domains.},

Volume = {12},

Abstract = {Through an examination of recent events and controversies Indian
   universities, this article reflects on the neoliberal creep taking over
   academia. The narrative connects the suicide note of a Dalit caste
   doctoral student, a student festival of political dissent, missives from
   the education minister, the financialization of higher education, and a
   market-oriented performance management system to discipline the
   professoriate. The latter element in the narrative is illustrated
   through my own teaching and research practice whose intellectual
   foundations draw on Professor Frank Fischer's scholarship. This personal
   reflection draws on my experiences in seeking to inhabit the role of a
   facilitator of participatory learning, engaging directly with policy
   actors and their cultural modes of communication.},

Pages = {222-250},
Abstract = {Although studies on policy transfer have expanded, a general and
   comprehensive understanding of policy transfer is lacking. This study
   offers an evidence-based explanation of policy transfer processes. We
   extracted constraining and facilitating factors from 180 empirical
   studies using PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews
   and Meta-Analysis) and aggregated these factors into a conceptual
   framework. We synthesize our findings in four transfer routes. We
   conclude that actors could shape a subset of those factors by taking
   certain decisions regarding transferability, adoptability and process
   design, albeit within the boundaries of the environment.},

Abstract = {Norms applying to food interact with conceptions of nationhood, identity
   and law. This occurs through gastronomies and ethico-religious
   standards, recognition and conviviality, and the voice of communities in
   the sourcing and labelling of their food. Law, nation and identity
   intersect in the notion of citizenship. The chapter moves from the tight
   relationships by which persons are constrained within overdetermined
   categories of state law and national citizenship, to explore the
   possibilities unleashed by a loosening of the bonds between law, nation
   and identity. Sections deal in turn with each of these ``loosenings{''},
   as we prize apart the knots that bind (i) identity and nation, (ii)
   nation and law, and (iii) law and identity, each in relation to the
   cultural and legal context of food. With these loosenings, the unified
   jurisdiction of the nation-state gives way to plural and informal law; a
   single national identity expands into multiple ethical and ethnic
   associations; identity is no longer determined by state-centred legal
   interpellation but allows persons to ``inhabit{''} a range of norms. By
   expanding the scope for participation and interaction in each of these
   areas, citizenship finds new networks for expansion, enrichment and
   reflexivity. The full spectrum of social justice can only be addressed
   by regimes and networks that ensure fair and adequate distribution of
   food, that respect the cultural demands as well as the biological needs
   of communities, and that ensure participation, through choices informed
   by personally relevant criteria and social and political structures.},

Volume = {17},

Pages = {184-198},
Abstract = {Octavia Butler's 1979 novel, Kindred, is a postmodern slave narrative
   that redefines the previous literary constructions of slavery in the
   United States. Through its rejection of the nineteenth century slave
   narrative and sentimental novel, Kindred highlights the main problem
   with nineteenth century narrative empathy: Forging an intimate
   identification between reader and character to enact empathy is founded
   through the representation of bodies in pain. In place of this
   identification tactic, Kindred reveals a new critical apparatus,
   essential for a mobilization of empathy centered on understanding both
   history and the process of historical recuperation. This investigation
   of empathy sheds light on the problematic construction of the early
   liberal human rights model across the Americas, a model centered on
   promoting identification with the suffering other.},

Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL POLITICS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {27},
Number = {3},
Pages = {411-432},
Abstract = {Previous research has shown that democracies exhibit stronger
   commitments to mitigate climate change and, generally, emit less carbon
   dioxide than non-democratic regimes. However, there remains much
   unexplained variation in how democratic regimes perform in this regard.
   Here it is argued that the benefits of democracy for climate change
   mitigation are limited in the presence of widespread corruption that
   reduces the capacity of democratic governments to reach climate targets
   and reduce CO2 emissions. Using a sample of 144 countries over
   1970-2011, the previously established relationship between the amount of
   countries' CO2 emissions and their level of democracy is revisited. It
   is empirically tested whether this relationship is instead moderated by
   the levels of corruption. The results indicate that more democracy is
   only associated with lower CO2 emissions in low-corruption contexts. If
   corruption is high, democracies do not seem to do better than
   authoritarian regimes.},

Abstract = {The EU's relations with North East Asia are essentially mercantilist,
   driven overwhelmingly by commercial policy. While China is currently all
   important to these relations, recent history suggests a willingness on
   the part of EU states to engage with Taiwan if they see real benefit
   from doing so. Concern or caution about possible Chinese reactions to
   engaging with Taiwan, especially in matters relating to trade, is
   therefore often overstated or even unfounded. Provided Chinese `red
   lines' are avoided, there should not be any restriction on developing a
   closer relationship with Taiwan. This suggests that the lack of
   engagement is at least in part due to the absence of better business
   opportunities.},

Abstract = {The paper analyzes Serbian system of local selfgovernment under the
   Constitution of 2006 and its possible improvements. There are two major
   aspects of reform. On the one side, there are weaknesses in internal law
   and practice that were detected in last three decades and six concrete
   proposals for their correction. On the other side, considering that
   Serbia negotiates on integration with the EU, some improvements of the
   system should be a result of that process, fully in accordance with the
   European standards of local self-government. Reforming the local
   selfgovernment in both of these directions should lead to better legal
   framework in the Republic of Serbia and upgrading the constitutional
   system.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this essay is to analyze two theories. One is a
   relatively new approach called Instrument Constituencies. The other is
   an established approach called the Advocacy Coalition Framework (ACF).
   This essay begins by comparing the two theories by an explicit set of
   criteria. It then lays out opportunities for refinement and advancement
   of Instrument Constituencies towards its better placement, usefulness,
   and longevity as a policy process theory. Research prospects at the
   intersection of Instrument Constituencies and the ACF are then presented
   with a set of research questions and hypotheses. This essay concludes
   with a summary of insights about the field of policy processes gained
   from this theoretical exploration. While there are opportunities for
   improvements and important caveats for consideration, this essay makes
   an optimistic argument for the potential of Instrument Constituencies to
   offer generalizable and context-specific knowledge in helping to advance
   policy process research.},

Abstract = {This article analyses the construction of Niyazov's regime, its ideology
   and symbolism. It is argued that Turkmenistan's strong emphasis on
   symbolism is correlated with the high degree of authoritarian rule in
   this state. Moreover, symbolism has been vital in the reconstruction of
   the two main metanarratives in Turkmenistan: Turkmen nationalism, and
   the cult of the leaderthe Turkmenbashi. Domestically, the metanarrative
   of nationalism is further broken down within the tribal hierarchical
   division of Turkmen society, in which Turkmenbashi presents a particular
   tribe as the leading one. Several myths accompany the construction of
   the new Turkmenbashi ideology. The historical myth of Turkmen national
   superiority, summarized in Niyazov's code of conduct Rukhnama', features
   specifically. This article also suggests that a manipulative approach of
   absurdism was implemented in Turkmenistan by Niyazov's regime to secure
   acceptance of these new metanarratives and myths. Much like Orwell's
   1984', the regime's efforts to distort reality and history suppressed
   the population's capacity for critical thinking and action. As a result,
   people became intellectually confused and more inclined to accept the
   line of dictatorship and its directives. The closed foreign policy of
   Turkmenistan under Niyazov further contributed to the significantly
   deteriorated sociopolitical standing of this ex-Soviet Central Asian
   state.},

Title = {Nonstate Actors and Compliance with International Agreements: An
   Empirical Analysis of the OECD Anti-Bribery Convention},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATION},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {72},
Number = {1},
Pages = {33-69},
Month = {WIN},
Abstract = {International relations scholarship has made great progress on the study
   of compliance with international agreements. While persuasive, most of
   this work has focused on states' de jure compliance decisions, largely
   excluding the de facto behavior of nonstate actors whose actions the
   agreement hopes to constrain. Of particular interest has been whether
   the OECD Anti-Bribery Convention (ABC) might reduce the propensity of
   multinational corporations (MNCs) to bribe officials in host countries
   through its mechanisms of extraterritoriality and extensive peer review.
   Unfortunately, research is hampered by reporting bias. Since the
   convention raises the probability of investors' punishment for bribery
   in their home countries, it reduces both the incentives for bribery and
   willingness to admit to the activity. This generates uncertainty over
   which of these incentives drives any correlation between signing the
   convention and reductions in reported bribery. We address this problem
   by employing a specialized survey experiment that shields respondents
   and reduces reporting bias. We find that after the onset of Phase 3 in
   2010, when the risk of noncompliance increased for firms subject to the
   OECD-ABC, those MNCs reduced their actual bribery relative to their
   nonsignatory competitors.},

Abstract = {This article contributes to the understanding of inter-agency
   coordination among international organizations, conceived as
   international public administrations (IPAs). We adopt a practice-based
   approach to study the dilemmas of coordination across levels of
   government in the empirical setting of United Nations agencies involved
   in field-level development activities. Based on elite interviews in both
   pilot countries and agency headquarters, complemented by extensive
   archival analysis, we track the emergence of a specific type of
   coordination dilemma that has been understudied, that is, the dilemma of
   inter- and intra-agency coordination. We identify two sets of
   coordinating practices that aided in balancing the dilemma, that is,
   `systemic thinking' and `jointly mobilizing resources and consensus',
   and we discuss the organizational factors mediating the perception of
   each set of practices.},

Abstract = {Informal governance often holds an aura of the covert and exclusive -
   aspects that are difficult to square with the ideal of a democratic
   process. Unfortunately, existing analyses mostly focus on the effect of
   informal governance on transparency, ignoring other channels through
   which a political order may generate legitimacy. However, existing
   analyses quite often conflate different types of informal governance or
   consider predominantly its effect on transparency and accountability.
   This article argued that the relationship between informal governance
   and legitimacy is much more complex and to some extent even
   counter-intuitive. To see this, I distinguish three channels of
   legitimation - input, throughput, and output - and discuss how various
   forms of informal governance affect it. The article has implications for
   scholarly debates on the legitimacy of global governance, studies of
   informal governance, and practical implications for the reform of
   international organizations.},

Abstract = {When the member states of the European Union (EU) accepted the Defence
   and Security Procurement Directive, the expectation was that they would
   be able to retain a substantial amount of autonomy. During the
   implementation process, however, the members accepted the European
   Commission as a legitimate authority on how the Directive should be
   implemented. In this light, member states changed one specific policy
   issue, not addressed in the Directive: their offset policy. Addressing
   the role of the Commission in the Common Security and Defence Policy,
   this paper analyses three separate cases and finds that a cost benefit
   analysis cannot explain why these member states complied with
   non-legally binding Guidance Notes issued by the Commission. The paper
   also explores the role of national civil servants seeking rule
   consistency and finds they acknowledged the authority of the Commission
   in prescribing new rules.},

Abstract = {In this article we present the research of local agricultural tax policy
   in Poland. It is a specific kind of tax as its volume depends on an
   artificial measure, i.e. the price of rye. The article aims to find out
   if with this construction of tax the local tax policy may be efficient.
   Our research proves that the lower the share of agricultural tax in
   property taxes, the more efficient is the tax policy. The reduction in
   the agricultural tax correlates positively with the growth in
   agricultural tax in the current year, and also to a lesser extent in the
   next year. Higher rye prices result in an increased reduction in
   agricultural tax rates as well as in tax revenues, and the tendency is
   reversed in the following year.},

Abstract = {US presidents-working through the Office of Information and Regulatory
   Affairs (OIRA)-influence administrative agencies by directing agencies
   to modify their regulatory policy proposals before finalization. We
   identify two competing hypotheses from the literature to explain this
   presidential intervention. First, some scholars hypothesize that
   presidents are more likely to change proposals when the submitting
   agency's political ideology differs from the president's. Second, others
   argue that presidents are more likely to correct ideologically extreme
   agencies of either political orientation. These claims have not been
   adequately investigated quantitatively. We study almost 1,500 final
   regulations reviewed by OIRA between 2005 and 2011. In the end, neither
   hypothesis garners support. Instead, we demonstrate that regulations
   proposed by more liberally oriented agencies are more likely to be
   changed-and the content of the rules changed to a greater degree-than
   those proposed by other agency types. Those results suggest a
   provocative third possibility: presidentially directed deregulation
   through OIRA review.},

Abstract = {Existing research on the European Union's (EU) activities at the
   international level typically pertains to how the EU acts, bargains and
   performs. However, scholarship less frequently examines how the EU
   formulates its negotiating strategy at international negotiation fora.
   Our analysis attempts to fill this gap by presenting an analytical
   framework to map the different features and parameters that determine
   and condition the EU negotiating strategy in multilateral contexts. We
   identify four features in two phases that shape the EU negotiating
   strategy: (a) goal-setting, (b) field analysis, (c) available means and
   (d) employed tactics. Each of these features contains additional
   parameters that, overall, define and constrain the EU's negotiating
   strategy. To test the relevance of our analytical framework, we delve
   into the determination of the EU human rights negotiating strategy at
   the United Nations.},

Abstract = {How do states achieve status? Although we rely on status to explain
   important phenomena in international politics-such as wars and the
   foreign policy of emerging powers-we still do not understand what status
   is or where it comes from. Previous research treats status as a function
   of state attributes, such as wealth and military capability. Following
   Weber, I argue that status depends on social recognition: it concerns
   identification processes in which an actor gains admission into a club
   once they follow the rules of membership. Therefore, systematic social
   processes, which cannot be reduced to state attributes, influence
   status. In particular, status is self-reinforcing. Moreover, social
   closure influences status-which implies that (1) a state's existing
   relations influence its ability to achieve status and (2) states
   recognize similar states rather than states with the most impressive
   portfolio of certain attributes. To investigate the determinants of
   international status, I move beyond ranking states based on attributes
   to examine quantitatively how status emerges from state relations.
   Leveraging inferential network analysis, I examine state practices that
   express recognition-specifically, the network of embassies. The analysis
   indicates that self-reinforcing dynamics and social closure, rather than
   state attributes directly, drive status recognition.},

Abstract = {This article investigates the impact of the introduction of the patent
   box/IP regime on foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows in R\&D and
   related activities, including design, developing, and testing
   activities, using city level data. The data are based on approximately
   1,200 cities in 80 countries. Results obtained by use of a
   difference-in-differences estimator show that the introduction of the
   patent/IP box regime in the Netherlands has led to increases in the FDI
   inflows in R\&D and related activities in the subsequent three-year
   period. For Spain and Belgium, no significant effects could be found.
   The results are robust when other important factors are accounted for
   (capital city, city population, quality of local university, presence of
   an airport, R\&D tax incentives, protection of property rights, and PISA
   ratings in mathematics and science) and different measures of FDI
   inflows (number of FDI projects, capital flows, and number of jobs
   generated).},

Abstract = {This article extends the study of regulatory enforcement on three
   levels. First, it separates enforcement style elements during
   inspections and sanction decision-making work, creating a more realistic
   measurement. Second, it focuses on how these elements function in a
   context where it is hard in practice to achieve deterrence. Third, it
   assesses how agents view the effectiveness of combinations of style
   elements in such a context. To do so, it uses survey and interview data
   with street-level environmental officials in Guangzhou, China. It finds
   that the agents studied practise enforcement that goes beyond deterrence
   and uses education and persuasion more effectively. It finds that the
   behavioural assumptions of these agents are to a large extent in line
   with the available regulatory literature, although agents are very
   unlikely to have consulted such studies. Therefore, the article
   concludes that law enforcement agents can develop nuanced and
   appropriate behavioural intuitions through their everyday work
   experiences.},

Journal = {PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION},

Volume = {96},

Pages = {594-610},

Abstract = {This article examines how local policy elites conceptualize and
   communicate potential innovations to overcome the fiscal crisis. Four
   austerity frames based on cultural theory are developed: an
   individualist, hierarchist, egalitarian and fatalist frame. Two
   expectations are tested by tracing frame usage in austerity speeches by
   the leadership in Birmingham, Cologne and Rotterdam. First, the modest
   contribution of the individualist frame in NPM-sceptic Cologne is
   confirmed, but no evidence is found of individualist dominance in
   NPM-minded Birmingham. Second, it is shown that leaders in Birmingham
   and Rotterdam combine elements of multiple frames so as to create a new
   promising narrative which opens up routes towards innovation. The
   importance of `frame flexibility' is stressed to deal with the
   complexities of coping with the fiscal crisis in ways that are logical
   (given available views) and innovative (exploring alternative views),
   and highlight the importance of further developing understandings of
   such (municipal) coping.},

Abstract = {What does it mean to mediate in the contemporary world? During the Cold
   War, and since, various forms of international intervention have
   maintained a fragile strategic and territorially sovereign balance
   between states and their elite leaders, as in Cyprus or the Middle East,
   or built new states and inculcated new norms. In the post-Cold War era
   intervention and mediation shifted beyond the balance of power and
   towards the liberal peace, as in Bosnia-Herzegovina, Kosovo, and Timor
   Leste. In the case of Northern Ireland, identity, territorial
   sovereignty, and the nature of governance also began to be mediated,
   leading to hints of complex, post-liberal formulations. This article
   offers and evaluates a genealogy of the evolution of international
   mediation.},

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATION},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {72},
Number = {4},

Month = {FAL},
Abstract = {When popular referendums fail to ratify new international agreements or
   succeed in reversing existing ones, it not only affects domestic voters
   but also creates negative spillovers for the other parties to such
   agreements. We explore how voters respond to this strategic environment.
   We use original survey data from a poll fielded just one day before the
   2015 Greek bailout referenduma referendum in which the stakes for other
   countries were particularly highto investigate how expectations about
   the likely foreign response to a noncooperative referendum outcome
   influence voting behavior and to what extent foreign policymakers can
   influence those expectations. Our analysis of the Greek referendum shows
   that such expectations had a powerful effect on voting behavior: voters
   expecting that a noncooperative referendum outcome would force Greece to
   leave the eurozone were substantially more likely to vote cooperatively
   than those believing that it would result in renewed negotiations with
   the country's creditors. Leveraging the bank closure that took place
   right before the vote, we also show that costly signals by foreign
   actors made voters more pessimistic about the consequences of a
   noncooperative vote and substantially increased the share of cooperative
   votes.},

Title = {SME resource acquisition in transition economies: power dependence and
   induced bribery},
Journal = {BUSINESS AND POLITICS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {20},
Number = {3},
Pages = {331-359},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Researchers have extensively studied how large firms and SMEs use
   business and political ties to obtain tangible and intangible resources
   in transition economies. However, how SMEs establish these ties in the
   context of power-imbalanced dependence by using unethical and illegal
   strategic practice such as bribery remains underexplored. Furthermore,
   how SMEs deploy strategies to mitigate such risky actions in the process
   of resource acquisition is also given limited attention in the
   literature. Lack of exploration of these issues leaves significant gaps
   in our understanding of how SMEs are able to initiate and operate their
   ties for survival and growth despite enormous institutional constraints.
   We analyze the negative and positive effects of power dependence on
   business resource acquisition via regression analysis using survey data
   drawn from 232 Chinese SMEs. The findings indicate that power-imbalanced
   dependence among SMEs is associated with their use of bribery to
   establish political ties with officials for access to resources. The
   moderating effect of power-mutual dependence on this relationship is
   also examined. Theoretical significance and managerial implications of
   these findings for SMEs in transition economies are discussed.},

Abstract = {Some scholars suggest popular culture shapes public attitudes about
   foreign policy in ways that can affect real-world political outcomes,
   but relatively few studies test this proposition. We examine whether-and
   more importantly how-popular culture affects public opinion on foreign
   policy through a survey experiment on American attitudes toward fully
   autonomous weapons. We queried respondents about their consumption of
   popular culture-including a number of iconic science-fiction films
   featuring armed artificial intelligence (AI)-before or after questions
   about autonomous weapons. We find that science fiction `` priming{''}
   exerts no independent effect on political attitudes, nor does referring
   to autonomous weapons as `` killer robots.{''} However, consumption of
   frightening armed AI films is associated with greater opposition to
   autonomous weapons. This `` scifi literacy{''} effect increases for the
   highest consumers of science fiction if they are `` primed{''} about
   popular culture before reporting their attitudes-what we call the ``
   sci-fi geek effect.{''} Our project advances current understanding of
   how popular culture affects public opinion on foreign policy and
   suggests avenues for further inquiry.},

Abstract = {This article traces the trajectory of party Euroscepticism in Greece
   drawing upon theories of issue competition. It demonstrates that the
   economic dimension of the multiple crises facing the European Union (EU)
   contributed to a Eurosceptic shift in public opinion, the electoral
   success of Eurosceptic parties, new parties populating the Europhile end
   of the spectrum, and the formation of a coalition government united not
   by ideological affinity but by a common Eurosceptic and anti-austerity
   agenda. Mainstream parties maintained their pro-EU agendas and
   challenger parties offered both pro- and anti-EU policy options to the
   electorate. The prospect of power resulted in the progressive softening
   of Euroscepticism among challenger parties. EU issue salience was
   relatively high across the party system and remained so during the
   crisis. Although Greek parties justified their pro- and anti-EU
   attitudes using a number of frames, economic arguments were prevalent at
   the height of the crisis and challenger parties of the left intensified
   their claims of the EU interfering in national politics. The findings
   have implications for our understanding of the evolving nature of
   Euroscepticism and the ways in which it may feature in domestic party
   politics.},

Abstract = {The eurozone crisis has reinvigorated the debate over the requirement
   for supranational integration within the single currency area. With the
   focus of political scientists often restricted to the study of
   intergovernmental processes of crisis management, this article considers
   the role of the European Parliament during the key legislative
   negotiations on European Union fiscal governance reform. A comparative
   frame analysis of the major European Union institutions' crisis
   discourse is applied. Frames are linked to macroeconomic ideology as
   well as to different integration scenarios within Economic and Monetary
   Union. It is found that the European Parliament converged around limited
   framing devices supporting intergovernmental fiscal discipline. Key
   explanatory factors here were the ideological divisions among Members of
   the European Parliament as well as the leadership role played by the
   European Council. These findings are broadly consistent with the new
   intergovernmentalist claims that the supranational institutions are no
   longer hard-wired to the pursuit of supranational integration.},

Abstract = {Scholars often find that highlands and rural areas foster insurgencies.
   However, others have argued that cities can also be centers of insurgent
   activity and that nonterritorial insurgencies are different from
   territorial guerilla wars. We expect that in a nonterritorial
   insurgency, the high quality of local knowledge makes populated rural
   areas inhospitable to nonterritorial insurgent activity. Using data from
   a random sample of about 750 Medaille de la Resistance Francaise
   recipients, we find that departments with more residents in cities and
   large towns had more medal recipients than rural departments. Analyses
   of repression patterns (finding that insurgent arrests are less likely
   in cities than rural areas) and the historical record provide further
   evidence for the information mechanism.},

Abstract = {This research note presents a new dataset on the speed of tariff
   liberalization in sixty-one preferential trade agreements (PTAs) signed
   by fifty states and regional economic organizations over the period 1995
   to 2013. We use this dataset to test prominent arguments concerning the
   impact of intra-industry trade and global value chains on the political
   economy of trade. Our results indicate that the speed of tariff
   liberalization through PTAs is considerably faster for intermediate
   goods than for finished products. This is in line with the most
   prominent argument about how global value chains affect the political
   economy of trade liberalization. At the same time, we find mixed
   evidence for the impact of intra-industry trade on the ease of trade
   liberalization, which reflects strong cross-country variation. We
   conclude with a discussion on how the dataset can help tackle important
   questions in international political economy and inform ongoing debates
   on trade agreements.},

Title = {The G20's Reform of Bank Regulation and the Changing Structure of the
   Global Financial System},
Journal = {GLOBAL POLICY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {9},
Number = {1, SI},
Pages = {21-33},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {The G20's financial regulatory reform programme, underway since 2008,
   was designed as an integrated set of strengthened regulatory measures to
   make the global financial system more robust and less crisis-prone.
   However, in practice the G20's stricter regulation of internationally
   active banks has not been matched by firmer oversight of other financial
   system participants that also take on large risks. The present article
   addresses the implications of this situation. Section1 outlines the role
   of the banking sector within the broader market-based financial system.
   Section2 considers the dynamics of a crisis in such a system. The
   measures that the G20 has agreed thus far to strengthen the G-SIBs, and
   regulators' intentions with regard to strengthening other sectors of the
   financial system are summarized in Section3. Section4 describes how
   stricter bank regulation may affect the resilience of market-based
   financial systems in conditions of stress. Section5 discusses how the
   focus on strengthening bank regulation, combined with slow progress in
   extending regulation to other sectors, has accelerated structural change
   in the financial system and offers some conjectures on how this may
   alter financial risks, the way the financial system may respond to
   stress, and the implications for macroprudential regulation.
   Policy makers should not be too confident that the G20's financial
   regulatory reform programme has made financial system-wide crises a
   thing of the past. There is still much to do to achieve a stable and
   resilient market-based global financial system.},

Volume = {39},

Abstract = {What makes people deny wrongdoing that their group has inflicted on
   others? Prior research argues that refusing to acknowledge past
   misbehavior contributes to intergroup conflict, making historical
   misinformation important to understand and address. In particular,
   feeling a lack of control may make people more vulnerable to these
   misperceptionsa claim we test in a preregistered survey experiment
   examining beliefs about the Palestinian exodus during the creation of
   the state of Israel. Consistent with expectations, Jewish Israelis who
   were asked to recall an event in which they lacked control were more
   vulnerable to arguments (incorrectly) denying any Jewish responsibility
   for the exodus. By contrast, corrective information successfully reduced
   misperceptions regardless of feelings of control. However, corrections
   had no effect on attitudes toward the outgroup or support for the peace
   process, which suggests that historical misperceptions may be more of a
   symptom of intergroup conflict than a cause of its persistence.},

Abstract = {International interventions are an omnipresent and increasingly diverse
   instrument in world politics. This special issue of Cooperation and
   Conflict follows broader calls to decentre' the study of International
   Relations and seeks to contribute to a research agenda that goes beyond
   the prevailing focus on Northern actors and interests in interventions
   research. The special issue advances two interrelated research
   strategies to decentre the study of international interventions. First,
   it promotes research that gives voice to the diversity of experiences
   and perspectives outside the Northern centre. Second, it embraces an
   emerging set of methodological advances that draw on sociological and
   ethnographic research traditions in order to advance the in-depth study
   of interventions. With contributing authors from the fields of peace and
   conflict studies, regional and area studies, as well as International
   Relations, the special issue sets out to build bridges across
   disciplinary boundaries by bringing together a set of experts who
   normally speak to separate audiences within their respective research
   fields. Taking research beyond the classical' cases of intervention, the
   articles provide in-depth case narratives of intervention practices in
   the Solomon Islands, Colombia, Somalia, Puntland, Cote d'Ivoire, Lebanon
   and Jordan.},

Abstract = {The paper analyzes Russia's perception of NATO since the beginning of
   its eastern enlargement. Russia's reaction to the enlargement evolved
   from attempts to diffuse its potential damage through a limited
   cooperation to passive and then active policies of containment. The
   latter have resulted in a risky behavior with respect to the alliance
   and a concentration of Russian military on the Western border. Two
   factors can assist us in explaining Russia's evolving perception of NATO
   from a potential partner to a renewed military threat - the historical
   experience of viewing the alliance, and the West in general, as
   potentially threatening and the post-Cold war interaction with NATO that
   served to strengthen the historically developed perception. As of today,
   Russia has learned from its interaction with the alliance that NATO
   remains a principle threat to Russia's national security and that
   through the alliance's expansion the West seeks to exercise its
   cultural, economic, and political domination in Eurasia. (C) 2018 The

Abstract = {How does voting in village elections affect one's assessment of China's
   democracy? In a time when a majority of the Chinese people believe that
   China is a democracy, this question has important implications for the
   prospects of bottom-up democratization. Village elections may play a
   positive role if they can bring people to realize that China is not a
   democracy. By contrast, village elections may play a negative role if
   they reinforce the belief that China is already a democracy. Using the
   China data of the ABS II, I show that voting in village elections does
   lead to more negative democratic assessment, but this does not imply a
   positive role of village elections for bottom-up democratization,
   because the negative effect of voting is only detected in elections of
   poor quality. In free and fair elections, voting has no influence.},

Abstract = {Prefigurative politics' has become a popular term for social movements'
   ethos of unity between means and ends, but its conceptual genealogy has
   escaped attention. This article disentangles two components: (a) an
   ethical revolutionary practice, chiefly indebted to the anarchist
   tradition, which fights domination while directly constructing
   alternatives and (b) prefiguration as a recursive temporal framing,
   unknowingly drawn from Christianity, in which a future radiates
   backwards on its past. Tracing prefiguration from the Church Fathers to
   politicised resurfacings in the Diggers and the New Left, I associate it
   with Koselleck's process of reassurance' in a pre-ordained historical
   path. Contrasted to recursive prefiguration are the generative temporal
   framings couching defences of means-ends unity in the anarchist
   tradition. These emphasised the path dependency of revolutionary social
   transformation and the ethical underpinnings of anti-authoritarian
   politics. Misplaced recursive terminology, I argue, today conveniently
   distracts from the generative framing of means-ends unity, as the
   promise of revolution is replaced by that of environmental and
   industrial collapse. Instead of prefiguration, I suggest conceiving of
   means-ends unity in terms of Bloch's concrete utopia', and associating
   it with anxious' and catastrophic' forms of hope.},

Abstract = {The complaint that many professional politicians lack integrity is
   common. However, it is unclear what such a judgement amounts to. Taking
   various codes of political ethics in the United Kingdom as my starting
   point, I examine the extent to which we can understand political
   integrity as a matter of politicians adhering to the obligations that
   official codes of ethics prescribe and, in a more general sense, the
   public-service ethos that underpins these codes. I argue that although
   this way of approaching the issue usefully draws our attention to an
   important class of positional duties that apply to politicians,
   commitment to principled political causes plays a further, indispensable
   role in coherent assessments of political integrity. In consequence, I
   claim that politicians of integrity succeed in furthering their deepest
   political commitments while avoiding malfeasance or misconduct. As such,
   the ascription of political integrity can often only be made when
   assessing a long train of action.},

Abstract = {This article explores which factors enable or hinder populist presidents
   in Latin America to pursue a radical strategy of institutional change
   and induce the erosion of horizontal checks and balances. Applying an
   actor-centred approach, the article focuses on specific constellations
   in the political arena that shape populist presidents' incentives and
   their ability to engage in institutional change. Three conditions are
   considered to be most decisive: the absence of unified government
   between the executive and the legislature, the existence of a power
   vacuum' in the political arena and the distribution of public support.
   Using configurational analyses, different causal paths explaining the
   presence or absence of the erosion of horizontal accountability are
   identified.},

Abstract = {Politics in Wales is often portrayed as being relatively consensual and
   enjoying healthy levels of trust between voters and elites when compared
   with the rest of the United Kingdom. Recent events, like the decision of
   Welsh voters to reject membership of the EU against the advice of most
   of its political establishment, are however calling into question this
   perception. Using the 2016 Welsh Candidate Study and 2016 Welsh Election
   Study data, this article evaluates the extent of policy divisions
   between voters and candidates in Wales. I find that candidates hold more
   liberal policy positions and are less likely than voters to think of
   immigration as the most important policy priority. In addition, they
   tend to favour a different approach to parliamentary representation,
   deeming it more acceptable for Assembly Members to discard the views of
   their voters in favour of their own views or those of their party.},

Abstract = {The public administration literature has been dominated by questions
   about how politicians can control the bureaucracy's application and
   implementation of laws at the back end of the policy process. Much less
   scholarly attention is devoted to the influence of the bureaucracy on
   the content and composition of the policy agenda at the front end of the
   process. Agenda setting is a fundamental aspect of politics, and this
   article examines the influence of the bureaucracy on the policy agenda
   and the conditions for this influence. The core proposition is that the
   policy agenda is larger and more diverse in political systems in which
   administrative professionals take up a larger share of the bureaucracy.
   This effect is expected to be mitigated by the involvement of elected
   representatives in the policymaking process. The empirical analysis
   supports these expectations. The findings are based on a time-series
   cross-section dataset from 98 Danish municipalities over 7 years
   containing a detailed coding of local council agendas and rich register
   data.},

Abstract = {While a large literature suggests an important role for political
   parties in development, this article is the first attempt to layout and
   test a comprehensive theory connecting parties to economic growth. The
   authors argue that strong parties broaden the constituencies to which
   policy-makers respond and help politicians solve coordination problems.
   These features help to ensure better economic management, public
   services, and political stability. And this, in turn, enhances economic
   growth. Drawing on a novel measure of party strength from the Varieties
   of Democracy data set, the authors test this theory on data drawn from
   more than 150 countries observed annually from 1901-2010. They identify
   a sizeable effect that is robust to various specifications, estimators,
   and samples. The effect operates in both democracies and autocracies,
   and is fairly stable across regions and time periods.},

Abstract = {We offer a model of how interest groups affect policy stability. The
   relationship between interest group density and policy volatility is
   concave because of two forces: (a) the number and interaction of
   interest groups in a policy domain and (b) the effect of this
   interaction on policy image and attention. After laying out the logics
   of both processes, we identify three ideal type situations: (a) capture
   (low interest group density, low attention) and (b) deadlock (high
   interest group density, high attention) lead to low levels of policy
   volatility while (c) lability (medium interest group density,
   intermittent attention) leads to high levels of policy volatility. For
   our empirical evidence, we rely on all budget functions in the American
   states from 1984 to 2010 and employ generalized additive regression
   modeling. The article contributes to the literature on understanding
   interest group strategies, interest group influence in policy making,
   and broader questions of deliberative democracy.},

Abstract = {Policy learning is an attractive proposition, but who learns and for
   what purposes? Can we learn the wrong lesson? And why do so many
   attempts to learn what works often fail? In this article, we provide
   three lessons. First, there are four different modes in which
   constellations of actors learn. Hence our propositions about learning
   are conditional on which of the four contexts we refer to. Second,
   policy learning does not just happen; there are specific hindrances and
   triggers. Thus, learning can be facilitated by knowing the mechanisms to
   activate and the likely obstacles. Third, learning itself is a
   conditional final aim: although the official aspiration of public
   organisations and politicians is to improve on public policy, policy
   learning can also be dysfunctional - for an organisation, a policy, a
   constellation of actors or even democracy.},

Abstract = {Creating new government levels through structural reforms also changes
   the settings of institutional participation. In this article,
   institutional participation is scrutinized as a question of legitimacy
   in changing local government by focusing on the effects of creating
   regional self-government. To investigate this question, this article
   utilizes a triangulation of data and methods through statistics, a
   survey and interviews. By considering many viewpoints, it is possible to
   create a general view on the diverse interpretations of the question.
   The study shows that structural reforms not only change the structures
   of participation but also require organizational ``sponginess{''} for
   citizen involvement in order to create a new, legitimate government
   level.},

Abstract = {The hedge fund industry is one of the most lucrative and powerful
   industries in the USA, yet it mostly comprises white men. To understand
   why, I turn to Weber's theory of patrimonialism, which primarily has
   been applied to historical or non-Western societies. I argue that
   patrimonialism-activated through trust, loyalty and tradition-restricts
   access to financial rewards and facilitates the reproduction of the
   white male domination of this industry. Using data from 45 in-depth
   interviews combined with field observations at industry events over a
   4-year period, I investigate how hiring, grooming and seeding practices
   within and among firms enable certain elites to maintain monopolies over
   financial resources. Applying the theory of patrimonialism to a context
   with few women and minority men in power-holding positions demonstrates
   how practices that reproduce elite structures are directly connected to
   inequality in the workplace.},

Abstract = {`Afropolitanism' has become a disputed term referring to diverse
   engagements by Africans who are typically members of the cultural elite
   and participate in diaspora politics, online activism, fashion and
   literature debates. Simultaneously, in discussions of development aid,
   celebrity has become a way of mediating between proximity and distance
   in imagining relationships between South and North. Afropolitanism can
   be usefully considered as an Africa-specific, post-colonial form of
   cosmopolitanism that spans discourses of elite pan-African culture to
   theories of elite global aid culture. We argue that there are essential
   connections between the rise of Afropolitanism and the celebritization
   of North-South relations. In this realm, `Afropolitanism' is an idea
   combining cosmopolitanism's notions of kindness to strangers in a world
   where the `kindness' is aid and the `strangers' are Africans. We analyse
   two archetypical Afropolitan performances by Danish aid celebrities to
   argue that their representations of Africa's external relations are
   theoretically more interesting, and politically more dangerous, than is
   currently understood. In doing so, we expand the debates around
   Afropolitanism and celebritization from the realm of cultural politics
   to one of International Relations.},

Abstract = {This paper captures the processes by which the French revolutionary and
   Napoleonic wars redefined enduringly the logics of interaction between
   Prussia/Germany and France. It explains transformations of power,
   political imagination and social organisation that are key to
   understanding the `special' nature of contemporary German-French
   relations. The paper finds that historical and international relations
   narratives fail to address the entire range of system-level
   transformations in the international order. Making use of approaches and
   concepts such as liminality, communitas, mimetic theory and the sacred,
   this paper proposes a novel, political anthropological perspective on
   such transformations, conceiving them as the interlocking of mimetic
   binds. First, I present wars and revolutions as liminal moments of
   collective threshold experiences. Second, I show how the liminal process
   functions at the international system-level. Third, I explain the
   challenge that the approach of liminality is posing to theories of
   international and systemic change. Fourth, I analyse the liminal process
   in Prussia and show how the said wars brought the French and the
   Prussians/Germans in a long-term mimetic rivalry. Finally, I argue that
   the proposed theoretical framework can take the research on
   international institutions and nationalism beyond the narratives of
   sociology, political science and historical studies.},

Abstract = {This study tests the effect of studying public administration and
   self-reported Public Service Motivation (PSM) on risk preferences. We
   conduct a compound lottery choice experiment with monetary rewards to
   measure risk behavior and a post-experiment survey to measure risk
   attitudes and PSM on three student subject pools. Empirical findings
   suggest that: First, students of public administration consider
   themselves more risk averse, but they do not behave more risk averse in
   the compound lottery choice experiment than business sciences and law
   students. Second, self-reported PSM is positively associated with
   risk-averse behavior in the compound lottery choice experiment. Thus,
   contrary to the popular stereotypical description of bureaucratic
   behavior, there are no substantive differences in risk behavior among
   future bureaucrats compared to other student groups.},

Abstract = {Strategic initiatives represent a government's response to constituent
   and organizational needs, but are only effective if properly
   implemented. In local governments with a council-manager form of
   government, city managers face a unique dilemma as compounding
   challenges of implementation often require them to step into leadership
   roles typically reserved for elected officials. For this qualitative
   study, 16 city managers and project leaders from US local governments
   were interviewed regarding the implementation of nine varied strategic
   initiatives. The responses indicate that city managers play an important
   dual role in implementationfirst, monitoring the progress of the
   implementation team and the satisfaction of the stakeholder coalition;
   and second, choosing to intervene directly in implementation
   decision-making when they observe missteps by the implementers or
   discontent from the stakeholders. These conclusions contribute to the
   practice perspective of strategic management theory and a better
   understanding of the institutional leadership role of city managers.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this article, which focuses on how migrants' countries of
   origin and countries of transit contribute to the fight against
   irregular immigration in Europe, is to analyze how these actors
   intervene in the management of migration flows and border control, and
   the resulting impact on the rights of economic migrants and asylum
   seekers, despite their clear difference in status. We demonstrate that
   the means and measures taken by third countries in the context of the
   European Union's fight against irregular immigration not only help
   foster this distinction between economic migrants and asylum seekers,
   but also lead to violations of their fundamental rights.},

Abstract = {We discuss the political economic development of. Romania since 1989,
   with a focus on the evolution of higher education (HE). First, we place
   this evolution in the context of demand for. HE by prospective students
   and employers, focusing on the low demand for skills in the
   MNC-dominated Romanian economy. Second, we provide empirical insight on
   indicators of quality, enrolment, and funding as key features of the HE,
   system. We argue that Romania has evolved into a dependent market
   economy entrenched in a low-skills equilibrium, and that the weakness of
   the HE system is a key element in this process. (C) 2018 The Regents of

Volume = {40},
Number = {1},

Abstract = {Recent intellectual histories about the emergence of human rights ideas
   in the 1970s stress how they became a plausible utopia when others
   failed. In these accounts, human rights replaced Socialist revolution or
   armed insurgency with a moral language that sought to transcend politics
   and the state. This article argues that this story loses sight of some
   processes that took place in other places of the Global South where the
   dreams of armed revolution and Socialism did not fade away so easily.
   Examining the Colombian case, this article shows how human rights ideas
   emerged within the framework of a contested political environment where
   revolutionary and democratic readings of human rights coexisted at least
   until 1980.},

   Abu Mohammad al-Maqdisi},
Journal = {STUDIES IN CONFLICT \& TERRORISM},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {41},
Number = {9},
Pages = {736-754},
Abstract = {Abu Mohammad al-Maqdisi is one of the most important spiritual fathers
   of the ideology and movement that has come to be known as
   Salafi-jihadism. Based on primary source materials produced by
   al-Maqdisi and other important relevant actors at different times and
   places, this article shows how he developed the ideas that have
   influenced his disciples and proteges, most prominently Abu Mus'ab
   al-Zarqawi, the founder of Al Qaeda in Iraq and godfather of the Islamic
   State, and Turki al-Binali, the Islamic State's current Grand Mufti. It
   also explains how and why, in later years, his disciples turned against
   him and, despite his repeated efforts, refused to allow him to play the
   role of the critical friend, much less regain control of the movement.
   The article seeks to expose the intra-jihadist frictions and debates
   involving al-Maqdisi during different times and contexts, especially the
   more recent ones between him and Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant.
   Indeed, it becomes obvious how al-Maqdisi has been trying to regain his
   lost influence and relevance among the most radical strands within his
   chosen movement for years. What this shows is that, amidst the
   fast-changing environment in which Salafi-jihadism has evolved, praxis
   trumps theory, and a reputation of steadfastness, zealousness, and
   unwavering convictions matter more to prospective radicals than a
   reputation of religious knowledge and scholarship.},

Abstract = {The present special issue brings together papers that focus on relevant
   theoretical perspectives and empirical research concerning individual
   and collective processes of radicalization, and social dynamics and
   conflicts associated with them. It also examines strategies to prevent
   the initiation of such processes and thereby connects analyses and
   transfer. Eight articles advance the current state of the art with
   regard to three aspects of radicalization within the context of Islamist
   terrorism, namely: 1) radicalization as a relational process; 2) social
   challenges and the role of foreign policy; and 3) prevention strategies.
   Together they represent important current empirical studies and point to
   directions where research is urgently needed.},

Abstract = {This article deals with the advent of a narrative on environmental
   policy success. While a positivist position would begin by determining a
   certain number of supposedly objective criteria of success, we consider
   success as the result of a process aiming at stabilizing a particular
   interpretation of a situation. We study the case of a French lagoon
   presented by many actors as a success in terms of watershed and
   environmental management. We seek to analyze how this narrative on
   success was built and became dominant thanks to the intervention of
   particular actors and how, in return, these actors managed to reinforce
   their domination, both in the territory under study and in the water
   policy sector in France.},

Pages = {249-264},
Abstract = {This article seeks to offer an overview of the structures of democratic
   legitimisation in EU economic governance, and to consider their
   adequacy, examining in particular the question of the extent of
   parliamentary participation in such governance. Although much progress
   has been made in establishing throughput legitimacy and creating
   processes furthering the interests of accountability, transparency and
   efficacy, it will be seen that considerable deficiencies continue to
   exist, at both European and member state level.},

Abstract = {What explains the variation in states' nonstate partners in civil
   warfare? States often use nonstate actors to do what their regular
   military forces cannot do well - navigate the local population. Some of
   their nonstate partners are ordinary civilians, while others are
   battle-hardened fighters with a rebellious or criminal past. The choice
   of proxy carries serious implications for the patterns and effects of
   violence during civil war, human rights, and international security.
   This article is the first to disaggregate the nonstate counterinsurgents
   and offer an explanation for why and how states use each type. It brings
   together the politics of collaboration with the politics of
   exploitation. The article shows that the state's use of nonstate proxies
   is shaped by the supply of willing collaborators, the state's ability to
   exercise control over them, and the trade-offs underlying the use of the
   different types of nonstate actors. The empirical evidence used to
   support this argument comes from a novel, comparative study of Turkey's
   counterinsurgency campaign against Kurdish separatists and India's
   counterinsurgency against Kashmiri separatists. The original data were
   collected through fieldwork in the disputed territories of each country.},

Volume = {121},

Abstract = {This contribution clarifies and further elaborates the complex nature of
   the relationship between emotion and reason in Aristotle's philosophy. A
   lexical-conceptual analysis of key-concepts in De Anima (sensation,
   affection, fear/pity, appetite/desire and impulse) highlights
   Aristotle's view on the role of emotions in cognitive processes.
   Aristotle's assumption of continuity between mind and body (ontological
   continuity) and his view on the cognitive relevance of emotion
   (teleonomy) are foundational for his complex model of reason merging
   biological and cognitive processes (circular anthropology). The
   interaction between evaluative levels and emotive factors in cognitive
   processes as conceived by Aristotle is fundamentally different from the
   modernist Cartesian perspective, but is surprisingly modern when
   compared with particular contemporary perspectives.},

Title = {Structure hypothesis of authoritarian rule: evidence from the lifespans
   of China's dynasties},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CHINESE GOVERNANCE},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {3},
Number = {1},
Pages = {1-24},
Abstract = {Scholars on authoritarianism in China have found that authoritarian
   resilience is partly derived from the ruling structure contained in the
   authoritarianism which is also known as the structure of `officials
   governed by the central government, people governed by local
   governments' or the `ruling structure of the system of prefectures and
   counties'. Under such ruling structure, the central government, by
   implementing centralized governance of its officials and decentralized
   governance of its people, is able to control social and agency risks.
   Hence, this structure helps the central government to maintain its
   authoritarian rule and the stability of the state in the long run. This
   paper summarizes the above point of view into the `structure hypothesis
   of authoritarian rule': for a large-scale authoritarian state with a
   vast territory and a large population, if it establishes the system of
   prefectures and counties as its ruling structure, it will enjoy a high
   degree of stability; on the contrary, if it deviates from the system of
   prefectures and counties, the country may be less stable. This paper
   provides new evidence for this hypothesis based on the lifespans of
   China's major dynasties.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF EUROPEAN PUBLIC POLICY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {25},
Number = {9},
Pages = {1336-1356},
Abstract = {It has convincingly been argued that in the United States, immigration
   is detrimental to welfare state support. In Europe, on the other hand,
   there is little evidence for such a negative relationship. This article
   examines whether a particular type of immigration - rapidly escalating
   intra-European Union (EU) immigration - reduces public support for the
   welfare state. We argue that because EU states cannot discriminate
   against resident EU nationals from other countries in the field of
   social security, intra-EU immigration will negatively affect attitudes
   towards welfare spending. To test this expectation, we use data from the
   European Social Survey of 2008, among other sources. The results of our
   multilevel analyses document a negative relationship between intra-EU
   immigration and welfare state support, supporting our hypothesis.},

   multi-session simulation},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONFLICT MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {29},
Number = {1},
Pages = {47-69},
Abstract = {Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to empirically examine the role
   of relationality in buyer-supplier negotiations and how it varies across
   cultural settings.
   Design/methodology/approach - Using a multisession simulation design,
   this study recruited research participants (n = 82) from diverse
   cultural backgrounds to play the role of either buyer or supplier for
   two negotiation tasks. Regression analyses were used to test the
   relationships among relational constructs as well as the moderating role
   of relational culture.
   Findings - Results show that negotiators' relational self-construal
   enhances their relational commitment to the ongoing negotiations, which
   leads to a higher level of relational capital accumulated at the end of
   negotiations. The impact of relational self-construal on relational
   commitment and that of relational commitment on counterparts' relational
   capital are stronger for negotiators from a high (as opposed to low)
   relational cultural background. Furthermore, intercultural negotiation
   context, when compared with intracultural context, weakens the impact of
   relational commitment on relational capital.
   Originality/value - This research is among the first to empirically
   examine the culturally varied relationality in negotiations. The
   findings offer important theoretical and practical implications
   regarding how relationality, when interacting with cultural factors, has
   varying impacts on business negotiations.},

Abstract = {Purpose This study aims to examine the theoretical links among three
   important variables by empirically testing the cases of two
   international brands.
   Design/methodology/approach By using a comparative case study design,
   this study conducts a content analysis of a total of 490 Facebook
   comments regarding online confrontational crises: Dolce \& Gabbana's
   photo fiasco and Laneige's discriminative sales incident.
   Findings The findings suggest that when evaluating whether or not a
   company has shouldered responsibility in online confrontational crises,
   social media users tend to be more influenced by how timely, active and
   consistent the organization's reaction is than by the organization's
   mere use of concession crisis communication strategies (CCSs). The
   individual-level perception (perceived degree of organizational crisis
   responsibility-taking) is a stronger predictor of social media users'
   reaction than organization strategies. The earlier that social media
   user has a perceived improvement in the organization, the more effective
   is the organization's strategy to minimize the effects of social media
   as crisis mobilizer.
   Originality/value This study confirms theories formulated in a Western
   context with actual cases from Eastern cultures. Theoretically, this
   study sheds light on the importance of the individual-level perception
   for effective use of organization strategy in crisis. This study also
   suggests the relative significance of positive forms of crisis response,
   concessions CCSs and their relationship with the perceived degree of
   crisis responsibility-taking.},

   reassessing Europeanisation in Estonia and Latvia},
Journal = {EAST EUROPEAN POLITICS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {34},

Pages = {317-336},
Abstract = {This article contributes to the growing debate on democratic backsliding
   in Central and Eastern Europe (CEE), by expanding on Bela Greskovits's
   distinction between backsliding and hollowness, suggesting ways to
   broaden and specify the concept of hollowness, and discussing the
   relationship between hollowness and backsliding. Estonia and Latvia
   provide illustrations of two stable democracies, which nevertheless have
   consolidated tendencies for an elite-driven and ethnic-majority-driven
   democratic process hollowed out of its democratic contestation. This is
   what I call ``technocratic{''} and ``ethnic{''} hollowness. This double
   hollowness consolidated during EU accession, which created a favourable
   context for well-positioned ethnic majority elites to push forward
   ethnocentric and neoliberal agendas while restricting the space for
   debating them. However, far from a symptom of backsliding in the sense
   of a regression into authoritarianism, double hollowness is in fact
   central to these democracies' stability. Such stability will have to be
   destabilised in order to improve their democratic quality.},

   The Case of Spain},
Journal = {ETHNOPOLITICS},

Pages = {165-180},
Abstract = {The Moreno Question-or Subjective National Identity Scale (SNIS)-is
   frequently used to study ethno-territorial claims and conflicts. Its
   origin and development are not so well-known. The SNIS was first
   implemented in Spain, in the late 1960s, and scale data have been
   gathered regularly since then. While the relevant definition of
   `national' has been a constant source of controversy, the SNIS measure
   has systematically found duality predominating across the country.
   Focussing on SNIS methodology and its impact on data and interpretation,
   this article investigates the scale's psychometric and sociological
   features, including structure and wording. That the scale tends to
   inflate dual responses has already been noted elsewhere but the
   interpretation of this duality, in terms of individual national
   sentiments, is still too readily accepted. The scale's identity
   adjectives and their use in social science are insufficiently analysed,
   especially as pertains to Spain. Further analysis could also be of
   relevance for other plurinational states and ethno-political contexts.},

Title = {Predictors of participation in protest in the Philippines},
Journal = {PHILIPPINE POLITICAL SCIENCE JOURNAL},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {39},
Number = {3},
Pages = {155-178},
Abstract = {Social movement theory links protest to psychological (grievance, system
   justification, uncertainty salience), strategic (costs, trust, norms),
   resource-based (sex, age, income, group membership, political interest,
   media consumption), and structural (political opportunity structures)
   predictors. This paper answers the question, Why do people protest in
   the Philippines? by assessing whether these variables predict protest in
   the Philippines using data from the 2012 World Values Survey.
   Specifically, it tests the following hypotheses: (1) more altruistic
   people are more likely to engage in protest; (2) more trusting
   respondents are more likely to engage in protest; (3) the relationship
   between trust and protest differ among active group members, non-active
   group members, and non-members; and (4) the association between trust
   and protest and between altruism and protest will differ between low-
   and high-cost protests. Estimates using binary logistic regression
   suggest that sex, group membership, political interest, and consumption
   of certain types of media consistently predict participation in protest.
   In addition, there is also evidence that factors that predict high-cost
   protest action do not predict low-cost protest action. Lastly, trust and
   system justification were also found to predict protest but in
   directions opposite those established by previous research.},

Abstract = {This study seeks to empirically examine the impact of research funding
   for academic researchers on their research performance in the areas of
   natural science, engineering, agriculture and fishery science, and
   medicine and pharmacology in South Korea. Specifically, this study
   analyzed the research performance of 32,064 academic researchers based
   on their patent applications, patent registrations, and research
   articles published in academic journals in the year 2010. Descriptive
   statistics and regression analysis showed that various forms of research
   funding have a significant effect on their research performance. The
   results of this study also showed that the attributes of academic
   researchers, such as gender, age, where their PhD was completed, and
   major, have an influence on their research performance.},

Abstract = {Following the adoption of Eurocrisis Law, the European Parliament (EP)
   has been strongly empowered in the Economic and Monetary Union. It may
   intervene mostly in three ways: by the means of control mechanisms
   around Euro summits, during Economic Dialogues and in the framework of
   the European Parliamentary Week and the Interparliamentary conference on
   Stability, Economic Coordination and Governance. An analysis of the
   practice reveals however that thus far this empowerment has remained
   largely theoretical; The EP could still better exploit the potential of
   its newly attributed capacities.The reform proposals currently under
   discussion were found to bear some potential if adequately used, despite
   being (still) of a soft nature like the ones currently existing.},

Abstract = {In response to changing geopolitical circumstances and the fiscal
   austerity in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis, many think tank
   donors have considered expanding their funding options to include new
   policy actors in order to achieve the same (or greater) policy impact on
   a more limited budget. This article reviews one case of donor assistance
   to support policy hybrid organizations in the Western Balkans and the
   former Soviet Union. While generally successful in helping a number of
   local organizations to become policy relevant, the experience provides a
   series of lessons for foreign donors. It also seeks to marry these
   insights with a new funding reality, which combines less money available
   for supporting policy research with greater pressure for that research
   to be responsive and influential.},

   vocation, deriving from their intellectual genius, from their moral
   virtue, from their character, from the force and the persistency of
   will{''}. These words, pronounced by the Italian Minister of Justice
   Giuseppe Zanardelli during the foundation stone-laying ceremony of the
   Palace of Justice (now seat of the Supreme Court of Cassation) in 1889,
   summarize his ideological program: to make the law one of the
   cornerstones of unified Italy (1861) with Rome, and especially its
   glorious and lay legal tradition, as its geographical as well as
   ideological center. During his long service as Minister of Justice,
   Zanardelli demonstrated his faith in law as a tool for unifying
   territories and people, realizing two great works: the first Italian
   Criminal Code and the Palace of Justice. This chapter aims to describe
   the events that led to the definition of the very peculiar
   iconographical plan of the Italian Supreme Court building, meaningfully
   known to the people of Rome as er Palazzaccio: ``the bad palace{''}.},

Abstract = {The Constitution, as fundamental, formal law, needs some form of
   representation in order to gain validity. This chapter demonstrates
   that, apart from using symbols such as tables of the law, artists
   alternatively chose for an artistic device, for which the name DCM
   (Decisive Constitutional Moment) is put forward. This device entails the
   selection and depiction of a specific, pivotal moment from
   constitutional history. The definition of this device consists of three
   parts, drawing on existing theory about the decisive moment by
   photographer Henri Cartier-Bresson, the constitutional moment of legal
   scholar Bruce Ackerman, and the depiction and narration of a history and
   a moment in visual art, with particular attention for the relationship
   between the depicted moment and the moment of depiction. The chapter's
   focus is on works of art from the long nineteenth century, the age of
   revolution, Constitution and a new idiom in art history in which artist
   took scenes from contemporary life as subject matter, thus combining a
   journalistic eyewitness account with an academic style. Looking into the
   main artistic media of this era and their use in DCMs allows for a
   better understanding of the legitimizing function of the art works under
   scrutiny. The chapter further develops with an elaborate study of the
   design entries for the 1849 competition for a constitutional monument in
   Brussels, Belgium, which demonstrates the variety of possible decisive
   constitutional moments and the challenges which artists faced when
   including them in their designs.},

Abstract = {This forum contribution discusses the increasing trend toward academic
   capitalism and profit-oriented entrepreneurial practices in the fields
   of education and research. This occurs as universities, in different
   ways and subject to greater or lesser financial, administrative, and
   ideological pressures, act less like centers of disinterested education
   and research and more like economic enterprises that aim to maximize
   their revenues and/or advance the economic competitiveness of the spaces
   in which they operate. This development has become more global thanks to
   intensi fying competition among relevant institutions (reflected, inter
   alio., in international accreditation for teaching and international
   rankings or research), intensified competition between the wider
   economic and political spaces in which they are embedded, and the
   `me-too-ism' that leads social actors to jump on the lates bandwagon. I
   also consider the expansion of predatory academic apitalism and, because
   this is the least familiar type, I use my limited space to illustrate
   this rather than the more widely discussed examples of academic
   capitalism and entrepreneurialism (further examples of all case are
   presented in Jessop 2017)},

Abstract = {This article examines local contestation against the European Union Rule
   of Law Mission in Kosovo (EULEX), manifesting itself in local actors
   publicly demanding a change in the mission's mandate and/or its
   operations. The article investigates how EULEX's actions and its
   effectiveness are perceived and reacted upon by the local actors. It
   shows that local contestation is mainly fueled by (1) conflicting
   sovereignty claims by the majority Albanians and the minority Serbs; (2)
   the understanding of sovereignty by parts of society as entailing
   exclusive authority; and (3) dissatisfaction with the mission's
   effectiveness. By addressing EULEX from a bottom-up perspective-that of
   the local actors-the article underlines the limitations of EU policies
   in post-conflict Kosovo.},

   Interdependence?},

Abstract = {The nexus between trade and peace has been an important and
   controversial topic among international relations analysts. The phrase
   `trade promotes peace', mostly associated with liberal scholars, became
   rather relevant in the post-Cold War period, linking increased trade
   with peace-building and comprehensive improvement of relations between
   parties in conflict. In this paper, the authors argue that Serbia-Kosovo
   trade interdependence has played a very limited role in the
   peace-building process. Using data available since 2000, the authors
   find that relatively stable trade relations and an improved
   institutional free-trade framework (CEFTA 2006) has failed to prevent
   major political disputes between Serbia and Kosovo (such as violence of
   2004 and promulgation of the Declaration of Independence in 2008). At
   the end, the article provides several alternative explanations as to why
   trade interdependence was not a key determinant for long-term peace
   between Serbia and Kosovo.},

Abstract = {The Good Friday or Belfast Agreement was reached just over 20 years ago.
   This article introduces a special issue devoted to appraising its
   subsequent trajectory. It provides a brief resume of the Agreement's
   contents as a peace agreement, and as a regional consociation with
   confederal and federal possibilities. The outworkings and partial
   implementation of the Agreement are reviewed against a theoretical
   appraisal of the circumstances under which consociations decay,
   organically dissolve, or definitively break down. Northern Ireland is
   not in these circumstances, yet. The impact of UK's referendum to leave
   the European Union (EU) is evaluated as well as `the year of the four
   votes' in 2016-2017, which have jointly left Northern Ireland without a
   functioning executive or Assembly, and politically divided over the
   minority UK Conservative government's plans to give effect to the
   referendum result-Northern Ireland voted to remain in the EU, and
   contrary to some suggestions, joint membership of the EU by the UK and
   Ireland was integral to the making and design of the 1998 Agreement.
   Future scenarios are sketched.},

Abstract = {The memoir Escape from Camp 14 tells the story of a camp-born North
   Korean prisoner. The deprived conditions in which he grew up give rise
   to hypotheses as to what must be present in our interactions as we are
   `political animals'. The chapter argues that the story of a childhood in
   the camp makes us think in a new way about the `capability of being
   partner in an association' that one who is without a city lacks. The
   chapter examines, in particular, what type of empathy could agree with
   Aristotle's statement that the city is by nature prior to individual.
   Projective empathy is discarded in this respect. Concepts close to
   empathy in Aristotle's works are surveyed: (1) feeling the same as a
   friend feels, (2) emotional contagion, (3) discernment, and (4)
   education from music. An Aristotelian concept of empathy is then
   defined. It is suggested in the chapter that in extreme cases the
   absence of empathy leads to the incapability of association, and an
   individual who lacks a minimal sense of empathy becomes an apolis.},

Title = {Enforcing the European Semester: the politics of asymmetric information
   in the excessive deficit and macroeconomic imbalance procedures},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF EUROPEAN PUBLIC POLICY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {25},
Number = {2},
Pages = {212-230},
Abstract = {The European Semester is an information-driven surveillance system that
   relies upon budgetary and economic statistics collected from the
   European Union's memberstates and analyzed by the European Commission.
   This is true for both the Excessive Deficit Procedure (EDP) and the
   Macroeconomic Imbalance Procedure (MIP). This article employs
   Principal-Agent theory to analyze the politics of asymmetric information
   in the EDP and MIP. The study explores how the statistical requirements
   of the Six-Pack have been enforced by the Commission and the Economic
   and Financial Affairs Council to strengthen the EDP, even as the
   statistical integrity of the MIP received less protection. The article
   examines how the misrepresentation of statistics by Spain's Autonomous
   Community of Valencia provoked the first financial sanction in the
   history of Economic and Monetary Union, as well as the Commission's
   unsuccessful efforts to strengthen the reliability of MIP statistics.},

Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL POLITICS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {27},
Number = {3},
Pages = {498-518},
Abstract = {European Union (EU) climate/energy targets and policies are poised for
   the first full climate policy cycle - from adoption and implementation
   of the policy package for 2020, to reform for 2030. A dynamic approach
   to the ways in which EU policies affect policy development is developed
   by applying theories of domestic implementation, policy feedback and
   integration. Implementation experiences in Poland - the least climate
   ambitious' EU member state - affected Polish preferences for reformed EU
   policies. Existing EU policies, their fit' with Poland's energy
   interests and change in anticipation of future EU policies explain much
   of the variation in preferences. Second, policy feedback from Poland
   significantly affected the EU 2030 climate and energy framework. As yet,
   the EU has succeeded only partly in gathering momentum through a
   snowball' effect whereby positive policy feedback from implementation
   generates further steps.},

Abstract = {The relationship between the Euro crisis and austerity policies is often
   understood in terms of broadly deterministic explanations centred around
   economic imperatives and, in the case of bailed out countries, the
   conditionality of international lenders. Applying a multi-lens framework
   of depoliticisation to the case of Portugal between 2011 and 2015, this
   article instead refocuses analysis on the discourse employed by national
   politicians, in their construction of crisis narratives, to build the
   political authority to pass reforms. The Portuguese case is particularly
   effective at demonstrating how depoliticisation, `relocates politics and
   the political rather than annihilating it'.},

Title = {Engineering world society? Scientists, internationalism, and the advent

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL POLITICS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {55},

Pages = {73-90},

Abstract = {In recent years, there has been a growing interest in the English School
   concept of world society and how it helps to illustrate the role of
   non-state actors and the promotion of cosmopolitan values. Yet, less
   attention has been paid to the idea of science and technology as a key
   feature of solidarist conceptions of justice and as a unifier of
   humankind, usually expressed in the form of scientific internationalism.
   The purpose of this article is twofold. First, it suggests that it is
   important to incorporate the role of scientists and engineers as agents
   of international society and to assess the significance of scientific
   internationalism in terms of its impact on facilitating world society.
   Second, however, it is also necessary to consider how this solidarist
   conception of science and technology is staged as complementary to a
   pluralist logic. This is because of the political and social
   embeddedness of scientists and engineers as actors who also think and
   act on behalf of the state. I develop this argument by examining two key
   turning points that paved the way towards the advent of the Space Age:
   the spaceflight movement of the 1920s and 1930s and the 1957-1958
   International Geophysical Year.},

Abstract = {Despite controversies about ``new intergovernmentalism{''}, most
   scholars agree that the Commission has recently lost influence in
   European affairs. This raises the question whether Commission presidents
   can still exert political leadership. Such leadership aims at shaping EU
   policy-making and deepening integration. In the present situation, it
   might also focus on strengthening the position of the Commission. This
   chapter explores the leadership performance of Jean-Claude Juncker as
   Commission president. It questions whether and to which extent Juncker
   pursues the three goals mentioned above. Drawing on leadership theory
   and recent insights into leadership at European level, the paper
   elaborates an analytical framework focused on Juncker's performance.
   Empirically, the chapter analyses Juncker's performance in using
   strategically his agenda-setting and procedural powers for shaping EU
   policy-making, deepening integration and strengthening the position of
   the Commission. It concludes that Juncker, in face of multiple
   constraints, introduced a new, more political leadership style, marked
   by boldly restoring the Commission's role as `motor of integration', yet
   adopting an open and conciliatory stance vis-a-vis the European Council
   and, more broadly, potential followers.},

   organisations have been deproscribed, and the UK government has resisted
   the periodic revision of listings and changes to the procedures for
   challenge and removal. The paper will consider the effectiveness and
   fairness of UK law in regard to the persistence of proscription, having

Abstract = {This article examines the role played by five independent commissions
   which managed contentious issues in post-Good Friday Agreement Northern
   Ireland. It finds that external or international actors can play a very
   useful role during the implementation of consociational arrangements.
   The commissions were most successful when they combined international
   involvement with local composition in keeping with consociational
   principles. Weak or nonexistence international input and behaviours
   which were not in keeping with consociational principles undermined the
   commissions and resulted in the failure of the commissions to resolve
   their respective issues.},

Pages = {239-257},
Abstract = {Since coming to power in 2002, AKP has exerted a range of legal and
   financial pressures on critical media organisations and professionals,
   including acts of direct intervention. While the growing literature on
   Turkey's media system has explored the influence of political and
   economic pressures on media freedoms, recent developments necessitate a
   re-examination that tackles the upsurge of direct government
   intervention in the country's commercial media landscape. Through the
   framework of media capture, this article analyses the disciplinary
   strategies deployed by AKP and argues that the party's media capture at
   recent political junctures (Gezi protests, corruption scandal, coup
   attempt) is continuous with its past policies and practices and does not
   necessarily represent an authoritarian turn'.},

Title = {Governance conflict in Chinese family firms: Managed by family-based
   managers or external managers?},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONFLICT MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {29},
Number = {4},
Pages = {446-469},
Abstract = {Purpose According to the real environment of China, the authors collect
   micro data about Chinese family firms (FFs) to explain why some Chinese
   FFs still tend to introduce external managers though they have to face
   governance conflict between family-based managers and external managers.
   Design/methodology/approach This study analyzes the effect of governance
   conflict between family-based managers and external managers on firm
   performance by using ordinary least square test, which is also used to
   test which factor has influence on governance conflict's profit
   promotion effect.
   Findings This study finds that governance conflict significantly
   improves firm performance (profit promotion effect). The governance
   conflict caused by the introduction of external managers in Chinese FFs
   can significantly improve a firm's performance by raising its management
   efficiency and capital investment.
   Research limitations/implications The governance conflict of the family
   business needs to be further refined in following research. Besides,
   this study is only based on the empirical study of cross-section data.
   Originality/value Different from the existing related research is mainly
   based on the sample data of listed family enterprises, the China
   employer-employee matched survey data includes a large number of small
   and medium-sized FFs, and has obtained the actual situation of how many
   of the middle and senior managers are external not family members.},

   co-ordination in crisis and beyond},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF EUROPEAN PUBLIC POLICY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {25},
Number = {2},
Pages = {149-174},
Abstract = {This contribution analyses how EU social objectives and policy
   co-ordination have been integrated into the Union's post-crisis
   governance architecture. It argues that between 2011 and 2016, there was
   a partial but progressive `socialization' of the `European Semester' of
   policy co-ordination, in terms of increasing emphasis on social
   objectives in its priorities and key messages, including the
   Country-Specific Recommendations; intensified social monitoring and
   review of national reforms; and an enhanced decision-making role for EU
   social and employment actors. In explaining these developments, the
   contribution highlights the contribution of strategic agency, reflexive
   learning and creative adaptation by social and employment actors to the
   new institutional conditions of the Semester, building on recent
   theoretical work on `actor-centred constructivism' and the `usages of
   Europe'.},

Abstract = {Despite the growing attention given to community-based initiatives in
   the delivery of public services, little is known about their durability.
   This article focuses on Dutch community enterprises (CEs) as an emerging
   form of community-based initiatives in urban regeneration. Due to their
   self-organizing and (largely) voluntary character, CEs face considerable
   governance challenges to sustain activities over time. Based on the
   literature, we examine the interplay of four key conditions in relation
   to their durability: social capital, entrepreneurial community
   leadership, supportive relationships with institutional key players and
   a strong business model. Based on an fsQCA of 12 cases, the main
   conclusion is that the presence of social capital, strong
   entrepreneurial leadership and a strong business model is the most
   important configuration leading to a durable CE. Government support is
   not found to be a necessary or sufficient condition, but its absence is
   part of the explanation of non-durability.},

Abstract = {The transnational climate movement mobilized massively around the 2015
   Paris Climate Summit (COP21) - despite a growing consensus within the
   movement that the UN was unable to solve the climate crisis. Extensive
   ethnographic fieldwork is the basis for exploration of the profound
   effect this consensus had on the movement around and beyond COP21.
   Firstly, it facilitated a historic degree of unification within a
   previously divided movement, around a desire to focus less on
   influencing official negotiations, although the degree to which
   negotiations should be ignored, and what actions should focus on
   instead, created new cleavages. Secondly, organizers experienced that
   mobilizing around a summit whilst trying to ignore it is problematic,
   thus limiting strategic options and presenting an `efficacy dilemma'.
   This, finally, limited the movement's success, and fueled desires for a
   transnational climate movement beyond COPs. Whether those desires can be
   realized without the organizational benefits of summit mobilizations
   remains unanswered.},

Abstract = {China's increasing engagement in global financial governance since the
   2008 crisis has potentially significant ramifications for global
   financial rule-making and standard-setting. This article presents a
   novel analysis of China's growing influence on the international stage
   and its consequences for the financial rules and standards that
   constrain policy makers in developing countries. We draw upon literature
   from international political economy and development studies to develop
   a framework for assessing whether China's rise has catalyzed a shift in
   global financial governance towards a tailored approach that responds to
   country-specific developmental circumstances and needs. We argue that
   China's status as a rising power that still has idiosyncratic
   developmental priorities is leading it to push for rules and standards
   that are more flexible and sensitive to specific national development
   conditions. We illustrate this argument in three case studies, deploying
   the framework to explain variation in the post-crisis evolution of rules
   in prudential banking regulation, capital flow management, and debt
   sustainability surveillance.},

Abstract = {Leaders negotiate, not states. Yet the extensive body of work on
   coercive diplomacy in international relations pays little attention to
   variation among leaders. In contrast, we argue that individual-level
   attributes directly influence leaders' beliefs about their own military
   capabilities and, by extension, their selection of disputes.
   Specifically, leaders with combat experience and careers in national
   militaries are relatively better judges of their own military power. As
   a consequence, targets tend to take their threats more seriously. In
   contrast, leaders who have military careers but lack combat experience
   tend to be less selective in their demands and correspondingly less
   successful when they make threats. Similar patterns hold for those with
   rebel experience. Drawing on new data on leader attributes, we find
   strong evidence that these leader-level attributes influence both
   dispute and compellent threat reciprocation. This leader-level approach
   provides a new explanation for why some countries initiate disputes
   against determined adversaries who are likely to escalate rather than
   back down.},

Abstract = {Scientists believe that humanity has already crossed the core planetary
   boundary for climate change, and is closer to crossing thresholds that
   trigger abrupt and irreversible environmental changes. Consequently,
   academia and the international political community should not disregard
   the prospect of a catastrophic environmental event. However, discussions
   about climate change usually assume the resilience of potentially
   deteriorating terrestrial-biosphere carbon sinks and rarely acknowledge
   catastrophic climate risk. Reviewing the latest scientific evidence on
   anthropogenic climate change, as well as the current and projected
   threats to the resilience of key large forest biomes, and combining them
   with the profound political frailties of the Paris Climate Agreement,
   this article argues that catastrophic climate risk is much more serious
   and likely than most of humanity is able to perceive and should thus be
   seriously considered. It emphasizes the massive gap between science and
   political action and how cognitive, cultural, institutional, and
   political limitations hinder our capacity to envisage, prevent, and
   ultimately manage catastrophic climate change. The article concludes by
   briefly raising awareness regarding the role that academia should play
   in catastrophic climate risk reduction.},

Abstract = {In this article, we address the climate change issue through the lens of
   science diplomacy. We contribute to analyzing the mechanisms by which,
   in the international climate regime, the issues of science intermingle
   with those of diplomacy. We use the term `nexus' to designate the
   interactions between the dynamics of science itself and the dynamics of
   diplomacy. We focus on the critical role played by the IPCC in the
   formation of this nexus. We argue that the extent to which diplomats
   understand and use scientific knowledge as well as that the clashing of
   national interests during major negotiations can jeopardize science
   diplomacy effectiveness. We thus explain why the large consensus that
   exists among scientists about the origins and long-term risks of climate
   change does not translate into a consensus among diplomats over an
   appropriate course of action. These findings illustrate the limits of
   `science in diplomacy'.},

Abstract = {Spain was one of the first countries to ratify the European Charter of
   Local Autonomy. Not without some setbacks, its principles have gradually
   been incorporated into the Spanish legal system as the regional and
   state laws on local government have been implemented. Its hermeneutics
   value has undoubtedly proven to be important and the legislator has
   considered the principles contained in the Charter when developing local
   laws. Therefore, it can be assured at present that the level of
   implementation of local autonomy in Spain is reasonably in line with the
   principles stipulated in the Charter. However, local autonomy in Spain
   is possibly in a stage of regression at present times, mainly due to the
   effects of the way to face the financial and economic crisis. Spain,
   along with other Mediterranean countries, has been required to introduce
   harsh austerity and adjustment policies which particularly affect the
   local public sector. In this context, the main challenges which Spain
   would have to handle in order to fully extend and reinforce local
   autonomy to completely comply with the principles stipulated in the
   Charter are outlined in this article.},

Journal = {GLOBAL POLICY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {9},
Number = {2, SI},
Pages = {49-57},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Both global value chains and trade in differentiated goods have become
   increasingly important in the international economy. We argue that these
   two developments interact in changing the political economy of trade.
   For finished goods, product differentiation facilitates trade
   liberalization because the adjustment costs of liberalization are lower
   when countries trade varieties of the same good. By contrast, for goods
   that are used as inputs in the production process, product
   differentiation makes trade liberalization more difficult. We find
   support for this argument in two tests. On the one hand, we look at
   patterns of lobbying on US preferential trade agreements (PTAs). On the
   other hand, we use a data set with highly disaggregated tariff data from
   61 PTAs signed between 1995 and 2013. The paper contributes to the
   long-standing debates on endogenous tariff formation and the
   consequences of intra-industry trade, and a nascent literature on the
   relationship between global value chains and trade policy.},

Abstract = {The scientific literature recognizes the key role of innovation in any
   country's growth and economic development. We are facing a growth model
   based on knowledge and one of its most concrete expressions is
   technological innovation. It's therefore evident that the more capable
   countries in promoting efficiently the activities included in this
   paradigm will be the better positioned to create richness and increase
   their citizen's welfare. This objective poses important challenges and
   opportunities for those public and private actors that shape the
   national innovation system and are responsible for generating the
   necessary knowledge to innovate and for the system's governance. Through
   the review of the literature that analyzes the relations between public
   and private actors, this article concludes that collaboration between
   them is both necessary and beneficial. A conceptual framework is
   proposed to define public-private partnerships in the innovation field
   and to analyze the specific instruments of public intervention included
   in this concept.},

Abstract = {Sub-Saharan Africa's recent economic boom has raised hopes and
   expectations to lift the regions' `bottom millions' out of poverty by
   2030. How realistic is that goal? We approach this question by comparing
   the experiences of three front-runners of region-specific development
   trajectories - Britain's capital-intensive, Japan's labour-intensive,
   and Ghana's land-extensive growth path, highlighting some historical
   analogies that are relevant for Africa, but often overlooked in the
   current `Africa rising' debate. We draw particular attention to Africa's
   demographic boom and the possibilities for a quick transition to
   labour-intensive export-led industrialization. Although our exercise in
   diachronic comparative history offers little hope for poverty
   eradication by 2030, we do see broadened opportunities for sustained
   African economic growth in the longer term.},

Abstract = {This article aims to study the economic management of Spanish
   municipalities through the information of their budgets. The relevant
   expenditures items related to transparency and funding were identified
   in quest of sustainable and transparent quantitative indicators. The
   budget management of several public services is analyzed to disclose
   transparency. The analysis is based on published databases of the
   Ministry of Public Finance. As a conclusion transparency and tax-rate
   can be explained through specific items in the expenditure budget,
   providing a sound basis for stakeholder to make efficiency-based
   expenditure decisions using transparent indicators.},

Abstract = {Inequality is a major determinant of access to food in Sudan, with
   power, wealth and services concentrated within a central Sudan elite,
   leaving much of the country marginalized, impoverished and suffering
   repeated emergencies. This article discusses how food aid both
   contributed to the state's exclusionary development process and tried
   but failed to assist crisis-affected populations in its peripheries. In
   the 1950s, food aid explicitly aimed to support the state but from the
   late 1980s, emergency food aid bypassed the state and its manipulation
   led to economic and political benefits for the Sudan government and its
   closely-aligned private sector. By the 2000s, the Sudan government
   controlled international food aid and established its own food aid
   apparatus, which it could use to further its political and military
   goals. New resilience-based food technologies developed in the aftermath
   of the 2008 food crisis, and applied in Darfur, have unintentionally
   facilitated the government's strategies. This article argues that the
   `actually existing development' resulting indirectly from food aid has
   benefited the government and private sector but has left most people
   facing a protracted emergency.},

Abstract = {Municipal mergers have been widely used as a tool for administrative
   reform. The goal of most municipal mergers is to increase the efficiency
   of service provision, but their impact on local democracy has been
   neglected. In particular, little is known as to how mergers affect
   performance of local legislatures. In filling these gaps, this study
   uses a dataset of 754 Japanese city-level governments from 2008 to 2014
   to examine how mergers influence legislative performance. After
   controlling for potential confounding factors, the analysis shows that
   municipal merger is negatively correlated to legislative performance.},

Abstract = {Why is it so hard to get opposing elites to work together rather than to
   seek partisan gains and/or political survival? While the credible
   commitment problem is widely known, there are a number of lesser known
   obstacles to building trust and trustworthiness between opposing elites.
   This article presents an account of how some of those obstacles interact
   through time. Common institutional types, particularly winner-takes-all
   and power-sharing institutions, force trade-offs between agile responses
   in the short term and medium-term trust between elites, on the one hand,
   and between trust among elites in the medium term and the adaptability
   of agreements in the long term, on the other. We call this the time
   horizon trilemma'. As an alternative approach, we consider a variant on
   the two-person consulate used by the Roman Republic for more than 400
   years as Rome rose to prominence. In our variant, a turn-taking
   institution', opposing executives take short alternating turns as the
   ultimate decisionmaker within one term. We conduct behavioral games in
   the experimental lab to provide an initial estimate of the impact of
   these institutional types - winner-takes-all, requiring consensus only,
   requiring turn-taking only, or requiring both - on overcoming obstacles
   to agile responses in the short term, trust among elites in the medium
   term, and adaptability of agreements in the long term. We find that
   turn-taking is a promising alternative to solving the time horizon
   trilemma.},

Abstract = {Global collaborations across level, domain, and sector boundaries are on
   the rise. This article analyses policy entrepreneurship for the
   establishment of the Global Alliance for Climate-Smart Agriculture
   (GACSA), a global multi-actor collaboration to address climate change
   and foster food security and development. We explore policy
   entrepreneurship as a process embedded within specific contexts. To that
   end we focus on the strategizing process, consisting of conditions,
   activities, and implications. Through a congruence case study based on
   interviews, documents, survey, and observation we find that: (1)
   accommodating a varied global community requires flexibility and
   adaptability from entrepreneurs towards a dynamic and changing
   environment; (2) the variety of actors constituting GACSA compromises
   vigour of the collaboration, and confuses the meaning of CSA; (3)
   whereas collective entrepreneurship is often depicted as joint operation
   of multiple actors, it might also be characterized by conflicting
   activities and/or successive involvement; (4) policy entrepreneurship is
   useful to establish collaborations, but its role is temporary.
   Entrepreneurs must therefore be sensitive to their potential
   obsoleteness and withdraw at the right moment. Our results show that
   policy entrepreneurship is a useful lens to study global policy
   processes, while providing guidelines to inspire and support
   practitioners to engage with global policy processes.
   Policy Implications
   In a period characterized by complexity, policy entrepreneurs must be
   flexible and adaptive vis-a-a-vis their environment, to anticipate
   changing contextual circumstances.
   The umbrella term of climate-smart agriculture seems attractive to unite
   a variety of actors, but requires explicit and continuous consideration
   of contradictory interpretations to address conflicting viewpoints,
   interests and responsibilities.
   The promotion of climate-smart agriculture encompasses multiple and
   different instances of issue promotion and issue framing, to introduce
   and sell the concept to different audiences.
   The role of policy entrepreneurs is often temporary, therefore they must
   be sensitive to their potential obsoleteness, and know when to withdraw.},

Abstract = {While rumors predominate in conflict settings, researchers have not
   identified whether and why they influence the start of organized armed
   conflict. In this paper, we advance a new conceptualization of initial
   rebel group formation that aims to do so. We present a simple
   game-theoretic network model to show why the structure of trusted
   communication networks among civilians where rebel groups formwhich
   carry credible rumors about the rebelscan influence whether incipient
   rebels become viable. We argue further that in rural Sub-Saharan Africa,
   kinship network structures favorable to nascent rebels often underlie
   ethnically homogeneous localities, but not heterogeneous ones. In doing
   so, we advance a new explanation for why ethnicity influences conflict
   onset, and show why ethnic grievances may not be a necessary condition
   for the emergence of ethnic rebellion. We illustrate our arguments using
   new evidence from Uganda that provides a rare window into rebel group
   formation.},

Abstract = {This article examines public opinion toward sovereign debt disputes.
   Using evidence from multiple surveys fielded in Argentina- the country
   at the center of the most prominent legal dispute with foreign
   bondholders- we explore the sources of public support for debt
   repayment. Our evidence shows that economic self- interest and competing
   issue frames have little impact on attitudes toward debt repayment in
   Argentina. Individuals' opinions toward debt disputes are driven
   primarily by their longstanding symbolic attitudes. In particular,
   partisan identity and presidential approval provide the strongest
   predictors of attitudes toward debt repayment. We also show that
   partisanship has particularly strong effects for well- informed voters
   and in periods marked by abundant information about elite positions on
   this issue. This supports elite- cueing theories of public opinion.
   These findings may help explain why some governments refuse to settle
   economically costly disputes with their external creditors.},

Abstract = {An analysis of the semiotic and productive transformation of food crops
   under Argentina's agribusiness model through a study of the diffusion of
   the term commodity in the discourse produced/reproduced by the rural
   sections of the hegemonic media, combined with statistical data that
   allow a dialogue between discourse and measurable quantities, concludes
   that defining the Argentine countryside as a place for commodity
   production is linked with increasing crop production for export that
   leads to the erosion of food sovereignty and food security.},

Abstract = {The global dominance of the US dollar as the key currency of the
   post-Bretton Woods monetary system rests on the cooperation of private
   financial markets as well as foreign central banks. The latter, in
   particular, avoid the collapse of the dollar's value in periods of
   economic distress and bearish market cycles using two policies. One is
   the accumulation of more-than-necessary foreign exchange reserves
   denominated in US dollars. The second is following the Federal Reserve's
   interest-rate policy to assure a steady flow of investments towards the
   American market. This research focuses on this second practice in order
   to improve our still insufficient understanding of the actual drivers of
   foreign countries' reaction to the Fed's policy moves. The article
   contributes to the existing debates in international political economy
   regarding the determinants of macroeconomic adjustments among
   interdependent economies. Specifically, it assesses the role played, in
   this respect, by the relative size of a country's stock of foreign
   assets. According to the findings, corroborated through a within-between
   regression over a large panel of countries, in economies holding
   relatively less dollar-denominated securities monetary authorities are
   less prone to sacrifice an autonomous governance of interest rates for
   cushioning the consequences of imbalances in the global payment system.},

Abstract = {Harnessing the power of wind is commonly understood as a greencleaner
   and more sustainablealternative to conventional extractive practices. An
   examination of the unfolding of wind energy projects and their
   contestation in southern Mexico shows that, despite the seeming
   immateriality of wind farming, wind energy requires epistemological and
   material enclosures to capture its value. The unreflexive push for these
   energy frontiers ignores this requirement and, in doing so, sidesteps
   the processes of dispossession that follow the widening and deepening of
   capitalist relations, green or otherwise.},

Abstract = {California and Washington recently replaced traditional partisan
   elections with nonpartisan ``top-two{''} election procedures. Some
   reform advocates hoped that voters would behave in a way to support
   moderate candidates in the primary stage; the limited evidence for this
   behaviour has led some scholars to conclude that the reform has little
   chance to change meaningful policy outcomes. Yet we find that the
   nonpartisan procedure has predictable and disparate political
   consequences: the general elections between two candidates of the same
   party, called copartisan general elections, tend to occur in districts
   without any meaningful crossparty competition. Furthermore, copartisan
   elections are more likely to occur with open seats, when a new
   legislator will begin building a network of relationships. The results,
   viewed through the lens of the Advocacy Coalition Framework, suggest
   that opportunities exist for coalitional rearrangement over time.},

Abstract = {This article aims to bring changes in the public health community's
   understanding of essential surgery to the field of human rights. In
   2015, the World Health Assembly (WHA), the decision-making body of the
   World Health Organization, adopted a resolution recognizing essential
   surgery as a critical part of integrated primary health care. This
   reflected a paradigm shift in public health thinking about the provision
   of essential surgical care, one that aligns with recent data regarding
   effective mechanisms for targeting the global burden of disease and
   building health systems. But despite the WHA's declaration, essential
   surgery continues to be neglected in international organizations'
   understandings of the right to health. This article argues that the
   right to health should be interpreted to include a right to essential
   surgery in order to reflect data-driven research demonstrating the
   importance of surgery to larger health outcomes.},

Abstract = {All bodies of scholarship reflect societal mindsets and ideologies.
   Academic fields of geopolitical area studies exemplify this fact, having
   developed historically in response to the global objectives and related
   policy requirements of major nation-states over the past century and a
   half. In the case of Latin American area studies, the field was given
   decisive impetus by the Cold War, as were the related fields of Soviet
   and United States studies in each of the two contending superpowers.
   Discussion of a representative selection of Latin Americanists in the
   former USSR, their varied statuses within the Soviet academic
   establishment, and their professional relations with their U.S
   counterparts and of the development of Soviet Latin American area
   studies from the post-World War II years down to the demise of the USSR
   in the early 1990s makes clear that both Soviet and American academic
   establishments were constrained by Cold War political imperatives and
   accompanying mindsets that hampered but did not preclude the pursuit and
   achievement of genuine scholarship. Todos los campos de estudio reflejan
   mentalidades e ideologias sociales. Los campos academicos de los
   estudios geopoliticos dan ejemplo de esto, dado que se desarrollaron en
   respuesta a los objetivos globales y requisitos politicos pertinentes de
   las principales naciones-estado durante el ultimo siglo y medio. Los
   estudios sobre America Latina recibieron un impulso decisivo durante la
   Guerra Fria, junto con los estudios sovieticos y estadounidenses en cada
   una de las dos superpotencias contendientes. Un vistazo a una seleccion
   representativa de latinoamericanistas en la antigua URSS, sus variantes
   condiciones dentro del status quo academico sovietico, y sus relaciones
   profesionales con sus contrapartes estadounidenses, asi como al
   desarrollo de los estudios sovieticos sobre America Latina despues la
   Segunda Guerra Mundial y hasta la desaparicion de la URSS a principios
   de la decada de 1990, dejan en claro que tanto los establecimientos
   academicos sovieticos como estadounidenses estaban constrenidos por los
   imperativos politicos de la Guerra Fria y la mentalidad acompanante.
   Esto obstaculizaba, pero no impedia, la busqueda y el logro de autentica
   investigacion.},

Abstract = {The initial development of Latin American studies in Britain in the
   early 1960s resulted from the interest of pioneering academics in London
   and Cambridge and the Royal Institute of International Affairs.
   Alongside these academic efforts, the government's concerns about the
   declining role of British business in the region triggered the
   establishment of the Parry Committee in 1962. Reporting in 1965, this
   committee recommended the establishment of five government-financed
   Latin American centers, together with investment in training new Ph.D.
   students, especially in the social sciences. These younger scholars, who
   took the opportunity to do research and travel in Latin America, soon
   began to react more strongly against U.S. policy, economic inequality,
   and human rights abuses. In the 1970s, tensions between the older and
   newer generations became acute with the Pinochet coup and the dirty
   wars. Many academics thus distanced themselves from business and
   government in a way that the pioneers had not anticipated. El desarrollo
   inicial de los estudios latinoamericanos en Gran Bretana a principios de
   la decada de 1960 se debio al interes de academicos pioneros en Londres,
   Cambridge y el Instituto Real de Asuntos Internacionales. Junto con
   estas iniciativas academicas, la preocupacion gubernamental ante el
   declive de los negocios britanicos en la region dio lugar a la fundacion
   del Comite Parry en 1962. En su informe de 1965, dicho comite recomendo
   el establecimiento de cinco centros latinoamericanos financiados por el
   gobierno, asi como la formacion de nuevos estudiantes doctorales, sobre
   todo en el area de ciencias sociales. Estos academicos mas jovenes, que
   aprovecharon la oportunidad de estudiar en y viajar por America Latina,
   pronto comenzaron a reaccionar con mayor fuerza contra la politica de
   EE.UU., la desigualdad economica y los abusos contra los derechos
   humanos. En la decada de 1970, las tensiones entre las generaciones mas
   viejas y las nuevas se agudizaron con el golpe de estado de Pinochet y
   las guerras sucias. Muchos academicos se distanciaron entonces de los
   negocios y los asuntos del gobierno de una manera que los pioneros no
   habian previsto.},

Abstract = {The study responds to the growing call for a more systematic approach to
   research on organizational responses to extreme events. It develops and
   tests an integrated framework based on the organizational adaptation and
   learning theory to shed light on how public organizations manage
   exposure and vulnerability to extreme events. The analysis uses data
   from a 2016 national survey of top managers in the largest fixed-route
   public transit agencies in the United States and from other
   institutional sources to test hypotheses that link exposure to extreme
   events, impact, risk perception, and adaptive responses. We apply a
   structural model to disentangle the direct effect of exposure on
   adaptation as well as its indirect effects through impact and risk
   perception. Findings underscore the critical role that organizational
   risk perception has in converting environmental stimuli to
   organizational adaptive responses and point to a perception-mediated
   learning model of adaptation.},

Abstract = {Metropolization is a global trend that results from a scale adjustment
   process in the context of globalization. The fragmentation inherent to
   metropolis always raises problems for intergovernmental coordination.
   This paper analyzes the existing institutional structures at the macro
   level in Mexico and from them the type of intergovernmental relations
   and the capacity for coordinating policies and sharing resources for
   metropolitan planning and management. The argument is that the unusual
   magnitude of transformations that Mexican cities have experienced have
   not been problematized from a metropolitan governance perspective but
   until very recently. Thus, the reforms undertaken since 1976 have come
   slowly from deep-rooted thinking logics that allows few spaces for
   innovation and always insufficiently, especially from the perspective of
   the instruments to seek a greater and more effective coordination of
   planning and implementation of metropolitan policies. One conclusion is
   that although the new General Law on Human Settlements, Urban Planning
   and Urban Development enacted in November 2016 represents a step forward
   towards metropolitan integration it will not unleash intergovernmental
   collaboration on its own. Better designed instruments are to be
   developed in order to produce the necessary incentives to achieve the
   agreements that constitute the cement of the collaboration envisioned by
   the law itself. The article ends with a proposal for a research agenda
   on these issues.},

Abstract = {Policy-makers claim to support personalized approaches to improving the
   employability of disadvantaged groups. Yet, in liberal welfare states,
   mainstream activation programmes targeting these groups often deliver
   standardized, low-quality services. Such failures may be related to a
   governance and management regime that uses tightly defined contracting
   and performance targets to incentivize (mainly for-profit) service
   providers to move people into any job as quickly as possible. This
   article draws on evidence from third sector/public sector-led services
   in Scotland to discuss an alternative approach. These services
   co-produced personalized support in partnership with disadvantaged
   service users (in this case vulnerable lone parents). We suggest that,
   in this case, street-level co-production and personalization were
   facilitated by co-governance and co-management in the design and
   organization of provision. We conclude by identifying lessons for future
   employability services.},

Abstract = {Fundamental transformations in the distribution of power among nations
   have re-focused the attention of the International Relations (IR)
   subfield on how to understand change and power transitions. I add to
   this larger literature by presenting a typology of change drawn from
   comparative politics that incorporates attention to incremental or slow
   moving change, and path-dependence as a theoretical tool to explain
   discontinuous change such as wars, and the fall of the former Soviet
   Union. I offer a distinction between process of change and its outcome.
   Change may be incremental or disruptive and could lead to continuity
   with existing institutions or their transformation. This typology allows
   us to explore the process of change and develop theories of change in a
   new way. In essence, I argue for broadening our conceptions of change to
   account for endogenous sources of change (internal to the system), and
   incremental yet significant change.},

Abstract = {While ideology is a central concept in Vaclav Havel's master essay, at
   no point does he operate with a standard definition of the term.
   Instead, Havel defines ideology in metaphorical and performative terms,
   reframing our understanding of its meaning and power in the modern world
   by focusing on its pre-political operation. This point has yet to be
   appreciated by scholars of Havel. To better understand the import of
   Havel's approach, this essay details metaphorical contexts for ideology
   in The Power of the Powerless and draws connections to ideological
   performativity in Havel's plays from the 1970s as well as in the cinema
   of the Czech New Wave.},

Abstract = {This article offers a theoretical and empirical investigation of
   marginality of actors and ideas in democratic systems. We do so with
   respect to the extensive public debate that ensued from the Charlie
   Hebdo terrorist attacks of January 2015. Using content analytical data
   retrieved from The Guardian, we assess the degree and nature of
   marginality as indicated by the presence of different types of
   intervention in the public debate. Our findings show that women have
   very limited visibility; religious and minority groupsparticularly
   Muslimsare sidestepped; and actors challenging the dominant
   securitisation narrative are systematically neglected by those holding
   dominant positions. We argue for greater attention to the problem of
   marginality and introduce the Maximin principle of marginality as a
   means to address this issue in analyses of democratic systems.},

Abstract = {This article offers a novel understanding and theorization of
   humanitarian disarmament regimes and their related prohibition politics.
   In doing so, it utilizes a power-analytical framework and puts in use
   four conceptions of power: productive, structural, institutional, and
   compulsory. Empirically, two potent humanitarian prohibition regimes
   that have been formed during the last two decades are examined. The ban
   of anti-personnel landmines (APLs) in 1997 marked a significant shift in
   humanitarian disarmament. Consequently, a humanitarian disarmament model
   emerged, consisting in bypassing permanent arms-control fora ({''}The
   Ottawa Process''). The ascent of the model to the arena traditionally
   dominated by power interests of major powers and ossified lowest-common
   denominator consensus was confirmed in 2008 when cluster munitions (CMs)
   were prohibited in a very similar fashion ({''}The Oslo Process''). The
   main contribution to the topic is the application of the
   power-analytical framework specifically developed to suit an analysis of
   formation and workings of global prohibition regimes, including
   heterarchy-of-power discussion of the relationship between states and
   non-state actors. Then, instead of the usual-and flawed at best-heroic
   discussions of victories of global civil society in relation to the
   establishment of regimes, rise of moral International Relations, and
   supposed progressivist teleology, a more complex picture with many
   contradictions, artefacts, and their layering inside and about those
   regimes looms large.},

Abstract = {The formation of new state television outlets in Venezuela during the
   Chavez era was a process of dismantling and remaking hierarchies among
   social classes and between the fields of state and community media
   production. An analysis of the involvement of community media producers
   in creating a new state television outlet in Caracas and the
   collaboration between community and state producers in the first decade
   of the twenty-first century suggests that the influx of community media
   producers into state media projects and vice versa was mutually
   transformative. Such an analysis brings to the fore what vertical
   topographies of power obscure: the conflict and cooperation between
   different social sectors that were central to the making of both
   official and unofficial media projects aligned with the Chavez-led
   Bolivarian Revolution. In these joint efforts we see the state as an
   unfolding process of negotiation and struggle.},

Abstract = {Recent scholarship has found evidence that refugee flows may
   inadvertently contribute to the spread of conflict across borders.
   Little is known, however, about the spatial diffusion of conflict within
   a state's borders and what role internal displacement plays in such a
   dynamic. This question is of relevance because of the particular
   marginalization of internally displaced persons, which make them at risk
   of predation and militarization by armed groups. Drawing on a novel
   global data set on internal displacement, we evaluate this question and
   find evidence for a similar mechanism leading to conflict spread
   operating at the domestic level.},

Abstract = {The paper researches effects of local government revenue structure on
   income growth and employment in Croatia. The results confirm highly
   positive and significant effects of personal income taxation. This
   differs dramatically from the previous research based on central
   government level, which show that property and consumptions taxes are
   growth-friendly. The most probable explanation of such results could be
   in narrow revenue structure defined by the vertical fiscal equalisation
   and the fact that particular local revenue structure does not affect
   competitiveness in the same way as overall revenue structure of the
   country.},

Abstract = {What is the relationship between income inequality and redistributive
   policies? This question carries with it important implications for both
   scholars of comparative politics and for core political dynamics in
   contemporary world politics. We contend that the current literature
   fails to provide satisfactory answers. It generally does not acknowledge
   heterogeneity in the relationship between inequality and redistributive
   policies across space and time, nor does it use cross-nationally
   comparable data on government redistribution and income. In this note,
   we compare the relationship between inequality and redistribution over
   time, as well as among clusters of developed and less developed
   countries. We use a number of statistical models to address the
   complexity of the relationship. We find a positive, short-term
   association between inequality and redistribution, controlling for
   endogeneity between redistribution and market income inequality. We also
   find that, over the long term, inequality increases redistribution in
   developed democracies, but appears to decrease it in a number of
   developing nations.},

Abstract = {Bolivia has become a plurinational state, and as such it seeks to
   dismantle the deeply ingrained internal colonialism that runs through
   the state and the society. Thus it recognizes self-determination by
   indigenous people, autonomous territories, plural economy and justice,
   communal democracy, and suma qamana (living well) and identifies the
   indigenous as the main actors in the transformation process, sidelining
   both the working and the middle classes. Some of the contradictions at
   its core include views of development that range from extractivism to
   environmentalism and living well. The government claims to be oriented
   toward communitarian socialism, but developmentalism will entail the
   destruction of indigenous modes of survival that are considered
   culturally rich but backward from a Western perspective. The central
   indigenous actor of current government discourse has been pushed aside.
   The Bolivian process presents a way of building a more equal state and a
   society that offers greater opportunities provided that these structural
   contradictions are resolved.},

Abstract = {Some decision makers are wary of the arrival of new ``migrants.{''}
   Journalists and politicians certainly have a share of responsibility for
   this situation, often fomenting fear through semantics. On the ground,
   this mindset places displaced persons at risk. Could the law help
   provide a clearer understanding of the situation, and contribute
   concretely to protecting the displaced? Given that the law is intended
   to be a voice of reason, it would seem so. But it is also legitimate to
   ask whether the confusion that exists around population movements is not
   directly related to a failure of law. Examining interactions between the
   law and its environment from the perspective of the interdisciplinary
   theory of complex dynamic systems may provide some answers.},

Abstract = {Prior research on policy conflicts indicates a tendency among policy
   actors to misperceive the influence of actors engaged in policy debates
   based on the degree of distance between their relative policy positions.
   This research develops a measure for assessing the degree and direction
   of the misperception effect. This measure is then utilized as a
   dependent variable to assess the relationship between theoretically
   relevant factors and the degree to which actors will exaggerate the
   influence of their opponents and allies. The research uses original
   survey data of policy actors engaged in the debate over hydraulic
   fracturing in New York. The results indicate misperceptions of relative
   influence are prevalent and most associated with the experience of a
   policy loss and holding relatively extreme policy beliefs. The findings
   provide new insight into factors that influence the demonization of
   political opponents. These insights are timely in the context of
   polarized debates over environmental and energy policy in the United
   States.},

Abstract = {The international relations literature has not produced a systematic
   typology of the different models of strategic cultures. This study aims
   to close this gap and contribute to the development and refinement of
   the concept of strategic culture by elaborating a typology that is based
   on current studies and researches. The typology is employed to analyse
   the strategic culture of the Italian political elite in the twenty-first
   century. Using an empirical analysis of the belief systems of the
   Italian party and bureaucratic elites, the study determines whether the
   model of Italian strategic culture, which has remained dominant since
   WWII, persisted during the post-Cold War period and the extent to which
   the current leadership has an image of international politics and
   strategic preferences consistent with this model.},

Title = {What drives violence against civilians in civil war? Evidence from
   Guatemala's conflict archives},

Abstract = {Dominant theories of mass violence hold that strategic concerns in civil
   war drive the deliberate targeting of civilians. However, the causal
   mechanisms that link strategic objectives to large-scale violence
   against civilians remain underspecified, and as such the causal logics
   that underpin each remain blurred. In this article, we identify and
   explicate four plausible mechanisms that explain why armed groups would
   target, for strategic purposes, civilians in war. We then turn to the
   peak period of violence during the Guatemalan armed conflict to assess
   which mechanisms were most prevalent. Specifically, we leverage unique
   archival data: 359 pages of military files from Operation Sofia, a
   month-long counterinsurgent campaign waged in the northwestern Ixil
   region. Through process tracing of real-time internal communications, we
   find that state actors most commonly described the civilian population
   as loyal to rebel forces; violence against civilians was a means to
   weaken the insurgency. Troops on the ground also depicted the Ixil
   population as winnable', which suggests that security forces used
   violence in this period to shape civilian behavior. These findings are
   most consistent with the idea that mass violence in this case and period
   was a coercive instrument to defeat insurgents by punishing civilians
   for collaboration. The evidence from this period is less consistent with
   a logic of genocide, in which the purpose of violence would be to
   destroy unwinnable' civilian groups. Our analysis illustrates how a
   mechanism-centered approach based on process tracing of conflict
   archives can help uncover logics underlying civilian killing.},

Title = {Hearing the Other Side? - Debiasing Political Opinions in the Case of
   the Scottish Independence Referendum},
Journal = {POLITICAL STUDIES},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {66},
Number = {1},
Pages = {23-42},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {This study reports the effects of two debiasing strategies on the
   complexity of people's thinking on a controversial policy issue - the
   question of Scottish independence. I start from the well-researched
   assumptions of motivated reasoning theory that individuals tend to
   protect their beliefs, are often not willing to hear the other side and
   fail to integrate contrasting arguments and different perspectives in
   their political considerations - although considering different
   viewpoints is a fundamental normative requirement for democratic
   decision-making. Two different debiasing techniques, which are meant to
   counteract this tendency and to evoke more integrative and complex
   thinking, were tested experimentally: a cognitive and a motivational
   strategy. The experiment was situated in the context of the Scottish
   independence referendum. The expectation of accountability - having to
   justify one's opinion in front of unknown others - significantly
   enhanced integrative complexity of thinking about the issue, while
   inducing subjects to consider the opposite had no significant effect.
   Opinion strength and political knowledge did not affect the treatment
   effects significantly.},

Abstract = {What are the processes through which identity change takes place at the
   individual and collective level? How might a focus on embodied religious
   performance and ritual contribute to understandings of such identity
   change? Through an ethnographic analysis of the Muharram rituals of
   Iraqi Shi'is in London, I take religious rites as a starting point from
   which to theorise a performative theory of identity change to highlight
   the role of ritual and performance in shaping changing notions of
   identity at both the individual and collective level. Such a project
   necessarily engages both with processes of identity change and with the
   paradox of identity/difference, particularly the ways in which
   articulations of subjective identity are ontologically dependent on an
   external other'. Ultimately, I argue that paying close critical
   attention to the performative and (re)iterative processes of micro-level
   identificatory practices allows a more nuanced understanding of the
   mechanisms through which identity change comes to take effect, both at
   the level of individual subjectivity and that of collective social
   belonging.},

Title = {What Does Neo-Weberian State Mean? A Theoretical Reflection on the Latin
   American Perspective},
Journal = {REVISTA DEL CLAD REFORMA Y DEMOCRACIA},
Year = {2018},
Number = {70},
Pages = {5-28},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Based on a theoretical approach this article highlights the heuristic
   concept of ``Neo-weberian State{''} to illustrate Latin American
   contemporary institutional transformations. It also suggests some
   analytical elements to make the theoretical use of this concept more
   systematic. The concept of ``Neo-weberian State{''}appeared in the
   mid-1990s and its dissemination in the Latin-American literature started
   roughly ten years later. It designates a hybrid model with features
   belonging to the two classical institutional paradigms: the weberian
   bureaucratic model and the New Public Management model. The Neo-weberian
   State operates a fusion presented as ideal as it values the respective
   qualities of these two models (juridical formalism and institutional
   agility) and rejects their drawbacks (administrative inertia and
   market-driven logics). In concrete terms, it tries to associate the
   principles of a free, universal and skilled public management with the
   contemporary requirements of rapidity, pragmatism and efficiency
   (cost-benefit relationship). Nevertheless, the Neo-weberian State cannot
   be mistaken for the new public governance, as the latter conveys a
   disembodied conception of political power and a negative idea of public
   administration. Indeed, the Neo-weberian State characterizes the
   post-neoliberal period which corresponds to the reinstatement of public
   institutions and the recognition of the State as the main actor of
   public policies. From a scientific point of view, the ideal type of the
   ``Neo-weberian State{''} seems to be very useful. Involved in its
   theoretical consolidation, it is intendend to demonstrate that it can be
   considered as a new analytical tool to study the evolutions of the role
   and the organization of the State in Latin America and beyond.},

Abstract = {How should we conceive of the relationship between European citizenship
   and national citizenship from a normative perspective? While the
   Treaties assert the supplementary nature of European citizenship
   vis-a-vis national citizenship, advocates of trans- and supra-national
   citizenship perspectives have agreed with the European Court of Justice
   that Union citizenship will ultimately supplant or subsume national
   citizenship. By contrast, we draw upon demoicratic and stakeholder
   citizenship theories to defend the primacy of national over European
   citizenship. Taking the cases of political and welfare rights, we argue
   that member states may have special duties to second-country nationals
   stemming from a European social contract, but that these duties must be
   balanced against the rights and duties of national citizens stemming
   from the national social contract.},

Title = {Small footprint, small payoff: The military effectiveness of security
   force assistance},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF STRATEGIC STUDIES},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {41},
Number = {1-2},
Pages = {89-142},
Abstract = {After 15 years of war in Afghanistan and Iraq, many now see
   `small-footprint' security force assistance (SFA) - training, advising
   and equipping allied militaries - as an alternative to large US
   ground-force commitments. Yet, its actual military efficacy has been
   little studied. This paper seeks to fill this gap. We find important
   limitations on SFA's military utility, stemming from agency problems
   arising from systematic interest misalignment between the US and its
   typical partners. SFA's achievable upper bound is modest and attainable
   only if US policy is intrusive and conditional, which it rarely is. For
   SFA, small footprints will usually mean small payoffs.},

Abstract = {How do choices among information sources reinforce political differences
   on topics such as climate change? Environmental sociologists have
   observed large-scale and long-term impacts from news media and
   think-tank reports, while experimental science-communication studies
   detect more immediate effects from variations in supplied information.
   Applying generalized structural equation modeling to recent survey data,
   previous work is extended to show that political ideology, education and
   their interaction predict news media information choices in much the
   same way they predict opinions about climate change itself.
   Consequently, media information sources serve as intervening variables
   that can reinforce and, through their own independent effects, amplify
   existing beliefs about climate change. Results provide empirical support
   for selective exposure and biased assimilation as mechanisms widening
   political divisions on climate change in the United States. The findings
   fit with the reinforcing spirals framework suggesting partisan media
   strengthens climate change beliefs which then influences subsequent use
   of media.},

Abstract = {This chapter focuses on the emotional ground of politics in Aristotle's
   thought. The passages on ``war lovers{''} and on the difference between
   Greek adult males (citizens by nature) and foreigners, slaves or women
   demonstrate that living in a polis as an equal and free partner requires
   a proper emotional temper. Aristotle's criticism of Platonic communism
   and of economic inequality shows that according to him emotions are
   necessary for stability of polis, but are also a source of instability.
   The way Aristotle describes the crowd as the best judge in real world
   situations shows how emotions help to establish and maintain the best
   regime. All of this helps to understand how emotions were seen as
   important for instituting, preserving and developing the polis-and how
   at the same time they could be their main obstacles.},

Title = {Predicting conflict acts using behavior and style measures},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONFLICT MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {29},
Number = {1},
Pages = {70-90},
Abstract = {Purpose - This paper aims to compare style and behavior-focused
   individual difference measures in their ability to uniquely predict
   naturally occurring conflict acts.
   Design/methodology/approach - Primary participants (and a friend of
   their choosing) completed a style measure and a behavior-focused measure
   about the primary participants and reported on the occurrence of a
   variety of conflict actions over a 60-day period.
   Findings - For self-ratings and friend ratings, both the style measure
   and the behavior-focused measure were significantly related to the
   occurrence of conflict acts. However, the unique effect of the
   behavior-focused measure was stronger than that of the style measure.
   Research limitations/implications - The data were collected from college
   students, thus limiting the generalizability of the findings. The
   measure of conflict acts was based on recall, which may also be subject
   to error and bias. In terms of implications, the findings strongly
   suggest that behavior-focused instruments are superior to style measures
   in predicting everyday conflict acts.
   Practical implications - Because the behavior-focused individual
   difference measure was a better predictor of actual behavior than the
   style measure, investigators interested in such prediction may want to
   seriously consider using such measures.
   Originality/value - Little research exists regarding the relative
   predictive abilities of style measures and behavior-focused measures;
   this paper provides some of the first such evidence.},

Title = {Aristotle's Functionalism and the Rise of Nominalism in Law and

Booktitle = {ARISTOTLE ON EMOTIONS IN LAW AND POLITICS},
Series = {Law and Philosophy Library},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {121},
Pages = {113-131},
Abstract = {This article explores the language of law and politics in Aristotle's
   ethical writings and the difference between Aristotle's teleological
   model and the nomological model of Christian ethics, especially in the
   case of Ockham. Nomological politics and law are only possible when
   based on authority, that is, on a communicative theory between sender
   and addressee, according to which the intention of the sender is somehow
   contingent.
   The nomological approach clearly represents a nominalistic metaphysical
   view on social reality, since legal and political concepts become
   completely contingent if their content depends only on the will of an
   authority. In contrast to nomological politics, the Aristotelian or
   teleological view is based on a non-authoritative interpretation of the
   function argument. The function argument hinges above all on grasping
   the final cause of an action. The core of grasping law and politics in
   Aristotle's model consists in the cognitive task of identifying the goal
   or the end of law. This end of actions is holistic, in the sense that it
   aims to present a permanent continuum between desire and reason, even in
   the case of social actions. Whereas emotions do not play a significant
   role in the nomological approach, they are pivotal in identifying the
   proper end of the individual and political action according to the
   Aristotelian model.},

Abstract = {This paper analyzes the internationalization of the Brazilian
   agricultural sector through a ``global history{''} approach. The goal of
   the paper is to understand the internationalization of agribusiness as a
   smaller part of a transformation in the global food regime. In tracing
   the trajectory of agribusiness internationalization in Brazil, the paper
   explores patterns of local-global interaction and the new opportunities
   that emerge in global food regimes as a result. Finally, the paper
   probes the internationalization of Brazilian agribusiness under the
   state-agrarian elite partnership that has taken advantage of local and
   global transformations in agribusiness in recent history.},

Abstract = {This paper compares a unique dataset tracking the content of all Central
   Committee and State Council documents with economic variables in China
   in the period 2003-2015. After motivating the dataset, two time-series
   measuring the relative importance of economic issues within the Party
   and the State are constructed. These two time-series are then compared
   with measures of China's real economy using a Granger test. The results
   suggest that past measures of China's economy can better help predict
   the State Council's future prioritisation of economic issues, but not
   vice versa. A similar relation is not found for the Central Committee's
   prioritisation of economic issues. This result is consistent with the
   view that it is the State that takes a more active role in managing the
   Chinese economy.},

Abstract = {Familiar philosophical accounts of the relationship between human rights
   and human dignity treat dignity as the foundation of human rights. These
   accounts get the historical and conceptual relationship between rights
   and dignity wrong and obscure how power and politics shape human dignity
   in practice. This article sketches an alternative view that treats the
   emancipatory praxis of human rights as constitutive of a distinctive
   conception of dignity as egalitarian freedom. This political account
   clarifies the historical and conceptual relationships between dignity
   and human rights in ways that provide powerful critical leverage on some
   obdurate controversies in the field. Additionally, it makes the analysis
   of power and struggle central to our understanding of dignity and human
   rights at a political moment when such an analysis proves indispensable.},

Abstract = {This paper analyses the policy developments concerning the Single Market
   in finance in the context of Brexit. Theoretically, we engage with two
   bodies of work that make contrasting predictions on European financial
   market integration and the development of European Union (EU) policies
   on financial regulation: one focused upon a neo-mercantilist battle'
   amongst member states and the other stressing the importance of
   transnational financial networks (or coalitions). Empirically, we find
   limited evidence of the formation of cross-national alliances in favour
   of the United Kingdom (UK) retaining broad access to the EU Single
   Market in financial services, the presence of which would have aligned
   with the expectations of analyses focused upon transnational networks.
   By contrast, the main financial centres in the EU27 and their national
   authorities competed to lure financial business away from the UK- what
   we explain in terms of a battle' amongst member states and their
   national financial centres.},

Title = {Identifying the Causes of Issue Attention and Policy Change: Evidence
   from US Offshore Oil and Natural Gas Drilling Policy, 2008},
Journal = {REVIEW OF POLICY RESEARCH},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {35},
Number = {1},

Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {The flow of attention in the policy process is dynamic and disruptive.
   While we know changes in issue attention often result in policy change,
   the causal mechanisms underlying the different stages of the attention
   allocation process remain unclear. This article uses Punctuated
   Equilibrium Theory to examine an underdeveloped aspect of issue
   attention within policy-making institutions: how specific policy
   indicators influence the entry and exit of issues on policy-making
   agendas. Partisan issue attention in the House of Representatives is
   used to analyze a significant change to U.S. offshore oil and natural
   gas drilling policy in 2008. The results highlight how historically high
   gasoline prices precipitated a shift in attention to offshore drilling
   and subsequent policy change. Moreover, gasoline prices Granger-cause
   attention to energy policy in partisan speeches over time. The analysis
   further reveals how competing policy frames and a salient focusing event
   shaped congressional and public discourse, leading to subsequent changes
   in attention. Taken together, the findings broaden our understanding of
   the policy process by identifying the specific forces behind the entry
   and exit of issues on the policy-making agenda.},

Abstract = {Moonlighting, the pursuit of (paid or unpaid) sideline jobs by
   democratically elected politicians, regularly evokes public outcry. This
   study provides an empirical test of the claim that moonlighting goes
   hand-in-hand with a lower degree of parliamentary effort. The article
   draws upon original data on the number of outside jobs and the
   remuneration received by Members of the European Parliament (MEPs)
   during the seventh legislative term (2009-2014). Controlling for key
   intervening variables that affect legislative effort, we find that
   higher ancillary income is associated with lower participation in
   roll-call votes, but that this relationship is mostly driven by a small
   circle of heavy moonlighters. However, our analysis demonstrates that
   representatives with a greater number of outside jobs are also more,
   instead of less, likely to draft committee reports. The findings have
   important normative implications and speak to policy debates about the
   regulation and transparency requirements of outside jobs in
   legislatures.},

Abstract = {This article examines the debates in Israel between 2009 and 2013 over
   Iran's nuclear programme as a reflection of a particular type of
   civil-military or civil-security relationship. It analyses how key
   actors within that relationship particularly those with an intelligence
   background - engaged with media outlets in Israel and further afield to
   influence domestic and international opinion over how best to contain
   Iran's nuclear ambitions. In so doing, it seeks to address one
   fundamental question: are governments in Jerusalem any longer the final
   arbiters over deciding what is in the national security interests of the
   State of Israel?},

Title = {Getting back in the DeLorean: modernization vs. anti-modernization in
   contemporary British politics},
Journal = {POLICY STUDIES},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {39},
Number = {3},
Pages = {292-309},
Abstract = {This article highlights a growing clash between mainstream modernizing
   and populist anti-modernizing forces in the UK. Whilst scholarship on UK
   party politics has, for the past three decades, focussed on processes of
   party modernization, little attention has been paid to the
   countervailing processes of resistance towards modernization. This
   contrasts with comparative studies, which show that throughout much of
   Europe modernization processes have worked to produce populist
   backlashes from anti-modernizing forces seeking to reassert various
   types of traditional values and practices. Drawing on the comparative
   literature on modernization, our argument here is that a similar
   populist backlash against modernization is occurring across the
   political spectrum in the UK and has been a factor in: the rise of
   nationalism associated with UKIP and the SNP; the 2016 BREXIT vote and
   the efforts of both Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn and Conservative PM
   Theresa May to distance their parties from the legacies of their
   modernizing predecessors. Empirically, we show how this increasingly
   prevalent line of conflict is playing out in the UK, whilst
   theoretically we argue that a discourse theoretical approach can provide
   significant advantages over existing approaches for understanding the
   dynamic interplay between modernizing and anti-modernizing discourses.},

Abstract = {This article discusses the lessons that can be drawn from post-Soviet
   experiences of democratisation in hybrid regimes for debates on Central
   and Eastern Europe (CEE) ``democratic backsliding{''}. Focusing on
   Moldova and Ukraine, the article investigates the ebb and flow of
   post-Soviet democratisation in hybrid regimes. It explores factors that
   have hindered democratisation, namely state and media capture by
   business-political interests, and factors that have hindered
   authoritarian consolidation, namely civil society and citizens'
   potential for mobilisation. The article reflects on how these factors
   can inform debates on backsliding in more consolidated democracies, such
   as CEE states.},

Abstract = {The beginning of the twenty-first century has witnessed the emergence of
   balancing responses to the US hegemony, among which Russia's foreign
   policies stand out as corresponding to what is understood as hard
   balancing.' Why is the United States being balanced against? This paper
   categorizes the existing theories of non-balancing into six conditions
   that together guarantee the absence of balancing and demonstrates that
   the current unipolar system can satisfy only one of them. This eases the
   systemic constraints and makes balancing possible. The paper then
   presents three cases of balancing with reference to President Putin's
   foreign policy. It argues that even though in terms of relative military
   capabilities unipolarity still holds, the emergence of counter-hegemonic
   balancing is indicative of important changes in the nature of post-Cold
   War American domination.},

Abstract = {Quantitative analysis of the question whether parties still matter' has
   largely focused on the dynamics of aggregated expenditure-based
   dependent variables or protective welfare policies such as unemployment,
   sickness and family benefits. This article develops a series of pooled
   time-series cross-section regression specifications predicting changes
   in disaggregated protective welfare policies alongside productive
   welfare policies, namely family services, active labour market
   programmes and public education, across 17 Western democracies
   (1971-2010). In so doing, it employs the latest Comparative Manifesto

   the effect of the ideological position of prime ministers' parties, veto
   players and their combined effect on these welfare policy areas. The
   article confirms that Left and Right governments ceased to make any
   substantive difference for protective welfare policies from the early
   1980s onwards. Yet, it also finds that positive Left partisan effects
   have largely persisted for productive welfare policies. In the era of
   global competition, Left party ideology has continued to be an important
   factor in realising a social investment perspective in practice; in
   terms of the expansion of family services, its effects have been
   contingent on the veto power Left prime ministers faced.},

Abstract = {This article discusses the role of think tanks in the production of
   ideas guiding recent change in Brazil's economic policy. It claims that
   think tanks are significant policy-making agents preparing the society
   for change - via their communicative discourse - but also attempting to
   influence the interaction between political elites - via their
   coordinative discourse. The polarization of think tanks' communicative
   discourse in regard to austerity during two critical junctures for
   Brazil is analysed. Discursive institutionalism is applied in order to
   interpret data from four Brazilian think tanks: the Institute of Applied
   Economic Research, the Inter-Union Department of Statistics and
   Socioeconomic Studies, the Fernand Braudel Institute and the Brazilian
   Institute of Economy. These think tanks have very different
   organizational and ideological characteristics but a polarization of the
   discussion around austerity can be observed in the discourse of all four
   of them. The scale ranges from an active defence of the Brazilian
   development model to a full-scale endorsement of austerity.},

Abstract = {Despite the emphasis placed on agility in uncertain situations such as
   extreme events, no comparative data exist to look into the determinants
   that drive agility. For crisis response managers, the failure to develop
   agility threatens organizations' survival amid uncertainties. This paper
   investigates the development of agility and explains the emergence of
   agility against the fight of influenza A/H1N1 pandemics in Singapore and
   Taiwan in 2009. This paper further provides empirically grounded
   evidence to identify prerequisites for agility development in response
   to public health crises in East Asia.},

Abstract = {The fossil fuel divestment movement has been a vibrant novel development
   in climate change politics in recent years, particularly in North
   America. Here, the character of the discourse used to promote divestment
   as a strategy is explored. The divestment discourse is shown to rest on
   four overlapping narratives, those of war and enemies, morality,
   economics and justice. All four are clearly discernible in statements
   from movement activists, in coverage of divestment campaigns by major
   news sources and in the movement's aims, objectives and strategies
   covered in alternative media. The war narrative, with the formulation of
   fossil fuel companies as enemies to be overcome to ensure survival, is
   the dominant narrative. By polarising climate action and identifying an
   antagonist against which to mobilise, divestment discourse has
   articulated climate change as an explicitly political phenomenon, in
   contrast to the primarily consensus and collaboration-based approaches
   that have predominated in climate politics.},

Journal = {SOUTH EUROPEAN SOCIETY AND POLITICS},

Volume = {23},
Number = {1, SI},
Pages = {63-79},
Abstract = {Many of the usual assumptions about the impact of the economic crisis on
   trade unions and employment relations only partially fit the Italian
   case. Trade unions during the crisis showed resilience both
   organisationally and as important actors in economic and political life.
   Also, the national industry level reaffirmed itself as the key level in
   industrial relations. Explanations of these unexpected outcomes have to
   do with some features of all three actors of Italian employment
   relations. Trade unions have become over time a relevant actor not just
   in the industrial relations arena but in several other spheres of
   Italian society and politics. As to employers, small and medium
   enterprises (SMEs) have tended to prefer national sectoral-level
   agreements and set rather low wage standards, while employers'
   associations have shown an organisational interest in preserving
   centralised bargaining where they play a role. Finally, governments have
   been too weak and short-lived to follow a consistent strategy of
   unilateral decision-making.},

Abstract = {National welfare states and free movement rights are in tension in the
   European Union (EU). Yet, despite potential free-riding dynamics, fully
   developed welfare states appear remarkably resilient. Two explanations
   can account for this in the literature: institutional heterogeneity of
   welfare states leads to differential impact of free movement, and
   contained compliance with EU legal obligations means that
   non-discrimination provisions exist mainly on paper. By example of
   higher education and student financial maintenance, we show that under
   adverse conditions, free movement rights need exceptions to not
   undermine national welfare. Moreover, the incapacity of the European
   Court of Justice to provide clear and stringent guidelines in regards to
   EU students' access to student benefits, confronts potential
   beneficiaries with significant legal uncertainty. This introduces new
   inequalities among EU students. Our analysis shows the limits of
   judge-made law in furthering social justice.},

   Applicability and Impact of Three Learning Arrangements},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONFLICT AND VIOLENCE},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {12},
Abstract = {The networked structure of the Internet facilitates the dissemination of
   extremist messages and often makes removal impossible. Equipping media
   users with critical (preventive) skills appears a more promising
   strategy than trying to block any exposure to extremist messages.
   Although various prevention programs follow this approach, research on
   their impact and success is scarce. This contribution describes how
   prevention programs can benefit from systematic evaluation using the
   example of the CONTRA school program, which seeks to foster critical
   media literacy with regard to extremist online messages via three
   sub-dimensions: awareness, reflection, and empowerment. The feasibility,
   applicability and impact of methods and measures developed in the
   context of CONTRA were assessed using an innovative mixed method design.
   The contribution describes the scientific approach of the prevention
   program, outlines the results of the evaluation and extrapolates from
   this prevention program to the general question of best practices for
   prevention programs with a specific focus on the school context.},

Abstract = {Twenty years after the transition in South Africa, the violence of
   today's student protests resembles that of a ticking `time bomb' on the
   brink of explosion. To understand this complex reality, Christo Thesnaar
   assesses the role of the Truth and Reconciliation (TRC) process during
   this time. Although throughout the post-TRC period faith communities
   have been predominantly absent in their calling to reconcile the people
   of South Africa, this contribution argues that they must take a more
   proactive role in healing and reconciling the nation. In seeking to find
   suitable ways to overcome this challenge, Thesnaar's contribution
   engages critically with two alternative and innovative approaches to
   reconciliation and healing: the reenactment of the TRC faith hearing,
   and the approach adopted by the Restitution Foundation (RF).},

Abstract = {This article discusses the role of the Brazilian state in the
   development of the country's cultural diplomacy, comparing moments in
   which a more assertive participation of the state is identified in the
   formulation of its guidelines, following the return of democracy to
   Brazil. The hypothesis proposed is that the governments of Jose Sarney
   (1985-1990) and Lula da Silva (2003-2010) constitute two moments of
   matrix transition in Brazilian foreign policy, in which the state took
   on a more dynamic role in the articulation of cultural diplomacy. Based
   on the bibliographic review of official records and specialized works,
   this analysis begins with a theoretical explanation of what is conceived
   as cultural diplomacy in Brazilian foreign policy, and continues with a
   comparison between the two periods of matrix transition, in the light of
   the state's actions in shaping the country's cultural diplomacy.},

Abstract = {A Peruvian case study explores how urban informal workers negotiate
   their livelihoods as they age, highlighting reciprocity among urban
   informal workers, retired formal sector workers, and peasants in a
   pattern of rural-urban circular migration. Labor-intensive mining in the
   twentieth century created a proletarian workforce that included men from
   the peasant community of Allpachico. Their wages became an anchor for
   kin-linked clusters of households. Now, despite an economic boom, the
   lack of formal jobs forces younger Allpachiquenos to undertake
   precarious and informal work. Resource-sector-funded state social
   spending, such as through state-administered pensions for retired
   workers and the elderly poor, has replaced wages as a stable source of
   cash. This state mediation between the technology-intensive resource
   sector and citizens elicits suspicion and uncertainty. Dispossessed of
   the right to work and subjected to conditions of eligibility for social
   programs, urban informal workers continue to rely on kin and community.},

   Conflict},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CONFLICT RESOLUTION},

Volume = {62},
Number = {1},
Pages = {29-63},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {How does international public support via social media influence
   conflict dynamics? To answer this question, I construct a unique,
   extremely disaggregated data set drawn from social media sources to
   examine the behavior of Israel and Hamas during the 2012 Gaza Conflict.
   The data set contains conflict actions and international audience
   behavior at the hourly level for the full 179 hours of the conflict.
   Notably, I also include popular support for each side from international
   audiences on social media. I employ a Bayesian structural vector
   autoregression to measure how Israel's and Hamas's actions respond to
   shifts in international public support. The main finding is that shifts
   in public support reduce conflict intensity, particularly for Israel.
   This effect is greater than the effect of the key international
   actorsUnited States, Egypt, and United Nations. The results provide an
   important insight into how information technology is changing the role
   of international audiences in conflict.},

Abstract = {The last few decades have seen a dramatic increase in the public
   communication efforts of international organizations (IOs). They target
   an expanding audience, including journalists, experts, activists, and
   citizens. Their communication departments have grown to more effectively
   produce and disseminate messages, evaluate their impact, and develop
   long-term communication strategies. I examine this trend for forty-eight
   IOs between 1950 and 2015. Based on an event history analysis of
   structural reforms, I argue that two causal mechanisms most consistently
   explain why IOs go public: First, normative change toward greater
   institutional transparency encourages the democratic membership of IOs
   to push for reforms in order to improve the provision of public
   information on IO decisions and policy programs. Second, public protest
   and scandals substantially increase organizational demands for
   self-legitimation. As a result, IOs reformed communication in order to
   more effectively generate public support. However, I find limited
   evidence that IO mandates to promote social change-by teaching norms and
   knowledge-can account for observed reforms to their communication
   structures.},

Volume = {72},

Pages = {139-171},
Month = {WIN},
Abstract = {Militant groups, like all organizations, carefully consider the tactics
   and strategies that they employ. We assess why some militant
   organizations diversify into multiple tactics while others limit
   themselves to just one or a few. This is an important puzzle because
   militant organizations that employ multiple approaches to violence are
   more likely to stretch state defenses, achieve tactical success, and
   threaten state security. We theorize that militant organizations respond
   to external pressure by diversifying their tactics to ensure their
   survival and continued relevance, and that the primary sources of such
   pressure are government repression and interorganizational competition.
   We find consistent support for these propositions in tests of both the
   Global Terrorism Database (GTD) and Minorities at Risk Organizational
   Behavior (MAROB) data sets. We bolster these findings with an additional
   specification that employs ethnic fractionalization in the first stage
   of a multi-process recursive model. These findings are relevant not only
   for academic research but for policy as well. While it is difficult for
   countries to anticipate the character of future tactical choices, they
   may be able to anticipate which groups will most readily diversify and
   thereby complicate counterterrorism efforts.},

Abstract = {How do regional security complexes (rscs) emerge and take shape? In
   2003, B. Buzan and O. Waever described the Horn of Africa as a proto-rsc
   (after having been a pre-rsc during the Cold War), but did not have the
   analytical tools to explain the transition to a full-fledged rsc. We
   show how the emergence of a regional power, in this case Ethiopia,
   played a key role in the formation of an rsc. The regional power became
   an active agent in the process of securitization. This article seeks to
   provide both an empirical and a theoretical contribution. We show how a
   double process of securitization-of the jihadist terror threat in the
   Horn between 1998 and 2005, and of the Somali ``failed state{''}-led to
   the 2006 Ethiopian intervention. We then analyze the outcome of rsc
   formation.},

Abstract = {Scholarly efforts to predict the future character of the U.S.-China
   relationship abound. Few however looks to leaders' beliefs as valid
   explanatory variables. In this paper, we argue that state leaders'
   belief systems are key to understanding both the states' intentions and
   policy choices. We analyze China's national defense white papers
   (1998-2015) published to date as the source material to gauge the core
   collective beliefs of three generations of Chinese leadership. The
   operational code framework is employed to conceptualize and measure
   these beliefs. Our results identified important crossgenerational
   changes in a few belief indicators. In the Xi Jinping era, for instance,
   the political world is seen as less friendly and cooperative strategies
   are viewed less favorably. In terms of tactics, the policy tools
   threaten and promise are viewed as significantly more useful by the
   current leadership than by past Chinese leaders.},

Abstract = {Turkey's relations with the European Union are at a stalemate, with
   accession negotiations effectively frozen. Yet, Turkey opts into the EU
   acquis in multiple policy areas, where its voluntary compliance-prior to
   or an alternative to accession, could be conceptualized as external
   differentiated integration. We analyse Turkish compliance into the EU
   acquis in one policy area: Development policy. We assess Turkey's opting
   into the EU rules on development policy from the perspective of three
   key factors, institutional structure, volume of aid and geographical
   focus. We argue that Turkey's alignment with the EU development acquis
   is most visible in the institutional structure of Turkish foreign aid,
   and its increasing volume. Yet, there is also a highly visible
   divergence between Turkey and the EU in terms of geographical focus,
   acting as an element of competition in development policy. The
   transformation of Turkey's development policy enhances Turkey's opting
   into the EU acquis.},

Abstract = {By any objective measure, defense institutions in Central and Eastern
   Europe have all but universally been incapable of producing viable
   defense plans that are based on objective costing and operational
   planning data. This situation exists in spite the provision of
   considerable Western advice and assistance, let alone reporting to and
   receiving assessments by NATO's International Staff under Partnership
   for Peace, as well as via the integrated defense planning and reporting
   systems. An explanation for this systematic failure across European
   post-Communist defense institutions can be found in the continued slow
   development of an over-arching policy framework which directs and
   approves all activities of the armed forces, as well as the
   de-centralization of financial decision-making down to capability
   providers. The essay ends with an examination of the adverse effects of
   the early introduction of planning programming, budgeting system (PPBS),
   have had on the development of effective policy and planning
   capabilities within these defense institutions.},

Title = {Democracy versus deterrence: Nuclear weapons and political integrity},
Journal = {POLITICS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {38},
Number = {4},
Pages = {500-513},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {This article argues that the practice and performance of nuclear
   deterrence can never be fully representative or democratic due to the
   particular pressures placed on leaders by the nuclear condition. For
   nuclear deterrence to be effective - and for nuclear weapons to have any
   political value - a leader must always convince both their electorate as
   well as any possible foe, that they are willing to use nuclear weapons
   in extremis, irrespective of whether this is their true position. In any
   nuclear-armed state, where politicians privately believe that using
   nuclear weapons is always wrong, but publicly stress that possessing
   nuclear weapons to use as a deterrent is right, they are forced to act
   dishonestly. These tensions are particularly acute in the UK context
   given the reliance on just one form of nuclear weapons system for
   deterrence and the concurrent requirement to pre-delegate secret orders
   through a letter of last resort'. The consequences for democratic
   nuclear-armed states are troubling; for public morality, the personal
   integrity of democratic leaders, and for true democratic accountability.
   This article concludes that public criticism of political leaders, and
   citizen voting choices, ought to take account of the problem of
   transparency posed by policies of nuclear deterrence.},

Abstract = {Many agreements to liberalize trade in services tend to be limited in
   scope. This is a puzzle considering the high share of services in total
   employment and value added and relatively high barriers to trade in
   services in many countries. In this paper we argue that neglected
   complementarities between services trade policies and domestic
   regulation may help to understand the limited ambition on services
   observed in many trade agreements. We show that the productivity effects
   of services trade liberalization are conditional on regulatory quality.
   Our findings suggest that greater effort to design trade agreements with
   a view to improving regulatory quality may be a necessary condition for
   deepening the services coverage of trade agreements and will enhance the
   welfare gains from services trade liberalization.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this article is to understand the EU/UK security
   relationship after Brexit and the institutional form(s) it may take.
   Taking stock of the literature on the consequences of Brexit for
   European foreign affairs, this article employs a question-driven
   approach to examine uncertainties regarding the future EU/UK security
   relationship. These questions relate in particular to the United
   Kingdom's commitment to European security after Brexit, the nature of
   post-Brexit developments within the Union, and the European Union's
   willingness to afford the United Kingdom a substantial role after
   withdrawal. This article examines each of these questions in turn,
   before considering the viability of three frequently mooted
   institutional arrangements post-Brexit: UK participation in the CSDP as
   a third country; increased engagement with NATO that becomes the main
   platform for cooperation between the United Kingdom and the European
   Union; and the enhancement of bilateral ties between the United Kingdom
   and key European allies - especially France.},

Abstract = {In this paper, we utilize narratives about sanctuary cities as an
   exploratory case study to suggest further development of the Narrative
   Policy Framework (NPF). We propose the inclusion of elements from the
   Multiple Streams Approach (MSA)-the ideas of focusing events, evidence,
   policy entrepreneurs, timing, policy windows-and the general agenda
   setting literature's concept of translation of narratives among
   different policy agendas to extend the NPF in theoretically meaningful
   ways. Then we use these ideas in an exploration of recent narratives
   about sanctuary cities in order to increase understanding of the role of
   policy narratives and agenda setting within public policy processes. Our
   exploratory questions and findings demonstrate the usefulness of adding
   elements of the MSA to the NPF. First, we suggest that an emotionally
   powerful story can create a formidable focusing event which can be used
   by policy entrepreneurs, even if the construction of the event is
   dominated by one media outlet. Second, our preliminary results show that
   studying narrative policy windows provides a methodological challenge;
   it is difficult to determine how long a policy narrative remains
   powerful and relevant. Finally, our findings reveal both similarities
   and differences of narratives between different policy agendas.},

Title = {Global Value Chains and the Governance of `Embedded' Food Commodities:
   The Case of Soy},
Journal = {GLOBAL POLICY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {9},
Number = {2, SI},
Pages = {29-37},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {In recent decades, soy has emerged as one of the world's most
   significant food-related commodities and is strongly linked to
   deforestation and habitat loss, especially in Latin America. However,
   only a very small proportion of soy is consumed directly as food by
   humans with the rest crushed to produce animal feed, oils, biofuel and
   other industrial products. We argue that the peculiar (but not
   necessarily unique) structural and institutional characteristics of the
   soy supply chain raises crucial questions about the promotion of
   sustainability in complex, non-consumer facing global value chains
   (GVCs). The particular way that soy is `embedded' in the food system has
   meant that consumer-facing firms have been shielded from the
   externalities of its production and trade to a much larger degree than
   is the case for comparable food commodities. This, in turn, helps to
   explain the widely perceived inadequacies of the private certification
   of `sustainable soy' - and ongoing and wider political struggles around
   land, labour and the environment - for more comprehensive and inclusive
   forms of governance.},

Abstract = {In their recent rigorous analysis of the European Charter of Local
   Self-Government (Radvan, Mrkyvka, Schweigl 2018), the authors elaborated
   the manner in which the Charter has been implemented into the Czech
   legal order. In this paper, the authors extended the previous analysis
   by focusing on the challenges connected with the incorporation of the
   Charta's principles into the Czech legal order. They outlined the areas,
   in which the incorporation seems to be properly done, and pointed to a
   few areas which might be viewed as problematic, as for incorporating of
   the Charta's principles. One of the most significant problems is that
   the distinction between the state-administration and self-administration
   was not carried out in a strict manner and this improper distinction may
   lead to enhanced conflicts of interest. Some problems might also be
   detected in the area of how a smaller municipality's citizens may
   influence the policy of a larger municipality which provides
   state-administration for the residents of smaller municipalities.},

   Microlending},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL STUDIES QUARTERLY},

Volume = {62},
Number = {3},

Abstract = {Although private foreign aid has expanded dramatically in recent years,
   we still lack detailed information on the allocation of those private
   aid flows. We use a novel approach to examine the funding decisions of
   individuals with respect to international development assistance. We
   analyze the speed at which requests from microentrepreneurs in
   developing countries are fulfilled through a US-based Internet
   organization that bundles individual contributions and transfers them as
   interest-free loans to developing countries. Survival analysis finds
   little evidence for the expectation that private donors behave as
   rational aid givers, nor do we see private funders mimicking the
   behaviors of official aid agencies. Rather, private microloans seem
   principally influenced by humanitarian crises, along with the presence
   of migrant and diaspora networks from recipient countries. We conclude
   that international private aid is shaped by social linkages between
   individual donors and recipients. It can therefore fund areas neglected
   by traditional foreign aid. As a result, private foreign aid serves, in
   at least some cases, as a complement to official development assistance.},

Abstract = {This article analyzes an understudied and contested form of government
   taking, transfer restriction, which has supplanted expropriation as the
   most ubiquitous and costly type of international property rights
   violation. Veto-player-type constraints curtail governments' ability to
   engage in outright and (nontransfer related) creeping expropriation but
   have little impact on their ability to generate wealth via transfer
   restrictions. We use a formal model to derive testable implications
   regarding the effect of political institutions and domestic politics on
   governments' ability to collect these two types of rent. Empirically, we
   use novel time-series cross-sectional data to show that while
   veto-player-type political constraints diminish expropriation risk,
   transfer risk is much less affected: even constrained governments impose
   transfer restrictions.},

Abstract = {Targeted killing by drones is a systemic driven instrumental practice
   that overrides societal non-instrumental practices that are essential
   for international society. Doing so, targeted killing by drones is not
   simply another form of inflicting violence by technical means to
   political opponents. It also inflicts the agents applying this practice,
   tempting them to frame it as a permissible measure to preserve
   international society. The reliance on drones for targeted killing is a
   pursuit of non-societal practices that seek individual and retributive
   justice and anticipatory and preventive self-defence by means of force
   relying on technological advantage. Eventually, this practice permits
   military tactics to steer political strategy, mitigating standards and
   practices agreed on in international society's norms, rules of conduct,
   and institutions.},

Abstract = {Previous studies of voter turnout in Latin America have found weak and
   inconsistent evidence for the link between political institutions and
   electoral participation. In this article, I use data from an expanded
   dataset of voter turnout in Latin America (1980-2016) to show that
   institutions do have an impact on citizens' decisions on whether or not
   to participate in concurrent elections. Whereas previous studies
   analyzed the effect of legislative institutions on voter turnout, this
   article estimates a series of models that demonstrate the impact of
   presidential institutions and the political context surrounding
   presidential elections on electoral participation. The findings suggest
   that when first-order (presidential) and second-order (legislative)
   elections take place concurrently, electoral participation is influenced
   primarily by presidential institutions (term length, presidential
   powers, and electoral rules) and the electoral context in which the
   presidential elections take place (effective number of presidential
   candidates).},

Abstract = {As the introduction to this special issue highlights, the Great
   Recession, along with the more recent phenomenon such as the refugees'
   crisis and the Brexit referendum, has contributed to the success and
   strengthening of populist Eurosceptic parties across European party
   systems. The loss of legitimacy of governments and European institutions
   has opened a window of opportunity for parties expressing
   anti-establishment positions and populist orientations and criticizing
   the political-economic arrangements prevailing in Europe. Our study
   focuses on the rise of a specific left-wing populist Euroscepticism
   linked with the impact of the Great Recession and austerity measures in
   Portugal and Spain and the party system transformations. Thus, economic
   issues, bailouts, and, above all, anti-austerity measures were the main
   driving forces behind the transformations of Iberian party systems. The
   increase in populist reactions in both countries after the economic
   crisis and the implementation of austerity had to do with the
   transformation of the radical left emphasizing distributive issues in
   Eurosceptic populist directions. Finally, the analysis shows the
   distinctiveness of the populist Euroscepticism of the new challenger,
   Podemos, which illustrates the opportunities afforded with the economic
   crisis for the rise of new challenger parties exhibiting the
   contemporary link between populism and Euroscepticism in the radical
   left.},

Abstract = {By a comparative case analysis of the Northern Ireland conflict and the
   Kurdish conflict in Turkey, this article aims to make a contribution to
   the (de)securitisation literature. It raises two interrelated questions.
   First, under what conditions are states more likely to desecuritise
   minority identities? Second, what does desecuritisation entail? The
   conventional wisdom about desecuritisation, especially among the
   Copenhagen School scholars, is that it is the shift from emergency
   politics to normal politics within which the security speech act becomes
   absent. In turn, desecuritisation is assumed to be an agency-driven
   process. This article underlines some of the problems and
   insufficiencies of this approach and pushes forward an interpretation
   based on structure-driven processes along with agency-driven acts in the
   desecuritisation of minority identities. While we unpack the concept of
   desecuritisation further, as opposed to taking it at its face value
   (i.e. the absence of the security speech act), we place the process of
   desecuritisation into a specific historical context. We argue that
   states are more likely to desecuritise minority identities in three
   interrelated processes: first, when status-quo security discourses lose
   their legitimacy; second, when there is an elite change; and third, when
   there is an external pressure.},

Abstract = {This Research Note reflects on the question of representing marginalized
   people's voices by discussing field research based on open-ended
   narrative interviews with rural populations that had been displaced by
   natural resource extraction in Mozambique. It highlights the
   methodological challenges of representing narratives of the marginalized
   by discussing several aspects of the politics of narrative. On the one
   hand, narratives that emerge in fieldwork encounters are contingent
   articulations of oneself that unfold through the implicit negotiation
   process between a researcher and a research participant. On the other
   hand, these narratives are embedded in broader socio-material
   relationalities. Through this discussion, the Research Note demonstrates
   how these methodological aspects of the politics of narrative should be
   reflected upon as a way to navigate complex ontological narratives that
   emerge in one's fieldwork, as well as highlights how this narrative
   reading overcomes the potential danger of fetishizing individual agency
   and/or overlooking broader structural inequalities.},

Title = {Backdoor peacekeeping: Does participation in UN peacekeeping reduce

Journal = {JOURNAL OF PEACE RESEARCH},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {55},

Abstract = {I advance and test a theoretical argument of how participation in UN
   peacekeeping affects the likelihood of coup attempts in
   troop-contributing countries (TCCs). The argument highlights the
   interplay between the economic incentives of militaries in poor TCCs and
   the UN's preference for contributors with stable civil-military
   relations. Fearing the loss of UN reimbursement funds, militaries for
   which such funds are important will avoid visible acts of military
   insubordination, such as coup attempts, that would place their future
   participation in UN peacekeeping at risk. I test this proposition
   against time-series cross-sectional data on 157 countries in the
   1991-2013 period using panel regression and matching. The data show that
   countries where the armed forces are more dependent on peacekeeping
   revenues experience fewer coup attempts than comparable peers, even when
   taking coup-proofing measures and other alternative explanations into
   account. I also find that the coup-restraining effect is only observed
   in periods where member states contribute enough troops to award the UN
   a real choice over alternative contributors. The study introduces a
   novel theoretic logic, presents empirical results at odds with the
   existing literature, and suggests important policy implications with
   regard to UN vetting and standards for troop-contributing countries.},

Abstract = {To what extent can the theory of the developmental state (DS) illuminate
   China's development? This paper argues that the Chinese state reflects
   the standard accounts of the DS, but the conventional wisdom of the DS
   alone cannot capture comprehensively the features of Chinese
   development. In all aspects of standard accounts of the DS, China's
   development embodies new characteristics. It is the Chinese DS with
   these new characteristics that has brought about China's economic
   success. Consequently, the Chinese DS broadens the traditional concept
   of the DS and explores a new way for the development of some countries
   with similar social and economic backgrounds, particularly the economies
   in post-socialist transformation.},

Abstract = {Despite the Realist's assertion that nothing fundamental changes in
   world politics, change is the norm in all life and all fields. World
   politics is no exception. Yes, there are continuities in world politics;
   they are the persistent, albeit themselves changing, mechanisms that
   foster fundamental change, the both large and small alterations in the
   nature of agents, structures, processes, and the content of arguments.
   Sometimes things change slowly, they evolve. And sometimes radical
   changes occur in a relatively short period of time; we might think of
   the latter as phase changes or radical ruptures at tipping points. But
   often those ruptures have been preceded by decades of slower work by
   advocates of change toiling in civil societies or specialized
   communities. Thus, a great deal of effort goes into not only making
   change but also resisting change.},

Title = {Resisting Rights to Renounce Imperialism: East African Churches'
   Strategic Symbolic Resistance to LGBTQ Inclusion},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL STUDIES QUARTERLY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {62},
Number = {2},
Pages = {423-436},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {When American Anglican and Lutheran churches elected to ordain same-sex
   partnered clergy, nearly all African counterparts either denounced LGBTQ
   inclusion or entirely dissociated from their bilateral partners. Why did
   these disagreements over domestic policies introduce transnational
   schisms, and what explains this variation? I argue that East African
   churches responded to bilateral partners' LGBTQ inclusion by adopting a
   strategy of symbolic resistance. They invoked domestic anticolonial
   sentiments to buttress their symbolic capital, relative to domestic
   religious competitors. Churches who relied least on US counterparts
   (financially or institutionally) fortified that resistance by
   dissociating entirely. All others maintained bilateral partnerships but
   publicly denounced LGBTQ inclusion. This research contributes insights
   about transnational norm diffusion. Beyond simply dismissing norms
   deemed incongruent with domestic ideals, actors in the global South
   capitalize on incongruence to gain domestic symbolic capital. Global
   rights movements thereby unwittingly incentivize domestic actors to
   mobilize a strategy of symbolic resistance that obstructs transnational
   agendas.},

Abstract = {Firms across the globe are affected by red tape, but there is little
   academic research on how country-level institutions shape red tape
   perceptions. Drawing on institutional theory, we argue that a variety of
   formal and informal country-level institutions affect perceptions of red
   tape in the private sector. We test our hypotheses using six data
   sources, including the World Economic Forum and the World Bank. Our
   results indicate that red tape is weakly associated with a country's
   level of formalization and rule enforcement effectiveness and more
   prevalent in federal as opposed to unitary states. As for informal
   institutions, we find that red tape perceptions are more pronounced in
   countries with an increased conservative political ideology, higher
   levels of corruption, and cultures that emphasize individualism and
   uncertainty avoidance. We conclude with a discussion of the implications
   for theory and practice.},

Abstract = {Numerous studies have linked a range of economic, social, and
   institutional variables with corruption in government. Yet, most of this
   literature overlooks the management of public officials themselves. This
   is a relevant omission: almost all corrupt exchanges involve public
   officials. This article reviews studies36 in totalthat do address civil
   service management and anti-corruption. It finds that prior works assess
   a narrow set of civil service management structures. Meritocratic
   recruitment and, less robustly, pay levels have been associated with
   lower corruption. By contrast, robust evidence on how corruption relates
   to other established public personnel management areassuch as distinct
   pay structures (rather than levels), promotion, transfer, and job
   stability practicesis largely unavailable. The article thus calls for
   research assessing the effects of a broader set of civil service
   management practices to gain a deeper understanding of corruption, and
   how to curb it.},

Abstract = {This study seeks to explain the profound discord currently observable in
   elite political discourse on Chinese investments in many host countries.
   Using Argentina as a case study, a combination of quantitative content
   analysis and qualitative discourse analysis was employed to analyze
   parliamentary speeches on a controversial space-monitoring station built
   there by China in 2015. The study finds that the competing discourses
   about China in Argentinean politics draw primarily on locally embedded
   contexts and the region's particular historical experiences and
   geopolitical position. These local narratives are used in different ways
   by both sides of the debate to support contradicting positions on
   relevant issues. Questions of regional hegemony, center-periphery
   relations, national autonomy as well as Peronist and anti-Peronist
   ideologies are being drawn on by elite politicians in an attempt to cope
   with the deep uncertainty about what China's increased engagement means
   for the country and to compensate for the lack of predictability about
   China's behavior in its future role as a major global power. Ultimately,
   however, Argentina's elite politicians end up in a dilemma in which
   these narratives and historical memories can be spun in both ways to
   either support or reject a controversial investment project to go ahead
   on domestic soil that is, at the same time, a symbolic test for the
   potential depth of the future relationship with China.},

Abstract = {Employing a dataset of 1843 think tank publications containing 37million
   words, computer-assisted text analysis was used to examine the idea of
   austerity in British politics between 2003 and 2013. Theoretically, the
   article builds on the ideational turn in political research. However, in
   contrast to much ideational work which argues that ideas are important
   at times of crisis because they can address uncertainty, this article
   argues that moments of crisis can lead to the reformulation of ideas.
   Empirically, this article demonstrates the transformation of the idea of
   austerity. Prior to the 2008 financial crisis, austerity was largely
   understood either in historical terms or as a practice applied in other
   countries. In the aftermath of the crisis, both the political right and
   left attempted to co-opt the idea of austerity for their own ends,
   combining it with various other ideational strands on which they have
   historically drawn.},

Abstract = {Presence, of bodies and ideas, is often taken as the primary indicator
   of political equality and, hence, democratic health. Intersectionality
   and constructivism question the validity of measuring presence. Turning
   theory into practice, we propose a comparative reflexive design guided
   by two research questions: (1) Who are the groups? and (2) What are
   their problems? This reveals both prototypical and non-prototypical
   groups and interests, from the perspectives of politicians (from above)
   and citizens (from below). We suggest concrete qualitative and
   quantitative methodological strategies to study these questions
   empirically.},

Abstract = {This article presents the first systematic analysis of how location of
   drone strikes and the identification of civilian or terrorist casualties
   in newspaper reporting affect media assessments of operational outcomes
   and elite responsibility. Conducting a content analysis of several
   hundred newspaper articles, we evaluate the likelihood of these
   newspapers identifying the civilian casualties, the role those
   casualties play in media assessments of operational outcomes, and who
   they blame for failure. We found that there were significant differences
   in the likelihood of the two newspapers reporting civilian casualties.
   We demonstrate that political elites including the US President tended
   to avoid blame for failure, with much of the focus of newspaper
   dissatisfaction being directed at the intelligence agencies. We believe
   these findings have serious ramifications for the democratic oversight
   for future warfare and have the potential to undermine the ability of
   public to constrain elites from launching military operations using
   drones.},

   views on responsibility, particularly as personified in the greengrocer
   taking responsibility for his actions and his decision to authentically

   the powerless do indeed have poweralthough assuming this heavy
   responsibility is not for the faint-hearted. As a defense of bottom-up
   politics and a call to action in both authoritarian and depersonalized
   bureaucratic regimes, moreover, the essay remains relevant today, an
   important contribution to the canon of political theory.},

Volume = {9},

Pages = {276-282},

Abstract = {The confluence of social and health inequities and global environmental
   degradation shines a light on fundamental ruptures in society. A systems
   view of humanity reminds us that this status quo is not static, and that
   the shifting political and economic sands provide an important window of
   opportunity to collectively change the system towards the public good,
   such that communities are able to live with good health, dignity and in
   an environmentally sustainable way. To enable this, global policy, and
   in particular global health policy must break out of the policy silos
   and refocus in a systems way. If the system is to adapt, an ambitious
   vision for the system is needed that is different to the status quo. No
   one regulatory model that can improve complex societal problems, rather
   we must use a plurality of approaches. Reorienting the system to achieve
   positive outcomes depends on reimagining the purpose of structural
   regulatory powers, and the releasing the agency of networks of concerned
   actors. In a hyper-connected world there are many partners to help
   create systems of hope.
   It would be very easy to be overwhelmed with despair given the dreadful
   atrocities that plague the world. No country is immune from these
   concerns but such life and death experiences are not distributed evenly
   between or within nations},

Abstract = {What is the relationship between landholding inequality and rural
   unrest? And why does land reform that ostensibly addresses rural
   grievances sometimes exacerbate unrest? We advance the understanding of
   these longstanding questions by shifting the emphasis from how
   landholding inequality fuels rural grievances to how it captures the
   collective action capacity of landowners. Using municipal-level data
   from Brazil's large land reform program from 1988 to 2013, we
   demonstrate that the relationship between landholding inequality and
   unrest is conditional. Isolated threats to landed elites in the form of
   land invasions are difficult to repel, generating a positive
   relationship between landholding inequality and one-off land invasions.
   By contrast, sustained, broader local threats triggered by nearby land
   reforms catalyze landowner organization to repel land invasions, leading
   to the reverse relationship. The findings provide a novel answer for why
   a straightforward link between land inequality and rural unrest is
   elusive and may generalize to a broad range of similar cases.},

Abstract = {International-relations scholars tend to focus on the formation, design,
   and effects of international organizations (IOs). However, the vitality
   of IOs varies tremendously. I argue that IOs end up in one of three
   situations. They could die off altogether, though this happens
   infrequently. More commonly, many IOs become ``zombies.{''} They
   continue to operate, but without any progress toward their mandates. A
   third category includes IOs that are alive and functioning. I develop a
   theory to explain an organization's vitality, hinging on the quality of
   the bureaucracy. In an environment where IOs with similar goals, and
   with many overlapping members, compete for bureaucrats, the ability of
   the secretariats to attract talented staff and to enact policy
   autonomously are associated with whether organizations truly stay
   active, simply endure, or die off. I demonstrate this proposition using
   a new measure of the vitality of international economic organizations
   from 1950 to the present. Around 52 percent of the organizations in the
   sample are alive and functioning, around 10 percent are essentially
   dead, and nearly 38 percent are zombies. Using these original data,
   tests of these propositions support the theory.},

Title = {Organizational reputation and risk regulation: The effect of
   reputational threats on agency scientific outputs},
Journal = {PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {96},
Number = {1},
Pages = {70-83},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {This article aims to explain the variation in the scientific risk
   assessments conducted by two regulatory agencies: the European Food
   Safety Authority (EFSA) and the French Agency for Food, Environmental
   and Occupational Health and Safety (ANSES). To explain the merits of
   scientific risk assessments that have caused polarization within the EU,
   this article draws on bureaucratic reputation theory. The theory argues
   that regulators are political organizations that are active in
   protecting their unique organizational reputations. The findings
   obtained from interviews, direct observations, and primary documents
   yield support for this framework: depending on reputational threats,
   agencies choose to emphasize either their role as guardians of the
   prevailing social values, or send strong professional signals by
   delivering a scientifically rigorous risk assessment.},

Abstract = {The aim of this article is to analyze the main characteristic features
   of the security culture of the Russian Federation (RF) during Medvedev's
   presidency in the context of the Russian foreign and security policy in
   the period 2008-2012. The second aim of this paper is to demonstrate
   that the continuity of the main features of the Russian security culture
   represents a possible starting point for understanding the reasons for
   the current Russian military intervention in Crimea. The main features
   of the Russian security culture will be searched for on three levels:
   firstly, the level of key foreign and security strategic documents of
   the RF; secondly, that of the Russian position toward military
   interventions; and finally, that of Russia's relations with the West.},

Abstract = {The article is an expression of search for the motivational role of
   religiosity in individuals' civic activity. Mature civic attitude is
   shaped by the person's values, individual and communal needs, and
   experience. The main thesis of the presented study is that the relation
   between religiosity and human will in many points overlap with the
   factors which determine the citizen's activity for the benefit of the
   community. Stefan Huber's Centrality of Religiosity Scale emphasizing
   the primary importance of the motivational value of religiosity and an
   original scale measuring civic involvement were used in the study (N =
   732). The study proved that religiosity mostly serves as a civic
   involvement predictor among women from the middle age group. Although a
   higher level of civic involvement was found in men, religiosity did not
   prove to be a significant factor explaining its higher level, which
   means that the determinants for it need to be sought in other spheres.

Abstract = {In Latin America there are few countries with a legal framework that
   regulates collective bargaining in the public sector. However, most of
   these countries have strong public workers' organizations that negotiate
   a wide range of issues with the authorities. Despite its impact on
   public budget, information lack on the extent and the characteristics of
   these collective bargaining practices.
   This paper analyses the Chilean case to contribute to fill this blank.
   Based on a census of the public services in the Central Administration
   carried out in 2016 (ENCLACE), it examines the dynamics of collective
   bargaining in this sector. The article demonstrates that the lack of
   regulation has not been an obstacle to the development of the
   negotiation between public workers' associations and the authorities. In
   the absence of clear rules to settle how, when, and what is possible to
   negotiate, public workers' associations have been able to use their
   strength to create relatively stable spaces for participation that far
   exceed those legally guaranteed for workers in the private sector
   companies. The document proposes some elements to explain this situation
   and underscores that at least in the Chilean case regulation is not the
   best criterion for evaluating the development of labor relations in the
   public sector or the differences between workers in this sector and
   those of the private sector.},

Title = {The State Capacities of Brazilian Municipalities in a Context of
   Policies' Decentralization},
Journal = {REVISTA DEL CLAD REFORMA Y DEMOCRACIA},
Year = {2018},
Number = {70},
Pages = {93-126},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {This article addresses institutional and managerial changes of Brazilian
   municipalities in the context of the new constitutional order that
   strengthened their autonomy as federative entity and the
   decentralization of public policies. The municipal governments started
   to demand a greater level of administrative management when assuming
   their new responsibilities. This work shows how these requirements
   include the management of financial areas, human resource, IT and
   organizational topics. It is argued that the decentralization of
   policies and municipal autonomy set by the 1988 Federal Constitution
   were not followed by an increase in the State capacities required for
   the new attributions. The decentralization assumes the explanatory
   function of an independent variable and the modernization of State
   capacities is the dependent variable. A quantitative research is carried
   out based on descriptive statistics, in a longitudinal analysis, with
   the objective of capturing the effect of the independent variable in
   almost 30 years. The paper concludes that the capacities of Brazilian
   municipalities did not advance to the challenges arising from the
   decentralization of policies initiated after 1988. In the four central
   areas of management there are significant challenges to qualify the
   municipal management. This is more evident in municipalities with a
   population up to 50 thousand inhabitants in which several indicators
   show a worse situation compared to the largest. Considering
   decentralization as independent variable, its effect over the
   modernization of municipal administrations has been reduced, which in
   practice affects the autonomy of this federative entity defined in the
   Federal Constitution. This is a relevant consideration since the
   Brazilian federation chose to expand municipal attributions in the field
   of public policies over the last 30 years. Still, efforts to provide
   conditions to this purpose at the municipal level have not been very
   successful.},

Abstract = {The article examines the weakness of discourses around food sovereignty
   in Southwest Asia and North Africa, and examines some older currents
   resembling the food sovereignty discourse. The author first historically
   situates the emergence of food sovereignty. He discusses agro-ecology -
   the technics' (or social embeddedness of technology) of food sovereignty
   - and its national-popular content, before then developing elements of
   the delinking paradigm. He goes on to discuss Tunisian national-popular
   and Third Worldist agronomists' and economists' efforts to develop
   technics and frameworks for food sovereignty in the 1970s and 1980s. The
   article compares the food sovereignty paradigm with auto-centred,
   self-reliant development proposals, and the proposals of the Tunisian
   economists and agronomists.},

Title = {Relative deprivation, protests and voting in Kenya},
Journal = {COMMONWEALTH \& COMPARATIVE POLITICS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {56},
Number = {1},
Pages = {65-83},
Abstract = {While protests and voting are forms of political participation, their
   theoretical and empirical literature has largely developed independently
   and remains unintegrated, despite a possible common causal mechanism.
   This paper explores the possibility that perceptions of relative
   deprivation could be a common causal mechanism. It identifies three
   forms of relative deprivation - intra-personal, inter-personal, and
   fraternalistic. Using the Afrobarometer survey data for Kenya, the paper
   tests the influence of each of the three forms of relative deprivation
   on the likelihood of voting or participating in protests. The results
   show that intra-personal relative deprivation influences the likelihood
   of protesting and voting, by raising the former while reducing the
   latter. However, inter-personal and fraternalistic relative deprivations
   are not significant predictors of the likelihood of either protesting or
   voting.},

   ``inappropriate{''} or no emotions) are often judged to be more
   credible. The authors studied the interplay of different emotion
   displays with perceivers' acceptance of modern myths about sexual
   aggression (AMMSA) in predicting judgments of credibility and blame. Law
   students (N= 120) completed a 16-item AMMSA scale and watched a video
   showing a simulated interview with a rape victim (played by an actress).
   The emotion displayed by the victim (sad, angry, or neutral) was
   experimentally manipulated; her statement's verbal content was held
   constant. Main dependent variables were perceived victim credibility,
   victim blame, severity of the injury, and likelihood of recovery.
   Results showed that AMMSA strongly predicted all dependent variables
   across conditions. Effects of displayed emotions were less pervasive and
   depended on participants' gender and AMMSA: At higher (vs. lower) levels
   of AMMSA, women - but not men - judged the sad victim's statement to be
   most credible, and the angry victim's statement to be least credible,
   with the neutral statement falling in between. The findings suggest that
   perceivers may be better at keeping their judgements free from unwanted
   external influences (the emotional displays) than unwanted internal
   influences (their own AMMSA). The authors discuss future directions
   regarding the mechanisms involved and practical implications for the
   legal context.},

Abstract = {Accurate knowledge about societal conditions and public policies is an
   important public good in any polity, yet governments across the world
   differ dramatically in the extent to which they collect and publish such
   knowledge. This article develops and tests the argument that this
   variation to some extent can be traced to the degree of bureaucratic
   politicization in a polity. A politicized bureaucracy offers politicians
   greater opportunities to demand from bureaucratsand raises incentives
   for bureaucrats to supplypublic policy knowledge that is strategically
   biased or suppressed in a manner that benefits incumbents
   reputationally. Due to electoral competition, we suggest that the link
   between bureaucratic politicization and politicized policy knowledge
   will be stronger in democracies than in autocracies. A case analysis of
   Argentina's statistical agency lends credence to the underlying causal
   mechanism. Time-series cross-sectional analyses confirm the broader
   validity of the expectations and show that the relationship is present
   only in democracies.},

Abstract = {In 1992, the constituent parts of Yugoslavia started to break up and
   form independent nations, leading to instability and war in the region.
   In a gesture soon reciprocated by George H. W. Bush, Boris Yeltsin
   announced that the Soviet Union would cease to target with nuclear
   weapons cities in the United States and in countries friendly to the
   United States; this eventually led to a mutual declaration by the two
   governments of the end of the Cold War. The Montreal Protocol on
   Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer and the Maastricht Treaty (which
   created the European Union) were signed by government leaders. White
   South Africans voted to approve reforms proposed by President F. W. De
   Klerk to end apartheid, which had been the law of the land for over
   forty years. Widespread riots in Los Angeles followed the acquittal of
   four police officers who had been videotaped beating black man Rodney
   King. The Twenty-Seventh Amendment of the US Constitution, having to do
   with Congressional pay, became law. The end of an era, The Tonight Show
   Starring Johnny Carson had its final show. Sparking great controversy,
   Sinead O'Connor, during a Saturday Night Live episode, tore a picture
   with the likeness of Pope John Paul II on it after having sung a song in
   protest of child abuse by the Catholic Church. The NAMES Project AIDS
   Memorial Quilt was laid out in Washington, DC, to honor the memories of
   those who died from AIDS and to call national attention to the
   condition. A march of coal miners was organized in London to the ruling
   Conservative Party's plans to shutter a number of mines and make many
   miners redundant.},

Journal = {ETHNOPOLITICS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {17},
Number = {2},
Pages = {181-200},
Abstract = {De facto states, according to the most established elaborations of the
   concept, by definition strive towards full-fledged, internationally
   recognised independence. However, in many cases, independence may
   actually be perceived as a second best option. This article argues that
   in seeking further integration with a patron post-Soviet de facto states
   are behaving similarly to small-sized dependent jurisdictions in other
   parts of the world. Conceptualising post-Soviet de facto states as small
   dependent jurisdictions contributes to a more nuanced understanding of
   their state-building project, their relationship with the patron state,
   their political economy, as well as their long-term path of development.},

Abstract = {The revival of nuclear strategy in US policy and scholarship has been
   strengthened by arguments that the `nuclear revolution' - the assumption
   that thermonuclear bombs and missiles had made major war too dangerous
   to wage - does not affect international behaviour as much as nuclear
   revolution advocates claim. This article shows that the Soviet leader
   Nikita Khrushchev indeed regarded nuclear war as too dangerous to wage,
   a decision which manifested itself not so much in foreign policy or
   military doctrine but in his determination to avoid war when the
   possibility arose. We argue that Khrushchev's experience provides us
   with a more useful way to characterise the nuclear revolution and
   suggest some implications of this argument for contemporary debates
   about nuclear weaponry.},

Abstract = {The International Criminal Court's interventions have prompted debate
   about the wisdom of criminally prosecuting combatants while attempting
   to build peace in conflict-ridden societies. Previous research fails to
   distinguish between different types of trials. Using a large-N dataset
   of three types of criminal trials undertaken during internal conflict -
   domestic security trials of rebels, domestic human rights trials of
   state agents, and international war crimes trials of both - this article
   tests a theory of the compellent effect of criminal prosecution on
   conflict termination. We find that, even when accounting for
   endogeneity, rebel trials are associated with a higher probability of
   conflict termination, while trials of state agents are weakly associated
   with conflict persistence. We argue that the former compel the
   opposition to discontinue fighting, while the latter signal to rebels a
   lack of government resolve. We also find that the effect of
   international trials, which at times appear weakly associated with
   conflict termination, is endogenous to international intervention more
   generally.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF STRATEGIC STUDIES},

Volume = {41},

Pages = {519-544},
Abstract = {This article argues that logistics constrains strategic opportunity
   while itself being heavily circumscribed by strategic and operational
   planning. With the academic literature all but ignoring the centrality
   of logistics to strategy and war, this article argues for a reappraisal
   of the critical role of military logistics, and posits that the study
   and conduct of war and strategy are incomplete at best or false at worst
   when they ignore this crucial component of the art of war. The article
   conceptualises the logistics-strategy nexus in a novel way, explores its
   contemporary manifestation in an age of uncertainty, and applies it to a
   detailed case study of UK operations in Iraq and Afghanistan since 2001.},

Abstract = {In recent years, many political parties have created new forms of
   affiliation and have justified the blurring of membership boundaries
   with claims that sympathisers would be more representative of the
   electorate and less radical. Such claims are based on `popular wisdom'
   inspired by John May's `special law of curvilinearity', which states
   that activists hold more extreme views than voters and elites. When this
   expectation has been tested, results have been at best inconclusive; but
   testing has so far never used a single survey to compare different
   groups. Using an online survey of Europe Ecologie Les Verts party
   members and their extended networks (affiliated supporters, lapsed
   members, sympathisers), relationships between ideological differences
   and degree of investment in party activities and decision-making are
   analysed. The results, contradicting May's special law along all
   ideological dimensions other than intra-party democracy, can be
   explained if May's narrowly instrumental assumptions about preference
   formation are rejected.},

Abstract = {This article attempts to challenge binary notions of victim and
   perpetrator categories by taking into account the complex interaction of
   actors who both participate in, and are impacted by, terrorist violence.
   Semi-structured interviews were conducted with self-identified
   Republican (n = 25) and Loyalist (n = 27) ex-prisoners in Northern
   Ireland who are currently involved in self-described peace initiatives.
   Results suggest that political ex-prisoners evoke notions of collective
   victimization as a vehicle to bridge their transition from paramilitary
   to peace maker in this context. The implications are discussed in terms
   of understanding the functionality of collective victimhood for those
   who controversially adopt the label.},

Abstract = {With the failure of liberal peace strategies in the Global South,
   resilience has recently become the risk management strategy par
   excellence in peacebuilding. Since it is not possible to predict when
   the next crisis will take place, peacebuilders must invest in bottom-up
   adaptive capacities to cope with external shocks. This article moves
   away from governmentality accounts of resilience which are overtly
   deterministic and depoliticizing. Instead, it posits that the
   uncertainty, ambiguity, and complexity associated with resilience mean
   that we should expect opportunities for contestation and institutional
   agency. This argument will be illustrated by drawing upon the European
   Union's adoption of the resilience approach in its peacebuilding and
   security policies. The article argues that while uncertainty, ambiguity,
   and complexity constitute the ontological conditions that underpin the
   rise of resilience in peacebuilding, they are also likely to lead to its
   potential demise.},

Abstract = {If we are looking for sociological theories that spell out the
   institutions of the emerging world society, we have two main choices:
   John Meyer and his students from the Stanford-based world polity school
   and Barry Buzan, based at the London School of Economics and from the
   English School `world society' stable. Meyer first put forward his ideas
   of an emerging `world polity' in the 1970s, while Buzan came forward
   with his schema only latterly, in his 2004 From International Society to
   World Society. The two theories contend in both processes and the role
   of major institutions, but agree to a surprising extent on identities
   and transformational routes. Both theories have a good deal to say about
   the requirements for a world society and the institutions that comprise
   it, and a comparison between them reveals a good deal about how to
   theorize world society and what a plausible sociological theory would
   require.},

   determination Disputes},
Journal = {ETHNOPOLITICS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {17},
Number = {1},
Pages = {37-54},
Abstract = {There has been a failure to address the future of Kirkuk through
   political means, whilst tensions are once again coming to the fore there
   is a real risk that Kirkuk's future will be decided by force. This
   article examines the political options available for Kirkuk based on the
   resolution of similar issues of conflict in Northern Ireland and Breko,
   Bosnia and Herzegovina. Based on the advances made in these cases the
   article suggests that exogenous actors will have to play a role in
   reaching an agreement in Kirkuk, that a special status for Kirkuk is
   necessary, and that power sharing needs to be properly
   institutionalised.},

Title = {Does learning matter for policy outcomes? The case of integrating
   climate finance into the EU budget},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF EUROPEAN PUBLIC POLICY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {25},
Number = {4},
Pages = {487-505},
Abstract = {A considerable body of work has invoked learning in seeking to explain
   observed patterns of EU policy change. This contribution scrutinizes the
   relevance of learning for understanding policy outcomes. We apply a
   consolidated framework based on factual, experiential and constructivist
   learning across the individual and organizational levels to examine the
   unlikely policy outcome of dedicating 20\% of the EU 2014-2020 budget to
   climate action. Learning did play some role in the policy outcome, in
   that the belief that climate policy integration (CPI) was an appropriate
   instrument to address climate change was the result of constructivist
   learning over the preceding decade. However, this learning was
   restricted to a handful of policy entrepreneurs in Cabinet/DG Clima, who
   largely pushed' the policy through based on pre-existing convictions.
   Conversely, beyond some experiential learning, there is little evidence
   that learning was a significant feature of the policy process amongst
   actors in other European institutions.},

Journal = {CRITICAL POLICY STUDIES},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {12},
Number = {4},
Pages = {469-490},
Abstract = {The paper explores the concept of World Bank capacity development. It
   argues that capacity development is under-defined, enabling the World
   Bank to live up to often contradictory demands toward domestic
   development and retaining legitimacy as a `knowledge bank'. On the
   ground, vagueness translates into technocratic approaches to
   institutional reform, based on a simple definition of learning. The case
   of central public administration reform in Moldova demonstrates how
   institutional changes under the label of capacity development translated
   into little change in administrative behavior. It shows how a country
   can maintain a sense of modernization through capacity development
   despite little actual change.},
