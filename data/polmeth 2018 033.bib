Abstract = {Gender and politics literature has a strong focus on policy progress and
   the conditions that facilitate progressive change. Yet, increased
   opposition to gender equality makes it urgent to examine if and how
   current attacks affect existing gender-equality policies and
   institutions. We develop a conceptual framework to map patterns of
   backsliding of gender-equality policies. Empirically, we focus on
   Central and Eastern Europe as a notable example of backsliding. We find
   that rather than the direct dismantling of gender-equality policies, the
   core dimensions challenged by processes of backsliding are
   implementation and accountability. We argue that backsliding affects the
   legitimacy and effectiveness of existing laws and undermines democracy.},

Abstract = {How can a state react to being a target of disinformation activities by
   another state without losing the moral ground that it seeks to protect?
   This essay argues that the concept of moral authority offers an original
   framework for addressing this dilemma. As a power resource, moral
   authority enables an actor to have its arguments treated with priority
   by others and to build support for its actions, but only as long as its
   behavior does not deviate from certain moral expectations. To develop
   moral authority, an actor engaged in combating digital propaganda must
   cultivate six normative attributes: truthfulness and prudence for
   demonstrating the nature of the harmful effects of disinformation;
   accountability, integrity, and effectiveness for establishing the
   normative standing of the actor to engage in counter-intervention; and
   responsibility for confirming the proportionality of the response.},

Title = {Neoliberalism, Violence, and the Body: Dollhouse and the Critique
   of the Neoliberal Subject},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL SOCIOLOGY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {12},
Number = {3},
Pages = {274-290},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {What is the relationship between neoliberal subjectivities and sexual
   violence? Prevailing accounts of neoliberalism assert a particular
   notion of subjectivity, reflected in the notion of homo oeconomicus as
   an entrepreneur of the self, embedded in social relations of
   competition, with characteristics to enable behaviors that affirm or
   reproduce neoliberal rationality. This article, drawing upon the
   television series Dollhouse, argues for a contrary understanding of
   subjectivity as concretely embodied, emerging from lived experience
   shaped by violence. We examine theoretical critiques of neoliberalism,
   which have not sufficiently explored the integral role of violence in
   neoliberalism's subject-forming process. Dollhouse, read as a
   theoretically informed diagnosis of neoliberal subjectivity, shows how
   subjects are produced in embodied, everyday lived experience and how
   violence-in particular sexual and racial violence-is integral to the
   inscription of neoliberal subjectivity. This analytical move enables a
   critique of the neoliberal subject in terms of the lived experience of
   subjectification, contributing to a political understanding of
   subjectivity which critiques the depoliticized image of the neoliberal
   subject.},

Abstract = {Since the 1980s, gender and politics scholarship has prospered alongside
   increases in women's descriptive representation. If a `feminist
   imperative' drives us to seek to transform as well as study politics,
   the potential impact of research and our role as change actors has been
   little studied. We ask: (1) what effects feminist scholars sought to
   have; (2) upon whom; (3) when; and (4) through what channels. With two
   cases - Nordic countries and the UK - we explore the opportunities and
   dilemmas faced in seeking to enhance descriptive representation and aim
   to contribute to the development of feminist theories of political
   change.},

Abstract = {This article discusses the history of randomized controlled trials
   (RCTs) in development economics and the ways in which their use has
   shaped disciplinary practices and development policy over the past two
   decades. We first explain how increased use of academic-run RCTs
   internationally has led to important methodological breakthroughs that
   have advanced our knowledge of human behavior as well as changes in how
   research is conducted, including routine practice of in-field
   apprenticeships for young researchers and the establishment of robust
   research infrastructure in numerous developing countries around the
   world. We then explore three ways in which the scale-up of
   evidence-informed programs and policies based on findings from RCTs have
   achieved real-world impact, giving examples for each. These include how
   rigorous evidence can help to resolve contentious policy debates; enable
   policy-makers to assess external validity of findings and draw lessons
   across contexts; and support institutionalization of evidence use in
   various types of organizations.},

Abstract = {From the late 1950s until 1975, the war between North and South Vietnam
   had both domestic and international consequences. Unlike the Cold War
   divide between the United States and the Soviet Union, the war between
   the Democratic Republic of Vietnam (DRV, the Communist North) and the
   Republic of Vietnam (RVN, the non-Communist South) was an armed conflict
   between two polities that both identified themselves as Vietnamese. In
   this twenty-year-long struggle, the fates of the DRV and the RVN were
   tied to their success in producing new generations who would subscribe
   to their respective agendas. This was done through many venues, of which
   education was one of the most important. Relying on archival materials
   and published documents, this article compares the educational systems
   at the primary and secondary school levels in the DRV and RVN after the
   division of the country, with a special focus on the period 1965-1975.},

Abstract = {The Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) is a core policy of the European
   Union (EU), representing 40 per cent of the EU budget and a cornerstone
   of the integration process. Due to the path dependency that defined its
   evolution, it had always been a rather homogeneous and centralized
   policy. For the first time, the 2014-20 reform endowed Member States
   with the possibility to tailor the direct payments of the CAP along
   different fields of flexibility and thereby better address their
   national needs. This article examines these national choices in terms of
   the discontinuity they impose on the centralized policy model, showing
   that they reduced the policy inertia associated to the historical
   processes in place at the EU level, along a new national path dependency
   re-shaping the CAP implementation. The flexibility introduced by the
   2014-20 reform was particularly embraced by Member States that had been
   penalized by the one-size-fits-all' historical archetype.},

Abstract = {This article draws on ethnographic fieldwork and in-depth interviews
   with forty North Korean escapees involved in smuggling and brokerage
   networks and explores North Korean escapees' cross-border mobility to
   China. It addresses the complexities of smuggling, showing how the
   category spans a continuum of actions that might be described as saving
   or rescuing at one pole, and the kind of exploitation generally termed
   trafficking at the other. By focusing on the multiple and varied
   interests and motivations of different actors who assist with North
   Korean women's migration, I argue that differences among trafficking,
   smuggling, and migration are constructed rather than essential, and
   reflect a continued tendency among policy-makers to imagine human
   mobility through the lens of a fictional opposition between actions that
   are forced and those that are voluntary. The North Korean women's
   migratory processes demonstrate the complexities of brokerage and
   smuggling networks, revealing how they can, but do not necessarily,
   entail the kind of exploitation generally termed trafficking.},

Abstract = {Policy feedback, or the process in which policies create constituencies
   vested in their maintenance, is a durable feature of the American
   welfare state. Scholars have shown that policy visibility conditions how
   feedback effects unfold: for public-private policiesarrangements in
   which the state delegates service provision to private actors, often
   described as hidden or submergedpolicy feedback typically galvanizes not
   citizens but market actors that benefit indirectly from these subsidies.
   This article extends theories of public-private policy feedback from
   market actors to charitable organizations through a case study of the
   charitable contributions deduction. The deduction's incremental
   expansion is found to have mobilized charities as powerful stakeholders
   in the policy's endurance. Charities' efforts to protect the deduction,
   together with the efforts of lawmakers, have couched the policy in a
   politics of neoliberalism and disguised its effects, insulating it from
   reform even as elites have netted a greater share of its benefits over
   time.},

Abstract = {Previous research finds citizens' attitudes towards international
   redistribution in the European sovereign debt crisis to be related to
   party preferences. This article further reveals the nature of this link.
   We show that citizens follow party cues on international bailouts,
   rather than having merely ideologically congruent positions. By
   employing an original survey experiment that exposes respondents to
   elite cues, we additionally uncover underlying dynamics. First, party
   cues mobilize support for bailouts even in the face of salient elite
   dissent and, second, even a strong elite consensus does not affect
   citizens without PID and low levels of political sophistication. The
   findings of the experiment are cross-validated with data from the voter
   survey of European Election Study 2014. The results suggest that current
   debates about international bailout packages deepen a polarization
   between politicized and non-politicized Europeans.},

Abstract = {Since the 1980s, United Nations (UN) Member States have seen issues of
   drug policy predominantly as problems of law enforcement and security,
   alienated from other UN priorities, including human rights. However,
   developments in the UN and global challenges, like HIV/AIDS have made
   have made it more difficult to separate drug policy from its impact on
   the health and human rights of people who use drugs, particularly drug
   dependent people. As a result, several UN and human rights bodies have
   all begun to include human rights considerations in their policy
   documents. Despite these positive developments, the UN human rights
   system lags behind and UN human rights bodies fall short in addressing
   human rights violations against people who use drugs. To remedy this
   shortfall, this article first explains the need for new guidelines on
   drug policy and human rights by describing the impact of drug policy on
   human rights and the ways in which UN human rights bodies have thus far
   failed to adequately address violations suffered by people who use
   drugs. The authors join other international organizations and activists
   calling for the adoption of the guidelines (a human rights impact
   assessment tool) to provide the UN human rights treaty bodies and
   special procedures with clear guidance on how to assess drug policy
   issues through the prism of international human rights standards.},

Title = {Sovereign lending after debt relief},
Journal = {REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL ECONOMY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {25},
Number = {3},
Pages = {317-339},
Abstract = {Debt relief has been controversial due to its potential to reward
   irresponsible behavior by debtor governments. Recently, however,
   observers note that debt relief might also induce irresponsible behavior
   by creditor governments. A collective action problem might exist, where
   creditor governments target new loans to developing countries that just
   received debt relief from a different creditor. I investigate if debt
   relief affects decisions by creditor governments to provide new loans.
   Additionally, I analyze which types of creditor governments are more
   likely to lend to recipients of debt relief. I find that China and other
   emerging creditors are not more likely to lend to recipients of debt
   relief than western creditor governments. Instead, creditor governments
   of smaller economies are more likely than those of larger economies to
   free-ride on debt relief provided by other lenders. If states lend to
   gain influence, larger lenders will typically crowd out smaller
   creditors. However, if a debtor state just received debt relief and is
   therefore viewed as a greater risk, small creditors may see an
   opportunity to gain influence by providing a loan that no other state
   wants to provide.},

Abstract = {This article assesses a claim by Khrushchev that warnings from the
   Soviet intelligence services enabled to him to deter a Turkish invasion
   of Syria in 1957. The article shows that the United States and Turkey
   did aim to overthrow the Syrian government, with the Turks massing an
   invasion force on Syria's border. Soviet intelligence detected this
   threat and was able to alert Khrushchev, who took diplomatic and
   military countermeasures. However, while the Soviet intelligence
   services did provide advance warning, Khrushchev overestimated the
   extent to which the United States was committed to a Turkish invasion.},

Abstract = {This chapter assesses the availability and usefulness of environmental,
   climate, population and health data in Brazil, with the aim of enabling
   the construction of indicators for monitoring the health-related effects
   of environmental and climate changes. This task was performed by means
   of thematic workshops held between 2009 and 2011, aiming to define the
   data to be made available, the data sources to be used and the
   integration strategies. Sentinel sites were highlighted, where some
   local problems relating to possible impacts of environmental and climate
   change were being studied. These workshops involved the participation of
   potential data users and producers, such as civil society members,
   governmental institutions and researchers. The local studies showed
   close correlations between climate variables and the incidence of
   vector-borne diseases, respiratory and cardiovascular diseases
   associated with exposure to smoke generated by fires, and waterborne
   diseases. The indicators selected provided support for academic studies
   and the development of technological innovations in the fields of
   climate and health. An integrative platform was built in order to
   disseminate health and climate information, original data, environmental
   and epidemiological indicators, news and technical publications. The
   Website also made it possible for these changes to be followed and
   debated within civil society.},

Abstract = {In October 2011, the four ruling coalition parties in Slovakia failed to
   agree upon updating the European Financial Stability Facility. It was
   ultimately approved with the help of the opposition in exchange for an
   early election. This self-destructive behaviour by the ruling coalition
   remains a puzzle with the only available explanations merely referring
   to the irrationality of the domestic political elite. Our research
   tackles this problem using game theory. By focusing on the preferences
   of the key leaders, this article shows that although the fall of
   government was the only rational outcome, other factors beyond the scope
   of rational choice theory can suggest a possible explanation.},

Abstract = {This chapter explores the dynamics of the commercial relationships
   between the European East India Companies and Indian merchants, and
   examines the local and global forces that shaped this relationship. In
   carrying out their large-scale trade in India, the EIC and the VOC
   depended heavily on Indian merchants, who extended a variety of
   professional commercial services to the companies. Indian merchants too
   benefited from this and sought affiliation with the companies as it
   presented lucrative commercial opportunities as well as social and
   political advantages. The relationship that developed between the two
   was one of interdependence and complementarity. It was also competitive
   and, at times, contestable. Through a comparative analysis of the EIC's
   and VOC's relationship with Indian merchants, this chapter seeks to
   understand the significance of this strategic alliance for European
   commercial enterprise in India in the early modern period.},

Abstract = {This article will widen existing analyses of Russian imperial narratives
   through the introduction of the concept of hybrid exceptionalism',
   referring to discourses and practices of hierarchy emanating from the
   country's liminal position between East and West. In its variousTsarist,
   Soviet, contemporaryguises, Russia is posited to have reproduced
   narratives of hierarchy by formulating civilising missions within a
   distinct sphere of interest. Transcending political discontinuities,
   such hierarchical civilising missions have been a defining feature of
   various Russian worldviews for centuries, and are poised to remain so in
   the absence of a major redefinition of Russian national identity.},

   handled the aftermath of the Chernobyl nuclear disaster in Belarus and
   Ukraine in the period 1992-2014. It shows that the official and

   Europe and Russia that were linked to the national narratives of the
   Belarusian authorities and opposition, while the official and
   alternative media in Ukraine carried congruent representations of Europe
   and Russia that were not linked to the competing national narratives of
   the political actors. It is further argued that while the media in
   Belarus constructed its national identity as present-oriented, the media
   of Ukraine presented its national identity as past-centred.},

Abstract = {The US government was a late adopter of support and advocacy for
   international sexual orientation and gender identity (SOGI) human
   rights. Although US support for SOGI human rights did not begin in the
   Obama administration, after 2011 such support was expanded, publicized,
   and institutionalized. Since the 2016 presidential election, many
   international and grassroots LGBTQI human rights activists have
   expressed concern about the prospects for US SOCA advocacy in the Trump
   administration. No definitive policy changes have been made public, but
   clues to the future of US advocacy for SOGI can be found in a variety of
   sites. These include the discourse and policy articulations of the
   secretary and human rights officials in the State Department as well as
   those of legislators who fund human rights programs and exercise
   oversight over it.},

   heart of business models of many of the largest information and
   communication technologies companies risks instrumentalizing human
   beings. Second, concentrations of wealth and market power online may be
   contributing to economic inequalities and other forms of domination.
   Third, long-standing tensions between the security of states and the
   human security of people in those states have not been at all resolved
   online and deserve attention.},

Abstract = {The Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID) has made more contributions to
   the study of income volatility than any other dataset in the United
   States. Its record of providing data for seminal research is unmatched.
   In this article, we first present the reasons that the PSID has made
   such major contributions to research on the topic. Then we review the
   major papers that have used the PSID to study income volatility,
   comparing their results to those using other datasets. Last, we present
   new results for income volatility among U.S. men through 2014, finding
   that both gross volatility and the variance of transitory shocks display
   a three-phase trend: upward trends from the 1970s to the 1980s, a stable
   period in the 1990s through the early 2000s, and a large increase during
   the Great Recession.},

Abstract = {A key influence on governance and regulation is the ideology of
   individual decisionmakers. However, certain branches of government -
   such as courts - while wielding wide ranging regulatory powers, are
   expected to do so with no attitudinal influence. We posit a dynamic
   response model to investigate attitudinal behavior in different national
   courts. Our ideological scores are estimated based on probability models
   that formalize the assumption that judicial decisions consist of
   ideological, strategic, and jurisprudential components. The Dynamic
   Comparative Attitudinal Measure estimates the attitudinal decisionmaking
   on the institution as a whole. Additionally, we estimate Ideological
   Ideal Point Preference for individual justices. Empirical results with
   original data for political and religious rights rulings in the Supreme
   Courts of the United States, Canada, India, the Philippines, and Israel
   corroborate the measures' validity. Future studies can utilize
   Ideological Ideal Point Preference and the Dynamic Comparative
   Attitudinal Measure to cover additional courts, legal spheres, and time
   frames, and to estimate government deference.},

Abstract = {This article reviews contemporary academic debates about feminist
   organising in and against neoliberalism, which we see as structured by a
   co-optation-resistance dichotomy. We outline three narratives: a
   high-profile `strong' co-optation thesis; a more nuanced co-optation
   discourse; and an emergent counter-narrative of resistance. While
   sympathetic to the latter two, we critically unpack the account of
   neoliberalism, of feminist protagonists and of where feminist activism
   takes place in all three. We sketch out ways in which neoliberalism and
   the `who' and `where' of feminism might be considered differently, and
   argue overall for the need to move beyond the co-optation-resistance
   dichotomy.},

Abstract = {In 2010, the Pew Charitable Trusts and the John D. and Catherine T.
   MacArthur Foundation launched an initiative called Results First to help
   states and local governments better incorporate evidence into their
   policy, budget, and management-related decision-making. This article
   reviews the early results and lessons of Results First by summarizing
   the initiative and the current level of evidence use in the states,
   describing political and administrative obstacles that have complicated
   similar efforts, and discussing how Results First is addressing them. I
   conclude that rational, top-down policymaking by elected officials is
   taking place in states and that Results First appears to be having some
   success in helping to make policy decisions better informed. I also
   argue, though, that Results First may be having an even greater effect
   by encouraging evidence-based management among appointed officials and
   non-policymaking civil servant managers, and that this may help
   evidence-based policy avoid some of the pitfalls that have undermined
   previous efforts at government reform.},

Abstract = {In the past 20 years, feminist non-governmental organizations (NGOs)
   have increasingly engaged in transnational legal activism in the
   Americas not only to seek individual remedies for victims/survivors of
   abuses of women's human rights, but also to pressure states to make
   legal and policy changes, to promote human rights cultures and to
   strengthen the demands of women's movements. Yet the scholarship on
   transnational feminist activism overlooks transnational litigation
   practices. Studies of transnational legal mobilization tend to ignore
   the relationship between human rights and feminist advocacy networks, or
   between NGOs and the victims whose knowledge and experience serve as the
   basis for transnational litigation practices. This article draws from
   research on transnational legal activism over cases of women's human
   rights presented to the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights
   against Brazil. It builds on the `epistemologies of the South' framework
   to examine how human rights NGOs that specialize in transnational
   litigation, feminist advocacy NGOs, grassroots feminist organizations
   and victims/survivors (or family victims) of intimate (partner) violence
   against women engage in transnational legal activism, negotiate power
   relations, and exchange their knowledges/visions on human rights and
   justice. The legalistic view on human rights held by the more
   professionalized NGOs tends to prevail over grassroots feminist
   organizations' and survivors' perspectives on human rights and justice.
   To promote global justice, human rights activism must include epistemic
   justice and must legitimate all types of knowledge produced by all the
   actors involved.},

Abstract = {The role of national parliaments in EU matters has become an important
   subject in the debate over the democratic legitimacy of the European
   Union. Yet despite a remarkable increase in parliamentary involvement in
   EU affairs, the added value in terms of democratic legitimacy will
   remain limited if citizens are not aware of their activities. Given that
   citizens mainly experience politics through the media, the aim of the
   paper is therefore to explore whether and under what conditions
   parliamentary involvement in EU matters is visible in national
   newspapers. The paper draws on two quantitative datasets covering
   parliamentary EU activities and relevant newspaper articles in seven
   Member States between 2010 and 2013. Results suggest that the efforts of
   active parliaments pay off. In addition, conflict within government
   coalitions over EU issues and greater salience of EU politics in public
   opinion increase coverage while, surprisingly, both public and
   parliamentary euroscepticism do not.},

Abstract = {First embodied by the European Supervisory Authorities in 2010, agency
   governance in the financial sector has gained momentum with the creation
   of the Single Resolution Board (SRB) - an EU agency with considerable
   competencies in banking prudential policy. Within a short period, backed
   by the ESMA-Short Selling case' judgment, agencies have progressed from
   supporting the European Commission with their quasi-rule making, to a
   more prominent role in the decision-making process, potentially
   influencing policy-makers' agenda. By engaging in a qualitative analysis
   of legal documents, official texts and relevant scholarship, this
   research note examines the formal framework and practical aspects of
   SRB's governance, in order to substantiate whether its establishment
   presents a qualitative increase' in financial sector agencification. At
   the same time, the research note highlights problematic issues arising
   because of the limitations set by the Meroni doctrine arguing that the
   Board's wide powers on paper' may prove challenging to implement in
   practice.},

Abstract = {This article examines the role of the European Commission in
   non-legislative policy co-ordination in the European Union. Using the
   Open Method of Co-ordination (OMC) in the oft-neglected sector of
   cultural policy as a case study, it argues that rather than a neutral
   facilitator as it appears on paper, the Commission occupies both a
   political and administrative leadership role in the operation of the
   culture OMC. Through analysis of policy documentation, interviews and
   non-participant observation material, the article demonstrates how the
   Commission has operated as a key driver and agenda-setter in the field,
   exposing the inter-institutional dynamics in a competence in which the
   EU has a supporting role. The findings thus have broader implications
   for the study of agenda-setting and European integration in policy
   sectors where the EU holds a supporting competence.},

Title = {Structural conditions for currency internationalization: international
   finance and the survival constraint},
Journal = {REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL ECONOMY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {25},
Number = {5},
Pages = {699-725},
Abstract = {This paper examines the relationship between currency
   internationalization and economic structure. It argues that the
   hierarchical and asymmetric architecture of the international monetary
   system imposes a survival constraint' upon non-center countries that
   obliges them to generate net inflows of the international center
   currency to finance their payment commitments. It outlines why
   management of this constraint has historically been associated with a
   development approach that prioritizes exports and investment over
   domestic consumption and illustrates how this development approach
   creates economic structure subject to path dependence and network
   effects, which perpetuates the role of non-center countries as users of
   the international currency and the role of the center country as
   supplier of the international currency. On this basis, it is argued that
   currency internationalization cannot be pursued in isolation from
   broader economic policy, but rather requires economic structural change,
   political mediation and accommodative balance of payments management.
   Specifically, raising the international profile of the Chinese renminbi
   would require rebalancing of the Chinese economy towards domestic
   demand, whereas the status of the US dollar is intimately intertwined
   with the international openness of the US economy.},

Title = {Curious erasures: the sexual in wartime sexual violence},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL FEMINIST JOURNAL OF POLITICS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {20},
Number = {3},
Pages = {295-314},
Abstract = {Wartime sexual violence is especially egregious precisely because it is
   a sexual form of violence that causes particular harms. Yet, curiously,
   and in contrast to feminist theory on sexual violence more generally,
   the sexual has been erased from frames of understanding in dominant
   accounts of wartime rape. This article places the seeming certainty that
   ``wartime rape is not about sex (it's about power/violence){''} under
   critical scrutiny and poses questions about the stakes of the erasure of
   the sexual in explanations of conflict-related sexual violence. It
   argues that the particular urgency that accompanies this erasure
   reflects the workings of familiar distinctions between war and peace, as
   well as efforts to clearly recognize violence and separate it from sex.
   Erasing the sexual from accounts of wartime rape thus ultimately
   reinscribes the normal and the exceptional as separate, and reproduces a
   reductive notion of heterosexual masculine sex (in peacetime) that is
   ontologically different from the violence of war.},

Abstract = {This chapter will analyze the concept of national minorities as it is
   understood and implemented in federal Switzerland. It attempts to
   examine how traditional Swiss understandings of unity and diversity are
   being challenged by the European Framework Convention for the Protection
   of National Minorities which is currently ratified by 39 European states
   and designed to be implemented in unitary, decentralized as well as
   federal states. While protecting and promoting diversity in unity has
   always been at the heart of the pluralistic Swiss state, the concept of
   accommodating ``national minorities{''} has been introduced to the Swiss
   scene mainly by international law.
   The chapter will also outline the original understanding of unity and
   diversity in Switzerland and the empirical and legal challenges that
   demographic changes and the Framework Convention has brought to the
   country. The author will then examine the conceptual reactions and
   responses to these challenges by investigating the initial report on the
   implementation of the Framework Convention submitted by Switzerland in
   2001 and the three subsequent reporting cycles documenting numerous
   changes in law and policies as well as reform projects that are
   affecting national minorities. By doing so, the author attempts to
   clarify the interactions between the country's traditional, mostly
   federal, patterns of dealing with diversity in unity and the new ways of
   thinking about and accommodating national minorities introduced by the
   Framework Convention. The guiding question will be if and how the
   implementation of the Convention has impacted on the original Swiss
   arrangements developed to deal with the country's plurality.},

   Dialogue in Information-Poor Environments: A Cambodian Example},
Booktitle = {COMMUNICATING CLIMATE CHANGE INFORMATION FOR DECISION-MAKING},
Series = {Springer Climate},
Year = {2018},
Pages = {149-160},
Abstract = {Community preparedness for the impacts of climate change on livelihoods
   in the Asia-Pacific region is largely unknown. Scientific impact
   projections and quality data (at a scale relevant to local adaptation
   decision-making) are rare in countries such as Cambodia, particularly in
   rural areas. Adaption (including mitigation, adaptation, transformation
   and maladaptation) therefore predominantly occurs in an information-poor
   environment. In this chapter, we present some findings of a
   collaboration between two projects: first, the UN FAO Life and Nature
   watershed management project-a project incorporating vulnerability
   assessments, improved land use practices, and climate-smart agricultural
   adaptation, with a gender focus; and second, The Community Resilience
   and Climate Adaptation project-a small research project that developed a
   rapid assessment of community resilience to inform adaptation planning.
   Our common aim has been to address the absence of quality climate
   information for adaptation planning through the use of vulnerability and
   resilience assessment and policy dialogue. We demonstrate the importance
   of adaptation dialogue processes as mechanisms for introducing climate
   change information into decision-making. We argue that such processes
   are paramount to communicating quality information when and if it does
   become available, given that communities already recognize the impacts
   of climate change upon them, and in addition, they create a
   sociocultural context conducive to adaptation and transformation,
   exposing the limitations of existing mitigation strategies.},

   evolution of an Australian National Security Community},
Journal = {INTELLIGENCE AND NATIONAL SECURITY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {33},
Number = {1},
Pages = {1-20},
Abstract = {Since 2001 expenditure on the security services has increased
   exponentially in Western democracies and particularly amongst the Five
   Eyes community of the UK, the US, Canada, Australia and New Zealand.
   This has occurred in conjunction with the expansion of counter-terror
   laws. Yet somewhat problematically the phenomenon of Islamist inspired
   violence became more threatening to the internal security of western
   democracies in the first decade of the twenty- first century. This study
   examines the Western managerial approach to security using Australia as
   a case study. It argues that the growth of Australian security agencies
   since 2001 and their evolution into a National Security Community after
   2008 has neglected basic maxims of political and constitutional prudence
   and eschews the modern state's own contractual self - understanding of
   sovereignty and political obligation.},

Abstract = {Nuclear colonialism, or the exploitation of Indigenous lands and peoples
   to sustain the nuclear fuel cycle from uranium mining and refining to
   nuclear energy and weapons production and the dumping of the resulting
   nuclear waste, occurs in many parts of the world and has generated
   considerable protest. This article focuses on a contemporary and ongoing
   case of nuclear colonialism in Canada: attempts to site two national
   deep geological repositories (DGRs) for nuclear waste on traditional
   First Nations land in Southwestern Ontario near the world's largest
   operational nuclear power plant. Through histories of the rise of
   nuclear power and nuclear waste policy-making and their relationship to
   settler colonialism in Canada, as well as actions taken by the Saugeen
   Ojibway Nation (SON) and white settler anti-nuclear waste movements, the
   article explores how gender is at work in nuclear colonialism and
   anti-nuclear waste struggles. Gender is explored here in terms of the
   patriarchal nuclear imperative, the appropriation of Aboriginal land
   through undermining Aboriginal women's status and the problematic
   relationship between First Nations and white settler women-led movements
   in resistance to nuclear waste burial from a feminist decolonial
   perspective},

Journal = {EUROPE-ASIA STUDIES},

Volume = {70},
Number = {1},
Pages = {53-74},
Abstract = {This article focuses on post-2000 Russian education reforms,
   specifically the eradication of regional components from the school
   curriculum (in 2007) and the introduction of the Unified State
   Examination (in 2009), as part of a wider shift towards centralisation
   in Russian education. Based on ethnographic fieldwork in a semi-urban
   community in the Republic of Tatarstan over the period 2009-2013, the
   article examines what impact these reforms had on local practices of
   schooling, on the educational strategies of the population, and on
   minority language education more widely. It reveals that, while the new
   institutional framework imposed by the reforms limited the exposure of
   pupils to regional and ethno-cultural identity narratives, local
   educators managed to use the limited possibilities within the schools to
   promote ethnic and regional belonging.},

   Statist-patrimonial Capitalism},
Journal = {NEW POLITICAL ECONOMY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {23},

Pages = {314-330},
Abstract = {Manifestations of patrimonialism such as corruption and state predation
   on business are widespread in many emerging economies. This paper
   presents the case of Russian political economy, dubbed
   statist-patrimonial capitalism', which is marked by state threats to
   private property rights through bureaucratic extortion or legal
   harassment. How can we explain the resilience of Russia's
   statist-patrimonial capitalism? Predominant accounts focus on the lack
   of institutional constraints on state predation. The paper offers a
   different perspective by exploring the often-overlooked contribution of
   small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). First, statistical data show
   a steady rise of SMEs in the 2000s despite increasing state predation,
   suggesting that SMEs are not simply subjugated by the state. Second,
   in-depth interviews with Russian entrepreneurs reveal that business
   contributes to the maintenance of the statist-patrimonial system through
   the mechanism of the informality trap': firms that choose the informal
   strategy have difficulties to return to the legal sphere and get stuck
   in informality. The drivers of informality include firm-specific
   characteristics, institutional factors and socio-cultural factors dubbed
   normality'. The mechanism of the informality trap' highlights the agency
   of firms in corrupt polities and may be applicable to other emerging
   economies.},

Abstract = {What do border guards and central bankers have in common? Both operate,
   on a day-to-day basis, in political spaces exempt from many of the norms
   of liberal democratic politics and yet have the power to define and
   constrain them. In order to understand the role of such routine
   suspensions in the norms of liberal politics, we need to move beyond
   analyses that focus narrowly on security exceptionalism or
   emergency-management and pay attention to the practices of technocratic
   exceptionalism. Drawing on Foucault's lectures on biopolitics, I examine
   the ways in which economic theory and practice has sought to resolve
   some of the central tensions in liberalism by protecting the market from
   too much democracy-a kind of exceptionalism exemplified by the doctrine
   of central bank independence.},

Abstract = {This essay explores the ethical and legal implications of prioritizing
   the militarization of cyberspace as part of a roundtable on ``Competing
   Visions for Cyberspace.{''} Our essay uses an ideal type-a world that
   accepts warfighting as the prime directive for the construction and use
   of cyberspace-and examines the ethical and legal consequences that
   follow for (i) who will have authority to regulate cyberspace; (ii) what
   vehicles they will most likely use to do so; and (iii) what the rules of
   behavior for states and stakeholders will be. We envision a world where
   states would take on a greater role in governance but remain constrained
   by law, including jus ad helium and jus in bello criteria, but also
   sovereignty, nonintervention, and self-determination. We ask if the net
   result would mean states causing less harm than they do in kinetic
   conflicts. Ultimately, our essay takes no position on whether cyberspace
   should be a militarized domain (let alone one where warfighting is the
   prime directive). Rather, our goal is to situate a warfighting cyber
   domain within the reality of a pluralist cyberspace, where ethical
   imperatives compete or coalesce to support specific governance
   mechanisms.},

Abstract = {International organizations (IOs) have developed into important policy
   venues beyond the state. Yet our understanding of the broader dynamics
   of IO policy-making is limited. This article offers the first
   comparative analysis of macro patterns in IO policy-making.
   Theoretically, we draw on punctuated equilibrium theory to develop
   hypotheses about stability and change in the orientation of IO policy
   agendas. Empirically, we examine novel data on the policy output of five
   general-purpose IOs between 1980 and 2015, combining statistical
   analysis and comparative case illustrations. The analysis yields two
   central results. First, the policy agendas of all five IOs display
   patterns of punctuated equilibria, with longer periods of stability
   interrupted by shorter periods of dramatic change. Second, the level of
   institutional friction in decision-making contributes to variation in
   punctuations across IOs and within IOs over time. The results suggest
   four broader implications: (1) punctuated equilibrium theory applies to
   a broader empirical domain than previously thought; (2) patterns of
   change in IOs are more complex than conventionally expected; (3)
   institutional friction matters for IOs' responsiveness to societal
   demands and problem pressures; and (4) deeper integration of punctuated
   equilibrium theory into the study of IOs can pave the way for a
   promising IR research agenda.},

Abstract = {Homonegative attitudes are strikingly high in Eastern Europe, and a
   schism among an enlarged Europe. To understand this, we examine the
   comparative and over-time role of individual political orientations.
   Using the World Values Survey, we investigate how these relate to
   homonegativity over time (1995-2014) in eight Eastern European nations,
   compared to a sample of seven Western nations. Individuals in all
   nations who hold nationalist and authoritarian values and are unengaged
   in politics have stronger homonegative attitudes. National pride and
   support for democracy are particularly important for Eastern Europeans.
   Cleavages in democratic values and narratives may be increasingly
   important over time.},

Abstract = {In the summer of 2017 Tunisia achieved some notable victories in the
   field of women's rights, while at the same time it witnessed the further
   backtracking of its already fragile transitional justice process. Though
   various analyses in local and international media have touched upon the
   current regime's use of gender-friendly policies to cover up its
   otherwise illiberal agenda, few have considered what the consequences of
   these developments are for the advancement of gender justice in Tunisia.
   This article looks into this question, focusing specifically on the
   transformative potential of the activities of Tunisia's Truth and
   Dignity Commission. It uses these insights to feed into the feminist
   academic debate on `transformative justice.' The Tunisian case study
   shows that reliance on technical innovations within traditional
   transitional justice mechanisms does not necessarily guarantee the
   pursuance of transformative justice outcomes which cross political
   divides.},

Abstract = {We examine how childhood adversity relates to work disability and life
   expectancy, using 1999 to 2015 data from the Panel Study of Income
   Dynamics. We estimate the probabilities of work disability and death,
   adjusting for age, sex, race/ethnicity, and education in a nationally
   representative sample of African American, Hispanic, and white women and
   men. We find that people in all these groups who experienced
   high-adversity childhoods (individuals with four or more of six
   adversity indicators) had significantly more work disability and shorter
   lives than those who experienced no adversity. These findings provide
   evidence that childhood adversity is associated with substantial
   disability and a reduction in life expectancy of at least a decade.
   Childhood adversity was generally associated with more lost years of
   life for men than for women, and more disability for women than for men.
   The results are robust, even when controlling for diabetes, heart
   disease, depression, obesity, and sedentary behavior.},

Abstract = {Development promotes bureaucratization, and bureaucracies are based on
   knowledge and produce knowledge. Failures of development are therefore
   regularly attributed to a lack of knowledge. The article argues that the
   quest for knowledge is embedded in the managerial rationality of
   interventions. This rationality also structures the developmental
   knowledge field and thereby generates ignorance. The example of a
   state-building program in Somalia is used to empirically explore how the
   generation, administration, and transfer of knowledge was intertwined
   with ignorance. It shows what knowledge missed, obfuscated, ignored, or
   even hid and how knowledge and ignorance were arranged in the daily
   state-building practice. This approach sheds light on relations and
   mechanism of power exerted in development and helps to explain its
   effects. In Somalia, omission, silence, secrecy, and strategic and
   bureaucratic ignorance enabled the program to delineate the
   interventionist terrain as technical and to depoliticize state-building.
   They also helped to expand liberal modalities of government to
   ``remote{''} and ``unruly{''} Somali villages.},

Abstract = {The insertion of human rights commitments into international economic
   agreements is now a widespread practice. We argue that the effect of
   such commitments depends on the degree of leverage held by one partner
   over the other. In a comprehensive analysis of the European Union's
   (EU's) relations with developing countries, we find that human rights
   clauses are conditionally effective; they are associated with improved
   political freedom and physical integrity rights only in countries that
   are more heavily dependent on EU aid. An in-depth look at the EU's
   enforcement of its human rights clause in the African-Caribbean-Pacific
   (ACP) group reveals that the Union most often responds to violations of
   political rights-particularly coups and flawed elections-and that
   enforcement is indeed a more powerful catalyst for change in highly
   aid-dependent states. Alternative explanations-that the impact of the
   human rights clause depends on legalization, the country's strategic
   importance, NGO activity, or domestic institutions-find little support.},

Abstract = {During the Obama administration, the White House Office of Management
   and Budget's (OMB) leadership helped to initiate and cement
   evidence-based policymaking reforms across the federal government,
   particularly in social services programs. Notable accomplishments were
   in the design of outcome-focused programs that use and build evidence,
   the strengthening of agency evaluation capacity, and interagency
   data-linkage projects to harness administrative data. Here, I review
   those accomplishments and catalog the key assets and tactics that OMB
   used to help federal agencies increase their use of evidence and
   innovation. I also assess the shortcomings and limitations of the
   Obama-era OMB approach and draw conclusions about what could be done in
   the current or a future administration to further advance evidence-based
   policymaking in the executive branch. Specifically, I propose that
   Congress and the administration should work to improve agency evaluation
   capacity, assess and report on agencies' progress in using and building
   evidence, and establish an Intergovernmental Evidence and Innovation
   Council.},

Abstract = {Human service nonprofits are a major provider of social services in this
   country, spending billions of dollars each year implementing programs to
   improve outcomes for their clients. Unfortunately, these programs are
   typically not rigorously evaluated to determine whether they are having
   their intended effect. Many obstacles make it challenging to rigorously
   evaluate services provided by these nonprofits, including evaluation
   costs, limited access to data, and small sample sizes, but these
   obstacles are surmountable. Policy-makers could accelerate the pace and
   quality of evidence building by providing more resources for impact
   evaluations, streamlining and standardizing access to key administrative
   data, and expanding support for the replication of effective programs.
   Better evidence of what works for human service nonprofits will
   ultimately mean more effective programs at the national level.},

Abstract = {Preferential trade agreements (PTAs) trigger investment through their
   commitment to a liberal market economy. Increasingly however, PTAs go
   far beyond liberalizing trade and investment flows. Especially
   controversial features included in most modern PTAs are environmental
   and labor standards. Do these standards affect business activity? If so,
   how do investors react to such non-trade issues in trade deals? The
   literature provides inconclusive findings about the impact of standards
   on foreign direct investment (FDI). Some contributors argue that strict
   standards decrease FDI, whilst others claim that environmental and labor
   protection increases productivity and, in consequence, inward
   investment. In all likelihood, the usage of aggregated FDI data, as is
   the case for most studies, causes confusion. I expect standards to
   influence investors' decisions - but heterogeneously across sectors.
   Environmental and labor standards should reduce FDI in polluting and
   low-skilled labor endowed industries, but increase investment in
   environmentally clean and high-skilled labor abundant sectors. Based on
   an original dataset of environmental and social standards in trade
   agreements and at the sector-level disaggregated US-FDI data, I find
   robust support for my argument. The paper provides a more nuanced
   picture on the standards and investment nexus: Standards have no uniform
   effect on multinationals. Instead, they are good for some, but bad for
   other industries.},

Abstract = {Estimates of the size of the multiracial population in the United States
   depend on what prompts people to report multiple races on censuses and
   surveys. We use data from the 2015 Pew Survey of Multiracial Adults to
   explore how racial self-identification is shaped by the generational
   locus of an individual's multiracial ancestry-that is, the place in
   one's family tree where the earliest interracial union appears. We
   develop the theoretical rationale for considering generational
   heterogeneity and provide its first empirical demonstration for U.S.
   adults, by estimating what shares of the population identify multiracial
   ancestry in their parents' or grandparents' generation, or further back
   in their family tree. We find that multiracial generation is related
   to-and likely confounded with-the ancestry combinations that individuals
   report (e.g., white-Asian, black-American Indian). Finally, we show that
   later generations are less likely than their first-generation
   counterparts to select multiple races when they self-identify.
   Consequently, we argue that generational locus of multiracial ancestry
   should be taken into account by demographers and researchers who study
   outcomes for multiracial Americans.},

   a position to exercise effective scrutiny of national fiscal policies.
   It identifies substantial heterogeneity across IFIs in resources which

   comply-or-explain mechanisms and closer links with legislatures could
   enhance fiscal surveillance and accountability in the EU. The paper

Abstract = {Science diplomacy represents a relatively novel field of EU external
   action. This contribution provides a better understanding of the
   under-researched development of this policy domain, asking how and why
   the EU has extended the scope of its external activities in the
   scientific area. To answer these questions, it conducts an analysis of
   EU policy-makers' discourses on external science policies inspired by
   role theory. It finds that EU role conceptions in this domain take the
   forms of science for diplomacy' or diplomacy for science', and that they
   correspond either to an image of normative or market power Europe. These
   findings are confirmed by a study of the EU's recent external science
   policies. The article argues that the ambiguity of rationales invoked
   for introducing a genuine science diplomacy in the EU helps to appeal to
   different constituencies. This, in turn, enhances the Union's chances
   for successfully expanding the scope of its activities.},

   it in achieving this goal? We apply an econometric gravity analysis to
   bilateral trade. Unlike earlier analysis, we acknowledge that Schengen
   treats different country pairs differently, depending on their relative
   geographical location. Moreover, we find it crucial to carefully control
   for other elements of European integration such as membership in the
   customs union, the single market or the currency union, and to factor in
   countries' trade with themselves. Schengen has boosted trade by about
   2.81 per cent on average, on top of the EU's trade effects (equivalent
   to a drop in tariffs between 0.46 and 1.02 percentage points). Trade
   creation effects for services are stronger than for goods, but estimates
   feature larger parameter uncertainty. Peripheral countries benefit more
   than central ones. Other aspects of EU integration matter much more for
   trade than Schengen.},

Abstract = {Even under many formally democratic regimes, large swaths of the
   citizenry experience alienation from states with uneven presence
   throughout the national territory. Addressing a gap in scholarship that
   has examined why rather than how states establish new modes of
   engagement with subaltern groups, this article documents concrete
   mechanisms by which the Brazilian state built new state-society
   relations through a particular cultural policy. By recognizing and
   funding artistic initiatives in underserved communities, the program
   aimed to expand their access to the state and validate their role in the
   polity. On the basis of in-depth fieldwork in three Brazilian states,
   the article argues that new relations actually were forged through
   state-society encounters around the program's administrative procedures.
   The surprising twistthat paperwork, as much as art, played a
   transformative rolesheds new light on bureaucracy as a point of contact
   with the state and offers new insights into the ways that cultural
   politics can shift.},

Volume = {33},

Pages = {999-1021},
Abstract = {Intelligence agencies routinely use surveillance technology to perform
   surveillance on digital data. This practice raises many questions that
   feed a societal debate, including whether the surveillance technology is
   effective in achieving the given security goal, whether it is
   cost-efficient, and whether it is proportionate. Oversight bodies are
   important actors in this debate, overseeing budgets, legal and privacy
   matters, and the performance of intelligence agencies. This paper
   examines how oversight bodies evaluate the questions above, using
   documents produced by American and British oversight mechanisms.},

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL FEMINIST JOURNAL OF POLITICS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {20},
Number = {4},
Pages = {624-643},
Abstract = {Over the past three decades, international criminal legal standards on
   sexual and gender-based violence have developed rapidly, sparking debate
   within feminist circles over the extent to which these developments
   might be relevant to domestic contexts in a process termed norm
   transfer. Indeed, non-governmental organizations and feminist scholars
   have called for domestic adoption of the International Criminal Court
   (ICC) definition of rape due to its omission of the element of the
   absence of consent. However, the place of consent in an international
   criminal definition of rape is a hotly contested topic, with
   disagreement as to whether rape in conflict should be considered
   exceptional or a continuation of everyday violence against women. This
   article provides a new lens through which to explore these questions by
   situating the feminist strategy of norm transfer within the
   complementarity-based system of the ICC. It uncovers a number of gaps
   within the ICC definition that raise questions not only about the status
   of the definition as a candidate for norm transfer but also about the
   robustness of the definition itself. The article concludes by
   considering the role of consent as an implicit element within the ICC
   definition and its operation as a defense.},

   constitute `intelligence' and, third, it examines the main variables of
   regime, strategy and technology that must be considered in explaining
   the nature of intelligence systems. Finally, some implications for

Abstract = {Donetsk and Luhansk are often labeled pro-Russian regions as a result of
   the founding of Peoples' Republics there in spring 2014. This article
   investigates popular opinion in Donbas before armed conflict began, to
   determine whether the high concentration of ethnic Russians there drove
   support for separatism. Analysis of a KIIS opinion poll shows that, on
   the one hand, ethnic Russian respondents were divided on most separatist
   issues, with a minority backing separatist positions. On the other hand,
   they supported separatist issues in larger numbers than both ethnic
   Ukrainians and respondents with hybrid identities. Thus, while ethnic
   identity does not produce polarized preferences, it is relevant in
   shaping political attitudes. Also, analysis of an original database of
   statements made by Donbas residents indicate that they were motivated to
   support separatism by local concerns exacerbated by a sense of
   abandonment by Kyiv rather than by Russian language and pro-Russian
   foreign policy issues.},

Abstract = {This chapter explores the involvement of the East India Company (EIC) in
   the creation of a fleet in the Gulf by Nader Shah of Persia between 1734
   and 1747. It considers the rationale behind the EIC's assistance to the
   Persians and what shape it took, considering the pre-eminent position
   and threat attached by contemporaries to European ships. The chapter
   draws on the EIC's Persian Gulf Factory Records which shed new light on
   the ongoing negotiations between the EIC and Persian officials in
   country. The EIC were active in supporting the construction of a Persian
   fleet, turning a profit by supplying, not only ships, but also supplies
   and stores necessary for their maintenance. The provisions provided were
   a useful means through which the EIC gained favour with the Persian
   Court in a period of ongoing conflict and uncertainty.},

Pages = {1-34},
Abstract = {Turkmenistan has experienced increasing educational migration, and many
   of these students hope to return home after graduating. The ability of
   returned migrants to succeed in Turkmenistan's labor market is
   complicated by a variety of factors, including variation in educational
   quality across countries, intrusive state regulation of foreign
   education, and Turkmenistan's large informal sector. Based on a survey
   of 98 Turkmen citizens, this study compares the career trajectories and
   perceptions of the labor market of people educated in Turkmenistan to
   those educated elsewhere. Because men and women undertake different
   strategies of educational migration, it also compares patterns of labor
   market integration by gender. Country of education does appear to matter
   for employment in Turkmenistan, but the effect is most prominent
   immediately after graduation. Women were less likely to be employed in
   Turkmenistan, partly because they were more likely to have been educated
   abroad, and more likely to have a partner abroad.},

Abstract = {The essay investigates the survival strategies of foreign-funded Russian
   non-governmental organisations (NGOs) in the face of the so-called
   foreign agents' law of 2012. Conceptualising NGOs as autonomous social
   systems and drawing on two qualitative case studies of Russian NGOs in
   the fields of human rights protection, we show how these organisations
   manage to cope with the state's withdrawal of legitimacy by creatively
   handling their diverse environmental dependencies. Through shifting the
   relative importance of different audiences and generating new sources of
   legitimacy, they have eventually created and maintained small supportive
   ecologies within the overall environment of a political regime that does
   not tolerate them.},

   Regimes},
Journal = {NEW POLITICAL ECONOMY},

Pages = {627-639},
Abstract = {Refugees and migrants are often studied as though they have no relation
   to the racial and class structures of the societies in which they
   reside. They are strangers to be governed by integration' policy and
   border management. Refugees and migrants are, however, subjects of
   contemporary capitalism struggling to render themselves valuable
   capitalist modes of production. I study the government of refugees and
   migrants in order to examine capitalist value regimes. Societal values
   and hierarchies reflected in capitalist modes of production impact on
   struggles of racialised subaltern groups to translate body power into
   valued labour. Marx's account of surplus populations points to the
   common marginalisations of people called refugees' and other subaltern
   groups struggling to translate their body power into valorised labour.
   The essay includes a study of the gentrification of a district in
   Budapest, and its transformation into a means for the reproduction of
   capital, leading to the marginalisation of groups who no longer fit the
   new value regimes. Studying refugees as surplus populations allows for a
   sense of the common marginalisations of subaltern and racialised groups
   before capitalism, and questions the treatment of refugees and migrants
   as strangers'.},

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL FEMINIST JOURNAL OF POLITICS},

Abstract = {Feminist security studies (FSS) scholarship advocates the analysis of
   women's war experiences and narratives to understand conflict and
   military intervention. Here we add a non-great power focus to FSS
   debates on the gendered discourses of military interventionism. We zoom
   in on Danish and Swedish women soldiers' reflections on their
   involvement in the ISAF operation in Afghanistan. Their stories are
   deconstructed against the backdrop of their states' adoption of a
   cosmopolitan-minded ethic on military obligation. Both states employed
   women soldiers in dialogic peacekeeping in Afghanistan to establish
   links with local women and to gather intelligence, tasks that were less
   frequently afforded to male soldiers. However, feminist FSS scholarship
   locates military intelligence gathering within racial, gendered and
   imperialist power relations that assign victimhood to local women. This
   feminist critique is pertinent, but the gendered and racial logics
   governing international operations vary across national contexts. While
   such gender binaries were present in Danish and Swedish military
   practice in Afghanistan, our article shows that dialogical peacekeeping
   offered an alternative to stereotypical constructions of women as
   victims and men as protectors. Dialogical peacekeeping helped to disrupt
   such gendering processes, giving women soldiers an opportunity to
   rethink their gender identities while instilling dialogical relations
   with local women.},

Abstract = {Using the theoretical toolkit of material-semiotics, this article
   theorizes global migration governance as a governing technology that
   constitutes migration as an object of global governance.
   Methodologically, the analysis draws on event observation of the
   International Organization for Migration's International Dialogue on
   Migration. Empirically, the article uses the illustrative example of the
   International Organization for Migration's Migration Governance Index to
   make the case for a material-semiotic account of global migration
   governance more concrete. Overall, the article seeks to examine and
   enhance the contribution that practice-theoretical approaches make to
   the analysis of global governance.},

Abstract = {This article investigates the influence of family background and
   neighborhood conditions during childhood on health later in life, with a
   focus on hypertension. To document the proportion of current adult
   racial health disparities rooted in early-life factors, I use nationally
   representative longitudinal data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics
   (PSID) spanning four decades. The results indicate that racial
   differences in early life neighborhood conditions and family background
   characteristics play a substantial role in explaining racial disparities
   in hypertension through at least age 50. Contemporaneous socioeconomic
   factors account for relatively little of the racial disparities in this
   health condition in adulthood. Second, I match the PSID data to
   county-level data on Medicaid expenditures during these cohorts'
   childhoods, and provide new causal evidence on the long-run returns to
   childhood Medicaid spending: Medicaid-induced increases in access to
   public health insurance led to significant reductions in the likelihood
   of low birth weight, increased educational attainment and adult income,
   and reduced adult mortality and the annual incidence of health problems.},

Abstract = {Transitional justice and particularly criminal justice efforts within it
   are heavily reliant on victim support and a certain ability to speak `in
   the name of' victims. This article explores the complex figure of the
   `reluctant victim' by reexamining the legal treatment of Argentine
   children illegally `adopted' during the dictatorship and who refused to
   submit themselves to DNA testing. Such cases, it is argued, should be
   seen as emblematic of the ambivalence of many victims in transitional
   contexts, particularly when it comes to prosecutions. Moreover, they
   have a significant conceptual antecedent in debates among feminists on
   how to treat intimate partner violence and the rise of `mandatory
   punishment policies,' which can help shed light on the broader
   relationship of transitional justice and criminal justice to notions of
   victimhood, and the challenges of rendering justice for victims against
   their expressed will.},

Abstract = {Located at the intersection of political theory, memory studies and
   architecture, this article tentatively proposes the concept of
   architectural transitional justice (TJ) to capture architecture's power
   to provide favourable spaces for two interrelated processes: grappling
   with a violent past while simultaneously imagining a hopeful future. It
   argues that architecture can support - though not ensure - political
   renewal. While TJ scholars have explored architecture's part in
   memorialization, they have mostly focused on symbolic constructions.
   This article shifts focus and examines a broader category of buildings
   that were integral to the geography of violence but whose function was
   not primarily symbolic. Such buildings scar the architectural tissue of
   successor political orders. The article crosses disciplinary boundaries
   to understand how communities can valorize these scars, avoiding both
   nostalgic and tabula rasa approaches to reconstruction. The reinvention
   of two Nazi Flak towers in Vienna and Hamburg serves as a potential
   instantiation of architectural TJ.},

Abstract = {Intellectual property rights are a key piece of the expanded trade
   agenda, and the United States has pushed hard to strengthen protections
   beyond WTO standards in its trade agreements. While agreement provisions
   governing intellectual property are commonly thought to be an important
   driver of corporate preferences over US trade policy, systematic
   empirical evidence for this proposition, especially in comparison to
   other determinants of trade policy, is generally lacking. To fill this
   void, this paper examines variation in reliance on intellectual property
   across US industries to explain attitudes and lobbying on US trade
   agreements. The effects of IP provisions on support for US trade
   agreements are politically substantial, though trade remains the primary
   determinant of preferences over trade agreements.},

Abstract = {Since its coinage in the 1980s, intersectionality has journeyed across
   borders and disciplines, which is a testament to its resonance. We
   examine how intersectionality has travelled within political science and
   the potential impact that this has had on its political project, with
   particular attention to the politics of knowledge production. The
   analysis draws on: (1) an original database of articles published in
   political science journals; (2) descriptive citation analysis; (3) a
   content analysis of the articles; and (4) an online survey of authors.
   We find that positionality plays an important role in shaping the field
   and political project of intersectionality.},

Abstract = {The Nepali Compensation Relating to Torture Act (1996) is one of the
   earliest pieces of specific anti-torture legislation adopted in the
   global South. Despite a number of important limitations, scores of
   Nepalis have successfully litigated for monetary compensation under the
   Act, on a scale relatively rare on the global human rights scene. Using
   a qualitative case study approach, this article examines the conditions
   under which survivors of torture are awarded compensation in Nepal, and
   asks what lessons does this have for broader struggles to win monetary
   compensation for torture survivors? We end by suggesting that there can
   be practical tensions between providing individual financial
   compensation and addressing wider issues of accountability.},

Abstract = {Trade disputes are driven by domestic politics, and the onset of trade
   disputes are driven by changes in the leadership within states. We offer
   two stylized facts for explanation: Leader change leads to dispute
   onset, and the effect is greater in autocracies than in democracies. We
   develop a model that explains changes in trade policy and dispute onset
   induced by shifts in the sectors represented in government when leaders
   change. Democracies protect a wider set of industries at shallower
   levels than do autocracies. When leaders change in autocracies, new
   sectors enter the winning coalition, resulting in new deeper barriers
   that spark disputes. When leaders change in democracies, the change in
   the winning coalition is not as stark, and the depth of the shifts in
   trade barriers is not that large, resulting is a smaller effect on
   dispute initiation.},

Abstract = {There are more than 50 million Hispanics in the United States, composing
   16 percent of the population. Hispanics are also one of the
   fastest-growing race and ethnic groups. The American public often views
   and treats Hispanics as a racial group; yet 47 years after a Hispanic
   origin measure was added to the 1970 U.S. decennial census, and after
   numerous tests aimed at ameliorating racial measurement issues related
   to Hispanics, we continue to struggle with defining and measuring this
   population. In this article, we review literature about conceptual and
   measurement issues regarding Hispanic race reporting, evaluate public
   tabulations from one of the largest Census Bureau studies conducted in
   the 2010 Census to test strategies to improve race reporting for
   Hispanics, and discuss the opportunities and challenges of changing the
   race question on the decennial census to incorporate Hispanics.},

Abstract = {We identify two dimensions of race for the Latino/Hispanic population in
   the United States-Latinos as one category among the various categories
   of the U.S. ethno-racial pentagon and racial or color differences among
   Latinos. In a major change from the previous (two-question) format, the
   Census Bureau recommends a one-question format for capturing
   ethno-racial distinctions in the 2020 census, which efficiently captures
   the Latino population on the first dimension and is consistent with
   racial classification and identification in the real world. At the same
   time, it nearly eliminates the problem that the two-question format
   fostered of classifying many Hispanics as some other race while
   maintaining a similar number of Americans classified as Hispanic or
   Latino. Whether the Census Bureau adopts the one- or two-question format
   is yet to be decided as of this writing. However, neither format is
   sufficient for capturing racial distinctions among the fast-growing
   Latino population, thus precluding effective monitoring of racial
   disparities in the United States.},

Abstract = {Fritz Bauer (1903-1968) is a key actor in postwar (West) Germany's
   arduous transitional justice process. His remembrance is embroiled in
   controversies of late due to his multiple minority identities as
   depicted in a number of recent academic works and cultural
   representations about his life. This article examines Bauer's original
   writings and speeches to deduce a neglected aspect of his
   `intersectionality' - his conception of judicial reform based on his
   interpretation of biblical and theological sources. It proposes that
   `loveful judging,' or judging with love, as derived from his critique
   against the `loveless judging' during the Nazi era, is a fitting
   encapsulation of Bauer's thoughts on issues of punishment, resistance,
   reparation and resocialization. As such, the concept is useful both as
   an internal standard to evaluate Bauer's achievements, and as a unique
   contribution, based on the West German context, to the wider discussion
   on retributive and restorative justice.},

Abstract = {This article contributes to current debates on the potential and
   limitations of transnational environmental governance, addressing in
   particular the issue of how private and public regulation compete and/or
   reinforce each other - and with what results. One of the most
   influential approaches to emerge in recent years has been that of
   orchestration. But while recent discussions have focused on a narrow
   interpretation of orchestration as intermediation, we argue that there
   is analytical traction in studying orchestration as a combination of
   directive and facilitative tools. We also argue that a social network
   analytical perspective on orchestration can improve our understanding of
   how governments and international organizations can shape transnational
   environmental governance. Through a case study of aviation, we provide
   two contributions to these debates: first, we propose four analytical
   factors that facilitate the possible emergence of orchestration (issue
   visibility, interest alignment, issue scope, and regulatory
   fragmentation and uncertainty); and second, we argue that orchestrators
   are more likely to succeed when they employ two strategies: (i) they use
   a combination of directive and facilitative instruments, including the
   provision of feasible incentives for industry actors to change their
   behavior, backed up by regulation or a credible regulatory threat; and
   (ii) they are robustly embedded in, and involved in the formation of,
   the relevant transnational networks of actors and institutions that
   provide the infrastructure of governance. (c) 2017 JohnWiley \& Sons

Abstract = {Drawing on 18 months of ethnographic research in Senegal, this article
   focuses on the sociality of migrant facilitation. Although it has become
   relatively common in media and policy reports to suggest that irregular
   migrants are manipulated by greedy and unscrupulous human smugglers,
   this article shows how migrants in Senegal are often familiar with their
   handlers and are more likely to call them a friend (ami) than a
   criminal. Also, most migrants do not see themselves as smuggled, which
   implies victimhood. Rather, they see themselves as making calculated
   choices to migrate based on a host of social factors. By exploring the
   relationships between handlers and migrants, this article reveals the
   social worlds of negotiation, assistance, and protection that feature
   prominently in West African migrant narratives and practices.},

Abstract = {Debates on rising powers and a possible end to the liberal international
   order mostly focus on two kinds of actors: the hegemon (the United
   States), privileged by the power distribution of yesteryear, and rising
   powers (notably China). Europe's curious position brings to light some
   intriguing dynamics of the emerging world ordernuances needed to capture
   a more differentiated future. This essay traces the threats and
   opportunities to Europe presented by the emerging order in four domains.
   In terms of overall power (polarity) and economics, far-reaching change
   registers but is rarely designated as threatening. In contrast, change
   regarding values (human rights and democracy especially) triggers more
   alarm. Finally, in the domain of institutions, change elicited a
   relative lack of concern prior to 2016, but worries have grown since
   then. For Europe, peaceful change primarily demands that rising powers
   rearticulate rather than confront classical Western values because, in
   contrast to the United States, there is little sense of loss in Europe
   in relation to the global structures of power and economics.},

Abstract = {In this paper we seek to advance the debate on the conditions under
   which the WTO Dispute Settlement Body can bring about trade-liberalizing
   policy change in WTO members. Under what conditions do WTO members
   change domestic policies or measures that are challenged in WTO
   litigation? Starting from the assumption that policymakers are
   political-support maximizers who seek to avoid the mobilization of
   political enemies, we argue that the degree of integration in Global
   Value Chains (GVCs) of the economic sectors affected by a WTO dispute
   influences members' propensity to change domestic policies when targeted
   in WTO litigation. The initiation of a WTO dispute against sectors
   highly integrated in GVCs engenders the emergence of a domestic
   coalition of pro-trade liberalization groups composed of exporters
   seeking to avoid the imposition of retaliatory measures and
   import-dependent firms wishing to exploit the opportunity to access
   cheaper imports. Under these circumstances, trade-liberalizing responses
   to WTO legal challenges are therefore more likely. We test this
   hypothesis by estimating a Cox proportional hazard model and find that
   GVCs positively impact states' propensity to comply with the WTO dispute
   settlement panel rulings.},

Title = {Macroprudential regimes and the politics of social purpose},
Journal = {REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL ECONOMY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {25},
Number = {3},
Pages = {293-316},
Abstract = {Following the financial crash of 2008, many scholars have highlighted
   flaws and inadequacies in emerging macroprudential regulatory regimes. A
   missing ingredient in the political economy of post-crisis financial
   reform is the neglect of questions of social purpose in both policy
   debate and IPE scholarship. Social purpose is defined as a vision of the
   desirable or good economic system, derived from combinations of economic
   analysis and ethical reasoning. It is of particular relevance and
   importance to macroprudential regime building, because the foundational
   macroprudential conceptual frameworks developed by the Bank for
   International Settlements and the Geneva Group from 2000 onwards display
   the features of a macrosocial ontology that draw on a Minsky-Keynes
   tradition. By focusing on systemic outcomes and collective social
   expectations, such an ontology creates the basis for so-called
   macro-moralities that provide ethical justifications for public forms of
   systemic stabilisation. However, a variety of epistemological,
   professional, institutional and political barriers have impeded relevant
   expert groups and political actors' willingness and ability to actively
   translate macroprudential ontology into a systemic vision, or sense of
   social purpose that could be communicated to the public at large.},

Pages = {451-466},
Abstract = {There are concerns that gender quotas may raise the numbers of women
   elected to office without a commensurate increase in power. This article
   shows that gender quotas have not had such an effect in Taiwan by
   examining upward mobility. Women elected to local councils with the aid
   of gender quotas have not been less successful at moving up to higher
   offices with no gender quotas. Critically, Taiwan's quota system forces
   all candidates, including women, to face intense electoral competition
   and build up power resources. In short, Taiwan's quota system in local
   council elections fills the pipeline with women capable of challenging
   for higher office. Quotas thus play a critical role in promoting
   sustainable female representation in Taiwan.},

Title = {Clean Energy Trade Governance: Reconciling Trade Liberalism and Climate
   Interventionism?},
Journal = {NEW POLITICAL ECONOMY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {23},
Number = {6},
Pages = {728-747},
Abstract = {Scaling-up clean energy is vital to global efforts to address climate
   change. Promoting international trade in clean energy products (e.g.
   wind turbines, solar panels) can make an important contribution to this
   end through business and market expansion effects. If ratified, the
   landmark Paris COP21 Agreement will commit states to firmer climate
   actions, this necessarily requiring them to strengthen their promotion
   of clean energy technologies. Well over a hundred countries already have
   active policies in this area, many including industrial policy measures
   that impact on the international competitiveness of their clean energy
   sector. At the same time, governments have gradually liberalised their
   clean energy trade regimes, and large producers are negotiating an
   Environmental Goods Agreement (EGA). Clean energy trade is expanding and
   disputes among nations in this sector are growing. The World Trade
   Organisation (WTO) still has limited policy space' for climate action.
   Meanwhile, the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change
   (UNFCCC) still had narrow and infrequent connections with trade matters.
   Moreover, WTO-UNFCCC engagement on trade-climate issues overall has been
   largely confined to information sharing and secretariat-level dialogue.
   This paper explores the extent to which clean energy trade is currently
   governed, where certain governance gaps and deficiencies exists, and
   argues why addressing them could help expand trade in clean energy
   products. It also contends that the most fundamental challenge for the
   future governance of clean energy trade concerns how to reconcile
   ramped-up interventionist climate action with an essentially liberal
   trade order.},

   legislation, the Law on Foreigners and International Protection (LFIP),
   and the concurrent formation of the Directorate General for Migration
   Management (DGMM), a body created to ensure the law's effective
   implementation. Our focus here is on the role of intergovernmental
   organisations (IGOs) in shaping legislation and the formation of a
   civilian, transnational community of bordercrats. The existence of this
   legislation supported the labelling of Turkey as a `safe country' in a
   joint Turkey-EU declaration reached in March 2016. It is ironic that in
   2016 Turkey was designated a `safe country' for refugees in a context in
   which Turkey can be said to have become increasingly unsafe for refugees
   and its citizens alike.},

Abstract = {One might summarize the state of the field of research into contemporary
   Russian politics as a dismal consensus: most observers believe that
   durable authoritarianism has consolidated itself, and there is very
   little chance of democratization in the foreseeable future. However,
   political regime changes are often launched and developed overtime as
   side effects of moves made by political actors, and their outcomes are
   not predetermined. This article aims to go beyond this dismal consensus,
   and revisits some of the arguments on the role of structure and agency
   in post-Soviet regime dynamics. Apart from the changes in structural
   variables, it reconsiders the role of the incentives and choices of
   self-interested political actors, who are not always omnipotent and
   well-informed strategists. The overall dismal tendencies nevertheless
   leave some bias for hope in the analysis of regime dynamics in
   post-Soviet Eurasia and beyond.},

Abstract = {This article argues that opposition to expansion of women's roles in the
   US military and peer armed forces, particularly into combat-related
   military occupational specialties, is based on defending a means of
   proving masculinity and preserving access to power. Research is based on
   policies of US, UK, and other NATO countries, public statements made by
   officials, academic articles, and interviews with current and former
   members of the US military. The article examines shifting definitions of
   combat, historical examples of American women's military service, and
   common and persistent themes of resistance to women in combat roles. The
   article argues that resistance to women in combat roles is not only
   inconsistent with operational realities, but is both counterproductive
   to mission effectiveness, and may even put lives at risk. The article
   concludes that in an ever-shifting security environment requiring
   critical thinking, cross-cultural communication, and civil-military
   collaboration, rethinking gender roles may be advantageous.},

Abstract = {Analysis of Competing Hypotheses (ACH) promises a relatively objective
   and tractable methodology for ranking the plausibility of competing
   hypotheses. Unlike Bayesianism, it is computationally modest. Unlike
   explanationism, it appeals to minimally subjective judgments about
   relations between hypotheses and evidence. Yet the canonical procedures
   for ACH allow a certain kind of instability in applications of the
   methodology, by virtue of supporting competing rankings despite common
   evidential bases and diagnosticity assessments. This instability should
   motivate advocates of ACH to focus their efforts toward creating
   structured methods for individuating items of evidence.},

Title = {Context-driven attitude formation: the difference between supporting
   free trade in the abstract and supporting specific trade agreements},
Journal = {REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL ECONOMY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {25},

Pages = {215-242},
Abstract = {Many studies use the same factors to explain attitudes toward specific
   trade agreements and attitudes toward the principle of free trade and
   thus treat both objects as interchangeable. Contemporary trade
   agreements, however, often reach beyond trade in the narrow sense.
   Consequently, factors unrelated to free trade may affect citizens'
   evaluations of these agreements. We propose a model of attitude
   formation toward specific trade agreements that includes the societal
   context as a constitutive feature. We expect salient aspects of an
   agreement to activate corresponding predispositions. Empirically, we
   compare how this contextual model and a standard model perform in
   explaining German citizens' attitudes toward free trade and the
   Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP). The results show
   that the standard model performs well in explaining public opinion on
   the principle of free trade but is less useful in explaining attitudes
   toward TTIP. The latter were driven by postures toward transatlantic
   cooperation, predispositions toward the role of interest groups in
   politics, and market regulation-aspects salient in German public
   discourse about TTIP. In sum, we find ample evidence for the need to
   differentiate between the two attitude objects and for our contextual
   model of attitude formation.},

Abstract = {This essay examines socio-economic processes during the Soviet period to
   help explain the causes of peace and conflict in the post-Soviet North
   Caucasus. It argues that the absence of an ethnically stratified social
   structure in Kabardino-Balkaria is one of the reasons why this republic
   enjoyed relative intercommunal peace and stability in the 1990s and
   early 2000s. By contrast, the surrounding national republics of the
   North Caucasus that came out of the Soviet era with socio-economic
   disparities along ethnic lines witnessed higher levels of intercommunal
   conflict. This essay looks to the understudied topic of post-World War
   II and late Soviet nationalities policies to explain
   Kabardino-Balkaria's divergent historical trajectory.},

Abstract = {The article examines the coping mechanisms of state widows belonging to
   Israel's Religious-Zionist sector, whose husbands died at an early age
   either during military service or in terrorist attacks. While the
   national bereaved community's collective unconscious expects the widows
   to dedicate their lives to institutionalized commemoration of their dead
   husband, Jewish tradition expects them to remarry to rehabilitate their
   family and children. The widows who were studied seemed to manage the
   competing expectations successfully: they remarried and maintained a
   happy family life while entrusting commemoration to the bereaved
   parents, who are still part of their extended family. The findings point
   to successful manipulation of the patriarchy of both communities to
   which they belong, achieving individualization that offers freedom in
   the private spherewhat we call Backstage Autonomywhile perpetuating
   hegemony on the public level on the Front Stage.},

Title = {Welfare Capitalism in Post-Industrial Times: Trilemma or Power Over
   Rents?},
Journal = {NEW POLITICAL ECONOMY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {23},
Number = {6},
Pages = {748-767},
Abstract = {The structure of post-industrial' economies is widely held to be
   problematic for welfare capitalism, because of inherent limits to
   productivity growth in services compared to manufacturing. The so-called
   post-industrial trilemma is suggested to allow only two of relative
   earnings equality, high levels of employment and fiscal balance, and has
   resulted in the widespread policy belief that greater earnings
   inequality and welfare state retrenchment are unavoidable. This article
   challenges the micro foundations of this understanding, that the
   production of economic value is technologically determined by the
   physical properties inherent in goods and services. In contrast, we
   argue theoretically, and demonstrate empirically, that production,
   allocation and distribution are contingent processes better conceived in
   terms of power over rents' with associated externalities between
   sectors. Our analysis suggests that the post-industrial trilemma thesis
   may have unduly distracted research from the potential for
   redistributive politics to achieve sustainable levels of productivity
   growth, fiscal balance and higher levels of earnings equality.},

Abstract = {This article argues that the evidence-based-policy movement needs to
   supplement its current emphasis on program evaluations with an approach
   that uses data at a much higher frequency to improve the administration
   and impact of government-funded social service programs. Doing so offers
   the best chance of making significant progress in ameliorating
   challenging social problems. I describe how an idealized government
   social service agency could use data and data analysis to improve its
   results, review the barriers that prevent agencies from operating in
   this way, and outline how targeted resources and technical assistance
   can help to overcome these barriers. Finally, I discuss strategies for
   moving beyond the effective administration of siloed service programs to
   the improvement of population-wide outcomes, especially among
   individuals and families who need multiple services.},

Title = {Celtic Phoenix or Leprechaun Economics? The Politics of an FDI-led

Journal = {NEW POLITICAL ECONOMY},

Volume = {23},

Pages = {223-238},
Abstract = {In this paper, we argue that Ireland's post-crisis economic recovery in
   Europe was driven by foreign direct investment (FDI) from Silicon
   Valley, and while this growth model was made possible by Ireland's
   low-corporate tax rates, it was also a result of these firms using
   Ireland to directly access the European labour market. We evidence this
   contention via sectoral and geographic analyses while simultaneously
   showing that Irish fiscal policies have not redistributed gains from the
   recovery to the broader population. As a result, the economic recovery
   has been most actively felt by those in the FDI sectors, including
   workers from the EU and beyond. Building on theories from the study of
   comparative capitalism, we suggest that this experience indicates that
   Ireland's FDI-led growth model has created clear winners and losers,
   with significant distributional implications. The FDI growth regime been
   made possible by inward migration and European integration, but given
   the unequal distribution of the economic benefits that this generates,
   it is unlikely to be politically, or electorally, sustainable.},

Title = {The Revival of Private Landlords in Britain's Post-Homeownership Society},
Journal = {NEW POLITICAL ECONOMY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {23},
Number = {6},
Pages = {786-803},
Abstract = {Homeownership has been declining in favour of private renting in most
   developed English speaking countries since the early-2000s. Public
   debates in countries like Britain, Australia and the US have
   subsequently focused on the ostensible coming of age of generation
   rent', constituted of younger individuals excluded from home buying and
   traditional routes to housing asset accumulation. While the focus of
   this paper is the significance of access to housing assets as a means to
   offset potential economic and welfare precarity, our concern is
   landlords rather than tenants. Drawing on British survey data, we show
   that the rental boom has been accompanied by increasing multiple
   property ownership among classes of largely middle-aged and relatively
   affluent households. Over one-million small-time landlords have emerged
   in the last decade alone, who, we argue, are part product of historic
   developments in housing markets and welfare states. Generations of
   British have not only been orientated towards their homes as commodity
   assets, they have also begun to mobilise around multi-property
   accumulation in a context of shifting welfare and pension expectations.},

Volume = {23},

Pages = {544-559},
Abstract = {Crusoe' and Friday' signifiers necessarily evoke a world of racialised
   hierarchies. Economics textbooks are perhaps the sole remaining medium
   to simply wish away their resulting relations of power. These are the
   teaching aids that inspire students analytically to think of markets as
   pristine economic institutions and persuade them politically that they
   should want to will such institutions into being. Yet they all-too-often
   rely on the pedagogical device of the so-called Robinson Crusoe Economy,
   where the main characters from Defoe's most famous novel are required to
   instinctively recognise their equality within voluntary contracting
   agreements so that each can act as the neoclassical homo economicus. In
   other words, economists' Crusoe and Friday figures must behave
   antithetically to what has historically been implied by the Crusoe' and
   Friday' signifiers. But how can this be so, given how commonplace it was
   when Defoe's characters were first introduced into economic theory in
   the 1850s to justify white settler colonialism on the grounds that
   savage' societies lacked the capacity to be self-governing? The raced
   market frame that emerged in practice from this assumption continues to
   be reproduced uncritically today by Crusoe's and Friday's presence in
   the textbook explanation of the most basic model of market exchange.},

Abstract = {Where does British open source intelligence (OSINT) fit into the
   intelligence debate surrounding Allied knowledge of the Holocaust? In
   particular what can this source of intelligence tell us in regards to
   the opening of the extermination phase of the Holocaust in the Soviet
   Union? Were the Allies conclusions being falsely influenced by their own
   OSINT analysts? Or conversely did OSINT provide further evidence
   (alongside SIGINT decodes) that the Nazis were now committing mass
   genocide. This article explores these questions by examining the
   FRPS/FORD OSINT reports from the civilian ruled territories of (and
   those intended for) the Reichskommissariate Ostland and Ukraine.},

Abstract = {Multi-level networks of regulatory authorities are considered as vectors
   of knowledge circulation, norm diffusion, and regulatory coordination.
   However, this is often assumed without empirical scrutiny of the
   concrete ``micro-dynamics{''} between individual participants in
   networks, which remain a ``black box{''} for analysts. This paper is
   mainly based on direct observation and informal interviews conducted
   during a meeting of the European Platform of Regulatory Authorities in
   charge of regulation of the broadcasting sector. It seeks to elucidate
   what deliberation, socialization, and learning, considered as devices
   typical of ``soft{''} governance modes, mean as concrete social
   practices within a network.},

Abstract = {When rape by an armed organization occurs frequently, it is often said
   to be a strategy of war. But some cases of conflict-related rape are
   better understood as a practice, violence that has not been explicitly
   adopted as organization policy but is nonetheless tolerated by
   commanders. The typology of conflict-related rape in this article
   emphasizes not only vertical relationships between commanders
   (principals) and combatants (agents) but also the horizontal social
   interactions among combatants. It analyzes when rape is likely to be
   prevalent as a practice, emphasizing not only gendered norms and beliefs
   of the society from which combatants come but also how those might be
   transformed by the organization's socialization processes. In the
   conclusion, I suggest that the typology is relevant for analysts of all
   forms of of political violence and also for prosecutors, policy
   advocates, and policymakers concerned with conflict-related rape.},

Abstract = {Russian foreign policy thinkers have used a succession of geopolitical
   imaginaries to articulate a Russian role and identity in the post-Cold
   War era. This essay analyses one such spatial project, the idea of
   `Greater Eurasia', which imagines a new geopolitical geometry centred on
   Sino-Russian cooperation. The `Greater Eurasia' discourse provides a new
   role for Russia in international affairs but also makes far-reaching
   claims about the nature of the emerging, post-liberal world order. The
   essay concludes with an analysis of the main challenges to the `Greater
   Eurasia' project.},

   how bureaucratic agents often operate with slack that allows them to
   pursue their preferences in the shadow of institutional mandates. We
   study the division of costs in World Bank projects between the Bank and
   its borrowers. If this is a realm in which World Bank bureaucrats exert
   agency, we expect to see counterpart financing vary with poverty and
   governance, in line with theories about aid selectivity. If, on the
   other hand, this is a realm in which the Bank's state principals exert
   influence, we expect strategic interest measures to predict the division
   of financing. If counterpart commitments represent the outcome of
   Bank-borrower bargaining, we expect borrowers with outside options to
   contribute less. A 2004 rule revision at the Bank provides an
   opportunity to study how financing patterns changed when bureaucratic
   agents obtained more discretion. We show that increased flexibility
   within the Bank led to a deployment of resources that favored poorer
   countries, in line with the organizational mission of the Bank. We find
   less evidence of governance selectivity, and we find mixed results with
   regard to how a country's strategic importance or bargaining power
   influenced levels of counterpart funding.},

Abstract = {This article reviews how the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID) has
   contributed to our understanding of the links between childhood economic
   conditions-in particular, the household incomes with very young
   children-and the economic attainment and health of those children when
   they reach adulthood. From its beginning, the PSID has provided data
   useful for addressing intergenerational questions. In the mid-1990s,
   PSID data supported a series of studies that link early childhood income
   to early adult attainments, particularly to completed schooling. At the
   same time, discoveries in neurobiology and epidemiology were beginning
   to provide details on the processes producing the observed correlations.
   These discoveries led to a more recent set of PSID-based studies that
   focus not only on labor market and behavioral outcomes, but also on
   links between income in the earliest stages of life (including the
   prenatal period) and adult health. Links between economic disadvantage
   in childhood and adult health, and the developmental neuroscience
   underlying those links, are promising areas for future research.},

Abstract = {Crime tends to be concentrated at a relatively small proportion of
   proprietary placessmall parcels of land that often have a single address
   and are used for a specific purpose, like housing or entertainment. This
   fact points to the potential of regulation to reduce crime. Drawing on
   research and theory, this article discusses why we should be concerned
   about crime places, how the management of places influences crimes, why
   and how place management regulation might be helpful for reducing
   crimes, criteria for selecting place-based regulatory instruments, why
   it might be necessary to adjust such regulation to neighborhood
   characteristics, and principles for applying a regulatory approach to
   crime places.},

Abstract = {It is widely alleged that President Putin's regime attempted to exercise
   influence on the 2016 U.S. presidential election. It is known that its
   Soviet predecessors funded Western communist parties for decades as a
   means to undermine noncommunist regimes. Similarly, the United States
   has a long history of interfering in the institutions and elections of
   its Latin American neighbors, as well as (at the height of the Cold War)
   its European allies. More recently, many believe that, absent
   U.S.-driven assistance, the Democratic Opposition of Serbia would have
   lost the 2000 Yugoslavian presidential election to Slobodan Miloevi. As
   those examples suggest, attempting to subvert the democratic elections
   of a putatively sovereign country is a time-honored way of bending the
   latter's domestic and foreign policy to one's will. In this paper, I
   focus on the state-sponsored, nonviolent, nonkinetic subversion of
   nationwide elections (for short, subversion) through campaign and party
   financing, tampering with electoral registers, and conducting
   disinformation campaigns about candidates. I argue that, under certain
   conditions and subject to certain constraints, subversion is pro tanto
   justified as a means to prevent or end large-scale human rights
   violations.},

Abstract = {Why do tax havens, whose attractiveness for foreign investors depends
   upon financial secrecy, agree to automatically report account data to
   foreign governments? From a contractualist perspective, their
   cooperation should be motivated by the expectation of joint gains. Prior
   to such agreement, however, tax havens expected outflows of foreign
   capital and reductions in economic activity as likely outcomes. We show
   that the United States (US) imposed automatic information exchange on
   these countries without itself participating. The result is a strongly
   redistributive regime that worsens the economic situation of tax havens.
   By means of a difference-in-differences analysis, we ascertain a
   substantial and statistically significant negative effect of a US
   sanction threat on the value of assets held by foreigners in tax havens
   relative to non-havens. The effect becomes stronger when the US is
   included in the non-haven group. The analysis confirms the US's ability
   to redistribute financial wealth internationally through organized
   hypocrisy.},

Abstract = {In May 1948, as the Cold War escalated and the Communist insurgency in
   Greece intensified, the assassination of CBS News journalist George Polk
   in Salonica became an international cause celebre. Polk had openly
   criticized the Greek government and questioned the U.S. government's
   support of an undemocratic regime. Most probably, he was killed trying
   to reach an insurgent command post to interview guerrilla leaders about
   the civil war. With no claims of responsibility for the murder and no
   credible forensic evidence, suspicions of culpability fell on many
   actors, including the Communists, extreme rightwing elements, common
   criminals, and rogue British intelligence operatives. Although
   responsibility for identifying and bringing to justice the guilty fell
   squarely on the Greek authorities, the country's heavy dependence on
   U.S. assistance enabled U.S. officials and journalists to influence the
   case. Eager to blame the crime on the Communists and produce quick
   results, Greek police and justice officials fabricated a case against
   two known Communists (never apprehended) and a small-time reporter,
   Gregory Staktopoulos, whose incoherent confessions were clearly coerced.
   Staktopoulos's trial, conviction, long imprisonment, and failed appeals
   to the country's highest court left an indelible stigma on Greek
   justice. Polk's murder-which has never been solved-and Staktopoulos's
   cruel fate illustrate the powerfully corrosive impact of Cold War
   perceptions and priorities on the institutions of Western democracies.},

Abstract = {Illegal, unreported, and unregulated (IUU) fishing is a serious global
   environmental crime. It can lead to the collapse of important fisheries
   and the destruction of marine habitats, and it also directly threatens
   the food security and economies of developing countries, affecting
   millions of people who depend on fisheries for survival. IUU fishing
   also undermines the sustainability of seafood stocks of many developed
   countries and directly impacts these countries' legal commercial fishing
   industries. Several regulatory mechanisms have been put in place at
   international, regional, and country levels to address the problem, but
   the implementation of these regulations remains a challenge. This
   article examines the problem of IUU fishing and seafood fraud through
   the application of the crime script analysis technique to (1) describe
   IUU fishing and seafood fraud, (2) highlight the regulations designed to
   address IUU fishing and seafood fraud, and (3) offer recommendations
   that link piecemeal and grand crime prevention policy responses to
   strategies that could be used by practitioners to address these problems
   more effectively.},

Abstract = {The main elements of U.S. immigration policy date back to the early Cold
   War. One such element is a screening process initially designed to
   prevent infiltration by Communist agents posing as migrants from
   East-Central Europe. The development of these measures was driven by
   geopolitical concerns, resulting in vetting criteria that favored the
   admission of hardline nationalists and anti-Communists. The argument
   proceeds in two steps. First, the article demonstrates that geopolitics
   influenced immigration policy, resulting in the admission of extremist
   individuals. Second, it documents how geopolitical concerns and the
   openness of U.S. institutions provided exiles with the opportunity to
   mobilize politically. Although there is little evidence that the vetting
   system succeeded in preventing the entry of Communist subversives into
   the United States, it did help to create a highly mobilized
   anti-Communist ethnic lobby that supported extremist policies vis-a-vis
   the Soviet Union during the early Cold War.},

Abstract = {This article provides a brief history of evidence-based policy, which it
   defines as encompassing (1) the application of rigorous research
   methods, particularly randomized controlled trials (RCTs), to build
   credible evidence about what works to improve the human condition; and
   (2) the use of such evidence to focus public and private resources on
   effective interventions. Evidence-based policy emerged first in medicine
   after World War II, and has made tremendous contributions to human
   health. In social policy, a few RCTs were conducted before 1980, but the
   number grew rapidly in U.S. welfare and employment programs during the
   1980s and 1990s and had an important impact on government policy. Since
   2000, evidence-based policy has seen a major expansion in other social
   policy areas, including education and international development
   assistance. A recent milestone is the U.S. enactment of tiered evidence
   social programs in which rigorous evidence is the defining principle in
   awarding government funding for interventions.},

Abstract = {Acknowledging and addressing victims' experiences is a central objective
   of transitional justice (TJ) processes, but the disparate narratives of
   victimhood inherent in conflict complicate this task. In Northern
   Ireland, contention over who can be recognized and prioritized as a
   victim is exemplified in the so-called `hierarchy of victims.' In an
   effort to advance a more critical commentary on victimhood in TJ, this
   article offers a nuanced analysis of hierarchy by developing an original
   framework that illuminates the distinct meanings and functions of
   hierarchy in transitional contexts. Four distinct yet overlapping
   `types' of hierarchy are identified through empirical analysis: moral
   hierarchies, hierarchies of attention, pragmatic hierarchies and
   intergroup hierarchies. The pragmatic hierarchy emerges as the most
   appropriate for shaping TJ policy. Most problematic is the intergroup
   hierarchy, which intersects with other hierarchies to reinforce
   conflicting narratives of legitimate violence, victimhood and
   responsibility.},

Abstract = {How might teachers challenge oversimplified narratives regarding the
   life and deeds of Martin Luther King Jr. (MLK), in order to support
   ideals of human rights in education? In this study, we examine ongoing
   history education where teachers try to promote a more radical human
   rights perspective on the history and legacy of MLK by contrasting
   contemporary uses of history with primary sources from the era of the
   civil rights movement. Teachers ask students to engage in tandem with
   what we call the `historical' and `practical' past and we find that this
   may be constructive, but also challenging, in human rights education. We
   observe that students are able to deconstruct textbook narratives but
   find it difficult to challenge authorities and media that oversimplify
   popular perceptions of the past. Yet many students did learn a more
   active perspective on the life and deeds of MLK, evident even a year
   after the initial teaching took place, clearly influenced by the
   authentic historical writings of MLK. This study highlights important
   potentials and limitations in the attempts to teach students about,
   through and for human rights by making the past both historical and
   practical. This study also illustrates ways that promoting alternative
   historical perspectives can help students interrogate the past alongside
   their own present.},

Abstract = {On the basis of information collected from all the published European
   Commission's decisions in cartel cases between 1962 and 2014, this paper
   identifies different stages in the supra-nationalization of cartel
   policy at the European Union (EU) level. It analyzes major competition
   policy reforms, strategies and initiatives taken by the European
   Commission (EC), and its relationship and interaction with Member
   States' resistance and other policy players' positions, which offers a
   new in-depth study on the history and political economy of a key pillar
   of EU integration. It also provides a forensic analysis of the
   sanctioned cartels at each stage. This study shows that the introduction
   of the leniency programme was a critical juncture that allowed cartel
   authorities to identify cartels more effectively and to provide evidence
   for sanctioning collusion much more easily than before. This success was
   a key determinant for deepening the EU integration in competition
   policy. The intended drivers and the paradoxically unexpected shifters
   of such growing integration in cartel policy enforcement at the EU are
   discussed.},

Abstract = {Hidden within the office of the Secretary of War during World War II was
   a little-known agency called the Advisory Specialist Group (ASG).
   Strategically located between the laboratory, the factory, the
   battlefield, and civilian bureaucracy, the ASG solved the complex
   problem of reconciling new technologies and new military operations. In
   doing so, it combined incongruous domains of activity, contributed to
   Allied victory, and opened a channel to the problem-solving state. It is
   easy to overlook or misunderstand the ASG, because it was born in
   processes, addressed problems, and took a form unfamiliar to historical
   institutionalists. Drawing on Padgett and Powell's networked theory of
   organizational genesis and pragmatist theories of experimentalist
   governance, this article explains the ASG's emergence, networked form,
   and experimentalist procedures. A founding moment for the
   problem-solving state, this case provides empirical and theoretical
   guidance to study its historical and ongoing evolution.},

Journal = {ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF POLITICAL AND SOCIAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {677},
Number = {1},

Abstract = {For multiracial, Hispanic, and Native Americans, norms for racial and
   ethnic self-identification are less well established than they are for
   other population groups. There is considerable variation and fluidity in
   how multiracial, Hispanic, and Native Americans self-identify, as well
   as how they are classified by others. This presents challenges to
   researchers and analysts in terms of consistently and accurately
   estimating the size and population dynamics of these groups. I argue
   that for analytic purposes, racial/ethnic self-identification should
   continue to be treated as a statistical numerator, but that the
   challenge is for researchers to establish the correct denominatorthe
   population that could identify as members of the group based on their
   ancestry. Examining how many people who could identify with these groups
   choose to do so sheds light on assimilation and emerging racial
   classification processes. Analyses of the larger potential populations
   further avoid bias stemming from nonrandom patterns of
   self-identification with the groups.},

Title = {What Makes a Good Human Smuggler? The Differences between Satisfaction
   with and Recommendation of Coyotes on the US-Mexico Border},

Abstract = {This article draws on a unique dataset of more than eleven hundred
   postdeportation surveys to examine migrants' experiences with coyotes
   (human smugglers) along the U.S.-Mexico border. Our focus is on
   migrants' satisfaction with the services provided by their most recent
   smuggler and whether they would be willing to put family or friends in
   contact with that person. We find a distinct difference between people's
   expectations for their own migratory experience compared to what they
   would be willing to subject loved ones to. Expectations of comfort and
   safety are decidedly low for oneself; but for loved ones, a more
   expressive, qualitative assessment shapes their willingness to recommend
   a coyote: qualities such as trustworthiness, honesty, comportment, and
   treatment come to the fore. News coverage focusing on the deaths of
   smuggled migrants often portrays coyotes as nefarious and exploitative,
   but the migrant-smuggler relationship is much more complex than
   suggested by these media accounts. We provide empirical insight into the
   factors associated with successful, satisfactory, and safe relationships
   between migrants and their guides.},

Title = {Restructuring structured analytic techniques in intelligence},
Journal = {INTELLIGENCE AND NATIONAL SECURITY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {33},
Number = {3},
Pages = {337-356},
Abstract = {Structured analytic techniques (SATs) are intended to improve
   intelligence analysis by checking the two canonical sources of error:
   systematic biases and random noise. Although both goals are achievable,
   no one knows how close the current generation of SATs comes to achieving
   either of them. We identify two root problems: (1) SATs treat bipolar
   biases as unipolar. As a result, we lack metrics for gauging possible
   over-shooting-and have no way of knowing when SATs that focus on
   suppressing one bias (e.g., overconfidence) are triggering the opposing
   bias (e.g., under-confidence); (2) SATs tacitly assume that problem
   decomposition (e.g., breaking reasoning into rows and columns of
   matrices corresponding to hypotheses and evidence) is a sound means of
   reducing noise in assessments. But no one has ever actually tested
   whether decomposition is adding or subtracting noise from the analytic
   process- and there are good reasons for suspecting that decomposition
   will, on balance, degrade the reliability of analytic judgment. The
   central shortcoming is that SATs have not been subject to sustained
   scientific of the sort that could reveal when they are helping or
   harming the cause of delivering accurate assessments of the world to the
   policy community.},

   1970 ('The Gyde')},
Journal = {INTELLIGENCE AND NATIONAL SECURITY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {33},
Number = {5},
Pages = {775-780},
Abstract = {The literature on intelligence analysis contains many references to the
   `review process', the mechanism by which analysts' drafts are converted
   into corporate products. Analysts whose drafts consistently navigate the
   process quickly and smoothly are regarded as star performers. Divining
   the practical meaning of organizational definitions of `good' analysis
   and the personal preferences of specific senior reviewers is not easy,
   however. Analysts occasionally commit their understanding of reviewers'
   stylistic preferences to paper, effectively providing style guides to
   help others. This essay presents and explains the development and
   implications of one such guide, which was designed to help analysts in
   CIA's Office of Strategic Research in the early 1970s.},

Journal = {EUROPE-ASIA STUDIES},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {70},
Number = {8},
Pages = {1185-1212},
Abstract = {This article looks at Russia's exercise of power politics in Ukraine and
   Syria as a way of improving its international status. Russia's recent
   willingness to use power and coercion is theoretically counterintuitive
   as it appears to be in dissonance with the prevalent characterisation of
   the country as a status-overachieving inconsistent power. We argue that
   this behaviour is not the result of a consistent weighing of status
   against capabilities, but rather reflective of both internal and
   external dynamics. We analyse issues of identity, opportunity and costs
   as factors that influence Russian foreign action, showing that power
   politics will not solve Russia's status-inconsistency problem in the
   long run.},

Journal = {INTELLIGENCE AND NATIONAL SECURITY},

Pages = {541-552},
Abstract = {Theorists have invoked comparative intelligence studies as an arena for
   testing a `grand theory of intelligence.' Current grand theories of
   intelligence fall down against comparative analysis. Based on insights
   from comparative intelligence studies, this paper proposes to 1)
   identify key problems that have plagued the search for a theory of
   intelligence 2) reassess the role of comparative intelligence in testing
   or constructing a theory of intelligence and 3) offer observations to
   guide intelligence theorists in an era of transition. Ultimately, this
   paper seeks to join the comparatist and the theorist in their mutual
   (albeit often competing) aspiration to understand intelligence.},

Pages = {91-95},
Abstract = {The final chapter proposes that abandoning methodological nationalism
   means that an ethics of immigration is untenable. Rather, what is needed
   is an ethics of migration or an ethics of mobility that sees movement
   across state borders, movement within states, and movement to and from
   cities as raising the same normative issues. In particular, an
   investigation of the causes of mobility shows that it is often a
   response to social, economic, and political forces that expel vulnerable
   people from their homes. The chapter ends with a plea that people
   recognize the complex ways in which people are connected within and
   across borders and the dangers of uncritically using words that
   encourage seeing the world in terms of ``us{''} and ``them.{''}},

Abstract = {It is often argued that the politics of Central Eastern European
   countries revolve around political leaders. This can inhibit the
   development of fragile political institutions and the process of
   democratisation in general. This article examines patterns of media
   representation of political actors in the transition from a communist to
   a post-communist setting in the case of Yugoslavia and Croatia. The
   results show that, although there are significant similarities between
   the prominence of leaders in the communist and early post-communist
   eras, in the process of democratisation media attention has shifted
   significantly from leaders to parties as collectives.},

   highlighting the importance of big neighbours for small open economies.
   The study covers 1995-2015. The study shows that changes in the GDP
   growth of trading partners can have a greater effect on domestic private
   investment in small open economies than GDP changes in their own
   economies. The ongoing business cycle synchronisation between Russia and
   the Baltic countries means that the impact of Russia as a big neighbour
   remains an important issue for the latter.},

Abstract = {The state of commission has a duty to ensure accountability for the
   perpetration of horrendous crimes, such as, genocide and crimes against
   humanity. Following the fall of the military junta in 1991, the
   Ethiopian government attempted to dispense justice for the egregious
   crimes that were committed during the reign of the predecessor regime.
   In fact, the new government embarked on extensive investigation and
   prosecution of Derg crimes. This chapter focuses on the prosecution of
   Derg officials, particularly those who were in leadership positions, for
   the crime of politicide and other ordinary crimes. It shows that by and
   large the conviction of Derg officials for the crime of politicide has a
   legal foundation under the Penal Code of Ethiopia; hence it is not only
   justifiable but also fitting, given that crimes against humanity were
   and still are not criminalized as such.},

Abstract = {Why do some people believe that NGOs have a bad influence on their
   country? Building on the world polity literature, I hypothesize that
   opinions about Western actors affect opinions about the influence of
   NGOs because NGOs can act as vehicles for the diffusion of Western
   culture. Using Pew Research survey data, I find that the more
   unfavorable respondents' opinions are of the United States, the European
   Union, and the United Nations, the more likely they are to believe that
   NGOs have a bad influence on their country. While previous research
   finds evidence that a mechanism of ``guilt by association{''} exists
   between opinions about states and opinions about IGOs (Johnson, The
   Review of International Organizations, 6, 57-84, 2011), this manuscript
   expands on these findings by investigating the relationship between
   opinions about states and opinions about NGOs. This research has
   important implications for NGO effectiveness because opinions about NGOs
   can affect the willingness of local populations to work with such
   organizations.},

Abstract = {This article addresses the important question of how ``upper{''}-caste
   power is reproduced in contemporary India, in the face of organized
   challenges from below. It argues that this process turns on the
   reproduction of castelessness. A long-standing site for the cultivation
   of castelessness has been the postcolonial census, which has limited the
   enumeration of caste to certain nonelites for the purposes of
   affirmative action reservations. However, in the aftermath of an
   intensive campaign to include a full castewise enumeration in Census
   2011, the political leadership of the Indian National Congress Party
   conceded and reversed seventy years of census policy on caste. This
   article examines the institutional pushback within the executive
   bureaucracy in the year following the public concession to change census
   policy on caste. In doing so, it shows how bureaucratic actions and
   inactions reproduce both castelessness and upper-caste power in
   contemporary India.},

Abstract = {This article investigates EU-China dialogue on regional policy, a
   puzzling exercise in policy transfer because such policy is by its
   nature inward-oriented and the intricacies of regional development imply
   uncertainty about its effects in different contexts. The article sheds
   light on the reasons of both sides for engaging in this unlikely policy
   learning effort and identifies its actors and mechanisms. It also
   critically assesses this process, stressing its one-way nature and the
   active role of the EU as a `policy-sender', in contrast to most policy
   transfer literature citing demands by the policy-recipient as the
   predominant reason to engage in such cooperation.},

Title = {An Idea Whose Time Has Come? Modern Slavery, Multiple Streams Approach
   and Multilayer Policy Implementation},

Pages = {461-481},

Abstract = {This article uses Kingdon's multiple streams approach to analyse the
   implementation gap between anti-slavery legislation and front-line
   practice, with particular reference to emerging challenges in the
   implementation of the UK's 2015 Modern Slavery Act. The multiple streams
   approach suggests that policy change and implementation depends on an
   active coupling of problems, politics and policy, often by proactive `
   policy entrepreneurs' drawing upon supportive policy communities. While
   this conjunction can be observed in the framing of the UK's anti-slavery
   policy at a national level, document review and survey evidence suggests
   a failure to consistently replicate the same elements at a local level.
   It is suggested that this has resulted in differentiated engagement with
   anti-slavery policy from crucial local partner organizations, including
   UK local authorities and the voluntary sector. While in some cases local
   ` focusing' events, politics and policy entrepreneurs have helped to
   galvanize partnership action, in many localities there is a lack of
   coordination, resource and impetus. The article makes recommendations to
   strengthen local implementation, including attention to reframing the `
   problem' of modern slavery, to ensure that it has resonance for local
   stakeholders, including local political leaders. It is also important
   for government to recognize competing demands on service providers, and
   address contradictions that lead to tensions at the front line,
   particularly between victim care and immigration enforcement. Future
   policies could also more proactively support local policy networks and
   communities engaged in anti-slavery activity, embracing different
   conceptions of the policy challenge beyond a criminal justice
   perspective. These findings have relevance not only for the UK but also
   for other nations considering how to embed anti-slavery policy into
   local practice.},

Abstract = {The dominant narrative of the 1994 genocide in Rwanda is one that labels
   Hutu as the `other.' This stigma has had an impact both on the space for
   dialogue and on the process of meaning making for diaspora communities.
   This article draws on an in-depth study of Hutu diaspora communities in
   Belgium that involved 46 individual interviews and a survey of 149
   respondents. The study explored the impact of the Rwandan government's
   one-sided, dominant narrative of the genocide on efforts to deal with
   this legacy by different generations. This insight into marginalized
   voices is critical in framing opportunities for more inclusive processes
   of reconstructing memory and identity.},

Abstract = {After twenty-five years, few scholars still dispute the leading role of
   Liberal Intergovernmentalism (LI) in theorizing EU history. Yet some
   question whether it can explain Europe's recent evolution. This article
   argues that LI retains its place as a `baseline' integration theory. It
   is uniquely able to provide credible micro-foundations of EU
   decision-making, which even theories ostensibly critical of LI borrow.
   It offers a richer set of innovative opportunities for forward-looking
   extension than is often thought. Compared to competitors such as
   Post-Functionalism and Historical Institutionalism, LI generates more
   consistently satisfying empirical accounts of recent EU policy-making,
   particularly with regard to the outcomes that ultimately matter most,
   namely substantive policies. And it remains a trustworthy guide to
   normative evaluation, for example on the issue of democratic legitimacy.
   The future of integration theory lies in creatively elaborating LI and,
   where possible, crafting more rigorous syntheses with alternative
   accounts.},

Abstract = {The PSID has remained a valuable vehicle for evidence-based policy
   research for decades and should remain so for many more. In this short
   review, I cover major policy-related strengths from PSID research in the
   areas of event history analysis; mobility and volatility; cross national
   comparisons; health and health insurance; mobility into and out of
   poverty; the effects of parental income on children; and the use of the
   child development sample to broaden the PSID policy focus in new and
   interesting ways. I also include the emerging study of longer term
   intergenerational patterns of mobility and transfer, including across
   three generations. Finally, I take up the question of how PSID data and
   methods could be further improved to make the survey more valuable to
   public policy, focusing on administrative data linkages.},

Title = {Credible commitment without independent regulatory agent: Evidence from

Volume = {12},

Abstract = {Credible commitment problems arise whenever decisions made according to
   short-term incentives undermine long-term policy goals. While political
   actors can credibly commit themselves to their long-term policy goals by
   delegating decisions to independent regulatory agencies, the member
   states of international institutions rarely sacrifice control over
   regulatory decisions. Against the backdrop of the United Nations
   Compensation Commission established by the Security Council to settle
   claims on damage from the Iraqi occupation of Kuwait, we present an
   institutional arrangement that promises to credibly commit member states
   to their previously defined interests without excluding them from the
   decision process. It separates the stages of rulemaking and rule
   application, and is reinforced by conditional agenda-setting of an
   advisory body. We probe the theoretical claim with evidence from a
   unique data set that shows that the Commission settled compensation
   claims in a remarkably consistent way. The arrangement provides a
   blueprint for comparable regulatory tasks in many areas of
   international, European, or domestic politics, in which independent
   regulation is not feasible.},

Abstract = {Over the past several decades, scholarship on women's movements,
   feminism, and the state has brought renewed attention to the study of
   protest politics by questioning its frontier with dominant institutions.
   `This article takes this critique a step further by considering the
   institutional dimension of the state-movement intersection. Drawing on
   the French case, we argue that institutions that are formally devoted to
   women's rights inside the state (women's policy agencies) can operate as
   movement institutions - that is, as bureaucratic instances routinely
   engrained with a protest dimension - rather than being only a shelter
   for a network of insider activists. As such, they can provide a
   specific, institutional feminist socialization to their members; they
   can purvey, rather than only relay, feminist protest, and they can
   deploy institutional repertoires of protest, combining bureaucratic and
   movement dimensions. We conclude that the definition and boundaries of
   the women's movement need to be broadened to include bureaucratic
   sources of feminist protest.},

Abstract = {Structural problems are examined with pairing two chambers, one selected
   by election and the other by sortition, into a traditional bicameral
   system. It is argued that an all-purpose legislative chamber modeled on
   existing elected chambers is a mismatch for sortition and that purported
   benefits of maintaining partisan elections alongside sortition are
   illusory. Alleged benefits of a hybrid bicameral system are shown to be
   outweighed by a variety of harmful effects. Furthermore, even if those
   harms are not substantiated, the continued existence of an elected
   chamber will likely result in the delimitation of the sortition chamber.
   Combining many different sorts of minipublics with different
   characteristics and functions is preferable, and a possible multibody
   sortition legislative system is presented. Finally, an alternative way
   forward for sortition is proposed by peeling away individual topic areas
   from elected bodies and transferring them to sortition bodies.},

Abstract = {Because everyday human rights issues determine the ways in which people
   are able to live their lives, they are of extreme importance not only to
   each of us as individuals but also to us as members of a society. Their
   relevance means that everyday human rights issues should be central to
   our collective social memory and practice just like decisive
   international and domestic human rights events, victories, abuses and
   personages. The challenge, however, lies in trying to make these
   everyday issues attractive and `newsworthy' enough to capture people's
   attention. What role can media play in illuminating these everyday human
   rights issues? This paper tries to answer this question by critically
   analysing a human rights radio show/podcast produced in Aotearoa/New
   Zealand, Speak Up-Korerotia.},

   Policy in Practice Approach, built on: (1) the mix of instruments for
   policy action; (2) the process of inclusive empowerment in practice; and
   (3) gender transformation as the ultimate outcome. For the gender and
   politics community, we demonstrate the importance of incorporating
   implementation in taking policy success seriously; for the policy
   studies community, we show how engaging with gender provides a
   compelling critical case to test general propositions about policy
   success and the intersectional complexity of the policy process.},

Abstract = {Within the field of international criminal justice, opinion remains
   divided concerning the extent to which international criminal courts
   should be expected to write history. Taking this debate as its point of
   departure, this article argues that contestation over the historical
   function of international criminal courts hinges on the underlying
   conception of justice - adjudicative or sociopolitical - to which
   scholars and practitioners adhere in practice. The article demonstrates
   how these rival conceptions of justice function less as static positions
   and more as lines of argumentation that can be deployed to support or
   critique the range of practices that shape the historical narratives
   constructed within international criminal courts in practice. The
   article concludes by identifying a potential avenue to advance the
   conversation on the historical function - one that would assist in
   articulating what should legitimately be expected of international
   criminal courts and enable their practices to be evaluated in a more
   textured manner.},

Abstract = {This `state of the art' contribution reviews the methods, methodologies
   and epistemologies employed in gender and politics scholarship over
   time. We discuss the orientations and approaches of early scholars of
   Women and Politics, who challenged the claims that political science was
   both gender-neutral and objective, through more recent debates in
   political science over methodological pluralism, transparency and
   replicability. We trace the broadening of the subfield, marked by
   greater appreciation and use of quantitative research and by greater use
   and tolerance of quantitative approaches. We point to obstacles and
   promising directions in quantitative, qualitative, and mixed-methods
   research, demonstrating the methodological pluralism of gender and
   politics research today.},

Abstract = {Theories of democracy commonly assume that citizens must have a certain
   degree of information and factual knowledge to be able to understand the
   functioning of institutions, the performance of the incumbent
   government, and the actions of the main political actors. Political
   knowledge helps people to better assess their interest as individuals
   and as members of groups (Delli Carpini and Keeter 1996). Moreover,
   governments have more incentives to be responsive when they can be held
   accountable, but citizens are able to hold governments accountable for
   their actions only when they know what governments are actually doing.},

Abstract = {This article contributes to the historiography of two separate topics
   that became intertwined in the final decade of the Cold War: wildlife
   protection activism and Cold War broadcasting. The article explains how
   the activities of Radio Free Europe (RFE), a U.S.-funded radio station
   based in the Federal Republic of Germany (FRG) that transmitted
   shortwave broadcasts to five Soviet-bloc countries, throw into sharp
   relief the fine line between the advantages of radio technologies and
   their pitfalls. The article focuses on a protracted conflict between RFE
   and the FRG's bird protection activists in the 1980s and early 1990s.
   Some U.S. officials viewed the fight over the station's superior killer
   technologies as reflecting anti-Americanism during Ronald Reagan's
   presidency, but West German officials saw it more as an outgrowth of the
   species protection movement that had recently become a part of the FRG's
   political mainstream. The article highlights the complex social and
   international political dimensions of the dispute.},

Abstract = {Well-known theories suggest that administrative procedures may be used
   as mechanisms of political control of the bureaucracy. This study
   investigates whether three common regulatory analysis
   procedurescost-benefit analysis, risk assessment, and economic impact
   analysislead to greater influence by political officials on bureaucratic
   policymaking. Multivariate analyses of data from a unique survey of
   state administrators indicate that regulatory analysis requirements are
   associated with decreases in the perceived influence of elected
   political officials on the content of administrative rules. This
   association is particularly evident in cases where proposed rules are
   subjected to a cost-benefit test. These findings contradict prominent
   theories of administrative procedures, but are consistent with recent
   research on the political power of administrative agencies.},

Abstract = {The post-1960s immigration boom and contemporary demographics have
   elevated generation-since-immigration as a category that is central to
   analysts and, more generally, to Americans as they make sense of their
   place in the world around them. This makes the collection of data on
   immigrant generations imperative if surveys are to keep up with how the
   nation's people think about themselves and each other. A clear portrait
   of contemporary assimilation, and indeed American progress, depends on
   possessing the right tools to paint such a portrait. That means that
   surveys must enable researchers to identify respondents' generation,
   particularly the third generation of the post-1965 immigration wave.},

Abstract = {This article underscores the importance of adding a question on parental
   birthplace to the American Community Survey (ACS). This question was
   removed from the long form of the U.S. Census after 1970 and replaced by
   a question on ancestry. While the former provides accurate information
   about a demographic fact that is critical to the identification of the
   children of immigrants, the latter refers to a subjective social
   construction that has limited utility for purposes of program
   administration, apportionment, or governance. At the time that the
   parental birthplace question was eliminated, the percentage of ACS
   respondents who were foreign-born had reached an all-time low, and the
   second generation was aging and shrinking, so the loss to the nation's
   statistical system was not immediately apparent. With the revival of
   immigration in the final quarter of the twentieth century, the inability
   to identify and study the second generation has become glaringly
   apparent. Immigrants and their children now constitute a quarter of the
   U.S. population: their nonwhite racial origins and a widespread lack of
   legal documents among them render their prospects for integration
   uncertain. Our current inability to accurately measure progress between
   first- and second-generation immigrants now constitutes a major weakness
   in the U.S. statistical system.},

Abstract = {Sociologists of science emphasize the crucial role of the day-to-day
   practices of scholars in defining academic disciplines and
   epistemological schools. Taking the case of EU Studies (EUS), this
   article examines the key practice of normative writing. I analyze the
   degree to which 70 highly-cited journal articles of political science
   writing in EUS explicitly or implicitly suggest that European
   integration or its institutions or policies are bad or good, flourishing
   or declining. I use this discourse analysis, plus biographical data on
   the authors of texts, to explain a major temporal pattern. Degrees of
   normativity in EUS articles progressively declined from the 1970s until
   the millennium, but then subsequently recovered. Factors external' to
   scholarship, such as the progressive intensification of European
   integration and crises faced by the EU help explain this pattern.
   However they interacted in complex ways with internal' academic factors,
   such as generational replacement, mainstreaming' and rivalries between
   sub-disciplinary and theoretical camps.},

Journal = {REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL ECONOMY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {25},
Number = {1},
Pages = {28-48},
Abstract = {We examine the impact of formal standards on trade in global value
   chains (GVCs) in Europe. Using a gravity model approach for panel data,
   we estimate the influence of national, European and international
   standards on trade in value-added and gross trade flows within Europe.
   We find that national standards on their own hamper trade in European
   value chains while European and international standards foster trade.
   European standards have greater influence on trade in inner-European
   value chains whereas international standards have positive effects on
   imports into Europe from third countries. European standards therefore
   reduce information asymmetries between market actors in the value chains
   of the European Single Market. International standards serve as a means
   of global communication between international trade partners. In
   addition, we find a positive effect of an interaction term between
   national and European standards in European value chains confirming the
   necessity of national standardization. Furthermore, we consider our
   findings not only within international political economy's theoretical
   literature regarding the governance of GVCs but also, the subsequent
   policy implications of our findings in terms of economic growth and
   development.},
