Title = {DISABLED REFUGEE STUDENTS IN ZIMBABWE},
Booktitle = {STRATEGIES, POLICIES AND DIRECTIONS FOR REFUGEE EDUCATION},

Abstract = {Students with disabilities face numerous challenges in the institutions
   of learning especially in developing countries. Refugees student with
   disabilities face double jeopardy as they face discrimination due to
   their disability and because of their refugee status. In Zimbabwe the
   rights of refugees with disabilities are not well respected as enshrined
   in the international statues such as the United Nations Convention on
   the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. Universities in Zimbabwe
   appreciate that refugees are part of their diverse population and this
   includes the presence of students with disabilities who are also
   refugees. They have adopted a number of initiatives to accommodate these
   students. The disability resource centers at these institutions have
   been given the leading role in helping students with disabilities who
   are refugees to feel at home. The student affairs department also
   provides the necessary assistance that is required by these students.
   Refugees often require counseling to be able to deal with the past and
   the future challenges. Hence, counseling facilities are provided by the
   universities so that students who are refugees are mentally psyched so
   that they are able to perform well in their class. The language barrier
   was identified as deterrent to the success of refugees in their studies.
   Universities offer English language tutorials for free to the refugee
   students prior to the attendance of their degree programs. Challenges
   that are faced by refugee students with disabilities cannot be solved by
   government alone hence partnerships with non-governmental organizations
   (NGOs). NGOs have been at the forefront of assisting these students with
   scholarships and assistive devices because some students with
   disabilities do not afford to source the devices due to their
   prohibitive costs.},

Abstract = {Social media has become an enabler for wider public participation,
   adeptly allowing the citizenry to pro-actively engage in their own
   countries' democratization and peace processes. The use of social media
   networks by the people of Burundi and beyond, to actively respond to the
   political crisis in the country amid state sabotage of mainstream media,
   is the central theme. The chapter trails the continent's state of social
   networking and transitions, analysis of social media within conceptual
   democratic frames of agonism, to the political upheaval narrative.
   Lessons on the role of social media in democratic transitions and peace
   emerge from Burundi's reflection on three questions: Was social media a
   deterrence to possible genocide? Was there a de-escalation of the
   political crisis linked to social media? What was the specific function
   of hashtags and memes? This chapter is aided by a combination of
   secondary information and primary evidence from the online presence of
   over 2,000 individuals interacting with the authors on both the Facebook
   and Twitter accounts for Friends of United Africa.},
