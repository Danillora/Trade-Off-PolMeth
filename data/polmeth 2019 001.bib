Abstract = {Ghosh's book makes important interventions in contemporary LGBTQ+ rights
   politics, but some analytical and methodological choices produce
   oversights. In this response I address three such instances. First, I
   trouble the use of the term `queer' in the text, arguing that the focus
   on critiquing binaries is a useful but narrow deployment of the term.
   Second, I discuss dialectics as a methodology to show that the
   dialectical project undertaken here is incomplete. Finally, I
   interrogate Ghosh's useful term `Radical Theory Creep' to demonstrate
   the need for more analytical clarity on when a theory's explanatory
   power has crept beyond its limits.},

Title = {Identity as Dependent Variable: How Americans Shift Their Identities to
   Align with Their Politics},
Journal = {AMERICAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {64},
Number = {3},
Pages = {699-716},

Abstract = {Political science generally treats identities such as ethnicity,
   religion, and sexuality as ``unmoved movers{''} in the chain of
   causality. I hypothesize that the growing salience of partisanship and
   ideology as social identities in the United States, combined with the
   increasing demographic distinctiveness of the nation's two political
   coalitions, is leading some Americans to engage in a self-categorization
   and depersonalization process in which they shift their identities
   toward the demographic prototypes of their political groups. Analyses of
   a representative panel data set that tracks identities and political
   affiliations over a 4-year span confirm that small but significant
   shares of Americans engage in identity switching regarding ethnicity,
   religion, sexual orientation, and class that is predicted by
   partisanship and ideology in their pasts, bringing their identities into
   alignment with their politics. These findings enrich and complicate our
   understanding of the relationship between identity and politics and
   suggest caution in treating identities as unchanging phenomena.},

Title = {Authoritarian innovations in Indonesia: electoral narrowing, identity
   politics and executive illiberalism},

Year = {2020},
Volume = {27},
Number = {6},
Pages = {1021-1036},

Abstract = {In the last decade, autocrats and democrats alike have used a wide range
   of innovative illiberal methods to cement or expand their power.
   Especially in democracies, however, these techniques have often been
   difficult to detect as they are typically packaged as acts of democracy
   defense, not erosion. This article discusses the deployment of
   authoritarian innovations in Indonesia, where the elite as a collective,
   the opposition and the executive each launched illiberal initiatives
   that caused a notable decline in the country's democratic quality. These
   illiberal strategies concern a narrowing of electoral competitiveness,
   the mobilization of identity politics, and attempts at power
   concentration and maximization by the executive. The wide spread of
   anti-democratic actors in Indonesia differs from other cases of
   increasing illiberalism, in which executive leaders have been the main
   drivers. But Indonesia also stands out because the residual resources of
   its defective but persistent electoral democracy have mitigated the
   effectiveness of the authoritarian innovations, preventing (thus far)
   the polity's full descent into autocracy or populist illiberalism.},

Journal = {PARTY POLITICS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {27},
Number = {4},
Pages = {779-790},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Many parties have updated their recruitment strategies and offer softer
   routes for joining their ranks. In some parties, registered sympathizers
   are given virtually the same rights as traditional members with
   substantially lower costs. This begs the question, why would somebody
   take the further step of joining such parties as full members rather
   than sympathizers? This article analyzes this question by using
   membership surveys from three left-wing Spanish parties. As such, it
   explores the usefulness of the general incentives model (GIM) for
   explaining the decisions of these two groups of affiliates. We find that
   full members and sympathizers differ in the motives they have to join
   the party and in their evaluations of the diverse types of incentives
   included in the GIM. Candidate selection incentives seem particularly
   important for sympathizers, whereas selective outcome incentives,
   selective process benefits, collective outcome benefits and altruistic
   motivations play a more significant role for members.},

Abstract = {Nuclear cooperation has been a consistent feature of the Australia-US
   alliance. In the 1950s and 1960s, Canberra explored transferring US
   nuclear weapons to Australian forces operating in Southeast Asia. Since
   the 1960s, Australian governments have supported hosting joint
   facilities that contribute to America's ability to execute global
   nuclear operations. And Australia has regularly invoked the nuclear
   umbrella as part of the alliance. We explain the key sources of nuclear
   cooperation in the alliance by leveraging realist and institutionalist
   theories of alliance cooperation. While realism explains limits to US
   nuclear commitments in the 1950s, institutional explanations are more
   relevant in pinpointing the sources of nuclear cooperation and in
   explaining why Australia has often achieved its policy preferences as
   the junior partner.},

Volume = {25},

Abstract = {Jeremy Waldron introduced the notion of rights supersession into the
   philosophical discussion about restitutive justice in cases of historic
   injustices. He refers to land claims by indigenous peoples as a
   real-world example and as an application of his theory of rights
   supersession. He implies that the changes that have taken place in
   settler states since the first years of colonialism are the kind of
   changes that lead to a supersession of land rights. The article proposes
   to unbundle property rights into rights of benefit, control, use, and
   access and to distinguish between different forms of attachment. This
   strategy allows for a third option of restitution and supersession,
   namely partial restitution. Partial restitution grants current land
   holders those rights that they need to satisfy their attachments and
   basic distributive justice claims. At the same time, rights that are not
   needed for either purpose will revert back to indigenous peoples as the
   original owners. The article argues that the notion of partial
   restitution allows for far more extensive land rights than a less
   nuanced application of the supersession thesis.},

Month = {SEP 19},
Abstract = {The issue of political violence is mostly absent from current debates
   about power. Many conceptions of power treat violence as wholly distinct
   from or even antithetical to power, or see it as a mere instrument whose
   effects are obvious and not in need of political analysis. In this
   paper, I explore what kind of ontology of power is necessary to properly
   take account of the various roles that violence can play in creating and
   maintaining power structures. I pursue this question by contrasting the
   views of Hannah Arendt and Michel Foucault. For Arendt, power is
   generated and maintained by communicative practices. She argues that
   power and violence are `opposites' because violence can only destroy but
   not create these practices. In contrast, Foucault's conception
   explicitly allows violence to play a constitutive role in generating
   power. I argue that while Arendt is right to insist that power and
   violence are not identical, it does not follow that violence cannot play
   any role in constituting power. Guided by Foucault's approach, I
   formulate a non-dualist account of the relationship between power and
   violence that takes seriously the role that bodies, material things, and
   built infrastructures play in making social relations `more durable' and
   constituting power.},

Abstract = {Michael Oakeshott's account of political economy is claimed to have
   found its `apotheosis under Thatcherism'. Against critics who align him
   with a preference for small government, this article points to
   Oakeshott's stress on the indispensability of an infrastructure of
   government-provided public goods, in which individual agency and
   associative freedom can flourish. I argue that Oakeshott's account of
   political economy invites a contestatory politics over three types of
   public goods, which epitomize the unresolvable tension he diagnosed
   between nomocratic and teleocratic conceptions of the modern state.
   These three types are the system of civil law, the by-products of the
   operation of civil law and public goods which result from policies. The
   article concludes that Oakeshott offers an important corrective to
   political theories which favour either market mediation or radical
   democratic governance of the commons as self-sustaining modes of
   providing and enjoying goods.},

Abstract = {Since 2017 the British Labour Party has proposed mandatory sectoral
   collective bargaining (SCB) as a comprehensive strategy to rebuild the
   trade union voice across the entire economy. The intellectual roots lie
   in the Institute of Employment Rights' (IER) Manifesto for Labour Law
   (2016). First, this article explains the core IER approach, questioning
   its feasibility given current low levels of union membership and
   bargaining coverage and whether it would produce the stable and
   productive economy promised. Second, the article develops four social
   science objections to this state-driven approach centred on industrial
   relations history; political sociology; economics; and political
   philosophy. The conclusion argues that while stronger voluntary trade
   unions could help, it is neither practicable nor desirable for the state
   to impose a trade union, single-channel approach to employee voice.
   Instead, a `mixed economy of voice' is proposed, perhaps including
   statutory works councils, which speaks directly to all employees-union
   and non-union-and wins broader political, employer and public support.},

Title = {The Rise of the Homme Machine: Carl Schmitt's Critique of
   Biotechnology and Utopias},
Journal = {POLITICAL THEORY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {48},
Number = {5},
Pages = {615-643},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {This essay argues that Carl Schmitt's postwar writings offer an original
   critique of biotechnology and utopian thinking. Examining the classics
   of utopian literature from Plato to Thomas More and Aldous Huxley,
   Schmitt illustrates the rise of utopianism that aims to transform human
   nature and even produce an artificial ``human-machine.{''} Schmitt
   discovers a counterimage to the emerging era of biotechnology from a
   katechontic form of Christianity and maintains that human beings must
   recognize their shared humanity in God, warning us that without a realm
   of transcendence, the enemy no longer offers an existential mirror but
   begins to incarnate foreign values, which must be destroyed completely.
   By comparing Schmitt with Michel Foucault and Donna Haraway, it is also
   argued that Schmitt's thinking unlocks a novel path to exploring the
   meaning and histories of biopolitics and posthumanism. From a Schmittian
   perspective, Foucault's depiction of biopolitics appears as a mere
   prelude to the coming age of biotechnology that will lead us into a
   posthuman era. Demonstrating interesting contrasts with Haraway's
   utopian vision of the cyborg, it is maintained that Schmitt's thinking
   offers a distinctively conservative-Christian critique of posthumanism.},

Abstract = {The transformative and regulatory accommodation model addresses
   practical challenges to accommodate religious laws and courts in the
   secular and democratic regimes. There is a strong evidence against the
   jurisdictional competition between secular and religious courts under
   defined conditions. There is no concern regarding the Shariah courts in
   the non-Muslim democracies, as majority of the country's ethno-religious
   groups control the civil and rabbinical courts. In this regard, there is
   a need to mitigate the negative impact of Muslim Family Laws (MFLs) by
   the civil courts in non-Muslim majority countries because MFLs imply
   certain disabilities and limitations upon the displayed rights of women
   and children. To address these issues, the present study aims to discuss
   the possibilities and challenges faced by the multicultural and
   pluri-legal accommodations by focusing on the Islamic law and
   institutions within the non-Muslim democracies. The results have shown
   that the reformation of rules and procedures internalize certain
   principles and discourses due to increased compliance of religious
   courts with the high court rulings. Increase in the number of Muslim
   judges on civil courts would help to overcome lack of legitimacy in the
   perspectives of the Muslim minority that is the main reason of
   shortcomings of both ex post and ex ante oversight mechanisms.},

Abstract = {Africa is the springboard for al-Qaeda's global terrorism in modern
   history. The U.S. Embassy bombings in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, and
   Nairobi, Kenya in August 1998 put al-Qaeda on the map and led to major
   counter-terrorism operations throughout parts of Africa. Bin Laden made
   a strategic decision to use Africa as a launching pad for al-Qaeda's
   global network and appeal. The linkages of Jihadist terrorism in Africa
   trace back to the fight against the Soviets in Afghanistan. Today,
   al-Qaeda and ISIS continue to use Africa as an important locale of
   operations. If improvements in human security, economies, politics,
   education, conflict resolution, and wealth distribution are not
   addressed, then the continent will continue to experience history
   repeating itself involving Jihadist terrorism in Africa.},

   to Reduce Racial Inequality},
Journal = {POLITICAL BEHAVIOR},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {41},
Number = {4},
Pages = {917-943},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Although Blacks are homogeneous in their support for racial equality,
   research shows that they are conflicted about the political strategies
   their group should adopt to advance its interest. At times, Blacks rely
   on racial group specific behaviors (e.g., working on behalf of Black
   organizations) to alleviate racial inequality, while at other instances
   they depend on non-racial group specific behaviors (e.g., working on
   behalf of the Democratic Party). What is unclear from the literature are
   the conditions under which Blacks engage in behaviors that specifically
   help their racial group over actions that are more universalistic in
   nature. We argue that experiencing anger about race should boost Blacks'
   participation in donating to indigenous Black organizations and
   protesting rather than giving to universalistic organizations and
   voting. To test our expectations, we utilize a lab experiment and a
   national survey experiment. The findings show that feeling angry about
   race increases Blacks' willingness to donate to Black organizations and
   protest. We also find that angry Blacks, highly supportive of Black
   community nationalism, are the strongest participants in these types of
   actions. Meanwhile, Blacks who feel angry about race are not more
   engaging in non-racial group specific acts.},

Abstract = {The notion that democracy is a system is ever present in democratic
   theory. However, what it means to think systemically about democracy (as
   opposed to what it means for a political system to be democratic) is
   under-elaborated. This article sets out a meta-level framework for
   thinking systemically about democracy, built upon seven conceptual
   building blocks, which we term (1) functions, (2) norms, (3) practices,
   (4) actors, (5) arenas, (6) levels, and (7) interactions. This enables
   us to systematically structure the debate on democratic systems,
   highlighting the commonalities and differences between systems
   approaches, their omissions, and the key questions that remain to be
   answered. It also enables us to push the debate forward both by
   demonstrating how a full consideration of all seven building blocks
   would address issues with existing approaches and by introducing new
   conceptual clarifications within those building blocks.},

Abstract = {Discussing the way human rights are implemented by global actors who are
   able to make them explicit and achievable within the framework of a
   symbolic horizon where the right to have rights and the right to
   question the law exist opens up the possibility of undertaking an
   exercise of political action designed to update them. Two issues will be
   discussed in this respect: the interactive universalism of Seyla
   Benhabib and the role of the political action of global actors,
   developed through democratic iterations that re-establish the link
   between politics and law, placing human rights within the Arendtian
   register of the ``right to have rights{''}, while providing a radical
   critique of the universal idea of human rights that makes them
   impossible to achieve in today's world.},

Abstract = {This paper builds upon the concept of ``coalescent elite behaviour{''}
   which is crucial in consociational theory, but contested regarding its
   actual conceptualization. Contrary to Lijphart's (1968) original
   assumption that elites are generally committed to an ``overarching
   cooperation{''}, we hypothesize that institutional venues must be taken
   in account. Thus, the aim of this paper is twofold: Conceptually, we try
   to clarify the nature of ``amicable agreement{''} regarding two core
   institutions (i.e. parliament, government), and regarding
   executive-legislative relations. Empirically, we follow a two-step
   empirical approach that combines a cross-time comparison of the
   decision-making process regarding the revision of the Swiss basic
   pension scheme (AHV) with a cross-case assessment following Fischer's
   two-dimensional typology. More generally, our findings serve to
   inductively refine the ``political side{''} of consociationalism.},

Abstract = {The political consequences of climate change have been topics at
   numerous political science conferences. Contrary to the plurality of
   discussions at these meetings, it is striking that there is no
   systematic account of the carbon footprint of political science
   conferences themselves. Applying a GIS-based approach I estimate the
   travel induced greenhouse gas emissions of the last six ECPR General
   Conferences (2013-18). The results show that for the five conferences
   that took part in Europe the average emissions per attendee were between
   0.5-1.3 tons CO2-equivalents. At the 2015 conference in Montreal it were
   even 1.9-3.4 tons. Compared to estimations based on the latest IPCC
   reports which call for a reduction of per capita emissions to 2.5 tons
   by 2030 and even 0.7 tons by 2050 in order to keep on track with the
   1.5-degree goal, the travel induced GHG-emissions of ECPR conferences
   are very high. Yet, further estimations demonstrate that significant
   emission reductions are possible: by choosing more central conference
   venues, promoting low-emission landbound means of transportation and
   introducing online participation for researchers from far away, the
   carbon footprint could be reduced by 75-90 per cent. The article also
   gives concrete recommendations how the carbon footprint of conferences
   could be reduced.},

Abstract = {After a fatal police shooting, it is typical for city and police
   officials to view the family of the deceased through the lens of the
   law. If the family files a lawsuit, the city and police department
   consider it their legal right to defend themselves and to treat the
   plaintiffs as adversaries. However, reparations and the concept of
   ``reparative justice{''} allow authorities to frame police killings in
   moral rather than legal terms. When a police officer kills a person who
   was not liable to this outcome, officials should offer monetary
   reparations, an apology, and other redress measures to the victim's
   family. To make this argument, the article presents a philosophical
   account of non-liability hailing from self-defense theory that centers
   on the distinction between reasonableness and liability. Reparations
   provide a nonadversarial alternative to civil litigation after a
   non-liable person has been killed by a police officer. In cases where
   the officer nevertheless acted reasonably, ``institutional
   agent-regret{''} rather than moral responsibility grounds the argument
   for reparations. Throughout the article, it is argued that there are
   distinct racial wrongs both when police kill a nonliable black person
   and when family members of a black victim are treated poorly by
   officials in the civil litigation process.},

Abstract = {The article seeks to understand what is specifically modern about
   populists, why we have difficulty in agreeing on who and what they are,
   and-importantly-how we can address the formidable challenge they present
   to contemporary democratic politics. It does so by detailing the
   classical conception of the demagogue and by showing how modernity, in
   its liberal and counter-liberal aspects, sought to solve conclusively
   the problem of the demagogue. It argues that modern populists face
   significant obstacles to their ambitions in the form of modern
   constitutionalism, yet are also armed with new weapons, including new
   concepts or ``ideologies{''} for manipulation (such as ``the people,{''}
   nation, race and class) and new rhetorical techniques (such as
   propaganda that exploits modern technology and mass media).},

Abstract = {The authors examine three recent large-scale mnemonic projects and
   transformation processes in Austrias' capital, Vienna: The staging of
   celebrations of May 8 as a ``day of joy{''} at Heldenplatz in the city
   center, the subsequent reshaping of Heldenplatz, and the placing of
   pavement memorials dedicated to victims of the Shoah throughout the
   cityscape. The article is based on the sociological concepts of
   ``synthesizing{''} and ``spacing{''} as well as a recently conducted
   survey of all signs of remembrance referring to political violence
   during National Socialism in Vienna. In order to identify differences
   and similarities, the authors examine mnemonic actors that drive
   transnationalization, specific practices of producing spaces of
   remembrance that reach beyond national and municipal borders, as well as
   the effects of transnationality, normative frameworks, and esthetic
   means developed and used by agents of transnationalization. One of the
   key findings is that ``transnationality{''} is rarely an explicitly
   intended objective of actors. Rather, it emerges through specific
   practices applied by actors located at diverse political scales in an
   attempt to achieve their objectives in a particular local political and
   spatial setting.},

Abstract = {Over the course of three decades, vocabularies of radical democracy have
   pressed their stamp on democratic thought. Trading on the intuition that
   there is more to democracy than elections, they have generated critical
   insights into the important role that practices of pluralisation and
   critique play in bettering institutional politics. As a result, few
   would today deny the radical democratic contribution to democratic
   thought. What many might question, however, is its continuing traction.
   The article probes this question, focusing on the nuanced place of
   democracy in contemporary radical work. It grapples with the
   difficulties that this poses for radical democrats, and it suggests that
   a way of overcoming these difficulties - that threaten to undermine the
   coherence of radical democracy - is to rethink and reconstruct the
   distinctiveness of its vocabulary. The article attempts such a
   reconstruction. It develops the idea of the promissory rule of the many,
   and it discusses the ways that this idea rejuvenates broader democratic
   thought.},

Abstract = {This paper uses analyses of commercial polls alongside content-analytic
   measures of sentiment in the content of nine newspapers to explore the
   relationship between voter preferences and the tone of news coverage in
   the 2016 presidential election campaign. Both media coverage and voter
   preferences reflected the effects of certain campaign events-the
   conventions and the initial Comey intrusion-and there also is evidence
   of a relationship between the two. Indeed, it appears that the media
   both led and followed public preferences throughout much of the
   campaign, though evidence of followership actually is more robust; and
   the final weeks of the campaign show little to no media effects at all.
   Results speak to the importance of considering media not just as a
   driver, but also a follower of public sentiment.},

Abstract = {The need for ecological sustainability has been translated into
   different indicators such as the `ecological footprint' and the
   `planetary boundaries'. Analysis of both concepts concludes that the
   planet is currently undergoing a period of ecological unsustainability.
   For this reason, ecologists argue that various limits are required in
   order to move to a path of sustainability. The implementation of such
   limits has mostly been analysed from the perspectives of environmental
   rights and environmental justice, however research in terms of freedom
   is (surprisingly) still lacking. In what way do such limits have an
   impact on freedom? I will argue that there are two different ways to
   analyse the relation between freedom and ecological limits: on the one
   hand, freedom is often referred to as being in competition with
   ecological sustainability and the limits it is required to impose, and,
   on the other hand, the impact on an individual's freedom due to
   ecological catastrophe if strict limits are not implemented. Accepting
   that freedom is an important topic regarding ecological challenges, I
   ask which conception of freedom is better suited to answer this
   challenge as well as the required implementation of ecological limits. I
   compare and confront the closely linked conceptions of freedom as
   non-frustration and the closely linked conception of non-limitation, as
   well as non-interference and the conception of freedom as
   non-domination. After presenting these conceptions I examine their
   relationship with ecological limits. The conclusion is that the
   conception of freedom as non-domination is better placed to justify
   ecological limits necessary to promote an ecologically sustainable
   future.},

Abstract = {In this study, we argue that ethnic inclusiveness is an important
   democratic norm that fosters interstate peace. When two states are
   socialized into the notion of ethnic tolerance, they acquire the ability
   to reach cooperative arrangements in time of crisis. Based on
   cross-national time-series data analysis covering the period 1950-2001,
   we illustrate how two states that are inclusive of their politically
   relevant ethnic groups are less likely to experience interstate disputes
   than states that remain exclusive. This finding was robust, regardless
   of sample size, intensity of the dispute, model specification, or
   estimation method. Therefore, we believe in the existence of ethnic
   peace: ethnic inclusiveness represents an unambiguous force for
   democratic peace.},

Abstract = {Does an increasing divide in ideological orientations influence
   citizens' political behaviour? This study explores whether mass
   ideological polarisation stimulates individuals to become politically
   active in terms of poll attendance and non-electoral participation. In
   line with relative deprivation theory I argue that in an environment of
   ideological polarisation, individuals' normative notions are threatened,
   increasing the probability that they will actively participate in the
   political decision-making process. Using the European Social Survey
   (2002-2014) and focusing on subnational regions, I conduct macro-level
   as well as multi-level analyses. Empirical results show that ideological
   polarisation indeed mobilises for non-electoral participation, while
   there is no such effect on voting. In the second step, I examine whether
   ideological extremism makes individuals more susceptible to
   environmental ideological polarisation. Findings show that members of
   the far right are more likely to become politically active when their
   social environment is divided over political ideology. In contrast,
   members of the far left are hardly motivated by rising polarisation
   regarding ideology.},

Abstract = {The role of marriage in accessing membership entitlements has been
   studied extensively in the context of marriage migration, but it remains
   under-researched in the literature on citizenship acquisition. This
   paper explores specific constructions of deservingness vis-a-vis the
   foreign spouses of citizens and their marriages in the context of
   facilitated naturalization in Switzerland. Based on an ethnographic
   investigation of the naturalization practices of street-level
   bureaucrats, we show that the politics of belonging in the context of
   access to citizenship is regulated by intersecting gendered, ethnicized
   and classed logics of desirability about how a marriage should be.
   Additionally, a patrilineal logic continues to guide street-level
   bureaucrats de facto even when legislation has introduced de jure gender
   equality. Finally, we demonstrate that it is not only immigration
   regimes, but also citizenship regimes that employ assumptions about what
   constitutes a `good marriage' in order to draw the boundaries of the
   nation.},

   Valence Reputation},

Abstract = {We combine several strands of research from electoral behavior and party
   politics to suggest that ideological moderation will boost a party's
   perceived competence. Less radical parties are seen as readier to
   compromise, more realistic about what can be achieved, and less prone to
   simplistic solutions. The results of conjoint experiments with party
   profiles show that while an ideological leaning carries no cost, any
   appreciably left- or right-wing position eroded a party's perceived
   competence among a representative sample of around 2,000 British
   citizens. This effect holds when controlling for respondents'
   ideological proximity to the party in question, and it looks to operate
   through all three of the proposed mechanisms suggested above-especially
   willingness to compromise. These findings have important implications
   both for party strategy and for voting research, highlighting a key
   channel through which ideological moderation yields electoral gains.},

Abstract = {In this paper, which is positioned at the intersection of political
   sociology and the sociology of art, I discuss the implications of
   political art at the local level. I show how analyzing an existing
   example of locally engaged political art would contribute to the
   comprehension of the relationship between art and politics in
   contemporary societies. I employ a single case study, Freetown
   Christiania, in order to reveal the role of local artistic engagement in
   bringing about political outcomes, and in particular, relative autonomy
   at the local level. Though this study is solely focused on one community
   which has emerged within a specific context and time, it provides a
   unique lens to describe the relevance and potential of locally engaged
   political art for broader society. I utilize Freetown Christiania as an
   example of Benjaminian and Brechtian utopia in order to showcase how
   their micro-level artistic engagement has brought about relative
   autonomy at the local level. In particular, I describe the function of
   local artistic engagement in Freetown Christiania, especially their
   theatre groupSolvognen(The Sun Chariot), as a unique artistic enterprise
   which has surpassed Benjamin's and Brecht's elaborations of the role of
   political art in modern societies through the employment of the elements
   of the avant-garde and postdramatic theatre. I argue that this peculiar
   combination of Benjaminian and Brechtian forms of political art on the
   one hand, and the avant-garde and postdramatic theatre on the other, has
   enabled them to create and sustain this micro-utopia in a neoliberal
   capitalist order.},

Title = {`The most notorious trouble spot along the entire border': exploring the
   dynamics of political violence in an Irish border town, 1971-1974},
Journal = {IRISH POLITICAL STUDIES},

Volume = {35},

Abstract = {Levels of violence on the Irish border escalated significantly during
   the years 1971-1974. Frequently, the British government alleged that the
   IRA was using the territory of the Republic of Ireland as a base from
   which to launch attacks. This paper will examine the southern border
   town of Lifford, which featured prominently in British complaints.
   Despite the significance of border violence, there has been a tendency
   for research on the Northern Ireland Troubles to focus on the urban
   centres. Evidence presented shows that the IRA was extremely active in
   the Lifford area. The Irish security forces were ill-equipped to deal
   with the threat and there are allegations that low-level collusion
   occurred. The Irish government was under diplomatic pressure to act with
   regard to the situation for some time. The IRA eventually over-escalated
   its campaign, engaging in military activity south of the border,
   prompting a significant security response from the Irish state and a
   subsequent decline in violence. It is concluded that failings by the
   Irish security forces were due to a range of factors including sympathy
   for northern nationalists, lack of resources, organisational weakness,
   and a fear of acting in case violence spread to the Republic of Ireland.},

Abstract = {This article examines the lack of political pluralism and the resurgence
   of nationalism among football fans in Poland. As confirmed by
   quantitative surveys, Polish fans align with right- or ultra-right wing
   parties. Left-wing ideology is virtually non-existent at football
   terraces. The aims of the paper are: to provide a thorough description
   of Polish fans' political engagement and attitudes; to discuss
   interrelations between the wider socio-political context and specificity
   of football fandom and to explain the issue of growing politicization of
   fandom in the last decade. Finally, several non-mutually exclusive
   sociological interpretations of the state of affairs are offered.},

Abstract = {Challenger parties' electoral successes have attracted increasing
   scholarly attention. Based on the example of West European radical left
   parties, this article investigates whether and how centripetal and
   centrifugal positional movements on different conflict dimensions
   influence the election results of these parties. Depending on parties'
   issue-linkages, these strategies will have a different effect for the
   economic and the non-economic issue dimension. Due to radical left
   parties' long-term commitment and a strong party-issue linkage on
   economic issues, more moderate positions will play to their electoral
   advantage. In contrast, far-left parties compete with social democratic
   and green-libertarian parties for party-issue linkages on the
   non-economic issue dimension. Here, they benefit from promoting
   centrifugal strategies. Based on time-series cross-section analyses for
   25 West European far-left parties between 1990 and 2017, the empirical
   results show that the success of radical left parties' positional
   strategies varies with the conflict dimension in question and that this
   effect is only partly moderated by the positions of competing mainstream
   left parties.},

Abstract = {The computational campaign suggests the exploitation and sophistication
   of the discourse by extracting and analyzing the electorate's personal
   data, as well as the automation of diffusion tasks through techniques
   such as bots. This new stage in political communication has also been
   approached from a critical perspective, that questions the change of
   public opinion in the network and the adaptation of political discourse
   depending on the audience. This article aims to approach the techniques
   of computational analysis deployed during the last general and regional
   elections in Spain. And to do so, it uses the qualitative methodology
   based, on the one hand, on sixteen in-depth interviews with political
   parties with representation in the Congress of Deputies and Castile and
   Leon regional Parliament (Popular Party, Socialist Party, Podemos,
   Citizens and United Left); and on the other hand, on non-participant
   observation by means of an ethnographic content analysis for the
   specific internal monitoring of the resources and proposals for
   information, interaction, cooperation and mobilization facilitated in
   different online resources generated by the examined parties. Even if
   far from the US context, campaign teams confirm the use of new tools for
   mobilization such as WhatsApp, and the development of strategies based
   on data extraction and automated messages, like bots.},

Title = {LEADERSHIP PERCEPTION IN CANDIDATE FACES: SCOTLAND'S UNIONISTS PREFER
   DOMINANT LEADERS, AND SO DO NATIONALISTS - BUT ONLY IF THEY ARE ECONOMIC
   PESSIMISTS},
Journal = {SCOTTISH AFFAIRS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {28},

Abstract = {Voters rely on many cues to make decisions about who to vote for, and
   the appearance of a potential leader can play an important part in this
   decision-making process. When choosing leaders, it is thought that
   voters make `fit-to-task' voting decisions, for example, exhibiting a
   preference for masculine-looking leaders in hypothetical wartime
   scenarios, when masculine behavioural characteristics would be most
   valued. Here, we examine face preferences within a sample of Scottish
   voters during the campaign for the 2014 Scottish independence
   referendum. Subjects were presented with masculinised and feminised
   versions of faces in a forced-choice experimental task to select their
   preferred face in a hypothetical national election. No voters (those who
   voted to maintain the Union) chose more masculine-faced hypothetical
   leaders than Yes voters (those who voted in favour of an independent
   Scotland); effect sizes observed were medium. Within Yes voters,
   economic concern was related to a preference for masculine faces, but
   for No voters, economic outlook did not relate to face preferences.
   These findings underscore the importance of real-world socio-political
   contexts in psychology research, particularly that concerning the public
   perception of different leadership prototypes. Implications in the
   current Scottish context are discussed.},

Title = {Assessing the Effects of Partisan Bias at the Group Level of Analysis: A
   Hidden Profile Experiment},
Journal = {AMERICAN POLITICS RESEARCH},

Volume = {47},

Abstract = {Although there is some evidence in the political arena that pooling
   information can overcome individual biases to improve decision-making
   accuracy, research from the group communication and psychology arenas
   suggests otherwise. Specifically, research on the hidden profile, a
   group-level decision-making problem, suggests that groups are decidedly
   biased when making decisions. This laboratory experiment tested whether
   or not partisan biases manifest at the group level of analysis. In the
   main, it was found that groups composed of either all Republican or all
   Democratic group members were likely to make a decision that was
   consonant with their party's political ideology, which ultimately
   impacted hidden profile solution rates (i.e., decision accuracy).
   Moreover, supplemental analyses suggest that Republican and Democratic
   groups reached their biased decisions through different means. A
   discussion is provided in which the implications of these results are
   considered.},

Abstract = {This article explores how the secular nature of the Egyptian and Iranian
   states affected women's divorce rights between 1920 and 1939.
   Contributing to the existing literature by examining two states which
   have not been exclusively compared in this field, unique and important
   insights emerge regarding secularism, gender equality and family law
   through textual analysis of laws and memoirs. It demonstrates the impact
   of secular identities on divorce laws; secularism as a tool to challenge
   or seek power, and the significance of a state's political environment.
   This article challenges assumptions that secularism had little impact on
   family law in the MENA region.},

Abstract = {Both a party proposals and the politician's personality are among the
   important determinants of their success in the political market. Studies
   on the perception of the surrounding physical and social reality clearly
   demonstrate that the evaluation of experienced objects and events
   depends not only on the properties of the perceived stimulus but also on
   the external context, made up of the surrounding stimuli and events, and
   on the internal context, consisting of the cognitive schemata of the
   individuals. Two performed experiments covering the same political party
   proposals and the same personal profile of a politician demonstrate that
   the evaluation of that party and politician, if presented in different
   political contexts, depends on the politician's party affiliation and
   the voters partisanship. The results of the research lead to the
   hypotheses on political tolerance which depends on the political
   orientation of the voters and is subject to modification by the
   political object evaluated, that is, the party (a formally organized
   group) or the politician (a person).},

Abstract = {Discussion is often celebrated as a critical element of public opinion
   and political participation. Recently, scholars have suggested that the
   design and features of specific online platforms shape what is
   politically expressed online and how. Building on these findings and
   drawing on 112 semi-structured qualitative interviews with information
   technology experts and internet users, we explain how major Chinese
   social media platforms differ in structure and motivation. Drawing upon
   a nationwide representative survey and an online experiment, we find
   that platforms aiming to make users a source of information through
   public, information-centred communication, such as the Twitter-like
   Weibo, are more conducive to political expression; while platforms built
   to optimize building social connections through private, user-centred
   communication, such as WhatsApp and Facebook-like WeChat, tend to
   inhibit political expression. These technological design effects are
   stronger when users believe the authoritarian state tolerates
   discussion, but less important when political talk is sensitive. The
   findings contribute to the debate on the political consequences of the
   internet by specifying technological and political conditions.},

Abstract = {This work reassesses the central thesis of Shugart and Carey's
   Presidents and Assemblies, that weak presidencies make stronger, more
   lasting democracies. We argue that a thorough review of the literature
   that has evaluated this thesis thus far reveals a persistent
   methodological flaw that has hindered an adequate conclusion on its
   accuracy. While many scholars have revisited the role of presidential
   systems in democratic failure, comparative analyses of presidential
   systems have relied on additive, rather than combinatorial, measures of
   presidential power. We demonstrate why this produces misleading
   inferences about presidential power, and offer a novel methodology for
   its assessment. Following an investigation and replication of Shugart
   and Carey's original work that incorporates the progress of the cases
   they studied since 1992, we test our new method on their hypothesis, and
   find little support for their argument. However, our combinatorial
   approach invites future researchers to make their own theoretically
   informed arguments about the relative weight of different presidential
   powers within a methodological framework that avoids the errors of
   previous work on the topic.},

Abstract = {Ethnic power-sharing has been accused of decreasing ethnic inequality in
   unequal ways: while benefitting larger ethnic minorities, it often tends
   to overlook the smallest groups. Paradoxically, ethnic micro-minorities
   may thus find themselves in even more marginalised positions in
   power-sharing regimes than under institutional settings lacking any
   mandated inclusion. This article tests for the existence of this
   exclusion-amid-inclusion dilemma using a new group-based dataset that
   distinguishes between different types of power-sharing. The findings
   indicate that this dilemma indeed exists for ethnically based, but not
   for more liberal types of power-sharing, which increase all minorities'
   political status in an equal, albeit less strong, manner. The article
   concludes that adopting one form of power-sharing or the other means not
   only prioritising one form of equality over another, but also making a
   decision with severe political ramifications for the numerically most
   vulnerable ethnic minority communities.},

Abstract = {This article evaluates whether economic hardship affects social capital
   in Europe. Comparing 27 European countries, it evaluates the impact of
   personal experiences of economic hardship on engagement in voluntary
   associations as a cornerstone of civic and democratic life. Empirical
   analyses of the Eurobarometer data indicate that individual economic
   hardship has indeed a negative effect on associational volunteering in
   Europe. However, the result is qualified in two respects. First, it is
   found that the effect of individual economic hardship is contingent upon
   education. Second, this effect mostly refers to volunteering for
   associations providing solidarity goods (Putnam groups). These results
   have broader implications for understanding how economic hardship shapes
   the social capital within democratic societies.},

Abstract = {Volunteers are one of the most valuable resources for a political
   campaign. Little scholarly attention, however, has been dedicated to
   understanding ways to motivate a campaign volunteer. With limited time,
   campaigns strive to get the most efficient output from their volunteers.
   Working in collaboration with two mayoral candidates, four city council
   candidates, and a candidate for the State House of Representatives, the
   authors implemented four field experiments to test the effects of a
   subconscious primed goal on the performance of 158 political campaign
   volunteers. Applying the findings of prior research on the effects of
   photo primes in a call center, the authors tested achievement and
   task-oriented photo primes compared to the absence of a photo prime on
   the volunteer productivity within the context of door-to-door canvasing.
   The results indicate that the photo prime intended to instill general
   achievement statistically outperformed the absence of a photo prime,
   resulting in more address contact attempts (doors knocked), and may
   serve as a low to no cost option to maximize volunteer productivity.},

Abstract = {Scholars have suggested that civic engagement in the United States is
   declining and some have argued that institutions of higher education are
   responsible for the fostering of civic engagement through efforts such
   as service learning. These opportunities may be created either through a
   top-down approach with student assignment to specific groups and
   activities, or a more unrestricted approach allowing individual
   activities with experience reports. As an instructor of an American
   Government course, I sought to examine the effects of a
   student-directed, group approach on students? assignment evaluation.
   This article offers an approach to student civic engagement activities
   under minimal supervision. Students were offered class time, provided
   access to an online discussion forum, and instruction to utilize
   America: The Owner?s Manual (Graham 2009). Finally, students were given
   the direction to ?collectively decide on a project in the spirit of
   ?community service??. Evaluation of the learning objectives relies on
   feedback through regular progress reports, presentation of results, and
   a survey of students? evaluation of the project.},

Abstract = {This article assesses the Donald J Trump administration's pursuit of

   her party exaggerated the significance of this as they head towards an
   election in January 2020. It was uncertain, however, how lasting US
   policies might be and if the trend would continue if and when the trade

Abstract = {The article studies the reform carried out by Decree-Law 7/2018, of July
   27, to legally develop a health policy aimed at achieving a universal
   health model. The measures introduced and the objectives pursued are
   analyzed, particularly the extension of the personal scope about the
   right to health care and the harmonization of the different regional
   regulations. The difficulties to reach the foreseen objectives are
   revealed as a consequence of the inaccuracies of some precepts of the
   Decree-Law and of the possibility of interpreting restrictively some of
   the requirements established to exercise the right to health care},

Journal = {ELECTORAL STUDIES},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {61},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {The structure and dynamics of the education gap in immigration
   preferences are not well understood. Does the gap increase when the
   economy contracts? To what extent does the gap reflect labour market
   conflicts versus value polarization? Does the structure of the gap
   change with labour market and refugee shocks? I use European Social
   Survey data to decompose the gap into parts reflecting labour market
   position, social background, and value orientation, and explore how
   their importance in accounting for the gap change over time. I find no
   uniform trends in preferences or in the size of the gap, but the gap
   varies with the unemployment rate and the strength of trade unions.
   Moreover, positions in the labour market are more important for the gap
   in times of high unemployment, at the expense of the importance of value
   orientations. The results show the enduring importance of labour market
   conflicts for the gap.},

Abstract = {Historically, vouchers, which provide a sum of money to parents for
   private education, were tools of racist oppression; but in recent
   decades some advocates claim them as ``the civil rights issue of our
   time.{''} This article brings an analytic-historical perspective rooted
   in racial orders to understand how education vouchers have been
   reincarnated and reinvented since the Jim Crow era. Combining original
   primary research with statistical analysis, we identify multiple
   concurrent and consecutive transformations in voucher politics in three
   arenas of racial policy alliance contestation: expansion of color-blind
   policy designs, growing legal and political support from a conservative
   alliance, and a smorgasbord of voucher rationales rooted in color-blind
   framing. This approach demonstrates that education vouchers have never
   been racially neutral but served key roles with respect to prevailing
   racial hierarchies and contests.},

Abstract = {Civilians living in areas of rebel control have a variety of tools
   through which they may challenge rebel rule. While studies have examined
   how civilians violently resist the rule of armed groups, few have
   examined non-violent challengers. By examining instances of non-violent
   opposition to rebel rule by civilians living under rebel control in
   ``Eelam,{''} the areas of Sri Lanka controlled by the Liberation Tigers
   of Tamil Eelam, this article develops a conception of agency that
   reveals far more about the civilian/rebel relationship. Drawing on
   original interviews with key participants, we focus on two modes of
   ``oppositional agency{''} in which women and clergy non-violently
   challenged the rebel government regarding its detention and recruitment
   practices, with some success.},

Abstract = {Three themes emerge from this symposium. First, populism is largely
   shaped by (and is influencing) mainstream party political competition.
   Second, it has gained opportunities because of the economic policy
   decisions of governments regarding market reforms and liberal flows of
   labor and capital. Third, it is shaped by international forces such as
   the European Union. The symposium calls for further analyses of
   immigration, the fusion of cultural and economic threats, and what some
   call the ``illiberal international.{''}},

Abstract = {The analysis builds on previous research exploring the impact of
   far-right support on citizenship policy. Using Bayesian analyses, this
   research evaluates the impact of far-right success on citizenship policy
   restrictiveness and citizenship policy outcomes per year across 29
   European countries between 2003-2014. Results reveal that far-right
   success is a statistically and substantively significant factor in
   determining citizenship policy restrictiveness as well as rates of
   naturalization. However, differential levels of impact suggest that
   far-right influence is not uniform throughout the policy process.},

Abstract = {Donald Trump is often seen as a radical departure from the neoliberalism
   that has shaped recent American history and, at first glance, nowhere
   does this seem truer than on trade. Trump's support for protectionism
   certainly seems to depart from neoliberalism, which we are used to
   thinking of as involving unqualified support for free trade. But should
   this really be seen as a departure? This paper argues that, instead,
   Trump's trade policy should be seen a kind of `neoliberal
   protectionism', which seeks to use the coercive power of the state to
   force other nations to conform to a market-based economic logic. The
   origins of this neoliberal protectionism can be traced back to the 1980s
   when debates about foreign industrial policies first caused the United
   States to adopt a more aggressive approach to trade. From this
   perspective, Trump's trade policy represents not a rejection of
   neoliberalism but an extreme articulation of it.},

Abstract = {The product composition of bilateral trade encapsulates complex
   relationships about comparative advantage, global production networks,
   and domestic politics. Despite the availability of product-level trade
   data, most researchers rely on either the total volume of trade or
   certain sets of aggregated products. In this article, we develop a new
   dynamic clustering method to effectively summarize this massive amount
   of product-level information. The proposed method classifies a set of
   dyads into several clusters based on their similarities in trade
   profile-the product composition of imports and exports-and captures the
   evolution of the resulting clusters over time. We apply this method to
   two billion observations of product-level annual trade flows. We show
   how typical dyadic trade relationships evolve from sparse trade to
   interindustry trade and then to intra-industry trade. Finally, we
   illustrate the critical roles of our trade profile measure in
   international relations research on trade competition.},

Abstract = {Across Europe and the United States, negative party identification - an
   abiding aversion to a particular opposing political party is on the
   rise. At the same time, satisfaction with democracy is down worldwide.
   In this article, we explore the potential connection between these two
   phenomena. We develop a theory that posits a relationship between
   negative party identification and satisfaction with democracy where
   institutional structures and outcomes can mitigate the deleterious
   effects of negative party identification. We test our theory by drawing
   on data from 25 parliamentary and semi-presidential countries in the
   third wave of the Comparative Study of Electoral Systems (CSES) from
   2006-2011 to assess the cross-national effect of negative party
   identification on levels of satisfaction with the democratic process in
   one's own country. We find that satisfaction with democracy declines
   among voters in multiparty systems when an ``out-group{''} party holds
   the prime ministership. At the same time, larger vote margins and the
   nature of the governing coalition can mitigate the effects of negative
   party identification. Our findings have important implications for how
   institutions can reduce the potential effect of negative party
   identification on satisfaction with democracy.},

Abstract = {In recent years, the number of immigrants reaching the EU has grown
   dramatically. The migration crisis and its political repercussions have
   been felt with different intensity across Europe. In this critical
   situation, EU-level coordination has proved problematic due to the
   nested interests of the member states. This article addresses the
   problem of public support for an integrated EU immigration policy. Using
   data from the EUENGAGE project, we explore citizens' attitudes towards
   EU-level coordination of immigration, and we introduce a set of
   theoretical arguments that aim to explain their attitudes. We show that
   those subjects who are more frightened by immigrants and who demand
   stricter policy and greater protection from unwanted migration are
   keener to delegate policy competence to the EU in this field.},

   masculinities of the ethnic ``minority{''}, wounded masculinities of the
   ethnic ``majority{''}, and misogynistic masculinities of the everyday.
   Understanding and challenging these narratives is paramount for
   advancing social justice across many issues development NGOs and others
   prioritize-including the rights of refugees and migrants, sexual and
   reproductive freedoms, pluralism, and inclusive societies. Successfully
   challenging the far-right entails NGOs articulating core values and
   principles centered on an anti-racist feminism: one that seeks to
   abolish the social hierarchies and inequalities wrought by
   neoliberalism.},

Abstract = {A wave of legislative and regulatory crackdown on international
   nongovernmental organizations (INGOs) has constricted the legal
   environment for foreign advocacy groups interested in influencing
   domestic and global policy. Although the legal space for advocacy is
   shrinking, many INGOs have continued their work and found creative ways
   to adapt to these restrictions, sometimes even reshaping the regulatory
   environments of their target countries in their favor. In this article,
   I explore what enables INGOs to cope with and reshape their regulatory
   environments. I bridge international relations and interest group
   studies to examine the interaction between INGO resource configurations
   and institutional arrangements. I argue that the interaction between
   resources and institutions provide organizations with `programmatic
   flexibility' that enables them to adjust their strategies without
   changing their core mission. I illustrate this argument with case
   studies of Article 19 and AMERA International, and demonstrate how
   organizations with high programmatic flexibility can navigate
   regulations and shape policy in their target country, while those
   without this flexibility are shut out of policy discussions and often
   the target country itself. I conclude by exploring how the interaction
   between internal characteristics and institutional environments shapes
   and constrains the effects of interest groups in global governance.},

Abstract = {Two distinct strands of conservative Canadian economic
   nationalism-associated with the ideas of John Rae and Isaac
   Buchanan-helped to inform the country's protectionist National Policy of
   1879. These strands of nationalism were much less influenced by Listian
   ideas than was economic nationalist thought in many other countries at
   this time. This study of their content, intellectual sources and
   influence contributes empirically and analytically to debates in
   Canadian political economy and international political economy, while
   also advancing historical scholarship. The arguments also have some
   potential contemporary relevance in an age when protectionist economic
   nationalism is rising in the US and elsewhere.},

Title = {The Conditional Effectiveness of Legislative Threats: How Court Curbing
   Alters the Behavior of (Some) Supreme Court Justices},
Journal = {POLITICAL RESEARCH QUARTERLY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {72},
Number = {3},
Pages = {570-583},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {The separation-of-powers literature focuses on how the preferences of
   one branch constrain the behavior of its counterparts. Yet, in much of
   this work, scholars do not address how responsive behavior varies across
   particular members. Focusing on Court curbing legislation in Congress,
   we develop a model of heterogeneous responsiveness. Our theory
   identifies two distinct mechanisms that underpin responsiveness in
   judicial behavior, implying that the chief justice and the most moderate
   (swing) justice are more likely than their colleagues to adjust their
   behavior in response to external threats from Congress. We find that
   these two justices are significantly less likely to vote to invalidate
   legislation than their colleagues during periods of heightened Court
   curbing and provide evidence that distinct mechanisms shape their
   behaviors. In addition, we offer justice-specific evidence using a
   pre-post promotion analysis, demonstrating that Justice Rehnquist became
   responsive to Court curbing only after becoming chief justice. Our model
   highlights the micro-level underpinnings of judicial responsiveness to
   inter-institutional politics and, most broadly, speaks to the need for
   separation-of-powers models to differentiate the preferences of
   individual political actors when seeking to understand
   inter-institutional responsiveness.},

Abstract = {This paper explores the role of transnational partnerships within a
   transboundary policy problem, namely illegal, unregulated, and
   unreported (IUU) fishing. It focuses on an understudied aspect in the
   partnership literature, namely `how and why do partnerships engage in
   advocacy'? The article theorizes and empirically explores the variation
   in strategies used by transnational partnerships to shape IUU policy
   development and implementation, drawing on theories from comparative
   politics and international relations. The paper finds that transnational
   partnerships often combine inside strategies with service provision, but
   that they rarely use outside strategies, and analyzes this variation in
   strategies by looking at changes in issues complexity, institutional
   complexity, and salience for state concerning IUU fishing policy. The
   paper ends by discussing the implication of these findings in relation
   to the previous literature on interest groups in comparative politics
   and on international non-governmental organizations and transnational
   partnerships in international relations.},

Abstract = {In this article, the authors, collaboratively and based on their
   experience of related research (normative-legal activity of local
   self-government (Petryshyna, 2011), general theoretical problems of
   lawmaking and norm-making (Didych, 2018), problems of reception of
   foreign experience of reforming local self-government (Petryshyn, 2014),
   and pressing problems of decentralization reform (Hyliaka, 2015))
   investigate the features and the shortcomings of the system of
   normative-legal acts of local self-government of Ukraine. These include:
   the problems of the legal status and the nature of the modern system of
   normative legal acts of local self-government, its normative-legal
   consolidation; the issues of practical law-making by bodies and
   officials of local self-government through the prism of the heritage of
   the Soviet system of local self-government; the shortcomings in the
   reforms undertaken since independence; the ongoing decentralization and
   associated reforms as well as existing concepts and plans aimed at the
   integration of Ukraine into European legal space and the European Union
   in particular.
   The result of the study was the identification of a number of
   substantiated features of the system and general recommendations aimed
   at the improvement of the overall state of local self-government and its
   law-making activity in the context of the current and future related
   reforms in Ukraine.},

Abstract = {In this paper, the authors analyse the ambiguous political decision to
   ban the major Russian web resources from access to the Ukrainian market,
   in spite of heavy criticisms from local and foreign experts. While the
   supporters of the new internet policy claimed the new strategy to be
   coherent with cybersecurity priorities of the country, the opponents
   pointed out a set of legal and political limitations. Drawing on the
   setting and results of taking a new approach to information policy, we
   describe the fragility of Euromaidan democratic heritage and drawbacks
   of the current political regime. the logical method of legal
   interpretation has been applied to analyse the controversies of the
   current legislation on Russian internet resources restriction. The
   article concludes that Ukrainian post-Euromaidan governance model needs
   to consolidate the efforts in order to prove the commitment to freedom
   of speech as a core European value and replace spontaneous actions with
   an evidence-based approach to political decision-making.},

Abstract = {The Council of the European Union is the European Union's most powerful
   legislative body. Yet, we still have limited information about Council
   politics because of the lack of suitable data. This paper validates a
   new approach to studying Council politics entitled DICEU - Debates in
   the Council of the European Union. This approach is the first to
   leverage the public videos of Council deliberations as a data source. We
   demonstrate the face, convergent, and predictive validity of DICEU data.
   Governments' ideal points scaled from these videos yield meaningful and
   well-known conflict dimensions. Moreover, governments' positions during
   Council negotiations correlate highly with expert assessments and
   predict subsequent votes on legislative acts. We conclude that DICEU
   data provide a promising new approach to studying Council politics and
   multilevel governance.},

Title = {Power Transition Theory Revisited When Rising China Meets Dissatisfied

Journal = {CHINA QUARTERLY OF INTERNATIONAL STRATEGIC STUDIES},

Volume = {5},
Number = {3},

Abstract = {Dissatisfaction is a major concept in power transition theory, which
   postulates that a rapidly rising power tends to be dissatisfied with the
   international system and would thus attempt to reform or replace it,
   whereas the hegemonic power would, by default, be satisfied with and
   work to maintain the status quo. This paper, however, offers an
   alternative outlook on the reigning-rising power dynamics by examining
   the conditions for and implications of hegemonic dissatisfaction and
   rising power satisfaction. It argues that although China, as a potential
   systemic challenger harboring grievances against the existing global
   regimes, has been a recurrent subject for studies, it is the United
   States, the established hegemon, that appears increasingly dissatisfied
   with the status quo. The U.S. dissatisfaction is informed by a set of
   internal and external factors often justified with a reference to China
   as a challenger, and is manifested in a number of anti-system
   strategies, including unconventional diplomatic rhetoric, as well as
   withdrawal from various international institutions or attempts to
   undermine them. The U.S. discontent, as contrasted with China's
   satisfaction as a rising power, has a number of potential geopolitical
   and economic implications at the bilateral, regional, and global levels,
   endangering the viability and sustainability of the universally accepted
   political and economic regimes.},

Title = {The Recall of MPs Act 2015: Petitions, Polls and Problems},
Journal = {POLITICAL QUARTERLY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {90},

Pages = {713-718},

Abstract = {Under the terms of the Recall of MPs Act 2015, there have been three
   recall petitions brought against MPs who have committed misconduct. The
   outcomes have been variable. The first petition failed to attract enough
   signatures to trigger a by-election. The second led to the unseating of
   the MP, who declined the opportunity to stand in the subsequent
   by-election. The third led to the removal of the MP and an unsuccessful
   candidature to regain his seat at the by-election. Variation has not
   been confined to outcomes. There have been differences in how the
   legislation has been implemented-in terms of the ease of access of
   constituents to the recall petition. This article suggests that in the
   interests of fairness and transparency, there is a strong case for
   adjusting the legislation to ensure national standardisation of local
   implementation.},

Abstract = {What role do political parties play in Central Asian authoritarianism?
   Typically understood as being irrelevant, this article argues to the
   contrary that parties play an important role in the mosaic of
   authoritarian rule via the articulation of private interests. Examining
   Kazakhstan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan this study identifies two models
   of party interest articulation: a leveraging model where a party is
   utilized to protect the financial and political interests of elites; and
   a coordinating model where a party serves to integrate presidential
   assets. Neither model is uniform and party dynamics are dependent upon
   the specific nature of each personalist regime.},

Abstract = {This paper reports on a number of Eurobarometer surveys undertaken by
   the European Commission as a way of reflecting on Brexit and the
   challenges it poses to European identity. Our work with the surveys has
   been undertaken in the context of developing an educational game (RU
   EU?) which will explore European identity. European citizenship and
   identity have been strongly promoted by the EU but, while they appear to
   have been accepted at an elite level, the EU-and the UK in
   particular-have so far not constructed a narrative which has been
   supported by `ordinary' citizens. Brexit has therefore exposed the
   failings of European elites in this regard. That said, there is some
   evidence that the complexities of Brexit have led to a strengthening of
   European identity in the other EU 27 countries.},

Abstract = {When Ireland removed the prohibition on divorce from its constitution in
   1995 by way of a referendum, the result was achieved with a razor thin
   margin after a difficult campaign. The circumstances in which the 2019
   referendum on divorce took place were very different. After the hotly
   contested marriage equality and abortion referendums, a proposal to
   liberalise the divorce regime by removing the paragraph relating to the
   mandatory separation period from the constitution, and to enact
   legislation to halve that period, was uncontroversial. The amendment
   received widespread support from both the public and the political
   elite. The campaign was muted and largely overshadowed by the local and
   European elections that were taking place at the same time. On 24 May
   2019, 82 per cent of the electorate voted in favour of the Thirty-Eighth
   Amendment. This result can be seen as another step in the ongoing
   project to modernise the Irish constitution.},

Abstract = {I use new data on central and general governments for 23 OECD countries
   over the period 1960-2015 (unbalanced panel) to examine fiscal
   performance under minority governments. The results do not suggest that
   minority governments had higher fiscal deficits and public expenditure
   than majority governments-corroborating many previous studies. An
   innovation of my study is to examine fiscal policies of minority
   governments that enjoy organized support of opposition parties. The
   results do not show that minority governments that enjoy organized
   support of opposition parties increased public expenditure to a larger
   extent than majority governments. If anything, fiscal deficits were
   somewhat higher under single-party minority governments with organized
   support of opposition parties than under majority governments
   especially. Minority and majority governments had quite similar fiscal
   performance in OECD countries.},

Title = {The heterogeneous effect of diversity: Ascriptive identities, class and
   redistribution in developed democracies},
Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL RESEARCH},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {58},
Number = {3},
Pages = {820-844},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {The current consensus among comparative political scientists postulates
   that diverse democracies redistribute less than do homogeneous ones.
   However, whereas homogeneous democracies do redistribute more on
   average, diverse democracies exhibit high variation in redistributive
   outcomes. Why does ascriptive heterogeneity stifle redistribution in
   some cases but not in others? In this article, it is argued that
   diversity undermines redistributive outcomes when identity groups differ
   more starkly in their income levels. More importantly, under these
   conditions, the policy outcomes are not uniform: rather than general
   cutbacks, richer groups selectively under-prioritise benefits and access
   for poorer, minority-heavy groups while keeping their own redistributive
   interests protected. The result is not simply less redistribution
   aggregately, but a more exclusionary and regressive welfare state that
   prioritises the special needs of better-off identity groups. Empirical
   support is found in these hypotheses using macro-comparative panel data
   on multiple redistributive aspects in 22 developed democracies in the
   years 1980-2011. The article thus outlines a conditional and more
   nuanced relationship between diversity and redistributive outcomes than
   commonly assumed, as well as several broader lessons for research of
   identity politics and social policy.},

Abstract = {Lobbying presents an attractive postcongressional career, with some
   former congressional members and staffers transitioning to lucrative
   lobbying careers. Precisely why congressional experience is valued is a
   matter of ongoing debate. Building on research positing a relationship
   between political uncertainty and demand for lobbyists, we examine
   conditions under which lobbyists with past congressional experience
   prove most valuable. To assess lobbyist earnings, we develop a new
   measure, Lobbyist Value Added, that reflects the marginal contribution
   of each lobbyist on a contract, and show that previous measures
   understate the value of high-performing lobbyists. We find that former
   staffers earn revenues above their peers during times of uncertainty,
   and former members of Congress generate higher revenue overall, which we
   identify by comparing revenues generated by individuals who narrowly won
   election to those who narrowly lost. These findings help characterize
   when lobbyists with different skillsets prove most valuable and the
   value added by government experience.},

Abstract = {Can ethnically distinct communities ruled through ``traditional{''}
   assemblies provide public goods and services better, than when they are
   ruled by leaders elected through ``modern{''} multiparty elections? We
   exploit a unique institutional feature in the state of Oaxaca, Mexico,
   where municipalities are ruled by traditional governance institutions,
   to explore the effect of these forms of governance on the provision of
   public goods. Using locality-level census data, we study the provision
   of local public goods through a geographic discontinuity approach. We
   demonstrate that communities ruled by traditional governance practices
   offer more effective provision of local public goods than equally poor
   communities ruled by political parties. Relying on qualitative fieldwork
   and household surveys, we argue that the significant differences in the
   provision of public goods according to governance regime derive from
   community practices that solve collective action problems, enhance
   citizen participation in public decisions, and restrain elite capture.},

Abstract = {A key factor of semi-presidential regimes is power-sharing mechanisms
   between president and government. Influenced by Shugart and Carey's
   seminal work on premier-presidential regimes, this article addresses
   intra-executive dynamics in light of recent scholarship on the risks and
   consequences associated with conflict and cooperation between the
   president and the cabinet. Through an in-depth comparison of three
   premier-presidential systems with broadly similar constitutional
   designs, Finland, Lithuania and Romania, it forces us to reconsider how
   coordination mechanisms and political context shape presidential
   influence. Absent of a working constitutional division of labour and
   established modes of intra-executive coordination, presidents are more
   likely to use alternative channels of influence - such as the strategy
   of `going public' or direct contacts with political parties, the
   legislature or civil society stakeholders - and to intervene in
   questions falling under the competence of the government. Lack of
   institutionalized coordination also benefits the presidents as they hold
   the initiative regarding cooperation between the two executives.},

Abstract = {From 2000 to 2014, the British government engaged in a secret scheme
   aimed at allowing Republican paramilitaries `On the Run' to return to
   the United Kingdom without risk of penalty. When this scheme came into
   public view in 2013, those responsible in the British government
   justified it as `necessary' to maintaining peace following the 1998 Good
   Friday Agreement, as a failure to address IRA demands on the topic would
   have risked a return to active fighting. This research compares the
   success of the preceding Early Release Scheme in Northern Ireland with
   the experiences and potential of the On the Runs (OTR) Scheme,
   evaluating British governmental officials' testimony on the OTR Scheme
   to determine the degree to which the potential for paramilitary spoilers
   drove the development of a clandestine programme designed to encourage
   IRA support. It was the perception that these paramilitary spoilers
   would and could derail peace in Northern Ireland if their demands were
   not met that drove the OTR Scheme. As peace remains fragile, with the
   future of power-sharing due to concerns about the IRA remaining
   questionable as recently as 2015, it is obvious that the threat of
   spoilers remains a driving force of action in the region.},

Abstract = {The article is devoted to the issues of the legal regulation of the
   procedure of dispute resolution in the sphere of land use and protection
   by arbitral tribunals. The authors prove the need to adjust the Russian
   legislation on arbitral tribunals, that artificially limits their number
   and thereby prevent the access of economic activity subjects to justice.
   Particular attention is paid to the need to strengthen the legal force
   of arbitral awards on land disputes, including the consolidation of
   their right to issue writs of execution that are compulsory for the
   state registration bodies for registration of the rights to real estate
   without coming to the state courts of General Jurisdiction. The
   development of the system of arbitral tribunals and their competence
   will help to strengthen the guarantees of land and other economic rights
   of Russian entrepreneurs.},

Abstract = {The 2016 nomination of Hillary Clinton as the first female major party
   nominee for president created an unprecedented opportunity to test for
   evidence of explicit sexism in the electorate. Presidential elections
   normally produce two equally matched nominees with impressive public
   service resumes who behave similarly on the campaign trail. However,
   while Democrats were making history nominating the first female nominee,
   the Republicans also made history by selecting a nominee with no public
   service experience, a controversial personal background, and conduct
   that conflicted sharply with traditional norms of presidential
   candidates. In survey after survey, voters recognized that Clinton held
   a significant qualification advantage over Donald Trump. Yet, despite
   the fact that both men and women were more likely to rate Clinton as
   more qualified than her opponent overall, using an innovative approach
   via an original survey, we find evidence of implicit sexism in the way
   that some males evaluated Clinton compared to their female counterparts.},

Abstract = {Why is it that ruling parties with origins as rebel movements fighting
   against perceived injustices and exclusion often abandon the ideas and
   visions of state transformation that they had articulated when they were
   fighting? Using the case of the Conseil National pour la Defense de la
   Democratie-Forces pour la Defense de la Democratie (CNDD-FDD) in
   Burundi, this article shows that rather than experiencing an abrupt
   ideological change when the CNDD-FDD became a ruling party, there had
   always been ideological divergence within the movement. Over time,
   progressive ideas of inclusive state transformation were repeatedly
   sidelined in favour of a focus on resistance, and then state capture.
   Paradoxically, then, once it became a ruling party the CNDD-FDD reverted
   to governance practices that were akin to those that had led it to take
   up arms in the first place. This is not because of an absence of
   commitment to progressive ideas among some CNDD-FDD members, but because
   the internal dynamics of the CNDD-FDD meant that those factions relying
   on power politics eventually gained the upper hand over those that
   articulated a more progressive, inclusive vision, due in part to their
   ability to back their ideas with force.},

Abstract = {Reverse logistics is a new concept in the academic, business and social
   field that is usually associated or confused with green logistics,
   however there are differences not only between its definition but also
   its practice and implementation. The purpose of this paper is to analyze
   the status of both terms to determine their differences and the way both
   are consider in the science field. Bibliometrics is a methodology that
   uses statistical methods to analyze the information, as well as is
   useful for classification according to different variables. The article
   is integrated with the definition of both concepts, the description of
   the methodology used, the most cited articles, the most productive and
   most influential authors from both areas, the institutions and countries
   with the greatest participation, the quantity of articles produced
   between 2005-2019 and also a discussion with the most relevant
   conclusions of the study areas and the comparative analysis carried out.},

Title = {The partisan ties of lobbying firms},
Journal = {RESEARCH \& POLITICS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {6},
Number = {3},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {This article examines lobbying firms as intermediaries between organized
   interests and legislators in the United States. It states a partisan
   theory of legislative subsidy in which lobbying firms are institutions
   with relatively stable partisan identities. Firms generate greater
   revenues when their clients believe that firms' partisan ties are valued
   highly by members of Congress. It hypothesizes that firms that have
   partisan ties to the majority party receive greater revenues than do
   firms that do not have such ties, as well as that partisan ties with the
   House majority party lead to greater financial returns than do partisan
   ties to the Senate majority party. These hypotheses are tested using
   data available under the Lobbying Disclosure Act from 2008 to 2016.
   Panel regression analysis indicates that firms receive financial
   benefits when they have partisan ties with the majority party in the
   House but not necessarily with the Senate majority party, while
   controlling for firm-level covariates (number of clients, diversity, and
   organizational characteristics). A difference-in-differences analysis
   establishes that Democratically aligned lobbying firms experienced
   financial losses when the Republican Party reclaimed the House in 2011,
   but there were no significant differences between Republican and
   Democratic firms when the Republicans reclaimed the Senate in 2015.},

Journal = {AMERICAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE},

Volume = {63},
Number = {3},
Pages = {660-674},

Abstract = {Lobbyists frequently join forces to influence policy, yet the success of
   active lobbying coalitions remains a blind spot in the literature. This
   article is the first to test how and when characteristics of active
   coalitions increase their lobbying success. Based on pluralist theory,
   one can expect diverse coalitions, uniting different societal interests,
   to signal broad support to policy makers. Yet, their responsiveness to
   this signal (i.e., signaling benefits) and contribution incentives
   within the coalition (i.e., cooperation costs) are likely to vary with
   issue salience. This theory is tested on a unique data set comprising 50
   issues in five European countries. Results reveal a strong moderating
   effect of salience on the relationship between coalition diversity and
   success: On less salient issues, homogenous coalitions are more likely
   to succeed, whereas the effect reverses with higher salience, where
   diverse coalitions are more successful. These findings have implications
   for understanding political responsiveness and potential policy capture.},

Abstract = {Contemporary technologies facilitate democratic participation in a
   digital form. And Pirate Parties claim to represent such an empowered
   electronic democracy. Thereby this study examines whether Pirate Parties
   are actually social movements practicing and promoting electronic
   democracy. For this aim, the research applies the `real utopias'
   framework exploring desirable, viable, and achievable alternative social
   designs. In terms of methods, the inquiry is based on the analysis of
   expert interviews and political manifestos. The study revealed that
   Pirate Parties are genuine democratic initiatives, widely implementing
   principles and mechanisms of electronic democracy. Overall, the studied
   Pirate Parties foster member participation at all stages of policy
   making. Even though Pirate Parties have achieved low electoral results
   for public offices, their models of internal democratic organization and
   political ideas are proliferated by other parties.},

Abstract = {Based on an ethnographic study carried out during the 2011 and 2012
   student protests in Santiago de Chile, this article focuses on the role
   of emotions in the political engagement and radicalization of Chileans
   students from working class neighborhoods. We argue that the adoption of
   riskier tactics by youth activists during their engagement is closely
   tied to the emotional dynamics of individual actors. We therefore seek
   to understand how such emotional dynamics are constructed and organized,
   as well as how they unfold, disappear or transform during the protest
   life-cycle.},

Abstract = {This article intends to formulate a critical analysis on the judgment of
   ADPF 153 by STF, emphasizing the votes of the Minister Relator and of
   the Minister who opened the divergence. From Walter Benjamin's
   perspective of the political philosophy of memory, we sought to present
   the relevance of the narrative for the reconstruction of a past that it
   is not going to pass. With emphasis on the role of the narrator, it was
   ambitious to build a critique of the amnesty maintained in the court
   reviewed and its consequences for Brazilian contemporaneity. The present
   article sought to present a hypothesis for the diagnosis of the
   consequences of the option for broad, general and unrestricted amnesty
   and its maintenance by the Supreme Court.},

Abstract = {The objective is to determine the level of relevance and performance of
   environmental, economic and social variables, and their influence on
   corporate social responsibility (CSR) perceived by broccoli
   agro-exporters in the state of Guanajuato. It is an empirical research
   that uses the quantitative and qualitative method with correlational
   scope, using a questionnaire with 102 items to measure the variables.
   The results show that environmental, economic and social variables are
   highly relevant and present a high performance, although it is evident
   that there is only a significant and positive association between CSR
   and the environmental variable. The main limitation was the low response
   of companies to solve the instrument of inquiry. The study is relevant
   for the agro-export sector since its originality constitutes the first
   effort in characterizing CSR from this perspective. The findings of the
   gap between the performance and relevance of the variables are
   highlighted.},

Abstract = {Contemporary political discourse often presents controversial policy
   topics (e.g., public lands, climate change, and immigration) in a
   bimodal manner-either for or against. As a result, can our classrooms
   provide a space for students to learn how to construct solutions that
   broker various perspectives? For students to reconcile policy
   differences, I designed a series of debate panels across a semester. The
   focus of this article is to describe the details of the debate panels so
   they can be replicated in educational settings. Moreover, the debate
   panels embody active or experiential learning for students to become
   informed participants of US public-policy making.},

Abstract = {This article analyzes the process of water defense by the masewalmeh
   (Nahuas) that inhabit the northern highlands of the state of Puebla,
   given the threat of the imposition of new ideologies for the
   appropriation of the territory, based on technical or economic knowledge
   and, under the capitalist perspective, where nature is ``reified{''} and
   considered as a natural resource, and that when entering the market, it
   is conceived as merchandise, therefore subject to privatization
   processes, overexploitation and dispossession. The conflict arises when
   at least two perspectives are contrasted, on the one hand, the worldview
   that the masewalmeh have regarding nature and especially water, built
   from their cultural referents which provide collective identity,
   promotes social cohesion as well as the ability to organize for the
   conservation and custody of biodiversity inherent in the territories
   where they inhabit; On the other hand, the techno-bureaucratic vision,
   based on principles of efficiency and effectiveness from a perspective
   of economic profitability based on dispossession and dispossession.
   The methodological approach used for the analysis was that of ``complex
   systems{''} proposed by Rolando Garcia (2006) in conjunction with the
   theoretical approaches on the complex processes of resignification of
   what is considered the environment by social subjects and conflict of
   interests generated by the application of legal frameworks that regulate
   the use of so-called natural resources to what Arun Agrawal has called
   environmentality (2005). As a result, it was observed that, the
   territorial affiliation of the masewalmeh, as well as their shared
   norms, have guaranteed that despite the persistence of multiple
   interests on water, today the forms of management on the part of the
   communities, who have pressured the authorities to tacitly accept an
   instrument of public policy such as participatory municipal land use
   planning; This instrument has also consolidated and technically and
   administratively strengthened the local community water management
   committees.},

Abstract = {How do rebel groups turned political parties adapt their ideological
   profiles after war? Do they continue to mobilize along the main conflict
   cleavage or do they adopt new issues that are conducive to peace? This
   article develops an analytical framework that captures the extent to
   which parties adapt along two dimensions: conflict cleavage issues and
   peacebuilding issues. It conducts a qualitative content analysis of
   party manifestos and related discourse of three former rebel parties
   with backgrounds as secessionist rebel groups: the Aceh Party, the Serb
   Democratic Party (Bosnia Herzegovina) and the Tamil National Alliance.
   It finds that while some parties adopt the language of peace settlements
   to legitimize themselves and actively downplay wartime divisions, others
   continue to seek support based on ethnic differentiation. It is argued
   that the programmatic message that former rebel groups mobilize around
   has implications for how they contribute to forging more peaceful
   inter-ethnic relations after war.},

Abstract = {When citizens and local associations are involved in a
   socio-environmental conflict, on the one hand they interact with experts
   co-producing and disseminating scientific, historical and local
   knowledge building an alternative narrative of the territory, and by on
   the other side they interact in a political and social network with
   heterogeneous elements. The knowledge co-production and network creation
   ends in alliance that strongly influences the development of the
   conflict, and this network is a way to imagine how historical,
   geographical and social conditions frame a territory. In this paper I
   describe and analyze by ANT (Action Network Theory) the resistance of a
   small community in northern Italy to an extractivist project, showing
   how they achieves legitimacy, visibility and credibility in their
   struggle for the socio-environmental protection of their territory.},

Abstract = {This article begins with an understanding of social networks as an
   epistemological and theoretical position that invites reflection on the
   subjectivity of enhancing twinning. Specifically, the authors introduce
   Medellin's Network of Community Organizations, which emerges in the
   context of economic globalization and the onset of various types of
   violence in urban areas. This network is formed as a counter-hegemonic
   power and an emancipatory practice on the basis of the formation of
   politically critical subjects who mobilize and communicate in a
   different way within the struggle's framework for a decent life as a
   principle and order of action. This approach is formulated on the basis
   of social network theories, political theory and the systematization of
   experiences.},

Abstract = {Content analysis is the process of turning text into data, with either
   automated or manual techniques, and it provides a feasible and
   attractive option for undergraduate students to develop and utilize
   original data. This article presents a cohesive framework for teaching
   computerized content analysis in undergraduate political science
   courses. The article discusses examples of how we have taught the
   techniques in our own classrooms and provides a framework for a
   content-analysis research assignment. We describe coding, sources of
   text data available to students, software recommendations appropriate
   for students, and write-up issues. In the process, we also discuss
   various learning opportunities that arise from both the strengths and
   weaknesses of computerized content analysis as a methodological
   strategy.},

Abstract = {The investigation aims to study the constitutional guarantees and the
   principles of the criminal process within the framework of the
   Constitution of the Republic of Ecuador of 2008, is a descriptive
   documentary type and the analytical method is used. Constitutional
   guarantees are agile and effective mechanisms provided for the defense
   of rights, the claim to their possible restriction and obtaining
   reparation when they are in fact violated, therefore, the Constitution
   of the Republic of Ecuador regulates regulatory guarantees, guarantees
   jurisdictional policies and guarantees. The principles are the supports
   on which the structure of the legal system rises, characterized by its
   ambiguity, generality and abstraction, the principles of the criminal
   process are regulated in article 5 of the Organic Integral Criminal
   Code. The normative guarantees are related to the principles of the
   criminal process, especially with the principle of legality, which
   implies the normativity as the essence of its existence; political
   guarantees are related to the principles of criminal proceedings in a
   general area; and, jurisdictional guarantees are related to the
   principles of criminal proceedings, since many of these are present in
   the procedural process of the actions covered by said guarantees.},

Abstract = {The recent success of populist candidates in the UK and Continental
   Europe has sparked a major debate between those who view populism as a
   reaction of the economically `left behind' and those who view it as a
   cultural `backlash' by groups with declining social status, pointing to
   stark divisions between urban and rural areas, core and periphery. This
   paper bridges the economic and values-based approaches to populism by
   arguing that the geography of wealth inequality offers a convincing
   explanation for the pattern of populist vote share. Drawing on
   fine-grained house price data in the UK and France, it is shown that the
   pattern of house prices - even within small districts - plays a major
   part in shaping support for Brexit and Marine Le Pen. The findings
   illustrate how longstanding variation in local wealth shapes the
   geography of discontent and drives populist appeal. Populism, the
   article concludes, is primarily a politics of place, and place is a
   product, in part, of the housing market.},

Abstract = {This conjoint study investigates the type of mandate a referendum
   confers in the political decision-making process. While a majority of
   citizens in general believe that the government should follow the
   results of a referendum on European Union membership, its perceived
   legitimacy in the eyes of the public heavily depends upon the level of
   turnout, the size of the majority, and the outcome of the specific
   referendum in question. Thus, whether a referendum legitimizes a
   political decision in the eyes of the public is conditional upon these
   three dimensions.},

Abstract = {The last thirty years in Costa Rica had been marked by an important
   contradiction in the aspect of justice administration. Even though the
   axiological bases of the Ministry of Justice and Peace -institution in
   charge of the prisons in the country-were raised in the human rights
   normative and the progressive penalty system, these values have been
   systematically contradicted due to the emphatic punitive legislation,
   which has caused the country to stand out in the last years among the
   five Latin American countries with the higher rate of imprisonment. This
   notable paradox propitiated a broad debate. Between 2015 and 2018, some
   measures were implemented to mitigate the condition of
   hyperincarceration, like the extraordinary transfers to the
   semi-institutional (or semi open) model. Such measures were perceived by
   the public opinion from a moral panic reaction and a vindication of the
   punishment. This paper recovers that controversy, as a field of analysis
   suggestive of complex aspects such as the very conception of the State,
   punishment and justice.},

Abstract = {This article analyzes Justice Anthony M. Kennedy's commitment to
   protecting state sovereignty. In contrast to scholars who view Kennedy's
   behavior as merely pragmatic or centrist, this article focuses on
   principles and tensions underlying his liberty-based approach to
   federalism. From his early career in Sacramento through three decades on
   the U.S. Supreme Court, Kennedy sought to restore a federalism he
   considered essential to personal and political liberty but increasingly
   ``endangered.'' His opinions extended beyond the constitutional text to
   protect traditional areas of state concern, state treasuries, and local
   political decision making against increasing federal control. However,
   Kennedy subordinated state sovereignty when it interfered with the
   federal government's direct relationship to citizens, promoted economic
   protectionism, and violated his expansive conceptions of constitutional
   liberty and human dignity. The article concludes by situating Kennedy's
   distinctive conception of federalism within the larger Rehnquist and
   Roberts Courts.},

Abstract = {Studies of public contentious action in response to mineral resource
   extraction have rarely employed quantitative methods. In a highly
   disaggregated statistical analysis we examine local protest dynamics in
   Bolivia and argue for a political conditioning of the so-called resource
   curse. We find that mineral gas resources spark disputes over both
   extraction and rent redistribution at the local level, and that this
   relationship is especially pronounced where the population has highly
   heterogenous political values and interests. In contrast, where the
   population is relatively united in their political views, significantly
   fewer protests occur.},

Abstract = {In an increasing number of jurisdictions, gender mainstreaming
   approaches have been supplemented with attention to other equality
   areas, including race and disability. The UK is among the most advanced
   countries in mainstreaming `equality', with nine equality areas
   protected in law and a joined-up equality infrastructure. Among the
   nations of the UK there are, however, important distinctions in
   implementation of the law. In this article, we present findings of cross
   sectoral qualitative research (with academic, public and third sectors)
   aimed at understanding the progress of equality mainstreaming in the UK
   some years on from the implementation of the Equality Act 2010, with a
   specific focus on the devolved administrations of Northern Ireland,
   Scotland and Wales. We identify areas of progress as well as barriers to
   change and proposed solutions for the future.},

Abstract = {It is commonplace to equate the arrival of a new conservative
   administration in Washington, DC, with the rolling back of the federal
   activities. We disagree with this conventional perspective, and seek to
   demonstrate that the equation of conservative Republicanism and
   retrenchment elides a critical change in the relationship between party
   politics and State powera relationship that Donald Trump seems
   determined to nurture. Drawing on primary research, we argue that
   partisanship in the United States is no longer a struggle over the size
   of the State; rather it is a contest to control national administrative
   power. Since the late 1960s, conservative administrations have sought to
   redeploy rather than dismantle or roll back state power. Through
   redeployment, conservative presidents have sustained previous levels of
   State spending or State activity, but in a way reflecting a new
   administration's ideology.},

Abstract = {All India United Democratic Front (AIUDF) was formed in 2005 as Assam
   United Democratic Front (AUDF). It represents Muslim politics in
   contemporary Assam. In the 2006 and 2011 Assam Assembly elections (AAE),
   AIUDF showed continuous success, though it could not gain substantially
   in the communally polarized 2016 Assembly elections. With this backdrop,
   the present article is an attempt to understand contemporary Muslim
   politics in Assam through AIUDF. It argues that AIUDF was an attempt by
   a group of Muslim leaders in Assam, mainly from Jamiat Ulema-e-Hind
   (Jamiat), to share power in the name of Muslims and the party was made
   relevant in Assam politics by Congress through its soft Hindutva
   politics. It also argues that increasing dominance of AIUDF in Assam
   elections created ground for the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) to grow
   and to form government in 2016.},

Title = {Medicaid Expansion during the Trump Presidency: The Role of Executive
   Waivers, State Ballot Measures, and Attorney General Lawsuits in Shaping
   Intergovernmental Relations},

Abstract = {This article assesses developments in the first two years of the Trump
   presidency regarding implementation of the Affordable Care Act (ACA),
   with a focus on Medicaid policy. Trump administration officials relied
   on executive actions to chip away at various elements of the ACA and
   encouraged and granted state requests for waivers allowing
   work-requirements and other personal-responsibility rules for Medicaid
   beneficiaries. Governors and state attorneys general were actively
   involved in lawsuits that led to several federal court rulings blocking
   implementation of Medicaid work requirements as well as a ruling that
   re-opened the legitimacy of the entire ACA. Citizens and interest groups
   had a major impact at the ballot box by approving several ballot
   measures that expanded Medicaid in states where expansion was opposed by
   elected officials. These developments demonstrate how policy adjustments
   and disputes are worked out in the U.S. federal system in a polarized
   era, with Congress essentially a bystander and other institutions and
   actors coming to the fore and resulting in variable speed federalism
   characterized by different partisan trajectories of state implementation
   of national policies.},

Abstract = {Since the beginning of the Great Recession, the issue of European
   integration has become increasingly salient in many European polities.
   The European left has adopted a different stance toward European
   integration, both in terms of economic and welfare-state integration. On
   the one hand, radical left parties (RLPs) have always opposed a process
   of integration dominated by neoliberal logic; on the other hand, the
   social democratic parties (SDPs) have appeared as one of the main pro-EU
   party families, identifying the EU as a privileged space in which to
   promote the building of a European social model. In this paper, we
   propose a binary comparison between RLPs and SDPs in Italy and Spain
   with a qualitative content analysis methodology. Our results show that
   albeit the crisis brought SDPs closer to a Eurocritical stance vis-a-vis
   the social-Europe, this dimension along with the political integration
   are still dividing issues for the RLPs and SDPs families.},

Abstract = {Studies of parliamentary systems contend that backbench legislators are
   increasingly marginalized, with power being centralized in the
   executive. However, such research typically focuses on national
   legislatures, ignoring subnational jurisdictions. We extend this
   literature by exploring the process of ``executive creep{''} in Canada's
   provinces; namely the tendency of executives to erode legislative
   independence by appointing backbenchers to quasi-executive positions or
   cabinet committees. We examine executive creep in all provinces since
   1968, finding a clear trend towards the increased incorporation of
   backbenchers into the work of the executive. Moreover, these changes
   serve to strengthen the power of first ministers relative to their
   cabinets.},

Abstract = {Turkey is conducting an increasingly active energy diplomacy and in
   order to understand the role and strategies of Ankara in energy
   geopolitics, it is important to apprehend Turkey's behaviours at
   international level. In this respect, Turkey's energy ties with
   international (energy) organizations have key importance. Hence, this
   paper seeks to analyze the energy relationship between Ankara and the
   BSEC. Turkey attends activities of the organization in order to increase
   its visibility at international level, become a leader in the Black Sea
   region, and boost its political and economic ties with member states.
   However, due to the limited effectiveness of the organization in general
   and in the field of energy in particular, its contribution to the
   Turkish energy sector has remained modest.},

Abstract = {In this article, we use legislative correspondence to determine who
   gains access to key staffers in a congressional office. To evaluate our
   theory of the office power hierarchy, we test hypotheses using an
   original dataset of more than 3,000 correspondence records from the
   office of former member of Congress James R. Jones. Our empirical
   analysis is supplemented by an e-mail interview with Representative
   Jones. We find that key senior staffers are more likely to pay attention
   to powerful individuals and nonroutine matters. Letters from women and
   families and those dealing with routine legislation are more likely to
   be answered by lower-ranked staffers. These results are important
   because they reveal that even something as simple as constituent
   correspondence enters a type of power hierarchy within the legislative
   branch where some individuals are advantaged over others.},

Abstract = {Construction of Turkmenistan's East-West (EW) gas pipeline was completed
   in December 2015 when signs of the country's severe economic decline
   were becoming increasingly evident. This paper examines whether the EW
   pipeline can play any role in reversing this decline. To do this, it
   analyzes the feasibility of the four possible export options for
   Turkmenistan to utilize the pipeline: west, south, north, and east. This
   analysis demonstrates each option's infeasibility and associated
   problems. Based on this analysis, the paper concludes that the EW
   pipeline will be severely underutilized and thus contribute little to
   reversing Turkmenistan's economic decline.},

Abstract = {Most of the recent work on freedom is concerned with the
   liberal-republican debate. The latest move in this debate has been made
   by List and Valentini who argue in favor of a conception of freedom
   (called ``freedom as independence{''}) that is located midway between
   the liberal and republican conceptions. In this article, we review some
   key aspects of the debate that led to List and Valentini's move and then
   argue that their midway position is untenable. We first show how the
   debate has given rise to List and Valentini's (republican-inspired) view
   that unfreedom is created not merely by more or less probable
   constraints (as liberals have claimed) but by the sheer possibility of
   constraints. We then argue that this position on possible-but-improbable
   constraints makes unfreedom ubiquitous and that ``freedom as
   independence{''} is therefore an impossible ideal. In the course of our
   argument, we rebut some possible rejoinders that appeal to the
   difference between positive normative and non-normative constraints and
   to the ways in which ``freedom as independence{''} is an open and
   versatile concept.},

Title = {Family Ties? The Limits of Fathering Daughters on Congressional Behavior},
Journal = {AMERICAN POLITICS RESEARCH},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {47},
Number = {3},
Pages = {471-493},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Scholars have long suggested that familial life can affect political
   behavior and, more recently, have found that fathering daughters leads
   men to adopt more liberal positions on gender equality policies.
   However, few have focused on the impact of fathering a daughter on
   congressional behavior, particularly in an era of heightened partisan
   polarization. Using an original data set of familial information, we
   examine whether fathering a daughter influences male legislators' (a)
   roll call and cosponsorship support for women's issues in the 110th to
   114th Congresses and (b) cosponsorship of bills introduced by female
   legislators in the 110th Congress. We find that once party affiliation
   is taken into account, having a daughter neither predicts support for
   women's issues nor cosponsorship of bills sponsored by women. Our
   findings suggest there are limits to the direct effects of parenting
   daughters on men's political behavior, and that scholars should remain
   attentive to institutional and partisan contexts.},

Abstract = {The Great Recession is a non-trivial test bed for the theory of economic
   voting, especially if its predictions are decomposed at the party level,
   as done in this article by analysing the electoral performances of
   parties competing in 89 national elections held in the 28 member states
   of the EU between 2003 and 2015. We acknowledge counterintuitively that
   prime ministers' parties are able to exploit the relatively good state
   of the economy, while sharing the blame with their allies in times of
   crisis, counting on the lack of clarity in the attribution of
   responsibilities and deploying their heresthetic capacities. We further
   recognize that new parties, more than opposition ones, proportionally
   profited from the recession. Tough times magnify the alternation between
   left- and right-wing victories, without necessarily favouring the most
   radical parties, whereas the EU's supposed responsibility in prolonging
   the crisis fuelled the success of Eurosceptic parties.},

Abstract = {During past decades, the EU has responded to a variety of `crises' by
   promoting a common cultural heritage to advance European identity and
   belonging. This article analyses identity politics conducted in the
   framework of the EU's flagship heritage action, the European Heritage
   Label. I borrow from `banal nationalism' to scrutinise the usage of `we'
   and `us' in the promotional videos of the European Heritage Label sites
   as subject positions offered for identification in this heritage
   discourse. Analysis shows that the subject positions are constituted by
   an emphasis on the national level, preservation of the past for future
   generations and the key role of experts in the process of heritage.
   Although the heritage agents talk about Europe (representation) they do
   not identify with that as `us'. By making the lack of `banal
   Europeanness' in the videos visible the article shows the ambiguities of
   European identity politics.},

Abstract = {It is widely believed that the extension of protection against
   employment discrimination to women through Title VII of the Civil Rights
   Act (CRA) was a fluke, the product of an attempted ``killer
   amendment{''} by civil rights opponents gone awry. My analysis
   challenges this conventional wisdom, showing that the coalition of
   Republicans and southern Democrats in support of the sex amendment to
   Title VII was consistent with broader patterns of support for the Equal
   Rights Amendment (ERA) in the early to mid-20th century. In other words,
   support appears to have been sincere, not sophisticated-proponents
   preferred a CRA with the sex amendment to one without. I proceed to show
   that concern about the direct impact on women, and not simply the
   instrumental impact on labor, played an important role in motivating
   this support. But, I also find reason for caution in interpreting
   support for workplace rights as evidence of broad support for women's
   rights at this time.},

Abstract = {In recent years, political thought has taken a certain turn, at times
   referred as the ``ontological turn{''} that differentiates between
   politics and the political. The question of political ontology has been
   developed by numerous authors, who have distinguished between an ontic
   politics and the ontology of the political (relative to the totality of
   the social field, but not only to its particular practice). This
   differentiation (which in French is given by the difference between la
   politique and le politique) goes back to the article Paul Ricoeur's
   ``The political paradox{''}, and it has emerged strongly in thinkers,
   such as Jean-Francois Lyotard, Claude Lefort, Alain Badiou, Jacob
   Rogozinski, Jacques Ranciere and Etienne Balibar in the Eighties.},

Journal = {DEMOCRATIZATION},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {26},
Number = {3},

Abstract = {Using a new measure of ``comprehensive democracy,{''} our analysis
   traces the global democratic trend over the last 116 years, from 1900
   until 2016, looking in particular at the centennial trend's cultural
   zoning. As it turns out, democracy has been proceeding and continues to
   differentiate the world's nations in a strongly culture-bound manner:
   high levels of democracy remain a distinctive feature of nations in
   which emancipative values have grown strong over the generations. By the
   same token, backsliding and autocratization are limited to cultures with
   under-developed emancipative values. In line with this finding, public
   support for democracy neither favours democratization, nor does it
   prevent autocratization in disjunction from emancipative values. On the
   contrary, public support for democracy shows such pro-democratic effects
   if - and only if - it co-exists in close association with emancipative
   values. The reason is that - in disconnect from emancipative values -
   support for democracy frequently reverts its meaning, indicating the
   exact opposite of what intuition suggests: namely, support for
   autocracy. In conclusion, the prospects for democracy are bleak where
   emancipative values remain weak.},

Abstract = {I argue here that even sympathetic representations of obesity as a
   pathology most prevalent among black and Latina/o women and children can
   help reproduce racial injustice. At a time when fatness is deeply
   stigmatizing, fat bodies denote civic unfitness, and high white obesity
   rates jeopardize whiteness, raced and gendered obesity discourses
   effectively reify white superiority and maintain white dominance. They
   function as a racial project in two ways. First, they fortify white
   normativity by associating nonwhiteness with fatness and pathology and
   by exalting white consumption practices. Second, because they unfold in
   a political context pervaded by welfare-queen imagery, these discourses
   forge a new public identity of black womanhood, the obese black woman,
   which revives tropes of black women as insatiable, lazy bad mothers who
   deplete the state and economy. This imagery invites and justifies
   discriminatory and exclusionary practices that sustain structural racial
   inequality. To combat rather than reproduce racial inequality,
   anti-racist anti-obesity discourses must expose obesity as an embodiment
   of structural racism and promote structural transformation.},

Abstract = {A large literature shows that survey mode and survey technologies
   significantly affect item non-response and response distributions. Yet
   as researchers increasingly conduct surveys in the developing world,
   little attention has been devoted to understanding how new
   technologies-such as the use of electronic devices in face-to-face
   interviews-produce bias there. We hypothesize that using electronic
   devices instead of pen and paper can affect survey behavior via two
   pathways: a wealth effect and a surveillance effect. To test the
   hypotheses, we use data from a two-wave panel survey fielded in Tunisia.
   We investigate whether responses collected in Wave 1 with pen and paper
   changed when some individuals were interviewed in Wave 2 by interviewers
   using tablet computers. Consistent with the wealth effect hypothesis,
   more than half of the lowest income respondents reported a higher income
   in the second wave when interviewers used tablets. Conversely, we find
   little evidence that concerns about surveillance changed survey
   behavior.},

Abstract = {Partisan affiliation of ministers is a key analytical dimension in the
   study of government, cabinets being an integral aspect of the most basic
   categorizations of the literature. Here we argue that the most
   widespread operational criterion for dealing with the phenomenon, valid
   for a large part of consolidated parliamentary democracies, may prove
   inefficient and inadequate for systems with strong heads of government
   and fluid political organizations like the Latin American presidential
   regimes. The article identifies four operational challenges associated
   with the standard modality of codifying partisan ministers; proposes a
   methodological strategy to account for them, and discusses their
   practical application with an exploratory analysis of the Argentine

Abstract = {We use a field experiment to evaluate the impact of two informational
   get-out-the-vote campaigns to boost female electoral participation in
   rural areas of Paraguay. We find that public rallies had a small and
   insignificant effect either on registration or voter turnout in the 2013
   presidential elections. Households that received door-to-door canvassing
   treatment were 4.6 percentage points more likely to vote. Experimental
   variation on the intensity of the treatment at the locality level allows
   us to estimate spillover effects, which are present in localities that
   are geographically more concentrated, which may favor social
   interactions and diffusion of information. Reinforcement effects on the
   already treated population are twice as large as diffusion effects on
   the untreated. Our results underscore the importance of taking into
   account urbanization patterns when designing informational campaigns.},

Abstract = {Existing research often suggests that a greater degree of internal
   democracy within parties could weaken party unity. This article tests
   this assumption and analyses the relationship between degrees of
   intra-party democracy (IPD) and legislators' attitudes towards party
   unity. The article uses data collected in the framework of the PartiRep
   Comparative MP Survey; and of the Political Party Database (PPDB). The
   study includes 796 parliamentarians in 45 parties, elected in 14
   European national assemblies. The findings indicate that the legislators
   from more democratic party organizations tend to report more frequent
   disagreement and to assert their own opinions against the one of their
   parties.},

Abstract = {Partnerships are now essential to public service delivery. However, due
   to the limitations in collaborative capacity, there are both obstacles
   and motivators for forming partnerships. Intergovernmental and
   cross-sectoral partnerships offer different advantages and disadvantages
   in extending public service missions in new directions. Using survey
   data of local air quality agencies, findings determine different factors
   contribute to partnership and nonpartnership. Further findings suggest
   partnerships are driven largely by problem severity, but nonpartnership
   is driven by specific benefits and risks associated with types of
   partners. Conclusions indicate that understanding nonpartnership is a
   key to understanding partnership formation.},

Abstract = {This article lays out a framework for integrating identifications into
   securitization theory in order to specifically and systematically
   illuminate the role that identifications play in determining
   securitization success and in delimiting effective securitization
   rhetoric. I outline the framework, its theoretical backing as derived
   from cognitive, identity, and discourse studies, its potential use, and
   some empirical findings emerging from its current application. The
   framework holds that identifications consistently affect audience
   receptivity to securitization rhetoric, but only in certain
   circumstances (namely, when identifications are strong and thick) does
   their precise content restrict the parameters and performative power of
   effective securitization rhetoric. The framework draws insights from the
   fields of cognitive science, social psychology, and identity studies,
   and it emphasises a context-specific approach to securitization studies
   that inquires into, rather than assumes, local situations. As such, the
   article aims to inform securitization scholars engaged in a range of
   studies of how they can incorporate local audiences into their work
   without imposing a universalist logic of security onto disparate
   circumstances.},

Title = {Misleading ballot position cue: Party voting in Korea's nonpartisan
   local elections},
Journal = {ELECTORAL STUDIES},

Abstract = {In this study, I present evidence that ballot order can provide a
   misleading cue to voters. In South Korea, nonpartisan municipal
   legislative elections were held concurrently with other partisan local
   elections until 2002. The ballot order of the candidates running in
   nonpartisan elections was randomly determined, whereas it was determined
   according to a party's number of seats in the national legislature for
   candidates running in partisan elections. Therefore, if voters are fully
   informed, the vote share for the candidate listed first in the
   nonpartisan ballot should not be correlated with the vote share for the
   party listed first on the partisan ballot. However, I find that the vote
   share for a first-listed candidate increases when the first-listed
   party's vote share increases. I also find that the presence of an
   incumbent does not significantly reduce the degree to which voters
   mistakenly use ballot position as a party cue.},

Title = {The Erosion of German Elite Trust in the United States of America},
Journal = {GERMAN POLITICS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {28},
Number = {4},
Pages = {521-540},
Abstract = {In this article, I address two salient issues in IR trust research:
   first, I introduce a longitudinal, content analysis to measure foreign
   policy trust. Second, I provide an in-depth analysis of how recent
   crises affected German political elites' trust of the United States. I
   begin with a brief conceptual sketch of foreign policy trust and argue
   that treating it as a trusting discourse is a useful way to bridge the
   micro-macro gap. Next, I introduce a content analysis to measure trust,
   present coding rules and discuss advantages and problems of the
   approach. The empirical section consists of data generated from coding
   German Bundestag speeches and newspaper op-eds from 2000 through 2014.
   By disaggregating the data to specify who trusts whom and regarding
   which issues, I propose the following: First, there is a significant
   decline in trust among the traditionally pro-American German
   center-right politicians. Second, there is a steady decline in trust in
   the United States as a state entity, as opposed to strongly fluctuating
   trust in different U.S. presidents. Third, the NSA crisis directly
   affected German elites' trust in the bilateral security partnership, an
   area where trust was stable even during the Bush presidency.},

Abstract = {We refute S. Rendon's recent criticism of the 2003 Peruvian Truth and
   Reconciliation Commission (TRC) conflict mortality study. We first show
   that his most important result, an alternative estimate of the mortality
   due to the Maoist guerrillas of Shining Path (Sendero Luminoso), is
   lower than existing observed data and is therefore impossible. We then
   analyze his statistical approach and find that it is affected by a
   subtle form of selection bias. We contrast his approach to the TRC's
   using tools from statistical decision theory, and determine that his
   method is inadequate for this problem-and that the TRC's approach is, at
   minimum, better. Without advocating for the TRC's original results, we
   conclude that Rendon's approach and methods are inferior to the TRC's
   original work.},

Abstract = {Politicians are always seeking popularity, and they use several tools to
   try to influence their approval rate. We investigate the dynamic
   relationship between French executive politicians' approval rates and
   three types of legislative acts (laws, ordonnances, and decrees) that
   they can use to signal their policy stance. Given the persistent debate
   over causality between public opinion and policy, our results show that
   a strong President (in terms of popularity) can rely more on ordonnances
   without damaging his/her popularity. Moreover, the use of ordonnances
   also benefits the Prime Minister's popularity. Decrees are more
   beneficial to the Prime Minister than to the President. In terms of the
   agenda, if there is a honeymoon effect, legislative activism does
   nothing to prevent the fall in popularity at the end of a mandate. A
   winning strategy is thus to `wait and see.' The results are robust to
   the inclusion of economic performance indicators, political and
   institutional factors.},

Abstract = {Estimates of party ideological positions in Western Democracies yield
   useful party-level information, but generally lack the ability to
   provide an insight into the intraparty politics of party elites. In this
   article, we generate comparable measures of latent individual policy
   positions from elite survey data that enable analysis of elite-level
   party ideology and heterogeneity. This approach has some advantages over
   both expert surveys and approaches based on behavioral data, such as
   roll-call voting, and is directly relevant to the study of party
   cohesion. We generate a measure of elite positions for several mostly
   European countries using a common space scaling approach and demonstrate
   its validity as a measure of party ideology. We then apply these data to
   examine sources of party elite heterogeneity, focusing on the role of
   intraparty competition in electoral systems, nomination rules, and party
   goals. We find that policy-seeking parties and centralized party
   nomination rules are associated with less party heterogeneity. While
   intraparty competition has no effect, such contexts appear to condition
   the effect of district magnitude.},

Title = {A Bibliographic Survey on State-Minority Contestations in Post-Colonial

Abstract = {There is an extensive body of literature that delves deeply into the
   question of how a state is constituted, by examining it from various
   theoretical and empirical perspectives. Scholars engaged in the field of
   political science, as well as in other fields such as the social
   sciences, are constantly endeavouring to explain the myriad ways in
   which states are formed in different regions of the world. According to
   one set of academics, the social setup that prevailed in most of the
   post-colonial states of Asia, Africa, and Latin America was mainly due
   to the plurality of their multi-ethnic, multi-linguistic, and
   multi-cultural populations. This plurality had a profound effect on the
   way the state was formed. A significant volume of literature on Sri
   Lanka too is available, much of which approaches the question of state
   formation and reconstitution from the standpoint of ethnicity and
   nationalism. This survey reviews both the theoretical and empirical
   literature on state constitution/formation and pays special attention to
   three main themes; viz. theories on state constitution (formation),
   research on post-colonial state formation, and studies about Sri Lankan
   politics. The state-in-society theory is studied with focus on the
   crucial question of how state and society transform and constitute one
   another. This is a qualitative study based on text analysis. A wide
   selection of existing literature was reviewed. This survey shows that
   there is a paucity of research work on post-colonial state formation in

Abstract = {Since 2006, according to the Northern Ireland Life and Times Survey, the
   largest portion of people in Northern Ireland identify themselves not as
   Unionist nor Nationalist but as Neither. This fact is difficult to tally
   with the patterns of polarised election results and the narratives of a
   `culture war' that dominate most analyses of contemporary Northern
   Ireland. This article examines the existence of this large portion of
   the population in Northern Ireland who reject the identities upon which
   the 1998 Good Friday (Belfast) Agreement is centred. We find that those
   identifying as neither Unionist nor Nationalist are predominantly
   female, they come from all religious backgrounds, all age groups, and
   both British and Irish national identities. The majority of those who
   identify as Neither appear to do so as a statement of rejection of what
   is on offer from the political parties in Northern Ireland; rather than
   supporting a centrist party, they support no party at all. The article
   concludes that the 1998 Agreement has created the conditions for a
   growing number of people to identify as neither Unionist nor
   Nationalist, but at the same time it makes the emergence of any strong
   alternative, `third way' type of politics difficult to envisage.},

Abstract = {Under the Justice and Development Party (AKP) led by its leader Recep
   Tayyip Erdoan, the Turkish State and society at large have been subject
   to significant changes. Besides the recent increasing authoritarianism
   of the government, Islam made its way through politics like never
   before, and a new national ideology promoted by the AKP, Turkish Muslim
   Nationalism, laid the cultural foundations for a new Turkey and new
   Turks. In this paper, I put forward the claim that new national museums
   play a relevant role in shaping this new Turkey. In particular, they
   function as performative cabinets exhibiting the national ideology of
   the ruling party. I have looked into one of these museums, the Istanbul
   Museum of the Science and Technology in Islam, researching the links
   between the AKP, which promotes Turkish Muslim nationalism, and new
   museums, which exhibit it. The outcome of this study suggests that the
   IMSTI functioned as the resource and the host of national symbols
   manufactured by and within the ruling class to be supplied to the
   masses. The political class, represented here by the AKP, commissioned
   the museum, whereas cultural agents that shared the party's political
   ideology were appointed to make it. This collaboration benefited both
   parts, so much so that profit seems to have been a crucial ingredient in
   the making of this museum.},

Abstract = {Veto threats may offer presidents bargaining leverage, but such leverage
   will be diminished if they and those with whom they transact business
   view a veto as hurting the president's approval rating and his party's
   prospects in the next election. How concerned must presidents be about
   the audience costs associated with a veto? Political science research
   suggests that they should be in that the public does not like vetoes and
   punishes presidents when they exercise this authority. In this article,
   we test this argument with survey responses during times after
   presidents have issued a veto threat but before an actual veto. While,
   on average, respondents register opposition to a veto, this preference
   varies greatly with the specific policy in question and with
   respondents' party identification and presidential approval. The results
   suggest that opposition to a veto comes disproportionately, may be
   limited to politically distant respondents, and thus may not be as
   costly as the net negative numbers suggest.},

Abstract = {What impact do local candidates have on elections in single member
   district plurality electoral systems? We provide new evidence using data
   from a large election study carried out during the 2015 Canadian federal
   election. We improve on the measurement of local candidate effects by
   asking over 20,000 survey respondents to rate the candidates in their
   constituency directly. We present three estimates. We find that when all
   voters are considered together, local candidate evaluations are decisive
   for approximately 4 per cent of voters. Second, these evaluations are
   decisive for the outcome of 10 per cent of constituency contests. Third,
   when models are estimated for each constituency, we find significant
   evaluation effects for 14 per cent of candidates.},

Abstract = {Recently Tessman and Wolfe (International Studies Review 13:214-240,
   2011) and Tessman (Security Studies 21(2):192-231, 2012) introduced the
   concept of strategic hedging as a core strategy for second-tier states
   operating in the current deconcentrating unipolar system with the United
   States as system leader. Being a crucial element in understanding the
   connection between strategic hedging intentions and actual actions, this
   article investigates the measurement of strategic hedging capabilities
   of second-tier states. Building on earlier research of Geeraerts and
   Salman (Chinese Political Science Review 1(1):60-80, 2016) on the
   measurement of strategic hedging capabilities, we improve significantly
   the measurement methodology, which often leads to quite different
   results in strategic hedging capabilities. Using the new approach, we
   investigate how the strategic hedging capabilities of the leading eleven
   second-tier states have evolved over the period 2005-2015, extending the
   comparative analysis performed by Geeraerts and Salman for the year
   2013.},

Abstract = {Evidence on whether there is a gender affinity effect in US elections is
   mixed. In this article, we develop a theory of when gender affinity
   effects will be present and when they will be absent. Crucial to our
   theory is electoral context. In nonpartisan contexts, we argue that
   candidate sex serves as a representational cue and will lead to gender
   affinity effects in vote choice. However, in partisan contexts, all
   voters will use partisanship as a cue and there will be no evidence of
   gender affinity effects. We test and find support for our theory using
   data on vote choice in the 2012 U.S. state supreme court elections and a
   set of conjoint experiments. Our results have implications for theories
   of descriptive representation and the design of electoral institutions.},

Abstract = {Are people conservative (liberal) because they are Republicans
   (Democrats)? Or is it the reverse: people are Republicans (Democrats)
   because they are conservatives (liberals)? Though much has been said
   about this long-standing question, it is difficult to test because the
   concepts are nearly impossible to disentangle in modern America.
   Ideology and partisanship are highly correlated, only growing more so
   over time. However, the election of President Trump presents a unique
   opportunity to disentangle party attachment from ideological commitment.
   Using a research design that employs actual ``conservative{''} and
   ``liberal{''} policy statements from President Trump, we find that
   low-knowledge respondents, strong Republicans, Trump-approving
   respondents, and self-described conservatives are the most likely to
   behave like party loyalists by accepting the Trump cue-in either a
   liberal or conservative direction. These results suggest that there are
   a large number of party loyalists in the United States, that their
   claims to being a self-defined conservative are suspect, and that group
   loyalty is the stronger motivator of opinion than are any ideological
   principles.},

Abstract = {Relatively little is known about how voters behave under dual ballot
   voting systems. Do voters follow different decision rules at each
   ballot? Do they weigh relevant considerations differently on the second
   ballot, as compared to the first ballot? Does political sophistication
   condition the way people vote on the first and second ballots? Using
   survey data from five French presidential elections, we examine these
   questions and find that voters in France do indeed treat first and
   second ballots differently. More precisely, we find that both
   partisanship and ideology matter more on the second ballot.
   Demographics, socioeconomic status, and political issues, on the other
   hand, weigh more heavily in the first round. Political sophistication,
   for its part, does not condition nor reinforce these effects.},

Journal = {ELECTORAL STUDIES},

Volume = {57},

Abstract = {During a vote-decision process, citizens elect between some of the
   parties not all of them. In this paper, we explore a potential strategic
   reason to include an additional alternative in the consideration set.
   Drawing on research from the field of strategic voting, we study
   incentives to defect to a party at risk of falling below an electoral
   threshold in order to elect a winning coalition ({''}insurance{''}). Our
   argument is that these types of strategic considerations occur already
   in the campaign, but do not always translate into choice. Using the
   so-called consideration set model approach (CSM), which focuses on how
   voters select fewer alternatives among a larger number of parties, we
   model vote choice over an election campaign using panel data from the
   Swedish National Election Studies of 2014. In line with our argument, we
   demonstrate that the insurance strategy was prevalent earlier in the
   decision-making process, when forming the consideration set.},

Abstract = {We report the results of a laboratory experiment based on a
   citizen-candidate model with private information about ideal points.
   Inefficient political polarization is observed in all treatments; that
   is, citizens with extreme ideal points enter as candidates more often
   than moderate citizens. Second, less entry occurs, with even greater
   polarization, when voters have directional information about candidates'
   ideal points, using ideological party labels. Nonetheless, this
   directional information is welfare enhancing because the inefficiency
   from greater polarization is outweighed by lower entry expenses and
   better voter information. Third, entry rates are decreasing in group
   size and the entry cost. These findings are all implied by properties of
   the unique symmetric Bayesian equilibrium cutpoint pair of the entry
   game. Quantitatively, we observe too little (too much) entry when the
   theoretical entry rates are high (low). This general pattern of observed
   biases in entry rates is implied by logit quantal response equilibrium.},

Journal = {ELECTORAL STUDIES},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {57},
Pages = {174-185},

Abstract = {It was widely reported that the 2015 UK general election represented a
   breakthrough election for the Conservative party among ethnic minority
   voters - specifically that their vote share among minorities increased,
   and overtook that of Labour for the first time among some groups. I show
   that analysis using more representative data yields markedly different
   results. Looking at (i) party preference from 2010 to 2015, and (ii)
   reported vote shares from a nationally representative probability
   survey, I show that the Conservatives increased their support among
   Hindus - but the Labour party gained in support elsewhere. This is due
   to movement away from the Liberal Democrats, 2010 minority supporters of
   the Liberal Democrats moved to supporting Labour rather than the
   Conservatives in 2015 at a ratio of 2:1. There is also considerable
   individual-level volatility in party support among ethnic minorities,
   which is masked by a high level of stability at the aggregate level.},

Journal = {POLITICAL THEORY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {47},
Number = {1},
Pages = {6-31},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {W.E.B. Du Bois's reading of whiteness as a ``public and psychological
   wage{''} is enormously influential. This essay examines another, lesser
   known facet of Du Bois's account of racialized identity: his
   conceptualization of whiteness as dominion. In his 1920-1940 writings,
   ``modern{''} whiteness appears as a proprietary orientation toward the
   planet in general and toward ``darker peoples{''} in particular. This
   ``title to the universe{''} is part of chattel slavery's uneven
   afterlife, in which the historical fact of ``propertized human life{''}
   endures as a racialized ethos of ownership. The essay examines how this
   ``title{''} is expressed and reinforced in the twentieth century by the
   Jim Crow system of racial signs in the United States and by violent
   ``colonial aggrandizement{''} worldwide. The analytic of white dominion,
   I argue, allows Du Bois to productively link phenomena often regarded as
   discrete, namely, domestic and global forms of white supremacy and
   practices of exploitation and dispossession. Ultimately, the entitlement
   Du Bois associates with whiteness is best understood as a pervasive,
   taken-for-granted horizon of perception, which facilitates the
   transaction of the ``wage{''} but is not reducible to it.},

Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {What kind of a concept is friendship, and what is its connection to
   politics? Critics sometimes claim that friendship does not have a role
   to play in the study of politics. Such objections misconstrue the nature
   of the concept of friendship and its relation to politics. In response,
   this article proposes three approaches to understanding the concept of
   friendship: (1) as a `family resemblance' concept, (2) as an instance of
   an `essentially contested' concept, and (3) as a concept indicating a
   problematique. The article thus responds to the dismissal of friendship
   by undertaking the groundwork for understanding what kind of a concept
   friendship might be, and how it might serve different purposes. In doing
   so, it opens the way for understanding friendship's relation to
   politics.},

Abstract = {Global capitalism is a transnational ``operational space{''} (Sassen)
   which is (re)produced by the practices of states, policy- and
   issue-specific government networks, and private organizations such as
   transnational corporations, global law firms, and standard-setting
   agencies. This ``operational space,{''} which I call the transnational
   constellation, works through and beyond distinct spatial settings (i.e.
   local, glocal, national, global), endowing them with a global financial
   capitalistic logic and limiting the scope of democratic
   self-determination. In the second section, I analyze political protest
   against this transnational constellation in terms of democratic theory.
   I argue that transnational protest and activism have to be appreciated
   for their reshaping of spaces of the political, for developing and
   delivering a genuinely global perspective on political problems, and for
   their politicization of the transnational constellation by revealing and
   contesting structures and strategies of domination. However, it would be
   misleading to conceive of protest against the transnational
   constellation as constituent power. Instead, as I argue in the third
   part of the article, this kind of protest enacts a parallel world which
   very often lasts only for a fleeting moment, but where alternative
   political and social life forms are exercised and experienced. Perhaps
   their time is yet to come.},

Journal = {RESEARCH \& POLITICS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {6},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN 29},
Abstract = {This paper explores the employment trajectories of workers exposed to
   technological change. Based on individual-level panel data from the UK,
   we first confirm that the share of middle-skilled routine workers has
   declined, while non-routine jobs in both high- and low-skilled
   occupations have increased, consistent with country-level patterns of
   job polarization. Next, we zoom in on the actual transition patterns of
   threatened routine workers. Despite the aggregate decline in routine
   work, most affected workers manage to remain in the labor market during
   the time they are in the study: about 64\% ``survive{''} in routine
   work, 24\% switch to other (better or worse paying) jobs, almost 10\%
   exit routine work via retirement and only a small minority end up
   unemployed. Based on this finding, the final part of our analysis
   studies the economic implications of remaining in a digitalizing
   occupational environment. We rely on an original approach that
   specifically captures the impact of information and communication
   technology at the industry level on labor market outcomes and find
   evidence for a digital Matthew effect: while outcomes are, on average,
   positive, it is first and foremost non-routine workers in cognitively
   demanding jobs that benefit from the penetration of new technologies in
   the workplace. In the conclusions, we discuss if labor market
   polarization is a likely source of intensified political conflict.},

Abstract = {I reassess the argument by Tavits and Letki (2009) that in Eastern
   Europe in the 1990s and 2000s left-leaning governments were less likely
   to spend than right-leaning governments. I argue that the findings are
   most likely driven by time bias in their manifesto-based measurement of
   ideology. Starting in the mid-nineties, governments became artificially
   leftist, thus, the robustness of the relationship proposed by Tavits and
   Letki may be questioned. When adjusted for time bias, ideology does not
   influence spending in Eastern Europe. These findings have important
   consequences on the established literature linking ideology and
   spending. The findings also suggest that although manifesto-based
   measures of ideology have become widely used in time-series analyses,
   ideology scores at different times may not be comparable without
   adjustments.},

Abstract = {The literature on belief systems in mass publics shows that survey
   respondents typically have difficulty in describing their images of
   political parties; only about half offer a meaningful description of how
   they see individual parties. This paper investigates what people in
   Northern Ireland think that parties stand for in their home
   jurisdiction, in Great Britain and in the Republic of Ireland, using
   open-ended questions in a survey of 1,008 Northern Ireland residents.
   Northern Ireland respondents resemble those elsewhere, in that only
   about half seem able to offer a politically meaningful description of
   what local parties stand for. Among the more politically sophisticated,
   the Northern Ireland parties are described in ethnonational terms, the
   British parties are placed in socio-economic (social class and
   left-right) categories, but few respondents know how to describe the
   parties in the Republic of Ireland. There is an intriguing asymmetry in
   the characterization of Northern Ireland's unionist and nationalist
   parties: the DUP emerges as only marginally more `hard-line' than the
   UUP, whereas a great gulf exists between the SDLP and Sinn Fein, the
   former being perceived as much more moderate. Notwithstanding high
   levels of electoral stability in Northern Ireland, our findings show
   that party supporters vary greatly in their levels of political
   sophistication, perhaps allowing elites greater freedom of action than
   if all voters were highly politically informed.},

Volume = {46},
Number = {1},

Abstract = {Today, as before in history, competition between states and pressure to
   emulate the practices of the more successful competitors continue
   unabated. This article argues that in international politics
   continuities are far more impressive, and far more engrained, than we
   might think. By pointing towards the competitive and emulative behaviour
   of states, the article argues that some 500 years of
   international-political history lends credence to the old Waltzian
   proposition that in anarchic realms competitive and emulative behaviour
   are to be expected. Thus, in examining the conduct of international
   politics across three distinct international-political systems, the
   article points to (i) the impressive continuity of international
   politics, particularly with an eye towards competition and emulation,
   and (ii) the enduring quality of Waltzian structural realism. Although
   Waltz's publications briefly touch on the continuity of international
   politics, he provides but few historical illustrations, a shortcoming
   this article addresses.},

Abstract = {Current debates on citizenship and democracy highlight the salience of
   cooperative relations between government and its citizens. Scholars
   observe that governments and its institutions function better where
   there is cooperation and trust. However, evidence suggests that
   political interest is waning and trust in government, dwindling. More
   especially, concerns about the effects of youth disengaging from
   political life are increasing. This phenomenon is more worrying in young
   democracies, where democratic traditions and principles are still
   evolving. This study examines the effect of family politicisation on
   youth trust in government. This quantitative study used a
   cross-sectional correlational research design. A two-level approach was
   adopted. At the first level we examined the prevalence of political
   discussions in the home and the trust attitudes of the family (as
   indicators of family politicisation) and youth towards government. At a
   second level we conducted a regression analysis to determine
   relationships between parent-adolescent communication and youth trust in
   government; family trust in government and youth trust in government;
   and finally, parent-adolescent communication and family trust on youth
   trust in government. The results suggest that a combination of parent-
   adolescent communication and family trust in government in a model,
   significantly positively predicts youth trust in government.},

Abstract = {Scholars of LGBT advocacy often characterize the 1990s as a pragmatic
   and conservative era of activism - a time when neoliberalism
   ``de-sexed{''} the movement and suppressed any lingering
   ``liberationist{''} sentiment. AIDS, of course, figures prominently into
   this narrative. This paper explores the point of convergence between
   neoliberalism, sexual praxis, and political advocacy, making two primary
   contributions. First, I investigate how interest group representation
   serves the ends of neoliberal governance by mobilizing neoliberal
   citizens. This form of citizenship emphasizes not only a market-centered
   individualism, but it also promotes individual-level actions in the face
   of deeply structured social problems and encourages deference to
   strategy-minded professional managers and entrepreneurs. Second, I
   reintroduce pivotal leaders and organizations of the 1970s into the
   story of LGBT politics, arguing that these organizations laid the
   groundwork of a sexually conscientious gay citizenry before the AIDS
   crisis began. While a sincere concern over public health undoubtedly
   motivated activists throughout the 1980s, AIDS merely intensified
   (rather than initiated) community leaders' policing of gay sexuality.},

Abstract = {Studies show that globalisation creates political potentials that can
   transform electoral competition in Western societies. The specific
   process of how these potentials become effective is not completely
   understood. It is argued in the article that attention-grabbing events
   can trigger the transformation of electoral competition as they force
   actors to take clear positions and thereby allow citizens to align their
   partisan preferences and policy attitudes. The article analyses the case
   of German parties' reaction to the arrival of large numbers of refugees
   at Europe's borders in 2015/16. Using panel data that bracket this
   event, it is shown how German citizens responded to party behaviour by
   changing partisan preferences on the basis of prior immigration
   attitudes. The so-called refugee crisis may thus have been a critical
   juncture transforming party competition in Germany. As such, the crisis
   represents a striking example of how events may focus attention on a new
   policy dimension and catalyse the evolution of new cleavages.},

Abstract = {Donald J. Trump won the 2016 US presidential election with fewer popular
   votes than Hillary R. Clinton. This is the fourth time this has
   happened, the others being 1876, 1888, and 2000. In earlier work, we
   analyzed these elections (and others) and showed how the electoral
   winner can often depend on the size of the US House of Representatives.
   This work was inspired by Neubauer and Zeitlin (2003, 721-5) in their
   paper, ``Outcomes of Presidential Elections and the House Size{''}. A
   sufficiently larger House would have given electoral victories to the
   popular vote winner in both 1876 and 2000. An exception is the election
   of 1888. We show that Trump's victory in 2016 is like Harrison's in 1888
   and unlike Hayes's in 1876 and Bush's in 2000. This article updates our
   previous work to include the 2016 election. It also draws attention to
   some of the anomalous behavior that can arise under the Electoral
   College.},

Title = {Pervasive intra-party conflicts in a democratising Nigeria: Terrains,

Journal = {AFRICAN JOURNAL ON CONFLICT RESOLUTION},

Abstract = {Intra-party conflicts of all shapes and complexions have been part and
   parcel of Nigeria's democratic journey. However, in recent times, they
   have become much more pervasive and even assumed crisis dimensions, with
   negative implications for democratic stability and consolidation.
   Drawing from the literature and interpreting the evidence, this article
   examines the terrain, implications and drivers of intra-party conflicts
   in a democratising Nigeria with a view to recommending options for
   resolution. It proceeds from the premise that pervasive intra-party
   conflicts, which have now assumed crisis dimensions, are not given, but
   have been nurtured by certain structural factors which have shaped the
   contours of politics in Nigeria. Specifically, it argues that the crises
   are closely connected with the neo-patrimonial character of the Nigerian
   petro state, the nature of politics being played by the political
   actors, praetorian hangover, and the paucity of democrats who genuinely
   have democratic temperaments to play the game of democratic politics
   according to established rules. It calls for, among others, the reform
   and strengthening of the internal conflict management capacities of
   political parties in Nigeria.},

Abstract = {A number of theoretical and empirical studies analyze the effect of
   inclement weather on voter turnout and in turn on parties' vote share.
   However, empirical findings suggest that the effect of weather on
   parties' vote share is greater than can be explained by its influence on
   voter turnout alone. This article provides experimental evidence of the
   effect of weather on vote choice between more- versus less-risky
   candidates. Findings show that bad weather significantly and sizeably
   depresses risk tolerance making voters less likely to vote for risky
   candidates. This article also provides evidence of a possible mechanism:
   unpleasant weather conditions depress agents' mood, making agents less
   inclined to vote for candidates who are perceived as more risky.},

Abstract = {This paper exploits an original database that spans 30-plus developed
   and developing nations between 1870 and 2010 to perform the first
   empirical analysis of the relationship between historical levels of
   intra-elite competition and fiscal development over the long run. We
   argue that the timing of industrialization affects the extent of
   historical competition between agricultural and capitalist elites, which
   in turn helps shape key initial decisions over fiscal size and
   structure. Under ``early{''} industrialization, intra-elite competition
   levels tended to be greater, promoting fiscal development characterized
   by high overall taxation and tax progressivity. Under ``late{''}
   industrialization, by contrast, agricultural elites were more likely to
   retain political dominance, promoting fiscal states characterized by low
   overall taxation and tax regressivity. We show evidence for a positive,
   statistically significant, and robust relationship between historical
   intra-elite competition levels and long-run fiscal development. This
   focus on intra-elite competition improves our understanding of the
   fundamental determinants of cross-national fiscal differences today.},

Abstract = {The recent global financial crisis has been a serious stress test for
   representative democracies. Voter support has supposedly become more
   volatile, fragmented, and polarized, leaving elites with an intricate
   mix of economic and political challenges. However, a closer look at a
   new data set of European party systems during three major crises (1929,
   1973, and 2008) reveals that the reality is less dramatic than the
   popular impression suggests. We propose a novel theory of party-system
   change that explains both the impact of economic crises as well as the
   robustness of party systems to more serious destabilization. Since
   voters and elites are risk averse, economic crises tend to disturb party
   systems that are generally ``restrained{''} but, at the same time, help
   consolidate more complex systems. This explains why party systems rarely
   fall apart, nor do they reach ultimate stability. We provide
   quantitative evidence and qualitative illustrations of ``restrained
   change{''} in various party-system dimensions.},

Abstract = {single-case study seeks, first, to analyse the Peljesac bridge project's
   EU dimension, and the impact on the bilateral relations between Croatia
   and Bosnia-Herzegovina. The bridge is part of the so-called Road
   Connection to South Dalmatia, an infrastructure project linking the
   southern exclave of Croatia with the rest of the country. This article
   is going to reconstruct the considerable controversy between Sarajevo
   and Zagreb over the project. Second, this piece of research aims at
   highlighting the context of the bridge being built by a State-owned
   Chinese company and why the EU has been paralysed over the question of
   third-country bidders in national EU-wide public tenders. Lastly, this
   paper presents a recommendation on how the problem of maritime access to
   and from the territorial waters of Bosnia-Herzegovina through Croatian
   internal waters can be solved. The article demonstrates that the three
   issues of controversy related to the Peljesac bridge project can and
   must be unbundled to arrive at sustainable solutions for the region as a
   whole. The method employed in this article is process-tracing covering
   the period between 1999 and today based on interviews, documents, and
   secondary literature.},

Abstract = {This essay discusses a special moment in the antimafia history. These
   are the years 1985-1994, whose main figure is Leoluca Orlando, mayor of
   Palermo. In that historical period, for the first time, the antimafia's
   political speech is held by this young leader of the Christian
   Democracy. Since the post-war period, the party had ruled Palermo and
   Italy without facing the problem of the fight against the mafia. Since
   the beginning of the eighties, the opposition forces, in particular the
   Communist Party and the trade unions, carried on the antimafia fight.
   With the murder of Piersanti Mattarella, president of the Sicilian
   Region, and then of Carlo Alberto dalla Chiesa, prefect of Palermo, the
   Christian Democracy, led in Sicily, by Sergio Mattarella (brother of
   Piersanti), decided to cut off relations with the mafia, in particular
   with Vito Ciancimino, former mayor-mafia of Palermo. The experience of
   Orlando is first of all the consequence of that policy and then of a
   national clash, for the government leadership, between Christian
   Democracy and the Socialist Party. However, with the end of the First
   Republic in 1994, antimafia was no longer the main ground for
   confrontation between political forces involved in contending the
   municipality of Palermo.},

Abstract = {Research on the terrorism discourse has been growing recently, however
   there has not been yet a research that would focus on an almost 18 years
   long time period and analyse all presidents of a country involved in the
   war on terror. This article attempts to fill this gap and analyses
   character and evolution of terrorism discourse in the United States at
   presidential level. It focuses on discourse evolution since the 9/11
   attacks until the end of 2018. Author believes that it is important to
   know the character of discourse to be able to fight terrorism
   effectively, because rhetoric can influence counterterrorism measures
   and make them ineffective by for example being too aggressive or used
   for manipulation of public opinion. It uses Fairclough's Critical
   Discourse Analysis and it analyses official speeches and Twitter
   accounts of Presidents of the United States in the studied era - George
   W. Bush, Barack Obama and Donald Trump. It focuses on all three levels
   of Fairclough's analysis - textual, intertextual and contextual and it
   finds that the presidents' discourses are different in many respects
   even though they share some important characteristics and they're
   generally more calming throughout the time. However, all of the
   discourses were found not sufficient for effective counterterrorism
   measures. We need similar analyses of other countries to be able to
   change the way we present terrorism and make counter-terrorism more
   effective.},

Abstract = {In her Vindication of the Rights of Men, Mary Wollstonecraft accused
   Edmund Burke of having contempt for his political opponents. Yet she
   herself expressed contempt for Burke and did so unapologetically.
   Readers have long regarded Wollstonecraft's decision to match Burke's
   contempt with one of her own as either a tactical blunder or evidence
   that she sought merely to ridicule Burke rather than argue with him. I
   offer an interpretation and defence of Wollstonecraft's rhetorical
   choices by situating the Vindication within eighteenth-century debates
   about the dangers of elite contempt and the best methods for stifling
   it. Rather than countering Burke's contempt with more of the same,
   Wollstonecraft's Vindication marks a distinction between two forms of
   contempt. The first expresses the false sense of superiority experienced
   by elites who owe their social elevation to arbitrary differences of
   wealth or family. As such, it represents both an abuse of privilege and
   an anxious recognition among elites that their claims to dignity may be
   unfounded. By contrast, the contempt Wollstonecraft directs at Burke
   represents a dignified withdrawal of esteem which signals that one's
   opponent is unworthy of the dignity to which they lay claim. If
   Wollstonecraft appeared to treat Burke abusively it was because she came
   to consider this second form of contempt as an antidote to the abusive
   contempt of the privileged. I conclude by spelling out some implications
   of Wollstonecraft's analysis of contempt for recent debates in political
   theory over the importance of dignity to democracy.},

Journal = {ASIAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE},

Volume = {27},
Number = {2},
Pages = {190-210},
Abstract = {This paper examines whether economic or socio-psychological concerns
   determine anti-immigration attitudes in South Korea, in an effort to
   address regional asymmetries in existing immigration studies. An
   analysis reveals that labour market competition and fiscal burden
   concerns do not affect anti-immigration attitudes, but xenophobia, the
   conceptual views of citizenship, and the expectation of the impact of
   immigration on the national economy determine anti-immigration
   attitudes, a result in keeping with existing studies of anti-immigration
   attitudes in European or North American countries. However, when
   policies have humanitarian dimensions, the ethno-cultural views of
   Korean identity tend to reduce anti-immigration attitudes, a finding
   that runs counter to the empirical results from studies in the Western
   context. In addition, multiculturalism appears to affect
   anti-immigration attitudes when measured in terms of general immigration
   policies, but not when specific immigration groups are referenced. I
   conclude by discussing the implications of these new findings.},

Abstract = {This collective article is dedicated to the images of power in the

   power in the different pre-industrial societies of the East and Vest,
   such as procedures of obtaining power, coronation and anointment,
   ruler's regalia and the forms of organizing space of power. The authors
   investigate the relationship between the secular and the sacred elements
   in the political mythology of power. This paper deals with the evolution
   of images of power, rituals and symbols of authority from Ancient
   Eastern to Medieval societies. The purpose of the article is to present
   the universal components of the images of power in Ancient and Medieval
   times. The identification of common and specific features in the
   representation of power and ritual practices will allow us to see the
   evolution of ideas about power in pre-industrial societies.},

Abstract = {The reprint of Late Marx and the Russian Road on the 200th anniversary
   of Karl Marx's birth offers a valuable opportunity to discuss the impact
   of this path-breaking miscellaneous volume on Marx scholarship. The
   first aim of this paper is to highlight the original approach of the
   work, which looked at Marx's views on Russia from a different
   perspective to those of previous studies. This paper then deals with the
   main criticism raised by critics regarding the line of argument advanced
   in the book. Emphasis is placed on two aspects: (1) the debate over
   whether Marx believed in the possibility of socialist development in
   Russia without a proletarian revolution in the Western countries; (2)
   the argument that the shifts in Marx's perspective after 1870 were not
   limited to his writings on the Russian question, which were part of a
   wider rethink of the political forms suitable for the emancipation of
   labour from capitalist exploitation.},

Journal = {LABORATOIRE ITALIEN-POLITIQUE ET SOCIETE},
Year = {2019},
Number = {22},
Abstract = {The article analyzes how Milanese society has fought two phenomena that
   attacked it over the 25 years between 1968 and 1993 (the year of the
   indictment of the socialist leader Bettino Craxi and the mafia massacre
   in Via Palestro): terrorism -especially left-wing terrorism- and mafia.
   In other words, it seeks to frame the history of the richest and most
   cosmopolitan metropolis in Italy from a special point of view. The
   article does not deal with the economic and trade union struggles, nor
   with the political struggles of Bettino Craxi, the League or Silvio
   Berlusconi, but with the people's struggle against two direct enemies of
   democracy and legality. It thus offers some critical notes on the
   history of two different movements. Both were rather linked to civil
   society than to politics or the world of work. Both played an important
   role in the defense of the institutions. The antiterrorism movement was
   less structured and visible, while the antimafia one was more attended
   and organized. Both were forced to confront diffidence and cultural
   prejudices; finally, both were animated, especially the latter, by a
   strong youth and student component. The story and the analysis are born
   and fed by the direct memory of the author who for different reasons has
   participated in the two movements intensely: in the second case also
   playing a leadership role. The genre chosen is therefore that of the
   ``sociological diary{''}.},

Pages = {145-169},
Abstract = {This contribution reproduces one of the first articles analyzing rural
   women's participation in the Peruvian agrarian reform, published in
   1983, along with a new preface by the author. It is argued that
   processes of socio-economic change are not gender neutral; supposedly
   gender-neutral reforms may have a negative impact on the position of
   women. Neither the Peruvian nor Chilean agrarian reforms of the 1970s
   had an explicit policy to incorporate women into the reform, in contrast
   to Cuba in this period, where the participation of women in the new
   production cooperatives was a policy goal. As a result, few women were
   direct beneficiaries in Peru or Chile in comparison to Cuba. The
   criteria for being a beneficiary of the reform was the main mechanism of
   exclusion in the former two countries, specifically, the requirement
   that these be household heads. The exclusion of women had negative
   consequences for the success of the production cooperatives. In Cuba,
   women became cooperative members on their own account; moreover,
   attention to their domestic responsibilities in the new agrarian
   communities that were created, along with the support of and effective
   coordination between the peasant's and women's associations, largely
   explain both how women came to be over one-third of the members and the
   early success of the cooperativization process.},

Abstract = {Democratic accountability relies on citizens to anticipate future
   governing behavior. We explore the strategic incentives for parties to
   shape voter expectations by generating vague or concrete campaign
   statements. Using an English-language dictionary, we scale electoral
   statements from all industrialized English-speaking nations to develop a
   measure of concreteness. Concrete statements can create electoral risks
   from unfulfilled expectations. Yet, political parties have incentives to
   use concrete statements to clarify reputation uncertainty associated
   with unclear informational cues. Political context shapes these
   incentives. Incumbent parties tend to dictate concrete statements to
   balance attributed responsibility for government outcomes and signal
   that they are competent managers. Strong government performance,
   however, reduces the incentive for incumbents to be concrete, as
   favorable outcomes reveal competent management. Opposition parties are
   unconstrained from these demands. The research reveals how political
   parties actively manage and balance the information that voters use in
   order to adjust the informative value of party reputation.},

Abstract = {Featuring works by David Ha, Tom White, Daniel Ambrosi and Joanne
   Hastie, this selection represents the varied practice of artists
   engaging with AI today. From developing AI tools that draw to pushing
   the limits of image-recognition techniques and incorporating AI
   aesthetics in their work, these artists explore the full spectrum of the
   creative possibilities presented by AI. David Ha developed a model able
   to sketch animals in a similar way to humans, while Tom White plays with
   image recognition capabilities of neural networks, presenting abstract
   images that are recognised as specific objects. Daniel Ambrosi's
   interpretations of landscapes are enhanced by DeepDream's hallucinatory
   aesthetic, without being overshadowed by the technology. In her `Machine
   Learning Abstracts', Joanne Hastie relies on AI to come up with abstract
   compositions that she then paints by hand.

Abstract = {In this paper, we will study the recent poetic mass phenomenon that
   emerged in social networks; ``poetry 2.0{''}. Although it resisted to
   the democratization demanded by the public, the poetic discourse spurred
   by social networks has finally succumbed. Since in liquid societies
   everything is prone to be converted into a consumption item, there are
   several questions that assail us and we will try to answer them: what is
   the relationship between poetry-internet-market? Are we facing a case of
   best-selling poetry? What has been the necessary impulse for the birth
   of ``poetry 2.0{''}? What place does this poetic manifestation occupy in
   the literary field and in the collective worldview?},

Abstract = {This paper studies the institutionalization of political sciences as a
   social science through the 20th century. Such process of
   institutionalization strives the false distinction between an allegedly
   vindicated political philosophy and a self-proclaimed Political Science.
   This division is remarkable in order to understand the crisis in this
   field, which opens a debate proposed by Sartori in 2004, following these
   questions: Where is the Political Science heading at? And which type of
   science can and should be the Political Science? From this point we try
   to suggest, in the end of this article, some remarks on what is called a
   disciplinary catastrophe and propose a scenario to rebuild the knowledge
   and political theory towards a renewed Politology.},

   Retention},

Abstract = {Teaching and learning research typically focuses on learning outcomes
   relating to the acquisition of knowledge. In this article, we shift
   focus to a different outcome: student commitment to, and thus successful
   completion of, a course. By examining the relationship between
   instructor pedagogical chokes and rates of student retention-as measured
   primarily by withdrawal rates-we hope to help instructors think about
   ways to limit the incidence of their students ``going AWOL{''} How
   strong is the evidence that an instructor's teaching behavior influences
   student retention or attrition? If an instructor's decisions do seem to
   matter, exactly which patterns are evident? To begin answering these
   questions, we report results from a major data collection effort, which
   involved undergraduate research assistants attending a wide variety of
   courses and recording details related to the instructor's pedagogical
   approach-such as the extent to which the instruction was
   student-centered or instructor-centered, the extent to which the
   classroom environment was regulated, elements of entertainment
   incorporated into class sessions, and efforts to facilitate rapport with
   students. Comparing this information to end-of-semester grade and
   enrollment statistics, we identify the relationship between how a course
   is taught and the retention of its students. We find a pattern of lower
   retention in courses where class sessions are heavily structured, in the
   sense that students are ``cold-called{''} to participate or discouraged
   from such behaviors as phone use. We also find a relationship, weaker
   but still significant, between higher retention rates and both the
   showing of videos and the use of active learning.},

Abstract = {This article uses the social history of economic ideas and applies it to
   the case study of the French Socialist Party (PS), from its
   ``rebirth{''} under Francois Mitterrand in 1971 to the latter's victory
   in the 1981 presidential election. This theoretical approach offers two
   methodological interests. First of all, it highlights an original
   configuration within the PS, in which the ideas it promoted were
   considered as a crucial weapon in the political contest. Most of its
   ruling elites took an interest in theoretical issues, which convinced
   them to systematically justify their political decisions by mobilizing a
   (more or less) complex theoretical apparatus. Second, the social history
   of economic ideas developed in this article is also a contribution to
   the wider debate on expertise and experts engaged in politics. Examining
   the economic history of the PS through the lens of its experts questions
   the widespread belief depicting the Western parties of government as
   ``political corporations{''} only concerned with gaining power.
   Throughout the 1970s, the PS was also a receiver, a producer, and a
   mediator of heterodox economic ideas, such as the American neo-Marxism
   or the French ``regulation theories.{''} Yet the party's use of various
   forms of media (including conferences, books, brochures, newspapers, and
   journals) to promote its rejuvenated economic program underscores the
   existence of a strong concern for ideas, which existed neither in the
   previous period under Guy Mollet's leadership nor afterwards.},

Abstract = {This article analyses salient trade-offs in the design of democracy. It
   grounds this analysis in a distinction between two basic models of
   democracy: simple and complex majoritarianism. These models differ not
   only in their electoral and party systems, but also in the style of
   coalition-building. Simple majoritarianism concentrates executive power
   in a single majority party; complex majoritarianism envisions the
   formation of shifting, issue-specific coalitions among multiple parties
   whose programs differ across multiple conflict dimensions. The latter
   pattern of coalition formation is very difficult to create and sustain
   under pure parliamentary government. A separation of powers between
   executive and legislature can facilitate such a pattern, while also
   achieving central goals of simple majoritarianism: identifiable cabinet
   alternatives before the election and stable cabinets afterward. The
   separation of powers can thus balance simple and complex majoritarianism
   in ways that are unavailable under parliamentarism. The article also
   compares the presidential and semi-parliamentary versions of the
   separation of powers. It argues that the latter has important
   advantages, e.g., when it comes to resolving inter-branch deadlock, as
   it avoids the concentration of executive power in a single human being.},

Abstract = {For years, the theory of modernization was the main explanation of voter
   turnout in Mexico, but this theory has had important theoretical and
   empirical reverses, which led researchers to look for new explanations,
   among them is the possibility that citizens vote less because they do
   not find acceptable candidates in either a pragmatic (professional/work
   experience) or moral evaluation, but there is no empirical evidence of
   this and the international evidence is not conclusive either. Little
   before the Mexican 2018 election, a survey was made to test this
   hypothesis, finding that even controlling a couple of factors (partisan
   attachment and belief that one should vote even if all candidates are
   bad), the poor evaluation of candidates is relates to abstentionism. It
   was also found that the moral component of the evaluation has a stronger
   relationship than other aspects such as the academic and professional
   career of the candidate. Finally, the relationship found seems to
   fluctuate between cities, there seems to be regions where the weight of
   the moral prevails, while in others the professional and academic aspect
   determines more of the voter turnout.},

Abstract = {Government transparency is widely promoted, yet little is known about
   transparency's effects. Survey experiments reported here, made on the
   streets of Lima, Peru, investigate a simple question: what are the
   effects of government-sponsored transparency websites, and the
   information revealed by those efforts, on attitudes about the Peruvian
   political system? Like many developing countries, Peru lacks much system
   support, making it more difficult to improve governance and democracy;
   transparency itself has little impact on political attitudes. However,
   some dimensions of the information provided by transparency matter:
   endorsement by a credible third party or framing that associates
   comparatively good community well-being with government performance.
   These conditions substantively increase Peruvians' approval of the
   national political community, the regime's performance, institutions,
   and local government.},

Abstract = {Recent work across the social sciences have converged on the issue of
   emotion. In the vanguard of these advances has been the sociology of
   emotions, broadly defined, which, in various guises - structural,
   cultural, critical, social psychological, positivist and so on - has
   made a significant contribution to our understanding of the emotional
   dimensions of social life, and its centrality to the explanation and
   understanding of social action. In this paper, and building on previous
   work, I wish to make a contribution to an increasingly important
   interdisciplinary sub-field - the political sociology of emotion - and
   to reconsider and explain the increasingly important role of emotional
   practice, understood as the strategic deployment of emotional capital,
   in contemporary party politics.},

Abstract = {Many legislatures around the world are undergoing a participatory
   makeover'. Parliaments are hosting open days and communicating the
   latest parliamentary updates via websites and social media. Public
   activities such as these may make parliaments more informative and
   accessible, but much more could be done to foster meaningful democratic
   renewal. In particular, participatory efforts ought to be engaging
   citizens in a central task of legislatures - to deliberate and make
   decisions on collective issues. In this article, the potential of
   parliamentary committees to bring the public closer to legislative
   deliberations is considered. Drawing on insights from the practice and
   theory of deliberative democracy, the article discusses why and how
   deeper and more inclusive forms of public engagement can strengthen the
   epistemic, representative and deliberative capacities of parliamentary
   committees. Practical examples are considered to illustrate the
   possibilities and challenges of broadening public involvement in
   committee work.},

Title = {THE EU'S PROXY WAR ON REFUGEES},
Journal = {STATE CRIME},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {8},
Number = {1},
Pages = {80-103},
Abstract = {For decades, European Union (EU) member states have fought an illegal
   proxy war - a form of state crime - against refugees and migrants, far
   beyond EU external borders. Fatalities make this proxy war equivalent to
   international classifications of war. To justify this war, migrants have
   progressively been reclassified by the EU as ``illegal{''} or criminal.
   This article situates the proxy war within wider deterrence-based EU
   migration policies. Examples like the 2008-2009 Italy-Libya deal and
   2016 EU-Turkey deal show the high price paid by refugees, minorities and
   the damage to the EU's own stability and reputation. Forcibly confining
   people at ``holding points{''} along migratory routes, expelling people
   to unsafe countries and raising barriers to legal movement, the violence
   of the proxy war became more visible in 2015. We conclude that far from
   counteracting the dynamics of mass displacement, the proxy war may have
   contributed to the recent crisis of refugee reception in Europe.},

Abstract = {In this article, we explore civil society mobilisation and the impact of
   organised interests on the energy policies of two post-communist
   countries-Hungary and Czechia-and specifically nuclear energy. Drawing
   on numerous hypotheses from the literature on organised interests, we
   explore how open both political systems are for civil society input and
   what interest group-specific and socio-economic factors mediate the
   influence of organised interests. Based on the preference attainment
   method, our case studies focus on the extent to which organised
   interests have succeeded bringing nuclear energy legislation in line
   with their preferences. We find that while both democracies are open to
   civil society input, policy-making is generally conducted in
   state-industrial circles, whereby anti-nuclear and renewable energy
   advocates are at best able to make minor corrections to already
   pre-determined policies.},

Abstract = {Intensive scientific research conducted in the area of defence and
   security suggests that the gradual deterioration of the global and
   regional security environment and security situation during the first
   two decades of the new millennium, the considerable increase in
   symmetric and, above all, asymmetric security threats, along with the
   announced shift of the United States' primary interests from Europe to
   the Asia-Pacific region, prompted the adoption of various measures of
   political, security, military, legislative and organizational nature,
   both at national and integration groupings level (alliances, unions,
   pacts, etc.). Therefore, the author, using relevant scientific research
   methods in the study, analyses current trends in European defence and
   security and the prevailing tendencies in defence spending.
   Simultaneously, he points out that the European Union and its Member
   States must respond to these circumstances and take responsibility for
   their defence and security, as well as for their further development in
   their own hands. Finally, the author, in the context of scientific
   research results, underlines that, in order to meet this daring goal,
   European countries will inevitably need to increase their defence
   expenditures, as they urgently have to maintain, modernize and build new
   appropriate military capabilities and capacities to be able to respond
   not only to current military and non-military threats but also to future
   security challenges.},

Abstract = {This article examines the political framework of ``novi kurs{''}
   ({''}New Course{''}) from the beginning of the 20th century, its
   strategic aims and its function within the battle of different visions
   of a South Slavic state. The evidence shows that the new political
   direction contributed to the improvement of conflicting relations
   between Croats and Serbs, but, at the same time, it had a negative
   impact on the Croatian-Slovenian alliance along the Adriatic coast. In
   the context of the latter relation, the author analyses the reactions of
   Slovenians from Trieste and Primorska region who were supposed to be the
   collaterals due to what seemed to be an agreement between Serbs and
   Croats. However, although the ``New Course{''} may be seen as long
   expected consensus between Croats and Serbs, a thorough analysis
   undermines that thesis. This became evident with the formation of two
   political factions within the Croatian-Serbian Coalition in which
   different views on the fundamental geopolitical parameters of the South
   Slavic state were developed.},

Journal = {AMERICAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {63},
Number = {1},
Pages = {234-249},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Manipulation checks are often advisable in experimental studies, yet
   they rarely appear in practice. This lack of usage may stem from fears
   of distorting treatment effects and uncertainty regarding which type to
   use (e.g., instructional manipulation checks {[}IMCs] or assessments of
   whether stimuli alter a latent independent variable of interest). Here,
   we first categorize the main variants and argue that factual
   manipulation checks (FMCs)-that is, objective questions about key
   elements of the experiment-can identify individual-level attentiveness
   to experimental information and, as a consequence, better enable
   researchers to diagnose experimental findings. We then find, through
   four replication studies, little evidence that FMC placement affects
   treatment effects, and that placing FMCs immediately post-outcome does
   not attenuate FMC passage rates. Additionally, FMC and IMC passage rates
   are only weakly related, suggesting that each technique identifies
   different sets of attentive subjects. Thus, unlike other methods, FMCs
   can confirm attentiveness to experimental protocols.},

Title = {CORRUPTION, HUMAN VALUES AND ATTEMPTS OF VIOLENT CHANGES OF GOVERNMENT
   IN COUNTRIES WITH VARIOUS LEVELS OF PER CAPITA GDP: A COMPARATIVE
   QUANTITATIVE ANALYSIS},

Abstract = {The frequency of coups and coup attempts is shown to be approximately
   equally related both to the level of corruption and to the level of per
   capita GDP; with regard to attempts to overthrow the central government,
   the influence of the GDP per capita level is slightly stronger, whereas
   with regard to the overthrow of all authorities in aggregate, both
   central and local, the degree of corruption has a greater impact. At the
   same time, both indicators are in close connection, but the rate of GDP
   growth does not have a stable correlation with corruption and is weakly
   correlated-with the frequency of attempts to violently overthrow the
   state authorities. The detected relationships are connected in a complex
   way with the human values. In the group of developed countries with a
   level of corruption less than 40 points, we find a significant positive
   correlation between non-corruptness and values of self-expression. In
   other countries, values do not influence the level of corruption, but
   they affect the rate of economic growth and the frequency of attempts to
   overthrow the government. The study suggests that, with equal levels of
   corruption in low and middle income countries, the rejection of
   traditionalism produces a positive impact on political stability and
   rapid economic growth, whereas a premature transition to values of
   self-expression may produce a negative impact on economic growth. On the
   other hand, for a country to exceed the GDP per capita level of about
   20-25 thousand dollars a year is problematic if its development is not
   accompanied by the reduction of corruption below the level of 40-50
   points. There is reason to believe that modern Russia (with a per capita
   GDP of about 25 thousand dollars per year and a level of corruption of
   more than 70 points) can he just in this situation.},

Abstract = {This study focuses on media images of islamophobia as portrayed by Cable
   News Network (CNN) and its implications for international relations. The
   study employed qualitative methodology. Data was collected using key
   informant interviews, while documentary search was done using CNN
   current affairs videos. The study findings indicated that the media has
   the power to influence human perceptions towards stereotyping Islam as a
   terrorist organisation and conflating the Islamic religion and the
   Muslim culture with terrorism. The study also found out that
   islamophobia really has a relationship with how Muslims are represented
   in the media. The study recommends that media houses should have media
   ethics, laws and policies which force journalists to be more accountable
   and objective when reporting issues of religion, race and culture as a
   way of eliminating offensive communication and religious intolerance.},

Title = {THE ALIENATION ALONG THE SOCIAL CONTRACT: COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS OF BASIC
   FEATURES OF ALIENATION AND DEALIENATION IN THE CONSTITUTIONS OF
   BURGIUM-DEMOCRATIC, SOCIALIST, POST-SOCIALIST AND THEOCRATIC AND
   CLERICAL STATES},

Pages = {22-31},
Abstract = {In the present work the phenomenon of alienation, accompanied the modern
   formal social contracts - constitutions, is studied. The constitution,
   considered a formal social contract, is a legal act of alienation of the
   civil society and the governmental authority under the certain terms. In
   the context of methodology of the legal political science (the political
   science of law), the system comparative analysis of major features of
   alienation and de-alienation, corresponding to the constitutions of
   bourgeois - democratic, socialist, post-socialist, theocratic and
   clerical states, is performed. In the work a historical - materialistic
   approach, according to which the natural state (the interpretation of
   primitive living) and the social contract (the act of alienation of
   people's rights to the benefit of the establishing state), is used - the
   necessary fictions of anti-feudal natural legal theory, formulated in
   the Enlightenment. In practice the modern states define the people's
   rights and the ``government's{''}, provide for the opportunities of
   flexible alienation and de-alienation of all the constituted social
   relations through the formal social contract - the Constitution. This
   logical scheme constitutes modus operandi of all the study, in the
   result of which the author came to the conclusion that different types
   and forms of alienation are immanent to the social contracts
   (constitutions) of the countries with various social and political
   system; the ways of constitutional de-alienation are various as well:
   modernization of the system of rights and freedoms, social guarantees,
   state-party and state-religious ideology, etc. This process is
   relatively unlimited, determined by the civilizational features of
   societies, but, mainly, by the progress of productive forces and
   productive relations, the inevitable revolutionizing of which raises new
   issues of alienation and de-alienation on the way to the common good of
   humanity.},

Abstract = {Federal systems can also provide citizens with multiple avenues to
   obtain service representation. In shared issue areas, citizens are
   officially represented by two sets of politicians. When politicians are
   willing to cross jurisdictional boundaries, citizens might also obtain
   help or information from more than one set of politicians, even in areas
   of exclusive jurisdiction. We report an experiment designed to examine
   responses to requests for assistance in different issue areas. Our
   sample includes 202 Canadian politicians, each of whom received two
   requests for assistance from fictional constituents. We show that
   federal arrangements can enhance service representation. On average,
   politicians are as helpful on issues of shared jurisdiction as issues of
   exclusive jurisdiction. They are less helpful for issues outside of
   their jurisdiction. These results suggest that federal arrangements can
   work to provide citizens with multiple access points to their
   representative, even in areas that fall outside their representatives'
   jurisdictional purviews.},

Abstract = {Literature makes a contribution to a country's culture of remembrance.
   In Russia, Ivan (IV) the Terrible is being shown in an increasingly
   positive light. Mikhail Gigolashvili's novel Tainyi god (The Secret
   Year) is also set in the time of Ivan IV. Gigolashvili takes a closer
   look at the emotional life of the tsar. He uses a rich, sensual language
   that is partly based on Ivan's own style. Gigolashvili illustrates
   Ivan's historical personality with its inconsistencies, contradictions
   and abysses. In so doing, he offers a counternarrative to the new,
   mythologised image of the official portrayal of Ivan IV. At the same
   time, the novel diagnoses the present-day situation: cloaked in a
   historical perspective, the themes are the same as those of Russia
   today.},

Abstract = {The modern approaches to the evolution of the concepts of state and
   state power in a globalizing world is a subject of the paper. State
   power as the state evolves because of the need to address the systemic
   problems of society, requiring the development of new quality management
   resources. State power, like the political system, formulates and
   implements the collective goals of society or groups existing in it. The
   authors focus on the use of system-structural, functional methods of
   analysis of the state and state power, which makes it possible not only
   to explain state and political changes, but also to predict them. The
   authors substantiate the relevance of the methodological approaches of
   prominent economists and sociologists Schumpeter and Hayek to analyze
   contemporary problems of democracy, when the adaptive capacity of a
   state is aimed at reducing and reducing its role in the life of modern
   global society.},

Abstract = {The present article intends to describe and analyze social and
   solidarity economy public (SSE) policies at the sub-national level
   implemented in the city of Santa Fe, Argentina, between 2011 and 2015.
   At that time, the provincial government created the Undersecretariat of
   Social Economy, and the local government created the Department of
   Social Economy, all of which meant SSE became part of the government's
   agenda. The study is focused on two policies derived from the national
   sphere; the program Ideas en Marcha (Ideas in Motion), and the Center
   for Social Economy Entrepreneurs. The Universidad Nacional del Litoral
   is a part of the latter endeavor, a place where public policies can be
   managed jointly. Based on the analysis of documents and key informant
   semi-structured interviews conducted in the public policy management
   sector, the main characteristics of such interventions will be described
   by examining both stages, design and implementation, as well as by
   highlighting their achievements, their major difficulties and
   challenges.},

Abstract = {Scotland and Wales went to the polls on the same day in 2016, the former
   in a post- independence referendum environment and the latter shortly
   after receiving furtherdevolved powers. Despite this horizontal
   simultaneity, the results in these elections displayed considerable
   diversity. Sub-state elections are often classified as second-order and
   as such are characterized by lower turnouts, anti-government voting and
   small party support. However regional elections in the United Kingdom
   sit uncomfortably in this definition. This article focuses on the
   experience of Scotland and Wales, exploring regional and national
   factors that help to explain regional electoral outcomes. It examines
   valence models, multi-level blame attribution, and relative national and
   regional party leader support. In a second stage, a multinomial logistic
   regression is undertaken, finding that the relative importance of
   regional and national factors differs between the two regions.},

Journal = {NEW POLITICAL SCIENCE},

Volume = {41},

Abstract = {This article puts forward a provisional framework, at best, of Trumpism,
   in order to explore some of the potential political, social, cultural,
   and global implications of it. In particular, this article explores
   Trumpism's discursive ambiguity: how Trumpism appears to be one thing
   (for example, populist), and then appears to be another (for example,
   elitist). The framework draws from a wide-range of reputable journalism
   and scholarly literature, but notably borrows from Sheldon Wolin's
   theory of ``inverted totalitarianism,{''} specifically Wolin's use of
   ``inverted{''} to compensate for Trumpism's ambiguity. In so doi ng,
   this article moves Wolin's thesis forward as it relates to Trumpism. In
   the final analysis, the question is not whether Trumpism is fascist
   (yes, it is) or how similar it is to Wolin's inverted totalitarianism.
   Instead, Trumpism compels us to confront whether the United States has,
   to some degree, always been fascist, and what does that inverted
   American-style fascism look like?},

Abstract = {The pianist and musicologist Yasha Nemtsov is working to stop Jewish
   culture from being forgotten. As a music archaeologist, he has uncovered
   the works of persecuted composers. He has traced the Jewish legacy in
   European music and familiarised listeners with the sound of the ``New
   Jewish School{''}. As an individual and through his work, Nemtsov
   represents the Russian-Jewish cultural transfer. Incidentally, he also
   fills in the gaps in the German culture of remembrance. In an
   autobiographical retrospective of Jewish life in the Soviet Union,
   Nemtsov explains why the Gulag was a major stroke of luck for his
   father, and why his family emigrated to Germany of all places. He has a
   problem with the fact that many Germans are only interested in Jewish
   culture when this serves their ``self-reconciliation{''}. Never has
   knowledge about the ``New Jewish School{''} been greater than today,
   although in musical life, it remains marginalised.},

Journal = {SRAVNITELNAYA POLITIKA-COMPARATIVE POLITICS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {10},

Pages = {95-104},
Abstract = {The article attempts to highlight the key economic, political, and
   social factors that have adverse effects on current relationship
   dynamics between the Russian Federation and the CIS countries and are
   thus responsible for the gradual decline in Russia's influence in the
   post-Soviet area. Authors affirm that this specific phenomenon is
   predetermined, on the one hand, by the aspiration of the political and
   economic diversification and, on the other hand, by a number of
   socio-cultural and psychological factors. The article argues that
   Russian political leaders' perception of various post-soviet countries
   as ``pro-Russian{''} is biased in its conceptual core and based on a
   number of subjective factors that have no actual relation to the
   decision-making process in these countries. In reality, the foreign
   policy of CIS countries is based mostly on pragmatic economic interests
   capable of providing steady development, which makes implementation of
   such subjective terms as ``pro-Russian{''} and ``pro-Western{''} highly
   misleading and unproductive, especially in the current conditions of
   confrontation between Russia and the West.},

Abstract = {In the wake of Russia's military interventions in Georgia and Ukraine,
   foreign observers have repeatedly warned of the risks posed by the
   sizeable presence of ethnic Russians, Russian speakers and Russian
   nationals - collectively referred to as `compatriots', or
   sootechestvenniki, in Russia - in former Soviet states. In this article,
   Lincoln Pigman contextualises Moscow's expansive definition of the
   compatriot with reference to domestic politics and regional
   developments, and explores the discrepancy between rhetoric and reality.
   He finds that the Kremlin has consistently instrumentalised its
   compatriots, often without regard for the consequences of its actions -
   both for its regional influence and for the compatriots themselves.},

Abstract = {L'effondrement de l'architecture depuis la seconde moitie du XXe siecle
   est indissociable de la crise de legitimite des architectes dans les
   pays occidentaux. Suivant un des grands paradigmes tocquevilliens,
   l'egalitarisme des societes democratiques a conduit a la remise en cause
   des privileges des architectes dont la position precaire, entre client
   et constructeur, necessite des regles specifiques. Au lieu des
   obligations de recours qui n'ont engendre que defiance et man oe uvre de
   contournement, la principale reponse se trouve dans les concours. La
   difficulte ici decoule de la specificite des concours d'architecture qui
   selectionnent le meilleur projet et non le meilleur architecte.
   L'article etudie l'echec du systeme des concours francais instaure dans
   les annees 1980 et aujourd'hui presque systematiquement contourne en le
   comparant au succes durable des concours finlandais, adaptes du systeme
   suedois avant meme l'independance il y a plus de 130 ans, lui-meme
   inspire de la France des Lumieres.},

Abstract = {Power is widely acknowledged as central to Thomas Hobbes' political
   philosophy. There is ongoing debate over whether singular human beings
   or, instead, plural relationships, are the true source of power. After
   tracing the debate between the individualist and relationist
   interpretations, I offer an alternative option which, I argue, can
   accommodate both the individual and the relation together. Hobbesian
   power, I contend, is an appearance of a human being as having a means to
   satisfy his desires and, hence, while power belongs to an individual, it
   only appears in relation to another who recognizes him as such. In
   closing, I reflect on the political implications of this notion of power
   in connection with desire.},

Journal = {POLITICS AND GOVERNANCE},

Abstract = {Previous research on public support for participatory decision-making
   fails to distinguish between vote-centric (referendums and initiatives)
   and talk-centric (deliberative-style meetings) instruments, despite a
   deliberative turn in democratic theory suggesting that political
   discussion among ordinary citizens improves decision-making. In an
   online factorial survey experiment conducted among a sample of 960
   Americans recruited on Amazon's Mechanical Turk, we compared support for
   the use of referendums and public meetings, arguing that attitudes
   towards these instruments depend on whether they are used to inform
   legislators or take binding decisions. Public meetings were rated
   considerably lower than referendums and initiatives, especially when the
   outcomes were binding. Contrary to expectations, we did not find a
   preference for binding (over advisory) referendums and individuals from
   referendum and initiative states, where these instruments are legally
   binding, expressed less support for binding participatory reforms than
   individuals from non-direct democratic states. Despite the many
   critiques of direct democracy, public debate in the US has not
   considered whether advisory outcomes might appease some of these
   concerns. The results also demonstrated that individuals expressing
   concerns about the inability of ordinary citizens to understand politics
   and about the welfare of minority groups were not as negative about
   participatory decision-making when legislators had the final say.},

Abstract = {Although there is no rule defining the term family member of a member of
   a diplomatic mission in general international law, it is an established
   consensus between States of different cultures, political systems and
   legal orders that at least a husband or a wife and their joint minor
   children are family members. However, the status of same-sex partners of
   diplomats as well as the second and other wives of the polygamous
   diplomat is unclear. Since the data about practice of States regarding
   same-sex partners on one hand, and wives with children of polygamous
   diplomats on the other hand, is fragmentary and hardly accessible, we
   decided to conduct a research, objective of which was to identify the
   current diplomatic practice on the issues concerned as well as its
   consequences with respect to the definition of a family member of a
   member of a diplomatic mission. The main research was undertaken by the
   means of written requests sent to Ministries of Foreign Affairs and by
   subsequent processing of responses received. The results show that many
   sending States are sending openly homosexual diplomats into receiving
   States not recognising any form of same-sex partnership and that many
   receiving States prohibiting polygamy are willing to accredit sending
   States' polygamous diplomats with all their children, and even all their
   wives. This demonstrates an emerging tendency of the prevailing
   character of the sending States' law with respect to the definition of
   family members which takes place on the basis of international courtesy
   and not of international law.},

Abstract = {This paper presents theoretical and experimental evidence of increased
   voter satisfaction due to moderate candidate platform divergence. The
   formal model combines the traditional proximity treatment of voter
   satisfaction with a disutility stemming from the likelihood of
   ``incorrect{''} voter decision-making. The result is a voter utility
   function for the candidate field which is non-monotonic in platform
   divergence. I confirm the main result of the formal model through a
   voter survey where hypothetical candidate positions were varied from
   very moderate to very partisan. Respondents preferred moderate policy
   divergence to both minimal and extreme divergence. In tandem, these
   results recast moderate ideological differentiation as a desirable,
   rather than pejorative, element of politics and campaigning.},

Title = {Two Friends in Axis-Occupied Greece: The Rescue Efforts of Yomtov Yacoel
   and Asher Moisis},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF GENOCIDE RESEARCH},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {21},
Number = {3, SI},
Pages = {342-358},
Abstract = {This article discusses Jewish-Gentile relations ahead of and during the
   deportation of the Jews from Thessaloniki, Greece. It focuses on Yomtov
   Yacoel and Asher Moisis, two classmates, business partners, friends and
   prominent Jewish leaders who marked with their actions Greek Jewry in
   the twentieth century. They ascended very quickly in leadership
   positions, and in their mid-30s Moisis became president of the Jewish
   Community of Thessaloniki, while Yacoel acted as the Jewish Community's
   legal advisor and also as president of B'nei B'rith. The war found the
   two childhood friends and long-time colleagues separated, Moisis in
   Italian-occupied Athens and Yacoel in German-occupied Thessaloniki. The
   article amplifies existing knowledge and offers new unknown details on
   the efforts of Greek Jews for the aid and rescue of their coreligionists
   in this critical period, showing the Jews as agents and not as passive
   victims. Yacoel and Moisis tried to reach out to Greek Christian elites
   in both cities and elicit their mobilization in support of the Jews of
   Thessaloniki undergoing Nazi deportations. Nevertheless, their efforts
   were not met with the same success: Moisis was able to mobilize a larger
   force in support of the Jews of Thessaloniki in Athens than Yacoel in
   their native city. Thus, this article argues that in some cases - like
   that of the Jews in Thessaloniki - help was easier organized from the
   outside rather than from the inside. In addition, the article provides a
   detailed timeline and background on the efforts for the rescue of the
   Jews of Thessaloniki in Athens. The stories of Moisis and Yacoel make
   clear that it was often individual Jewish actions and initiatives that
   triggered efforts of aid and mobilization of solidarity by the Christian
   population. It also adds an important microhistorical approach to the
   Holocaust in Greece, laying bare the vulnerability of Jews as citizens
   in ``young{''} nation-states, during processes of consolidation of state
   structures and national identities.},

Abstract = {The article deals with the rules governing the organization of the
   Kyakhta trade in the 70-s of the XVIII century according to the
   instructions of the Irkutsk Governor, Major General Brile given to
   Kyakhta merchant companies.
   Russian historiography underestimates the involvement of the government
   in the organization of the Kyakhta trade. Interest in the instructions
   of the Irkutsk Governor is due to the fact that they reflected the
   experience of gradual development of some rules of the Kyakhta trade
   (book-keeping, debt relations with the Chinese party, confidentiality of
   information relating to commerce) and allowed to reveal new historical
   facts of the involvement of Russian authorities in the Kyakhta trade
   streamlining
   The creation of three manuals within a short period of time (November 7,
   1769, March 5 and July 10, 177(1) also serve as an evidence of certain
   difficulties in the development of the Kyakhta trade common rules. The
   incorporation of merchants into companies required regulation of
   business management and pricing policies. The latter was associated with
   the need for Russian merchants to hide information about their goods
   from Chinese merchants in order to deprive them of the opportunity to
   influence the pricing.
   No less important for merchant companies were ethical prescriptions
   about the relationship of merchants, mutual assistance and support as
   well as penalties for violating the established rules. The instructions
   of the Irkutsk Governor were aimed at subordinating the personal
   interests of individual merchants to the common interests of the
   merchant class.},

Abstract = {Given US President Donald Trump's uncertain commitment to Europe's
   defence, calls for greater European strategic autonomy have grown
   louder. However, Benjamin Shreer argues that while the approach of
   Trump's government is certainly complicating transatlantic security
   relations, the current arrangement for Europe's defence - anchored on
   NATO for collective defence and complemented by EU military capabilities
   for limited out-of-area operations - is unlikely to change. A US
   withdrawal from NATO is equally doubtful, as is the prospect that
   European countries will become serious about developing strategic
   autonomy.},

Abstract = {After the war against Russia broke out in 2014, numerous militias were
   formed in Ukraine. Some of them were founded by members of radical
   right-wing organisations. The Kyiv-2, Sich, Karpatska Sich, Azov, DUK PS
   and UNSO militant groups were created by men who had already organised
   paramilitary exercises during the 1990s, who had worked for security
   guard firms, or who were involved in protection rackets. Most of them
   belonged to the ``Maidan self-defence forces{''} during the protests in
   the winter of 2013/2014. Contrary to what is often claimed, however, the
   level of influence of these militant groups and their ideology is low.
   Since 2015, they have been almost entirely insignificant.},

   present the following collated review of the three volumes of Amin's
   memoirs, which were only just completed with the posthumous publication
   of The Long Revolution in 2019. Amin was, I argue, perhaps the first,
   and certainly the most prolific, global organic intellectual in history.
   That is, he wrote as a social act, to try and change the world, not
   simply understand it, and he did so on the world scale proper to his,
   and indeed our time. His life and work, therefore, ought to be of
   interest to scholars working to establish the field of global
   intellectual history, develop critical analyses of global accumulation,
   and of course, activists interested in a truly global praxis.},

Pages = {143-161},
Abstract = {What is the meaning and role of civil society in Afghanistan? And what
   contribution could civil society actors make to promoting peace and
   political reform? Drawing on a research and dialogue project conducted
   in 2009-2012, this article explores local understandings and practices
   of civil society in Afghanistan, and examines their relationship to
   security and social change. It argues that studying civil society can
   help shed light on the changing dynamics of political authority and
   security in the country, as well as offer new avenues for promoting
   progressive change. The article addresses some of the conceptual and
   analytical limitations of dominant narratives about civil society in
   conflict-affected environments, demonstrating how they tend to neglect
   certain forms of agency that have the potential to be transformative.},

   Russian literature},
Journal = {OSTEUROPA},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {69},
Number = {9-11},
Pages = {203+},
Abstract = {Russian literature is currently experiencing a comeback of the family
   novel. In this genre, questions surrounding Jewish identity are also
   discussed. Particularly good examples are Ludmila Ulitskaya's Jacob's
   Ladder, Maria Stepanova's Post-Memory and Elena Chizhova's A City,
   written from Memory. The authors consider the relationship between
   family memory and the official culture of memory and show how Jewish
   self-identity in Russia is now unfolding in the field of tension between
   family origins, anti-Semitism and the culture of remembrance. It is
   precisely in the ambivalences, breaks and gaps in their autofictional
   texts that there lies a realistic core. They refer to the irreparable
   injuries of the past and the decline of Jewish culture in the present.},

Title = {Living Together in the ``Yidishe Gas{''}: The Case of Antwerp},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF GENOCIDE RESEARCH},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {21},
Number = {3, SI},
Pages = {436-455},
Abstract = {Interwar Antwerp was home not only to a rapidly expanding Jewish
   community composed predominantly of first- and second-generation
   newcomers, but also to growing antisemitic and right-wing tendencies
   amongst the general population. These tendencies contributed
   significantly to the fact that the racial persecution during the Second
   World War struck Antwerp's Jewish population severely. This history
   would hardly lead one to envision that, before or after the war, there
   had been harmonious neighbourhood life where Jews and non-Jews shared
   public space and in some cases established friendships. However, we do
   read accounts of pleasant neighbourly relations. This study seeks to
   explore this seemingly contradictory image and to offer suggestions for
   bridging the gap between micro- and macro-history via the sociological
   concept of social identifications and proximity. By examining the lives
   of two particular Jewish families from a bustling, diverse neighbourhood
   where Jews and non-Jews lived alongside each other, we can draw a
   picture of these families - one a religious Orthodox family, the other
   Dutch and fairly assimilated - and their respective relationships with
   the larger community around them before, during and after the Second
   World War. The dynamics at such a micro-level allow us to process
   information that at a macro-level is difficult to grasp or explain. It
   offers examples - such as where ``disappointed friendships{''} were
   nevertheless able to remain intact after the war, where Orthodox Jews
   refused help from non-Jews, and where collaborators saved Jews - that
   can be explained by social identification or its lack thereof.
   ``Proximity{''} played a key role in social identifications and this
   concept helps to fill in the missing interpretational link between, on
   one hand, the macro-image of victims, bystanders and perpetrators and,
   on the other hand, the micro-level, which presents a far more tangled
   and unclear (sometimes even contradictory) division of these categories.},

Abstract = {The 2016 presidential nominating process presented the American public
   with an interesting and tumultuous set of contests. Despite the unique
   nature of both the Democratic and Republican contests, the candidates
   stuck to the usual campaign activities to help influence voters.
   However, one of these campaign tactics, campaign visits, has been vastly
   understudied. Using a uniquely compiled dataset and a hierarchical
   linear model, I am able to test how campaign effects, including visits,
   as well as an individual's predispositions impacted vote choice in the
   2016 presidential nominating contests. The results demonstrate that the
   2016 presidential nominating contests were decided based on a
   combination of both campaign activities and individual-level predictors.},

Abstract = {While newly contested issues connected with internationalism, such as
   European integration and migration, have become more politically
   salient, much of the literature sees these as largely the domain of
   ideologically extremist and challenger parties. By contrast, building on
   work by Kriesi et al, this article argues that international issues are
   far more embedded in party stances across the left- right spectrum than
   the niche and extremist models or Kriesi et al suggest. Accordingly, we
   develop a typology for categorizing parties according to their stances
   on left-right ideology and their positions on integration. Our analysis
   employs expert surveys on the stances of all electorally significant
   parties conducted in 24 European countries in 2013. The results have
   important implications for understanding the impact of international
   issues on how parties now appeal to voters.},

Abstract = {The contributions in this volume discuss legitimacy as an ``essentially
   contested concept{''}. The empirical study of legitimacy raises
   theoretical, conceptual, and methodological questions. However, there
   are also a number of aspects on which the contributors to this volume
   agree: Legitimacy is a relational concept, it describes a relationship
   between the governed and the governed and combines normative and
   empirical approaches. However, it is debatable whether the normative
   dimension can be tight or should be strongly conceptualized. Therefore -
   and in order to capture the complexity of the relationship between the
   governed, the governed and their effects on legitimacy - qualitative and
   quantitative methods can be combined. Moreover, with the European Union,
   a new addressee of legitimacy claims and bearer of legitimacy has
   entered the political science scene. Finally, autocracies also make
   targeted use of certain policies and client-specific services to
   legitimize themselves. The contributions in this volume have underscored
   and elaborated on what we discussed in the introduction and in a
   conceptual chapter: legitimacy is an ``essentially contested
   concept{''}, and the empirical study of legitimacy raises a number of
   theoretical, conceptual, and methodological questions this volume
   depicts them. We deliberately did not suggest to the authors how to
   define the concept. Thus, the chapters show the breadth of the debate
   surrounding legitimacy, as well as the possible definitions and uses of
   the term, the closely related concept of legitimation, and other related
   concepts such as identification, trust, and support. But there are also
   a number of aspects on which the participants in this volume agree.},

Abstract = {For the US House of Representatives, Cox and McCubbins discover tiny
   majority-party roll rates and offer them as evidence of majority-party
   agenda control. However, the observed roll rates are approximately what
   would result from chance alone or from chance constrained in several
   natural ways. Besides that, we show that rolls themselves are not
   evidence of any lapse in partisan agenda control and may even occur as
   the intended consequence of agenda setting by the majority party.
   Innovations include a solution to the combinatorial problem of counting
   all possible rolls, the associated computations, hypothetical examples
   of strategically advantageous self-induced rolls, and a review of likely
   real examples of the same.},

Abstract = {This study investigates the influence of MPs' co-sponsorship activities
   on their agenda-setting success. It analyses the strategic choices open
   to MPs who engage in co-sponsorship, the resulting centralities in the
   co-sponsorship network, and the effects on the success of parliamentary
   proposals. MPs can develop their co-sponsorship efforts within their
   party family ('bonding') or beyond it ('bridging'), and they can use
   co-sponsorship both to receive political support ('support-seeking') and
   to provide it ('support-providing'). The success of these different
   co-sponsorship strategies is empirically assessed here by investigating
   the acceptance or refusal of parliamentary proposals introduced in the
   Swiss Parliament from 2003 to 2015. The bridging/support-seeking
   strategy that pro-actively recruits co-sponsors across party families is
   the most rewarding. This holds especially for MPs belonging to pole
   parties, who overall appear as more sensitive to centrality-related
   effects than MPs of moderate right parties.},

Abstract = {This paper explores the texts of the state/national anthems of five
   states created out of the SFR Yugoslavia: Croatia, Macedonia,
   Montenegro, Serbia and Slovenia. While the lyrics of these anthems offer
   little if any information about the identity of their singers, the
   anthems function well as national markers of the singers. While most of
   them originate in the nineteenth-century poems/songs, from 1989 onwards,
   they were transformed, through special legislation, into state anthems;
   their transformation into state anthems was part of the legal
   preparation for the creation of the new states out of the
   Communist-ruled federation. The state anthems of Bosnia and Herzegovina
   and of Kosovo have no lyrics and are consequently not explored in the
   article.},

Abstract = {How does a candidate's position in the polls affect the decision to go
   negative? The endogenous nature of campaign negativity and the relative
   position of a candidate in the polls raises questions about the causal
   relationship of these two variables in previous observational studies of
   campaigns. To address this problem, this paper uses an experiment
   embedded in a survey of campaign practitioners to evaluate the role of
   poll positioning on the use of campaign negativity. Political operatives
   are more likely to advocate for negative campaign tactics when they are
   told a campaign is behind than when they are told the campaign is ahead.
   Moreover, a competitive race is more likely to encourage negativity from
   the favored candidate than a blowout. This study finds that if the
   pathway to electoral victory is more difficult, campaign practitioners
   are more likely to encourage the use of negative campaign tactics.},

Abstract = {The Anthropocene, understood from the perspective of the creators of
   Earth System Science and IPCC, calls for global governance, which tends
   to be understood as an epistocratic, technocratic affair leaving little
   room for reflective rationality and politics in the agonistic sense.
   Using the republican repertoire, I argue that global governance thus
   understood is actually the last thing we need. I suggest that global
   environmental institutions ought to be based on `constitutional
   republicanism'. Key elements of this approach are a Machiavellian
   appreciation of discord, agonism and `the political', combined with a
   realistic assessment of the very diverse interests at stake in global
   climate politics, hence very diverse ideas about the benefits and
   burdens of specific global environmental strategies; and institutions
   based on ideas uniquely developed by republicans from Machiavelli to
   Mouffe allowing for human and science's fallibility on the one hand,
   irreducible moral and political diversity on the other.},

Abstract = {This article presents theoretical and methodical as well as pragmatic
   basis of the theory of mentality of diasporas and provincial communities
   which is just taking shape in domestic legal and political knowledge.
   Great attention is paid, in particular, to legal mentality of diasporas'
   representatives manifests itself in a different way in the social space
   of a multinational state. The authors of this work believe that turning
   to steady in time mental attitudes common for representatives of
   different diasporas is necessary first of all for forming an adequate
   political and legal strategy of the national development, for pursuing
   relevant legal policies in different Russian regions. The contents and
   peculiarities of the legal mentality of diasporas and provincial
   communities should be taken into account in the process of defining
   priorities of reforming the legal and political system, choosing ways
   and methods of changes in the legal, political and socioeconomic fields.
   Besides, thorough research of legal mentality of different diasporas
   will give a chance to find out the ethnocultural component of dynamics
   in social processes and to assess them (e. g. in the issues of level of
   riskogenicity and conflictogenicity), to outline possible results and
   perspectives. The article considers features of legal mentality of the
   diasporas of the Far Eastern region of Russia as a specific example.},

Abstract = {The Great Recession that hit the world in 2008 functioned as a critical
   juncture, nurturing socioeconomic but also political transformations.
   Some of the political developments during the crisis have challenged
   civil, political and social rights, triggering a Great Regression. In
   the geographical areas that have been hardest hit by the financial
   crisis, particularly in the European periphery, waves of protest have,
   however, challenged the austerity policies adopted by national
   governments under heavy pressure from lending institutions including the
   European Central Bank, the European Union (EU) and the International
   Monetary Fund. This has put democracy under stress, but also triggered
   at some capacity for innovation. While some have considered the multiple
   crises as proof that governments need more technical expertise, others
   have blamed an ``econocracy{''} that has taken over political decisions
   while pretending they are not political. Siding with this second vision,
   I will suggest in these notes that what we need is more, rather than
   less participation in democracy. I develop my argument by summarising
   some recent reflections in the social sciences on the challenges that
   the financial crisis poses to democracy, and the ways to address those
   challenges.},

Abstract = {The Bank of England played a key role in the management of the 2007-2008
   financial crisis, a decade after being granted independence, and has
   since become an increasingly powerful monetary and financial actor.
   However, most accounts of the financial crisis in the UK have tended to
   approach the management of the crisis in terms of unified state action.
   This paper argues that this approach is limited as it ignores how the
   conflicts and tension between the now independent Bank of England and
   the British government shaped the response to the crisis. It is argued
   that we need to have a clearer understanding of how states and central
   banks interrelate in order to understand both the management of the
   crisis and the implications of the emerging monetary and financial
   order. Specifically it is argued that central banks and other state
   agencies engage with finance differently and face different problems in
   doing so and thus develop potentially conflicting strategies. Central
   banks, as distinct from other state agencies, should be perceived as key
   structural actors in order to understand the development of the crisis
   and the implications of the post-crisis regime.},

   social capital that prioritizes the capacities, knowledge and
   organizational experiences displayed by the most vulnerable social
   sectors. In this sense, social interactions begin to play a key role in
   the achievement of fundamental self-management experiences in local
   development that are not unrelated to personalist leadership and to the
   processes of client co-optation that reduce critical autonomy and

Abstract = {Within the framework of the golden communication triangle (Perloff,
   2008) and general mediatization concept, a particularly big number of
   theoretical analyses and empirical studies have been devoted to
   relations between political actors and the media. However, qualitative
   on-the-ground research among Central and East European party elites
   concerning their understanding of the media and journalists' roles in
   political communication is still rare. Taking into account the observed
   deficit, this article examines the implications of mediatization in a
   competitive model of democracy (Stromback, 2005) and suggests political
   actors' dichotomic perception, rooted in a confrontation between
   political logic and media logic (Brants \& Voltmer, 2011). As a
   reference point in this study, several specific features pertaining to
   the media system were adopted. Many evidences were found, that
   politicians perceive the role of the media differently and they base
   their perception on using dichotomies. Nevertheless, politicians
   accurately diagnose and evaluate the consequences of the mediatization
   process. The empirical results provide evidence gathered from
   semi-structured interviews conducted among 59 top representatives of six
   relevant political parties in Poland.},

Abstract = {There is an exceptional character to the Canadian federation when it
   comes to dynamic de/centralization. Despite expectations that forces of
   modernization and globalization centralize federations, Canada's overall
   ``federal balance'' has remained largely stable since 1867. Early in the
   federation's life, there was decentralization in the fiscal realm and in
   a few policy fields (e.g., finance and securities as well as employment
   relations). The last several decades have witnessed decentralization in
   several policy fields, such as agriculture, citizenship, and
   immigration, and natural resource, but also centralization in such
   crucial ones as social welfare and language. The overall slight
   decentralist path of the Canadian federation occurred primarily through
   non-constitutional means. Court decisions played a significant role in
   shaping this path early on, but it is the territorial diversity of the
   country, primarily but not exclusively nationalism in Quebec, along with
   the original centralized nature of the Canadian federation, that
   fundamentally accounts for why Canada has not centralized like so many
   other federations.},

Abstract = {Many of the central concerns of international relations war, diplomatic
   relations, international trade and investment, and alliance politics are
   also central to the state-making processes that are essential for the
   survival of states. The overlap between international relations and
   state making is profound but largely unrecognized. I present a framework
   emphasizing connections across these currently disparate areas of
   scholarship, thereby providing a more comprehensive basis for IR
   research. The framework I advance emphasizes the pursuit of capacity and
   legitimacy throughout a state's existence, suggests new research topics,
   and raises new concerns about research design.},

Abstract = {This article examines some of the linkages between trade rules and
   climate action, and identifies how trade rules might be made to support
   the fight against climate change. Multilateral environmental agreements
   have included provisions on trade and some have even included the
   protection of the environment in the preamble. Similarly, regional and
   bilateral trade agreements include some additional obligations, such as
   the obligation to have high environmental standards. However, it remains
   that certain trade rules may limit climate measures. Changes to such
   rules would assist in allowing measures to be used in the transformation
   to low carbon economies. Other options include the use of a climate
   waiver or an interpretation of the rules to allow certain climate
   measures.},

Title = {A Critical and Theoretical Re-imagining of `Victimhood Nationalism': The
   Case of National Victimhood of the Baltic Region},
Journal = {BALTIC JOURNAL OF EUROPEAN STUDIES},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {9},
Number = {4},
Pages = {206-217},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {There are many arguments to support the idea that the Baltic nations
   (and other ``victimized{''} areas) adhere to `victimhood nationalism', a
   form of nationalism that explains the region's recognition of its
   history and the related problems. Since the start of the 21st century,
   memory and area studies experts have used the concept of `victimhood
   nationalism'. However, the framework of victimhood nationalism is
   critically flawed. Its original conceptual architecture is weak and its
   effectiveness as an explanatory variable requires critical examination.
   This paper presents a theoretical examination of victimhood nationalism
   from the perspective of political and social historiology. Further, the
   paper criticizes the concept from the perspective of the empirical area
   studies of the Baltic region. First, it argues that the killing or
   damaging of one community by another does not automatically transform
   into a nationalism of victimhood. Unless it has been established that
   one community was the `victim' and the other the perpetrator of the
   crime, these events will not be remembered as the basis of victimhood
   nationalism. Second, the effectiveness of this concept is criticized
   from two perspectives: ``tangle{''} as an explanatory variable and its
   doctrinal history. It is tautological to claim that victimhood
   nationalism explains political issues, as was already being implied in
   the early twentieth-century collective memory studies. In conclusion,
   the assumption of victimhood is a preliminary necessity to a community
   claiming victimhood nationalism. Victimhood nationalism is not an
   explanatory, but an explained, variable. Therefore, the concept should
   be renamed otherwise. The alternative framework of collective memory
   studies framework of ``victimhood{''} is needed. This research argues
   that Baltic area studies, particularly regarding history recognition,
   should be phenomenologically reconsidered to reimagine the framework of
   ``victimhood{''}.},

Abstract = {In many low-income countries, persons with disabilities are consistently
   denied access to essential services, contributing to a high incidence of
   poverty among them. The Goal 1 of the Sustainable Development Goals
   (SDGs) exhorts countries to develop appropriate social protection to
   serve as a springboard to alleviate poverty among all persons. The
   government of Ghana has introduced Disability Fund to provide one-off
   financial support to persons with disabilities through its decentralised
   political units. This is to enable persons with disability to
   participate in socio-economic activities. However, after a decade of the
   establishment of the fund, anecdotal evidence still shows that many
   persons with disabilities continue to live in deplorable conditions.
   Therefore, the main aim of this qualitative study was to explore the
   beneficial impact of the fund on the lives of persons with disabilities
   in Ghana. A semi-structured interview guide was used to collect data
   from 48 participants, comprising 20 males and 28 females with
   disabilities. The narratives from the participants revealed that only a
   few were able to access the fund. In their quest to access the fund,
   participants encountered barriers, such as lack of information, delays
   in disbursement and insufficient funds. The findings underscore the need
   for re-evaluation of the administration of Disability Fund and its
   disbursement processes. The implications of the findings for policy
   reform are extensively discussed.},

Abstract = {Part of the project ``Dynamic De/Centralization in Federations,'' this
   article measures dynamic de/centralization in India since its founding
   in 1950 and seeks to account for observed patterns in terms of changes
   over time. India's federation was considerably centralized at birth
   across its legislative, administrative, and fiscal dimensions. It has
   since undergone further cumulative centralization in the legislative
   sphere, while little change has occurred in the other two spheres. The
   principal instruments of dynamic centralization have been constitutional
   change and court rulings. Several aspects of India's constitutional
   framework have facilitated the further accretion of legislative powers
   to the center. Centralization has been driven by a desire for policy
   uniformity and an emphasis on national interests and security. The
   transformation in the party system since the 1970s has not had a
   discernible impact on the system's degree of de/centralization. In turn,
   India's extreme societal diversity has not presented a major obstacle to
   centralization or produced significant demands for decentralization.},

Abstract = {Against the backdrop of the recent reform of data protection law in the
   EU and Germany, this contribution analyzes to which extent data
   protection control differs between the German federal states. Whereas
   data protection law is set at EU level, the oversight takes place at the
   national level or, as in the German case, on the sub-national level.
   Relying on a qualitative analysis of the 18 independent data protection
   authorities in Germany, we found variety in their activities within a
   relatively uniform regulatory environment. The authorities differ with
   regard to their action orientation, their action, their regulatory
   knowledge and their external communication. An important dimension of
   differentiation is a tension between preventive and sanctioning
   oversight activities. In addition, German data protection authorities
   have developed different fields of expertise and communication. This
   paper has not aimed to find determinants for this variety. However, we
   found tentative evidence that the authorities' resources, their
   political culture and policy entrepreneurs were important factors for
   their choice of preventive versus sanctioning measures. In contrast, we
   found no clear evidence about the importance of the German division
   between East and West, regulatory competition and party politics. Our
   findings demonstrate which oversight strategies and measures are
   currently utilized by German data protection authorities to ensure an
   overall high level of data protection. They furthermore indicate various
   measures of how to prevent the regulatory competition in data
   protection.},

Abstract = {Ideological commitments to neoliberalism have re-shaped demo-cratic
   institutions. Situating public higher education as an institution of
   democracy, this article identifies and unpacks the ways in which
   traditional approaches to leadership learning and development in public
   higher education a \& xfb03;rm neoliberal ideology in the United State
   of America (USA). Artificially produced consumer demand for specific
   types of leadership education in higher education are increasingly
   positioned to play on the social, political, and economic insecurities
   of those disadvantaged by neoliberal ideology. The ``Tripod Ontology{''}
   of leader, follower, and shared purpose is proble-matized through the
   political lens of power and choice. A critical ontology of leadership
   education and devel-opment in higher education that resists neoliberal
   ideology will center practices of immanent critique. Interpretative work
   that creates space for dialogue, relationship, and everyday practice can
   become part of the ontological basis of a critical approach to
   leader-ship learning and development in higher education.},

Abstract = {This article analyses democracy in post-communist Croatia 1990-1999 and
   2000-2011. During the first decade, political stagnation occurred under
   a competitive authoritarian regime. This ended abruptly and there was a
   critical juncture, during which a free and fair election marked the
   start of Croatian democracy in 2000. I first propose a causal chain to
   explain the election results, suggesting that the occurrence of the
   election, combined with other necessary factors, revealed the
   population's underlying preference for democracy. Internally, this
   preference then served as a positive feedback mechanism throughout
   Croatia's rapid increase in democracy as it became a candidate for
   European Union membership and finalized accession negotiations.
   Externally, the European Union influenced democratic progress,
   particularly via conditionality policies. This historical comparative
   analysis aims to explain which factors allowed for a rapid increase in
   democratic quality, positioning the 2000 election results as the main
   influence.},

Abstract = {Existing research suggests that tax-reliant governments are more
   accountable to citizens. This pattern is consistent with micro-level
   evidence that citizens who are taxed are more willing and able to make
   demands on leaders. However, there is no evidence on whether elected
   officials themselves view citizen pressures to spend tax and non-earned
   incomes differently. Using survey experiments conducted on elected
   municipal officials in the US, we find that officials report that taxes
   are less likely to be misused, relative to outside grants, and more
   likely to be spent on citizens' preferences. This is driven by the
   perception that electoral penalties are higher when tax funds are
   misused. Officials believe citizens feel stronger ownership over local
   tax funds and seek more information about how they are used.},

Abstract = {According to the presumption of equality, cases should be presumed to be
   similar when it is not known whether they are similar or different. When
   an allocative agent is unaware either of the appropriate distributive
   criterion or people?s relevant features (or both) and she cannot
   postpone the allocation, then she should distribute goods equally. I
   explore the nature and justification of the presumption of equality and
   bring out how commentators have confused it with the claim that all
   people are relevantly similar and therefore deserve similar treatment,
   unless there is a specific reason for different treatment. The claim of
   prima facie equality concerns substantive criteria of justice and should
   not be confused with the presumption of equality. I will also argue that
   in some cases, an allocative agent can easily justify the use of the
   presumption of equality and equal distribution by referring to the
   relative costs of potential errors. However, I conclude with a
   discussion of the overall significance of the presumption of equality by
   considering cases that reveal some important limitations on its use.},

Abstract = {In considering the widely held view that we have experienced an era of
   qualitative decline in policy provision, this paper briefly reviews four
   questions that appear to underlie such a view. Have there been
   identifiable transitions in deliberative processes, political practices
   and policy capacity in recent decades (and if so, what were the
   catalysts)? Has the relationship between policy practitioners and expert
   providers of policy advice changed (and if so, how)? Have channels of
   communication between the political/policy community and the research
   community deteriorated (and if so, why)? Has the political appreciation
   of public concerns and the public understanding of policy imperatives
   diminished? We use these to frame the results of a workshop in which
   researchers, policy practitioners and service providers participated.
   Our objective is to identify systematically the origin of contemporary
   policy problems, foreshadowing four articles that illuminate instances
   of success and failure in disruptive times.},

Abstract = {Many scholars expect that the ``party decides{''} on presidential
   nominees who are both electable and willing to pursue an agenda
   acceptable to the supporting coalition. By most accounts, the nomination
   of Donald Trump does not fit these expectations. Did most party insiders
   view Trump as unelectable and unacceptable? If so, how did the
   Republican Party coalition react to his unlikely nomination? To address
   these questions, we content analyze endorsements of Trump and construct
   an endorsement network of the coalition behind Trump's candidacy. We
   show that Trump received little support from party insiders prior to his
   nomination, and that policy considerations were relatively unimportant
   to Trump supporters throughout the election. Instead, when faced with an
   undesirable nominee, party insiders reacted by supporting Trump for
   electoral reasons. Our results suggest that party insiders are not
   immutable arbiters in presidential primaries and that most will
   prioritize partisan ambitions over policy goals.},

Abstract = {Are legislators responsive to the priorities of the public? Research
   demonstrates a strong correspondence between the issues about which the
   public cares and the issues addressed by politicians, but conclusive
   evidence about who leads whom in setting the political agenda has yet to
   be uncovered. We answer this question with fine-grained temporal
   analyses of Twitter messages by legislators and the public during the
   113thUSCongress. After employing an unsupervised methodthat classifies
   tweets sent by legislators and citizens into topics, we use vector
   autoregression models to explore whose priorities more strongly predict
   the relationship between citizens and politicians. We find that
   legislators are more likely to follow, than to lead, discussion of
   public issues, results that hold even after controlling for the
   agenda-setting effects of the media. We also find, however, that
   legislators are more likely to be responsive to their supporters than to
   the general public.},

Abstract = {Can cultural differences affect economic change? Max Weber famously
   argued that ascetic Protestants' religious commitments-specifically
   their work ethic-inspired them to develop capitalist economic systems
   conducive to rapid economic change. Yet today, scholars continue to
   debate the empirical validity of Weber's claims, which address a vibrant
   literature in political economy on the relationship between culture and
   economic change. We revisit the link between religion and economic
   change in Reformed Europe. To do so, we leverage a quasi-experiment in
   Western Switzerland, where certain regions had Reformed Protestant
   beliefs imposed on them by local authorities during the Swiss
   Reformation, while other regions remained Catholic. Using 19th-century
   Swiss census data, we perform a fuzzy spatial regression discontinuity
   design to test Weber's hypothesis and find that the Swiss Protestants in
   the Canton of Vaud industrialized faster than their Catholic neighbors
   in Fribourg.},

Abstract = {Political representation in European democracies is widely considered
   partisan and collectivist. This article, however, stresses that there is
   more to the representative process in European democracies than just its
   textbook version. It emphasizes the role of geographic representation as
   a complementary strategy in party-dominated legislatures that is
   characterized by two distinct features. First, legislators employ
   distinct opportunities to participate in legislative contexts to signal
   attention to geographic constituents without disrupting party unity.
   Second, these activities are motivated by individual- and district-level
   characteristics that supplement electoral-system-level sources of
   geographic representation. We empirically test and corroborate this
   argument for the German case on the basis of a content analysis of
   parliamentary questions in the 17th German Bundestag (2009-13). In this
   analysis, we show that higher levels of localness among legislators and
   higher levels of electoral volatility in districts result in increased
   geographic representation.},

Abstract = {Is labour mobility in the European Union a threat to the strength of
   unions? We argue that the combination of cheap labour, workforce
   heterogeneity and low unionisation among labour immigrants is a
   potential challenge for unions. The challenge will be severe if
   immigration affects natives' unionisation. We use Norwegian
   administrative data in a natural experiment framework to examine this
   claim. The 2004 European Union expansion led to a rapid increase in
   labour migration to the building and construction industry, but
   licensing demands protected some workers from the labour supply shock.
   We show negative labour market effects for workers exposed to labour
   immigration, but no effect on union membership. Our results question
   theories of unionisation and are relevant for research on immigration,
   political behaviour and collective action.},

Abstract = {This article argues that with the `Rise of the Informals' the
   traditional conception of status in international relations is outdated.
   Whereas through the nineteenth and twentieth centuries status was
   primarily created by the consequences of war, in the twenty-first
   century attributions of status are more explicitly institutional based.
   With the shift from small concerts to larger apex forums, therefore,
   opportunities to shape status standing are extended. This process of
   `democratization' in terms of global governance leadership is especially
   important for a mixture of states without the structural capability of
   great powers. If a function generally of the type of agency, however,
   the importance of leaders is highlighted. The G20 underscores this
   theme, although the dynamic of `democratization' must be examined
   through different stages of institutionalization. Even with these
   nuances, though, it is the differences as much as the similarities with
   traditional fixed hierarchies that comes to the fore.},

Abstract = {The mutual dependence between courts and their compliance constituencies
   is a fundamental feature of judicial power. Actors whose rights and
   interests are reinforced by court decisions may use these as legal
   ammunitions while contributing to ensuring that court decisions are
   effectively implemented. We argue that judgments that contain dissenting
   opinions are less powerful in this regard, compared with unanimous
   decisions. The reason is that dissent reduces the perceived legal
   authority of the judgment. Using data from the international human
   rights judiciaries in Europe and the Americas, we provide evidence of a
   negative relationship between judicial dissent and compliance. Our
   findings have important implications for questions relating to the
   institutional design of courts, for courts' ability to manage compliance
   problems, and for understanding the conditions for effective
   international judicial protection of human rights.},

   Composition, White Racial Threat, and Legislator Partisanship},
Journal = {STATE POLITICS \& POLICY QUARTERLY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {20},
Number = {1},

Abstract = {Most research studying minority representation concludes that minorities
   enjoy better representation when they constitute a larger share of a
   constituency, but only through the partisanship and race/ethnicity of
   the representative. Other research finds that minorities receive worse
   representation when they constitute a larger share of a constituency. We
   argue that minority composition will have an independent effect on
   representation, but that this effect will differ depending on the
   representative's partisanship. We apply our theory to Latino composition
   and state legislative voting on immigration policy and find that Latino
   composition has no effect on voting among Democratic legislators, who
   are less likely to vote in a restrictive direction on immigration than
   Republicans regardless of the Latino composition in their district.
   However, Republicans are more likely to vote to restrict immigration as
   Latinos comprise a larger share of their district. Our findings suggest
   that scholars should consider the moderating effect of legislator
   partisanship when examining minority composition and representation.},

Abstract = {Practice turn marks an important advancement in International Relations
   theorizing. In challenging abstract meta-theoretical debates, practice
   theorizing in International Relations aims to get close to the
   lifeworld(s) of the actual practitioners of politics. Scholars from
   different positions such as constructivism, critical theory, and
   post-structuralism have critically interrogated the analytical framework
   of practices in international politics. Building upon these works, we
   are concerned with a question of how to examine the context of
   international practices that unfolds in multiple ways in practitioners'
   performances. Our central thesis is that a distinct pragmatic
   methodology offers an opportunity to keep with the practice turn and
   avoid the problematic foundational moves of mainstream practice
   theorizing. This involves foregrounding three interrelated processes in
   examining practices: the role of exceptions in the normal stream of
   performances, normative uptake of the analysts, and the semantic field
   that actors navigate in political performances. We argue that this
   methodology is predicated on its usefulness to interpret practices
   through reflective social-science inquiry.},

Abstract = {This special issue was written to reflect on the current role of human
   rights in the United Kingdom, seventy years after the United Nations
   General Assembly voted in favour of the Universal Declaration of Human
   Rights. Human rights are explored by the authors in this issue from a
   wide variety of perspectives. Some authors are critical of the failure
   of the state to implement human rights principles in practice; others
   lament how human rights often appear of little relevance to most
   people's lives in the UK. The overall message, however, remains
   consistent: a human rights framework brings many positive elements to
   our country, ensuring it is a society where individuals, no matter their
   actions or characteristics, are treated with dignity.},

Title = {The Evolution of the National Security State in Pakistan: 1947-1989},
Journal = {DEMOCRACY \& SECURITY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {15},
Number = {4},
Pages = {301-327},
Month = {OCT 2},
Abstract = {Since its inception in 1947, Pakistan has perceived serious threats to
   its national sovereignty and territorial integrity from neighboring
   India. As a result, Pakistan adopted a state-centric national security
   approach to counter local and regional threats to its security during
   the Cold War period. By plugging into Cold War rivalry between the
   United States and the Soviet Union, Pakistan secured American support to
   help develop and consolidate a national security state that was focused,
   above all else, on a perceived local threat from India. Over time, the
   country was able devote substantial amounts of domestic and
   international resources to the imperative of national security.
   Meanwhile, the Pakistani military became a prominent institution in the
   formulation and execution of the country's foreign and security
   policies. The article seeks to chart the distinctive evolution of the
   national security state in Pakistan from 1947 to 1988 and to demonstrate
   that the Pakistani model has gone much further than its American
   counterpart in institutionalizing the leading role of the military in
   the making of security and foreign policy.},

Abstract = {Post-apartheid democratic South Africa experienced the pitfalls of
   one-party dominance when the country's fifth democratically elected
   parliament (2014-2019) faced growing corruption, state capture,
   undermining of parliamentary oversight and the abuse of political power
   and state institutions. These events threatened the country's
   constitutional democracy and its principles of an accountable government
   as the ruling party undermined parliamentary oversight structures
   through majoritarianism to evade accountability by the Legislature and
   Executive. This led to the growing coexistence and cooperation of
   opposition parties (despite their ideological differences) in
   parliamentary oversight as a means of challenging the African National
   Congress' (ANC) one-party dominance. This process resulted in the
   establishment of formal and informal coalitions for governing key cities
   such as Johannesburg, Tshwane and Nelson Mandela Bay. Against this
   backdrop, and building on a case study of these three metropolitan
   municipalities, this paper analyses the coexistence of the opposition
   parties in parliamentary oversight and in the governance of key cities
   as a means of challenging the ANC's one-party dominance. The analysis
   delineates the prospects and challenges of using coexistence as a
   strategy for challenging the ANC's one party-dominance post the 2019
   general election.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE EDUCATION},

Volume = {15},

Abstract = {Political theory instructors are often familiar with the syllabus themed
   ?Liberalism and its Critics.? Liberalism, however, is often narrowly and
   teleologically defined as the progressive expansion of human freedom.
   Further, counter or alternative narratives leave students as mere
   critics without constructive insight into the balance of individualism
   and cosmopolitanism. With these problematic approaches in mind, this
   article offers a civic republican viewpoint to supplement the limited
   approaches in ?Liberalism and its Critics.? The course proposed by the
   authors reframes common methodology to include civic republicanism as a
   parallel and sympathetic intellectual development to liberalism, at
   times intertwined, and at others anticipating and supplementing its
   deficiencies. This article first shows the deficiencies of the
   inadequate narrative/counter-narrative approach and highlights why civic
   republicanism presents a novel approach to teaching theory. The authors
   then provide a possible course description with specific learning
   outcomes, a recommended course structure with suggested readings, and
   some concluding considerations on implementing such a course.},

Abstract = {This article examines the relationship between protest and voting by
   revisiting Booysen's `ballot and the brick' thesis. Booysen argued that,
   in South Africa, protest forms part of a `dual repertoire' that poor
   communities use to fight for service delivery between elections but that
   protesters, ultimately, remain loyal to the African National Congress
   (ANC). Since Booysen first elaborated this argument the political
   landscape has altered considerably. The ANC has suffered declines in
   electoral support at a time when protest across many social spheres has
   been increasing. Yet, there is little scholarship that attempts to
   examine the relationship between these two phenomena. This article
   addresses this gap through the analysis of data collected in three
   surveys of South African voters. Our analysis reveals that while the ANC
   remains the party of preference of both voters who have not engaged in
   protest and those that have not, we find that opposition parties are, to
   a greater extent, characterised by voting protesters. We suggest that
   party loyalty to the ANC has become a much less binding constraint on
   voting protesters' indirect and direct political actions.},

Abstract = {We study loss aversion in elections by investigating a median voter
   model (full convergence in a two-candidate election) and a model of
   partial divergence of policy proposals. First, we show a status quo
   bias, an endowment effect, and a moderating effect of policies. Second,
   we show the occurrence of ``long-term cycles{''} in policies with
   self-supporting movements to the right or the left. Finally, we prove
   that younger societies should be more prone to change and less affected
   by the status quo bias than older ones.},

   COALITION FORMATION IN LATIN AMERICA},

Abstract = {The purpose of this article is to explore coalition formation in
   presidential systems using evidence from Latin America. It puts forward
   three hypotheses based on formateur power, electoral structures and
   party systems to explore when and why electoral and government coalition
   formation occurs. It uses evidence stemming from eighteen democratic
   presidential regimes in Latin America from 1980 to 2010. It looks at 100
   elections and 407 aggregate years of democratic government. It analyses
   data organized in a cross-sectional time-series fashion through a logit
   function with random effects and robust standard errors. It finds that
   in democracies with weak presidents, restrictive electoral rules and
   highly fragmented party systems, the president will seek the support of
   multiple parties. While the effective number of parties is the most
   important determinant, rules related to legislative elections are more
   important predictors of electoral coalitions, and those related to
   presidential elections are more important predictors of government
   coalitions. The findings in this article are important insofar as
   yielding critical insight into partisan strategies in both the run-up to
   elections and the maintenance of governments, as well as contributing to
   a general theory of coalition formation.},

Title = {Punishing campus protesters based on ideology},

Abstract = {Recent protests on university campuses have inspired conservative claims
   that liberals allow partisanship to color their judgement of disorderly
   activists. Prior research suggests, however, that both ideologies are
   prone to political bias. Furthermore, because conservatives are
   typically more concerned with orderliness and authority, there are
   theoretical reasons to expect conservatives to respond more forcefully
   to protests than liberals, especially when those protesters are
   political opponents. Using an experimental design with two samples, one
   with Mechanical Turk participants and the other with current college
   students, the study finds support for the hypotheses that (1)
   conservatives are more punitive towards protesters than liberals, (2)
   both ideologies are more likely to punish when protesters are their
   political opponents, and (3) conservatives' responses to protesters are
   more sensitive to their ideology than liberals'. These results support
   recent studies of the psychology of political ideology and punitiveness.},

Abstract = {The Cox proportional hazards model is a popular method for duration
   analysis that is frequently the subject of simulation studies. However,
   no standard method exists for simulating durations directly from its
   data generating process because it does not assume a distributional form
   for the baseline hazard function. Instead, simulation studies typically
   rely on parametric survival distributions, which contradicts the primary
   motivation for employing the Cox model. We propose a method that
   generates a baseline hazard function at random by fitting a cubic spline
   to randomly drawn points. Durations drawn from this function match the
   Cox model's inherent flexibility and improve the simulation's
   generalizability. The method can be extended to include time-varying
   covariates and non-proportional hazards.},

Abstract = {Position change is an essential feature of political competition.
   Implicitly, policy change on an issue dimension is often equated with
   opinion change on specific issues within that dimension. However, in
   addition to opinion-based policy change, we highlight that parties and
   candidates can change their overall position by increasing their
   emphasis on certain opinions within that issue dimension (emphasis-based
   policy change). Using party manifesto data, we find that parties differ
   in their use of each type of policy change based on aspects of party
   organization, particularly the relative power of leaders and activists.
   Leader-dominated parties are more likely to engage in opinion-based
   policy change, also in reaction to systemic policy shifts. In contrast,
   activist-dominated parties tend to change their overall position in
   reaction to systemic shifts by emphasizing certain positions more. Our
   approach links salience-based to spatial models of party competition and
   has broader implications for how we study party competition.},

Abstract = {From campaign rhetoric to tweets, President Trump has positioned himself
   as ``disrupter in chief,{''} often pointing to administrative action as
   the avenue by which he is leaving a lasting mark. However, research on
   the administrative presidency begins with the premise that all
   presidents face incentives to use administrative tools to gain
   substantive or political traction. If, as this article suggests, Trump's
   institutional standing differs little from his recent predecessors, then
   how much of the Trump presidency represents a change from past norms and
   practices? How much represents continuity, or the perennial dynamics of
   a far-from-omnipotent executive in an ongoing world of ``separate
   institutions sharing powers{''} (Neustadt 1990, 29)? To answer this, we
   tracked presidential directives and regulatory policy during Trump's
   first year in office. We found evidence of continuity, indicating that
   in its use of administrative tactics to shape policy, the Trump White
   House largely falls in line with recent presidencies.},

Abstract = {The rise of populism coincides with a new wave of anti-intellectualism,
   articulated in the ``War on Science.{''} This paper argues that there is
   no empirical evidence that the global surge of populism is accompanied
   by a general anti-science trend. However, there are similarities between
   the dissemination of scientific falsehoods in mass media and social
   media and the ways populist politicians use media to their end. First,
   this paper analyzes the history and the underlying sociological,
   psychological and cultural causes of the anti-science dispositions.
   Then, through the case studies of the U.S., Russia, Turkey and Hungary,
   the attitudes populist leaders exhibit towards science is discussed.
   Finally, the paper synthesizes the applicable scholarly literature from
   various disciplines to create an adequate framework for a comprehensive,
   multi-disciplinary communication strategy for the pro-science camp.},

Title = {Brexit and Fisheries: Fish and Chips Aplenty?},
Journal = {POLITICAL QUARTERLY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {90},
Number = {4},
Pages = {611-619},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {When discussing Brexit and food, fisheries take a special place: first,
   because the fisheries sector punched far above its (economic) weight in
   the campaign leading up to the Brexit referendum; second, because of the
   promise of a bright future for the fishing industry-both by politicians
   promising to `take back control of our waters' as well as by industry
   representatives auguring a `sea of opportunities' for fishermen. As it
   is still far too soon to assess fully the effects of Brexit for the
   fishing industry and the market for fisheries products, this paper takes
   a step back and analyses the context within which the changes brought
   about by Brexit will be taking place. It analyses the complexity of the
   post-Brexit fisheries context and its possible repercussions for food
   policy and the seafood sector. One of the central questions is whether
   Brexit could contribute to reviving the fisheries industry and enhancing
   food security in the UK. To explore this further, two other questions
   present themselves: when is fish UK fish? And what do UK consumers want?
   Finally, the paper looks at the structure of employment in the seafood
   industry and how that may present policy makers with difficult
   decisions. The paper concludes that the picture when it comes to the
   effect of Brexit on fisheries policy is expected to be mixed, and that
   both the potential benefits and costs of Brexit are likely to be
   unevenly distributed within the fisheries sector.},

Abstract = {Based on interviews with 21 immigrants in Norway, including both
   naturalized citizens and `denizens', this article addresses immigrant
   meanings of citizenship and naturalization. The findings show that the
   interviewees attributed three meanings to citizenship. First, Norwegian
   citizenship served as a powerful means of spatial mobility, thereby
   facilitating transnational connections. Second, citizenship signified a
   legal stability that may guard precarious immigrants against `liminal
   legality', i.e. enduring legal uncertainty. Third, citizenship was
   conceptualized as a formal recognition of equality and belonging,
   although `race' and ethnicity persisted as salient markers of inequality
   and alienage. The article contributes empirically to the growing
   literature on the experiencing side of citizenship and naturalization by
   delineating what citizenship means to different groups, and to whom it
   matters the most. Theoretically, it contributes by demonstrating that
   citizenship acquisition may not only be strategic, but also rooted in

Abstract = {This article will examine whether the demands for social justice during
   the citizen-led assemblies ({''}plenums{''}) in February 2014 in
   Bosnia-Herzegovina (BiH) triggered electoral change in cantonal
   elections in the Bosniak-Croat entity (the Federation of BiH, or FBiH).
   Extant analyses underline the perennial weakness of Bosnian civil
   society, and the stasis in the ethnified political party system, even in
   the wake of the protests in 2014. However, these studies only look at
   the aggregate level and do not differentiate between places where
   plenums were established and those where they were not. To address this
   gap, the present article will differentiate, following Engin Isin,
   between ``active citizenship{''} and ``activist citizenship{''} as the
   basis for the conceptual framework. A difference-in-differences analysis
   will be employed using municipal-level FBiH cantonal election results
   from 2006, 2010, 2014, and 2018. There are two main questions in the
   study. First, was there a significant electoral change in municipalities
   with plenums compared with places without a plenum? Relatedly, did the
   change differ amongst the main parties? The article will thus link
   active and activist citizenship in the post-conflict and post-socialist
   setting of BiH.},

Abstract = {According to Duverger's Law, plurality voting systems lead to two-party
   competition. However, many results of national parliamentary elections
   deviate from this rule. In contrast to previous research, which argues
   that in countries with territorial splits, regional two-party systems
   aggregate to national multi-party systems, this article shows that this
   explanation accounts for only a small proportion of the empirical
   exceptions to Duverger's Law. Instead, this article distinguishes three
   explanations for Non-Duvergerian outcomes at the national level. The
   three mechanisms relate to the level of electoral constituencies, to the
   aggregation of constituency results, and to the interaction between
   constituency- and aggregation effects. This article assesses the
   explanatory power of each of the three explanations on an extensive
   sample of election results from plurality vote systems, linking national
   to constituency-level results.},

Abstract = {In Cote d'Ivoire, eight years after the civil war, initiatives for
   improving the conditions of a still-polarised society through parallel
   civil and political reconciliation mechanisms are underway.
   Institutionalised reconciliation commissions are flanked by new
   electoral alliances and the return of well-known players. All of these
   trajectories have the ability to further dialogue if they overcome
   narrow group interests and dedicate themselves to the greater good of
   the country, i.e. if they join forces, at least to some extent.
   Democratisation as a common goal will play a crucial role in every
   regard. If combined and successful, these initiatives could turn out to
   be exemplary for other Sub-Saharan African nations too - but only if
   everything goes extremely well, and all actors accept the teachings of
   the case and are willing to compromise on multiple levels, write Roland

Abstract = {What systematic influence does the court exert on unilateral authority?
   Though questions relating to the expansion and the exercise of
   unilateral executive power remain a perennial concern in political
   science, existing studies of the unilateral presidency generally focus
   on relations between the executive and the legislature, with less
   attention paid to the impact of the judiciary on executive behavior.
   Using a system of differential equations to model executive
   unilateralism and judicial constraints, simulation results identified
   four broad patterns of unilateral executive behavior and judicial
   influence. Overall, presidents strategically anticipate reactions from
   the courts and employ unilateral actions accordingly. Although they are
   cognizant of the court's ability to strike down their actions, and
   thereby harming their preferred policy preferences and legacies,
   presidents nonetheless act unilaterally, albeit at a lower level.
   Results add to existing studies in separation of powers and constraints
   on unilateral executive behavior.},

Abstract = {Here is a sketch of a genealogy of political theory for the last
   century. This is a genealogy in Nietzsche's sense: therefore, neither
   unhistorical taxonomy, nor a history of political theory as it is
   written by historians, but a typology in time. Four types of modern
   political theory are distinguished. These are called, with some
   justification, positive, normative, third way and sceptical political
   theory. Seen from the vantage of the twenty-first century, they form an
   instructive sequence, emerging as a series of reactions to the canonical
   political theory that was established in the universities in the late
   nineteenth century. None of the four should be excluded from our
   conception of what political theory has been, though most of them, when
   seen genealogically, reveal their defects more clearly than they do when
   treated purely theoretically. Since this is a sceptical finding, the
   genealogy is a polemic against the first three types of modern political
   theory in favour of the last.},

Abstract = {This article explores how conventional military doctrines shape
   U.S.-China military engagement in the West Pacific under varying degrees
   of cooperation, competition and potential conflicts. Although military
   doctrines possess a certain level of influence on the ways and means of
   engaging each other in military terms, such engagement is not confined
   to using deadly force with a clear aim to destroy the other party.
   Instead, these doctrines can act as an instrument to forestall conflicts
   by maintaining credible deterrence. As rational actors that follow clear
   rules of military engagement, both the United States and China are fully
   aware of the defensive, offensive and deterrent value of their
   respective military doctrines, as well as the consequences of a
   potential conflict; and they have tried to expand cooperation on a
   number of non-traditional security issues. However, given their forward
   deployment-oriented military doctrines and the rising role of non-state
   actors, the United States and China are very likely to be engaged in an
   unintended escalation of conflicts if each holds a rigid view toward the
   other's military doctrine and fails to maintain stable military ties
   based on timely communication and constructive interaction.},

Abstract = {The positive influence of foreign direct investment (FDI) on host
   countries' economic growth has been widely debated. Given the mixed
   empirical evidence, scholars have sought to find the economic
   preconditions under which FDI spillovers are likely to occur and
   facilitate economic growth in the host countries. Those preconditions
   are not exogenously dictated but largely shaped by governments' policy
   preferences. Particularly in autocracies, an autocrat's policy
   preferences are the driving force that determines whether a host country
   is likely to be equipped with growth-friendly institutions and policies.
   We argue that such economic institutions and policies are dependent on
   the time horizons of autocrats in power. Our empirical analysis covering
   64 autocratic countries from 1970 to 2005 supports our main argument
   that FDI has a positive effect on growth when autocratic time horizons
   are sufficiently long, and positive FDI spillovers mainly occur through
   the protection of property right institutions.},

Abstract = {The aim of this paper is to explore whether and how discourses in
   Icelandic public policy documents reflect a) the democratic role of
   universities and b) universities' role in preparing students for
   responsible participation in a democratic society. Key policy documents
   related to Icelandic universities were analysed. The documents present
   university policy on three levels; a) the current official policy
   presented by the national authorities, b) the current policy of
   individual universities, and c) the most recent annual reports published
   by each university. These three levels were selected to explore the
   topic from the stage of formal policy making, to the purposes each
   university has defined for itself, and to reported actions in the
   institutions that adhere to the policy. In sum, the findings indicate a
   lack of conceptualisation of the democratic role of universities in
   official policies. While the university institutions report on current
   themes in the international discourse, vaguely related to the critical
   public and civic role of universities, quality and competitiveness are
   central discursive themes, obscuring discourses on the democratic role.},

Abstract = {Attitudes towards immigration are among the core predictors of attitudes
   toward the European Union. However, even though most citizens learn
   about immigration through the media, we lack a comprehensive account of
   how media coverage of immigration influences support for the European
   Union. In this study, we use a combination of European Social Survey and
   Media Claims data to investigate the effects of the visibility and
   valence of immigration and refugee media coverage on political trust in
   the European Union in 18 countries between 2012 and 2016. Our results
   show that media coverage of immigration and refugees influences trust in
   the European Union; however, the effects depend on citizens' ideological
   leaning and content characteristics. Furthermore, we find that the
   impact of immigration attitudes on trust in the European Union becomes
   more important over the course of the refugee crisis.},

Abstract = {Why do some transnational advocacy groups adopt radical, confrontational
   tactics whereas others focus on `inside' lobbying and information
   provision? Why do some advocacy groups appeal to large global audiences
   while others approach decision-makers behind closed doors? Bringing
   together interest group studies and population ecology theory, this
   article examines how population ecological dynamics affect strategic
   specialization among transnational advocate groups. I argue that
   increasing resource competition resulting from `organizational
   crowding', along with the introduction of new legal and technological
   tools has led to growing strategic differentiation among transnational
   advocates, and has prompted a strategic division of labor whereby some
   groups (mainly larger, well-established and resource-rich groups)
   specialize in gaining political access and media attention, while others
   (mainly smaller, less established groups) focus on developing `niche'
   agendas and strategies including, inter alia, radical protest,
   monitoring and enforcement, and litigation. I illustrate my argument
   with quantitative data and comparative cases from the realm of
   transnational environmental conservation advocacy.},

Abstract = {Research suggests that modernization is an important driver of
   liberalization in the field of gay and lesbian rights. Surprisingly, it
   has often been assumed-but not empirically examined-that a culture of
   tolerance mediates the relationship between socioeconomic modernization
   and liberal legislation. This article closes this gap by analyzing the
   seventy-three countries that took part in the fifth and sixth waves of
   the World Values Survey. As government responsiveness to public
   attitudes is structurally enforced by means of electoral accountability
   in democracies, but not in autocracies, we, in addition, distinguish
   between these regime types in an analysis of moderated mediation. We
   show that tolerant attitudes toward homosexuals do, indeed, mediate the
   influence of modernization on gay and lesbian rights policies in
   democracies, but not in autocracies. The result is confirmed by
   extensive robustness checks, including an instrumental variables
   approach to account for a potential reverse causality between tolerance
   and rights. The study does not only underline the relevance of cultural
   aspects of modernization, but also points to the crucial importance of
   regime type for a translation of public opinion into policy.},

Title = {The state of the field of Chinese political science: ``Glocalising{''}
   political science in China?},
Journal = {EUROPEAN POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {18},
Number = {3},
Pages = {456-472},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {This article aims to provide an overview of the general development of
   Chinese political science and a critical analysis of the problems and
   challenges faced by Chinese scholars. The development of Chinese
   political science is characterised by institutionalisation,
   professionalisation, and internationalisation on the one hand, and
   tensions between Westernisation and indigenisation, scientification and
   methodological pluralism, and the ``ivory tower{''} and political
   relevance, on the other. The debate centres on contending beliefs on the
   nature of political knowledge and ways to convert understanding of
   Chinese politics into knowledge and shows a serious tension and conflict
   between scientific, universalistic, and positivist traditions on the one
   hand and particularistic, historical, and contextual traditions on the
   other hand. We argue that a ``glocalisation{''} approach might be
   adopted to integrate ``globalisation{''} and ``localisation{''} of
   Chinese political studies by exploring the reciprocal influences of the
   two aspects, being methodologically both ``scientific{''} and
   ``pluralistic{''}, and balancing between scholarship and public
   relevance. We hope to help Western academics learn about achievements
   and struggles in the study of political science in China, and also to
   push Chinese political science to engage more with the rest of the
   world.},

Journal = {WEST EUROPEAN POLITICS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {43},
Number = {6},
Pages = {1211-1237},
Month = {SEP 18},
Abstract = {While many studies have identified an association between social class
   and economic preferences, we know little about the implications of
   changes in class location for these preferences. This article assesses
   how social class and intra-generational class mobility affect economic
   preferences drawing on longitudinal data from the British Household
   Panel Survey. In doing so, the article adopts a post-industrial
   perspective that considers horizontal and vertical class divisions. Even
   when time-invariant characteristics of individuals are kept constant
   (through fixed-effects estimation), it is found that both vertical and
   horizontal class location explain economic preferences. Thus, these
   estimations suggest that social class moulds preferences, even when
   accounting for factors that can lead to selection into classes.
   Moreover, people who change classes hold different economic preferences
   than their peers in the class of origin, but do not completely
   assimilate into their class of destination. This implies that growing
   intra-generational class mobility could undermine the class basis of
   political conflict.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF ELECTIONS PUBLIC OPINION AND PARTIES},
Year = {2019},
Month = {2019 AUG 21},
Abstract = {Why do parties change their policy positions? A growing literature
   suggests that the internal balance of power between leaders and
   activists affects how a party responds to changing environmental
   incentives. This paper explores when and how party organization matters
   for party strategy. It argues that a key prediction - that
   leadership-dominated and activist-dominated parties are responsive to
   the positional shifts of the mean voter and the party voter,
   respectively - is conditional on two factors, namely a party's electoral
   performance and party system polarization. Cross-sectional time series
   analyses of fifty-five parties in 10 European democracies between 1977
   and 2003 confirm that (1) leadership-dominated parties' responsiveness
   to the mean voter decreases as their electoral fortunes improve, (2)
   increases as a party system becomes more polarized, while (3)
   activist-dominated parties more reliably follow the positional shifts of
   the party voter. This study's findings have important implications for
   our understanding of how intra-party politics influences inter-party
   competition, and thus democratic representation more generally.},

Abstract = {Issue ownership theory suggests that candidates should focus on the
   issues that are owned by-or associated with-their parties and mostly
   avoid issues that are owned by the opposing party. Doing so allows them
   to focus on their own party's strengths rather than on their weaknesses.
   Despite this expectation, contemporary research finds that candidates
   discuss both their own party's issues and trespass by talking about
   issues owned by the opposing parties. I argue that issue ownership
   cues-subtle information cues linking candidates to parties through the
   discussion of party-owned issues-should have heterogeneous effects
   across partisan groups. Using a survey experiment, I show that
   copartisans prefer candidates who focus on issues owned by their parties
   while opposing partisans prefer candidates who trespass; independents'
   preferences do not appear to shift in response to these cues. It thus
   appears as if cuing people to connect candidates to one party or the
   other can inform citizens' levels of support for those candidates.
   Depending on the composition of the electorate, trespassing can be an
   advantageous strategy for candidates.},

Abstract = {The impact of age on voting behaviour and political outcomes has become
   an issue of increasing interest, particularly in the UK. Age divides in
   voter turnout and political preferences have led to claims that age is
   the `new class'. In this article, we contrast existing `cultural
   backlash' and political economy explanations of the age divide in
   politics, and challenge the view that older people are predominantly
   `left behind', culturally or economically. We show that older people
   have distinct material interests, related to housing wealth and
   pensions' income, that are visible in their political preferences. We
   argue for the development of a new political economy of age.},

Abstract = {In Switzerland, polio was eradicated in 1989; however, individuals
   infected with the virus in the 1940s and 1950s are still alive today.
   Decades after their infection, many polio survivors were subsequently
   affected by post-polio syndrome (PPS) - a cluster of long-term
   consequences from the initial virus leading to further disabling
   symptoms. During the course of their lives, they had to deal with their
   changing bodies and, consequently, changing needs in a fluctuating
   social environment. They have engaged in citizenship projects by having
   to articulate their bodies in contradictory ways to negotiate the Swiss
   welfare system and to become rights-bearing citizens. By analysing their
   different citizenship projects, the article focuses on the multiple
   roles the body plays in this process. Using ethnographic data, the
   article analyses how the body is articulated to claim disability-related
   citizenship rights by looking at issues of work, disability activism
   and, finally, PPS in old age.},

Abstract = {This paper examines so-called verification commissions in Brazil that
   have to decide whether those who applied for affirmative action
   vacancies for black candidates `correctly' declared themselves as such.
   Analyzing three repertoires through which the commissions take this
   decision, the paper shows how the subject that is entitled to
   affirmative action - the cotista (quota candidate) - comes into being in
   these classification practices. Discussing the tension between the idea
   of a social gaze - due to which `everybody' knows who is black in Brazil
   - and that of a skilled gaze one has to learn in order to work in a
   verification commission, I show how the latter arises from the attempt
   to handle the contradictory demands the commissions are facing and how
   it helps to `objectivize' the commissions' decisions. By way of
   conclusion, I point out how my study can contribute to a better
   understanding of processes in which citizenship rights are granted
   `through the body'.},

Abstract = {We investigate the path-dependent effects of subnational variation in
   authoritarian state-building policies on voter-party linkages after
   regime change. We argue that long-term patterns of regional favoritism
   and marginalization produce patterned regional heterogeneity in the
   attitudes and preferences linking voters with parties. Postcolonial
   state-building policies create ``winners{''} and ``losers{''} from
   particular interventions, in turn shaping local citizens' preferences
   over these policy areas and forming axes of contestation ready to be
   activated by democratic politics. We argue that attitudes associated
   with regionally consistent state-building policies should function
   uniformly as determinants of vote choice across regions, while attitudes
   associated with regionally divergent state-building policies should
   experience patterned regional variation in their effect on vote choice.
   We develop these arguments empirically with historical analysis of
   Tunisian state-building and an original exit survey of voters in five
   diverse regions conducted on the day of Tunisia's first democratic
   legislative elections in 2014. Our findings contribute to a growing
   literature on the importance of analyzing political transformation at
   the subnational level.},

Abstract = {How do institutional logics travel within a political economy? Employing
   insights from historical and ideational institutionalist theory, this
   article offers a novel understanding of change dynamics as driven by
   actors' creation of institutional interlinkages. It develops the causal
   mechanism of ``invasion from within,{''} consisting of a three-stage
   process: the progressive weakening of a policy paradigm within one
   institutional site coinciding with a strengthening of the policy
   paradigm in another; the building of a coalition within the exporting
   field; and the use of framing strategies to ``localize{''} adjacent
   logics of action and delegitimize adversarial coalitions. The analytical
   purchase of the argument is corroborated through process tracing of the
   German pension paradigm shift during the 1990s, showing that ideas about
   private capital formation developed in finance were redirected toward
   old-age provision and strategically transferred to the pension arena by
   a coalition of actors from the German finance domain.},

Abstract = {Given his extensive use of Twitter, the ways in which Donald Trump uses
   this platform are subject to a number of scholarly analyses. These
   generally attribute the success of Trump's tweets to the ways in which
   he uses the features Twitter offers. Adopting a perspective of political
   marketing, I regard Donald Trump as a political product that is marketed
   through political branding. Drawing on the literature on celebrity
   politicians and based on a sample of 1469 tweets that were posted by
   Donald Trump's personal Twitter account between March 2016 and April
   2017, I argue that Donald Trump's image marketing strategy produces a
   new brand that distinguishes Donald Trump from his competitors and
   predecessors: the superhero anti-politician celebrity. The analysis
   furthermore shows that in contrast to the assumption formulated in the
   literature on celebrity politicians, this brand does not contribute to
   reinvigorating democracy, because it is based on contempt of the
   existing political system.},

Abstract = {How do MPs in nascent legislatures choose a political party? We argue
   that MPs self-select into groups of like-minded colleagues to achieve
   favored policy outputs. MPs identify colleagues with similar preferences
   based on observed behavior and informative signals such as socioeconomic
   status, cultural background, and previous political experience. We test
   this explanation in the first democratically elected German parliament,
   the Frankfurt Assembly of 1848, that developed a differentiated party
   system in the absence of electoral and career incentives. Our
   statistical analysis shows that MPs were significantly more likely to
   join parties that were similar to them with regard to ideology, age,
   regional provenance, confession, noble status, and previous
   parliamentary experience. Qualitative evidence suggests that major
   changes in the party system were driven by disputes over policy. Our
   findings are particularly important for countries with more turbulent
   paths towards parliamentarization than those witnessed by archetypical
   cases like Britain or the United States.},

Pages = {1069-1093},

Abstract = {Focusing on the critical Hungarian case, this article analyses the fate
   of embedded neoliberal capitalism in the wake of the global financial
   crisis. The changes include policies to combat foreign dominance in the
   financial, energy, and retail sectors, and efforts to reform and
   retrench the hitherto relatively generous welfare state. Nevertheless,
   the article finds no less evidence of continuity than of change: the
   politicisation of fighting dependency is combined with the quiet
   politics of subsidising foreign direct investment in manufacturing, and
   the noisy politics of protecting pensioners and middle-class families
   parallels the erosion of future-oriented social investment.
   Notwithstanding the radical turn in development rhetoric, the actual
   path correction has merely shifted the pattern of dependency without
   breaking out of it: financing socio-economic development in Hungary (as
   in other Visegrad states) is still largely dependent on foreign sources,
   albeit of a more diversified nature, including not only manufacturing
   FDI, but the EU's structural funds and migrant labour's remittances as
   well.},

Abstract = {Racial inequality in Puerto Rico is not only a taboo subject in the
   public sphere, it is a concealed one. Despite the national denial,
   nonwhite Puerto Ricans are racially marginalized, experience racism in
   their daily lives and are underrepresented in various institutions.
   There are few nonwhite political candidates and officeholders, yet the
   connections between race and politics are seldom discussed. How then, if
   at all, does race matter politically for nonwhite Puerto Ricans? This
   article finds that although the silence about racism influences identity
   politics and consideration of a candidate's race, it does not obscure

Abstract = {Recent research has shown an increasing interest in the historical
   evolution of legislative institutions. The development of the UK
   Parliament has received particularly extensive attention. In this
   article, we contribute to this literature in three important ways.
   First, we introduce a complete, machine-readable data set of all the
   Standing Orders of the UK House of Commons between 1811 and 2015.
   Second, we demonstrate how this data set can be used to construct
   innovative measures of procedural change. Third, we illustrate a
   potential empirical application of the data set, offering an exploratory
   test of several expectations drawn from recent theories of formal rule
   change in parliamentary democracies. We conclude that the new data set
   has the potential to substantially advance our understanding of
   legislative reforms in the United Kingdom and beyond.},

Abstract = {Social democratic parties are crumbling at the polls. Surprisingly,
   however, the causes of this demise remain largely unexplored. This
   article contributes to filling this gap in the research by studying the
   long-term impact of welfare state generosity on the vote share of social
   democratic parties in 16 Western European democracies. If the welfare
   state indeed was a key factor behind social democratic growth in the
   past, we ask whether the recent plight of these parties is down to a
   reversal of their previously dominant success factor? The article makes
   three principal findings. First, we show that social democratic parties
   primarily benefited electorally from expansive reforms at lower levels
   of welfare state generosity. Second, we find that this dynamic of
   diminishing returns also helps explain the demise of the Social
   Democratic party family in the whole of Western Europe. Lastly, our
   results reveal that programmatic turns to the right predict electoral
   losses in the least generous welfare states, whereas such shifts either
   pass unnoticed or predict vote gains in the most generous ones. We
   conclude by arguing that the structure of welfare state institutions is
   one important explanation for variations in the demise of the once
   powerful Social Democratic party family.},

Abstract = {This article reflects on the prohibition of slavery set out in article 4
   of the 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and analyses efforts
   undertaken in the years since to fulfil this commitment. It first
   addresses the evolution in the prohibition from historic forms of
   slavery to contemporary forms of slavery and human trafficking. Second,
   the article examines the Modern Slavery Act 2015 and the National
   Referral Mechanism to appreciate the UK's efforts to implement various
   international commitments to prohibit slavery, noting that the current
   focus towards criminalisation and the meagre support offered as victim
   protection does not constitute a sufficiently comprehensive strategy
   towards effective prohibition. Third, areas for reform are identified
   that could reorient government strategy toward more effective victim
   protection and support, starting with better identification of victims.
   And finally, the article argues in favour of actions that seek to
   prevent modern slavery crimes and abuse, including with a more robust
   regulatory framework that engages private sector actors to recognise the
   risks of slavery and exclude forced labour from supply chains.},

Abstract = {How do the labels left and right take on meaning in new democracies?
   Existing explanations point to the universality of the left-right scheme
   or, reversely, emphasize regionally dominant social cleavages. We
   propose an alternative legacy-focused theory based on two observations:
   Dictatorships are not ideologically neutral and are negatively evaluated
   by most citizens and elites after democratization. These premises lead
   us to expect that when the authoritarian regime is associated with the
   left (right), the citizens of a new democracy will display an antileft
   (antiright) bias in their left-right self-identification. We test this
   hypothesis across Latin American and European new democracies. We find
   significant bias, which in the case of new democracies following
   left-wing regimes is concealed due to intercohort heterogeneity.
   Although older cohorts denote a positive bias, cohorts born after
   Stalin's era denote negative bias against the left. Consistent with our
   expectations, repression exacerbates this bias whereas indoctrination
   mitigates it. Finally, we look at how these biases apply to party
   preferences. The findings have important implications for understanding
   authoritarian legacies and party system development in new democracies.},

   Cohen and Dawson's {[}1993. ``Neighborhood Poverty and African American
   Politics.{''} The American Political Science Review 87: 286-302.]
   highly-cited study of neighborhood poverty's impact upon African
   American political participation and Dawson's {[}1994. Behind the Mule:
   Race and Class in African American Politics. Princeton, NJ: Princeton
   University Press.] seminal study of Black linked fate. Our analysis of
   Black and Latino/a subsamples of the 2016 Collaborative Multiracial
   Post-Election Study (CMPS) data yields three principle findings. First,
   somewhat contrary to Cohen and Dawson {[}1993. ``Neighborhood Poverty
   and African American Politics.{''} The American Political Science Review
   87: 286-302.], we find contextual poverty has no statistically
   significant effect upon African American political participation;
   however, we find it significantly and negatively effects Latino/a
   political participation. This may speak to how contemporary forms of
   economic segregation impact Latino/a communities. Second, we find linked
   fate has positive and statistically significant effects upon Black and
   Latino/a political participation, which reinforces Dawson's {[}1994.
   Behind the Mule: Race and Class in African American Politics. Princeton,
   NJ: Princeton University Press.] previous findings. And third, beyond
   the scope of the aforementioned works, we find that face-to-face
   neighbor interactions positively and significantly promote Black and
   Latino/a political participation. In conclusion, we discuss how, despite
   changing political and economic contexts, Dawson's work remains relevant
   for understanding Black (and Latino/a) political participation.},

Abstract = {The objective of this article is to analyze the legal regulations
   related to the management control of infrastructure contracts in the
   decentralized entities of the Government of the State of Zulia that
   administer infrastructure contracts, taking as key informants the
   management personnel of: Housing and Urbanism (Rafael Center Urdaneta,
   SA-CRUSA and the Zuliano Institute of Housing-INZUVIS), Health
   (Foundation for the Promotion of Health Zulia-FUNDASALUD), and Roads
   (Foundation for the Development of Infrastructure.) The results revealed
   that the procedure corresponding to the contracts of infrastructure are
   legally theoretically very well posed, however the reality found within
   the entities, showed that the quantitative indicators used in the
   entities do not guarantee a transparent execution of the contract, as
   they are not attached to the legal regulations in force in terms of
   management control It is concluded that the legal regulations 1
   stipulates the necessary parameters for management control, however,
   weaknesses were evidenced in the institutions studied.},

Title = {BATNA: Perceived Leverage through Positive Illusion in Conflicts},
Journal = {CONFLICT STUDIES QUARTERLY},
Year = {2019},
Number = {28},
Pages = {16-32},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {The paper explores the influence of a positive illusion of power (to
   control) in resolving a buyer-seller conflict. Here, the positive
   illusion is the negotiator's perception about the best alternative to a
   negotiated agreement (BATNA) as attractive, when it is not really so.
   The paper explores a buyer-seller conflict and explores the impact of
   positive illusion on buyers and sellers, behavior and their negotiation
   outcome. Postgraduates took part in a negotiation role-play and their
   responses were collected and analyzed. The findings revealed that the
   presence of the perceived positive illusion about BATNA could benefit
   negotiators to overcome a stressful conflict situation of having a
   weaker BATNA, and strike a final deal which is better than otherwise. It
   held true for both buyers and sellers, whether they offer first or not,
   in their negotiation. Findings, in the case of Indian negotiators,
   present that positive illusion of power influenced negotiators'
   perceived leverage using BATNA, anchor points, reference points, outcome
   (agreement), along with their satisfaction with the outcome. The paper
   supports that positive illusion can prove to be more advantageous. It
   also attempts to fill the gap owing to the lack of empirical evidence
   regarding positive illusion about one of the most important sources of
   power i.e., strong BATNA. The paper also discusses the implications of
   this research for other conflict studies such as diplomatic conflicts,
   WTO disputes, and other organizational and social conflicts, etc., and
   discusses future research implications.},

Abstract = {According to spatial models of elections, citizen perceptions of party
   policy positions are a key determinant of voting choices. Yet recent
   scholarship from Europe suggests that voters do not adjust their
   perceptions according to what parties advocate in their campaigns. This
   article argues that voters develop a more accurate understanding of
   parties' ideological positions following a leadership change because a
   new leader increases the credibility of party policy offerings. Focusing
   on Western European parties in the 1979-2012 period, it shows that
   having a new leader is a necessary condition for voters to more
   accurately perceive the left-right placements of opposition parties.
   Voters do not use party platforms to form perceptions of incumbent
   parties' positions, regardless of whether the leader is new or veteran.
   These results have important implications for models of party
   competition and democratic representation.},

Abstract = {Politicians bequeath an important legacy after they leave office: the
   public's memories of their time in office. Indeed, the media often
   discuss legacy concerns as a key motivation of politicians. Yet, there
   has been little empirical analysis of how politicians' legacies are
   interpreted and used by the mass public. Analyzing millions of comments
   from online discussion forums, we show that citizens frequently mobilize
   memories of past politicians in their discussions of current events. A
   randomized survey experiment rationalizes such invocations of past
   politicians: they bolster the persuasiveness of contemporary
   arguments-particularly bad ones-but only when made in the context of a
   policy domain specifically associated with a past politician. Our
   findings suggest that politicians have a strong interest in cultivating
   a positive, broad, and enduring legacy because memories of them
   influence policy debates long after they leave office.},

Abstract = {The politics of public policy is a vibrant research area increasingly at
   the forefront of intellectual innovations in the discipline. We argue
   that political scientists are best positioned to undertake research on
   the politics of public policy when they possess expertise in particular
   policy areas. Policy expertise positions scholars to conduct
   theoretically innovative work and to ensure that empirical research
   reflects the reality they aim to analyze. It also confers important
   practical advantages, such as access to a significant number of academic
   positions and major sources of research funding not otherwise available
   to political scientists. Perhaps most importantly, scholars with policy
   expertise are equipped to defend the value of political science degrees
   and research in the public sphere.},

Abstract = {Contemporary efforts to evaluate representation often compare survey
   measures of how citizens say they would vote on legislation to what
   elected officials do in office. These comparisons generally suggest poor
   representation. We argue here that this common design is unlikely to
   effectively evaluate representation because responses to survey
   questions differ in important aspects from voting in legislatures.
   Measurement error and construct validity undermine the comparison. Three
   survey experiments show that providing partisan and nonpartisan
   information readily available to legislators materially changes
   respondents' expressed preferences on roll-call votes. With information,
   expressed policy positions are both less centrist and more closely
   matched to legislator behavior in their preferred party. Respondents
   also appear aware of their own lack of knowledge in evaluating roll-call
   policy votes. The treatment effect of information decreases in
   confidence judging policy in that area. We show similar patterns for
   respondent opinions on Supreme Court decisions.},

Abstract = {Democratic performance and party system institutionalization (PSI) are
   thought to be integrally linked. Electoral volatility is an important
   dimension of PSI and has thus been the focus of many studies. Despite
   the attention given to electoral volatility, its determinants remain
   elusive. We examine the determinants of electoral volatility in 35
   African countries from 1972 to 2010. This study extends the prior
   literature by analyzing the effects of two previously unexamined
   variables, foreign aid and structural adjustment, on electoral
   volatility. Our results indicate that electoral volatility is lower when
   foreign aid is high, while structural adjustment programs are associated
   with increased volatility. Our findings contribute to the research on
   the political economy of aid, illustrating the impact of these economic
   practices on election outcomes. Political institutions and social
   demography also appear to affect volatility. Based on our analysis, the
   party systems of Africa generally do not appear to be
   institutionalizing.},

Abstract = {This article explores the factors affecting post-rebel party electoral
   performance. We present new research tracking the participation of these
   groups in national legislative elections from 1990 to 2016. Our full
   data set covers 77 parties and 286 elections in 37 countries. It
   includes parties formed after conflicts of varying length and intensity,
   with different incompatibilities, in every region of the world, and in
   countries with disparate political histories. Our analysis suggests that
   post-rebel parties' early electoral performance strongly affects future
   performance, and that competition - crowd-out by older rival parties -
   and pre-war organizational experience in politics have a significant
   positive effect, particularly for those parties that are consistently
   winning more than about 10 per cent of seats. But especially for parties
   that consistently win very low seat shares, organizational
   characteristics yield increasingly to environmental factors, most
   importantly the presence of rival parties and the barriers to
   representation presented by electoral rules.},

Abstract = {Sports events have had different impacts in cities such as Los Angeles
   (United States), Barcelona (Spain), Fortaleza (Brazil), Rio de Janeiro
   (Brazil) and Medellin (Colombia). The modern Olympic Games seek that
   nations gather around sports. Sports values today may go unnoticed,
   because the event is an excuse to update or to modernize the
   infrastructure and to change the land-use planning and the appreciation
   of the land.
   The article presents an explanation of the process of reproduction of
   urban space from 1999 to 2015, obtained from a study that favored a
   dialogue with both the inhabitants of Villa Suramericana and the
   officials who worked for the organization of the IX South American Games
   held in Medellin in 2010. It also shows the relationship between sports
   policy and its articulation with urban development, along with changes
   in the socio-economic conditions of its population and the appreciation
   of the land.},

Abstract = {In social movement studies, empowerment is regarded as one of the
   biographic consequences of activism and is related to social change.
   Although psychological studies show that emotions as a result of
   participating in collective actions have an essential role in the
   empowerment process, there is still little research analyzing the role
   of emotions in this dynamic process. With the study of emotions and
   protest as a starting point, and by incorporating the results of
   research conducted by psychologists who analyze social change, we seek
   to demonstrate the role of various emotions during the empowerment
   process that the members of the Mujer Nueva Collective have experienced.
   This collective comprises women who decided to self-organize after
   having participated actively in the 2006 insurgency in Oaxaca. In this
   respect, we will first analyze the change the members of this collective
   experienced. Second, we will present the emotions generated by this
   collective action that have influenced said change. Finally, we will
   explain the emotions generated by such empowerment. The results of this
   research aim to contribute to the multi-disciplinary literature that
   studies empowerment as a biographic consequence of protest and activism.},

   Brotherhood's response to repression since the coup of 2013},
Journal = {DEMOCRATIZATION},

Abstract = {This article examines the repression-dissent nexus in Islamist social
   movements. Several studies have overwhelmingly focused on the effects of
   repression on protest volume, level, and tactics. However, understanding
   the responses of individual members to regime repression and how they
   relate to the movement's collective response is rarely discussed. By
   analysing the response of the Egypt's Muslim Brotherhood to regime
   repression since the coup of 2013, this article explains the effects of
   repression on opposition movements. It argues that to understand the
   impact of repression on these movements, we need to differentiate
   between the collective and individual responses to repression. These two
   levels of analysis are crucial to better understand the
   repression-dissent nexus. Also, the article contends that collective and
   individual responses to repression cannot be explained by focusing
   solely on the structural and institutional factors (i.e. organization,
   ideology, leadership, etc.). Members' personal experiences, memory,
   emotions, and trauma play a key role in shaping their response to
   repression. The article thus accounts for both the formal and informal
   effects of repression on Islamists.},

Abstract = {One of the most fiercely debated questions about EU regulatory
   governance is the respective role played by functional and political
   factors in regulatory integration. This article contributes to this
   debate by focussing on the functional factor. Based on a refined
   conceptualisation of functional stakes, it finds that they vary across
   sectors, evolve over time, and that these variations are reflected in
   the degree of regulatory integration observed. When member states
   perceive regulatory integration as a solution to one of their most
   pressing problems of the moment, they value - and sometimes even
   actively push for - the delegation of regulatory powers to the EU. This
   argument is subject to a credibility probe based on two within-sector
   analyses of temporal patterns of regulatory integration in energy and
   telecommunications. The empirical analysis lends support to the
   conditioning role of the functional factor in the design of EU
   regulatory governance.},

Abstract = {Why do some autocratic countries attract more foreign direct investment
   (FDI) than others? Surprisingly, few studies have explored the
   considerable variation in FDI inflows to non-democratic countries. In
   this article, I argue that non-democratic countries with seemingly
   democratic political institutions, such as elected legislatures, attract
   more FDI inflow than others. This is because these institutions can (1)
   reduce the transaction costs of investment activities due to the
   relative transparency of the policy-making process, and (2) act as veto
   players, making the existing market-friendly policy changes difficult,
   and thus, promising a more stable investment environment. My empirical
   results support the main expectation that autocratic countries with
   legislatures attract more FDI than other autocratic countries, and the
   institutions' effects are conditionally modified by the quality of
   market protecting institutions.},

Abstract = {This study includes the answer to the question that may be raised
   regarding the possibility of considering the design of the interior
   decoration as classified as protected works in the UAE law, and the
   consequent enjoyment by the designer of the literary and financial
   rights of the author. Paragraph 11 of UAE Federal Law No. 7 of 2002 on
   the protection of copyright and related rights refers to the design of
   decoration as one of the examples of the technical works mentioned by
   the legislator. The answer to the questions raised in this study is
   divided into two axes: the first is the technical framework and
   guarantee the historical development of the design, the role of the Arab
   design in the development of the design of the decoration and the
   definition of the designer and distinguish it from the architectural
   design. The second axis included the legal framework and included the
   conditions that must be met in the decoration design in order to enjoy
   legal protection, the rights of the decorator and then the legal
   protection of the right of the decorator.},

Abstract = {State preemption of local policymaking has attracted increasing
   attention from scholars, public officials, and citizens, as states have
   prevented local governments from boosting the minimum wage, regulating
   firearms, and barring certain forms of discrimination, among other
   policies. Although scholars have examined the legal dimensions of state
   preemption and analyzed preemption in specific areas, we lack a
   comprehensive account of which states have adopted preemption laws and
   why some states are more active than others in adopting them. Using a
   dataset drawing on preemption legislation in seventeen policy areas, we
   test support for competing explanations for variation in adoption of
   state preemption measures. Our general conclusion is that political
   factors are more significant than institutional features in explaining
   state preemption activity. More specifically, and consistent with
   expectations, we find preemption measures are more likely to be adopted
   by Republican-controlled states. We also find that legislative
   professionalism, political culture, and home-rule status are correlated
   with the prevalence of preemption measures.},

Abstract = {This article analyzes political problems and the democratic crisis in
   Western Europe from the perspective of the rise of identity politics. It
   is argued that the root cause of the crisis lies in the Western
   democracy itself. Modern liberal democracy has encouraged the upsurge of
   active groups based primarily on their distinctive collective
   identities. With the rise of identity politics, antagonistic groups have
   struggled for recognition and expanded social divisions among the
   people, which has led to a representation crisis. Both Muslim and
   non-Muslim citizens, immigrants and non-immigrant citizens have
   expressed discontent and dissatisfaction with the democratic governments
   in almost all Western European countries, which has led to a legitimacy
   crisis. Political parties and local governments based on regional or
   religious identities have mobilized mass support for their independence
   proposals and posed serious challenges to national unity and solidarity,
   which has led to a governance crisis. Institutional redesign and
   innovation are important and imperative for overcoming these crises.},

Abstract = {Donald Trump has been an outspoken critic of NATO - insulting allies for
   spending too little on defense, questioning its eastward expansion, and
   even threatening to withdraw from the Alliance altogether. Despite
   Trump's dismissive attitude toward NATO, the Alliance is in notably good
   shape at its 70th anniversary. It has succeeded in adapting to shifting
   geopolitical conditions, addressing new threats in the broader Middle
   East while at the same time bolstering deterrence and collective defense
   against Russia. Paradoxically, Trump's criticism of NATO has actually
   strengthened the Alliance by eliciting strong support for it on both
   sides of the Atlantic and encouraging an increase in member's defense
   investments.},

Abstract = {The Belt and Road Initiative is mainly a geo-economic cooperation.
   However, in the so-called Indo-Pacific region, there are currently two
   different propositions: while one underlines the Initiative's
   geopolitical and geostrategic significance, the other demands countries
   within the region to conduct economic cooperation. The US believes that
   the BRI has geo-economical and geopolitical implications, therefore the
   potential formation of a Eurasian supercontinent and the ``new type of
   globalization movement{''} that will arise from the Initiative worries
   US policymakers. In order to prevent this from happening, American
   policy elites suggest that the US government take a multi pronged
   approach. In that regard, the Trump Administration's ``Indo-Pacific{''}
   strategy is designed to deal with the BRI and essentially contain the
   rise of China.},

Abstract = {The U.S. Constitution reserves to states the responsibility for
   regulating most aspects of elections. Recently, the Supreme Court has
   weakened the tools for federal officials to challenge state elections
   practices under the Voting Rights Act and signaled a great deal of
   deference to state authority over election law. As a result, state
   legislatures' latitude to regulate elections is constrained primarily by
   state constitutions. With voter ID laws and partisan gerrymandering
   commanding considerable attention in recent years, it is important to
   investigate the importance of state constitutions in this area. In this
   article, we discuss recent efforts by voting and election reformers to
   utilize state constitutions to challenge restrictive voting laws and
   partisan gerrymandering, whether by enacting state constitutional
   amendments or relying on state constitutional provisions in state court
   litigation. We also highlight the diverse and often underappreciated
   landscape of voting and election laws in the states and the resources
   available to reformers at the state level by analyzing state
   constitutional provisions bearing on the right to vote, voter
   registration, and redistricting.},

Abstract = {This work concerns health sector reform in Nigeria between 2003 and
   2014. Using qualitative content analysis, I investigate the factors that
   led to the reform, the reform process, and its outcome. The objective is
   to assess the conformity of the policy reform to Sabatier and Weible's
   Advocacy Coalition Framework (ACF) in order to ascertain the
   applicability, or otherwise, of the ACF in policy analysis in stable
   democratic African states. In the article, external shock, policy
   subsystem, stable parameter, technical experts, advocacy coalitions, the
   ``devil shift,{''} and policy core beliefs-which are basic components of
   ACF-were all identified in the policy reform process. I conclude that
   the ACF can be applied in policy reform in democratic African states, so
   long as there is the rule of law, a separation of powers, freedom of
   speech and association, a fairly stable political environment, and the
   presence of policy participants with expert knowledge of the policy
   issues.},

Abstract = {The European Parliament organizes its legislative activities along two
   chains of delegation to the rapporteurs - one institutional, one
   partisan. We analyze discretion and agency loss along these chains of
   delegation from the perspective of party group coordinators who select
   the rapporteur on behalf of the party group. Do coordinators minimize
   agency loss towards their national party, their European party group,
   the committee median or the plenary median when allocating reports? Data
   from the 2009-2014 legislative term demonstrate that coordinators tend
   to select rapporteurs who are close to their own national party's ideal
   point on the integration dimension. This has important implications for
   intra-parliamentary and intra-party delegation, party group cohesion and
   broader policy-making in the European Union.},

   participation in parliamentary democracies},
Journal = {ELECTORAL STUDIES},

Abstract = {A crucial difference between political systems is the nature of
   government alternation: that is, whether when a government changes, all
   parties now in government were previously in opposition ('wholesale
   alternation') or whether just some parties were ('partial alternation')
   (Mair 1997). Bergman and Strom (2011) suggest that wholesale alternation
   gives voters a clear choice between alternative governments and allows
   them to hold the government accountable, while partial alternation is
   associated with one (centre) party becoming a (near-) permanent
   government party who can govern with either the parties to its right or
   to its left. However, this relationship has not been tested. We propose
   to examine the effect of partial and wholesale alternation on turnout in
   a large-N cross-country study, showing that there is an interaction
   effect between disproportionality and wholesale turn-out. Wholesale
   decreases turn-out but only when it when disproportionality is high.},

Title = {From the `Small but Smart State' to the `Small and Entrepreneurial
   State': Introducing a Framework for Effective Small State Strategies

Abstract = {As the current international system is leaning towards multipolarity,
   small states face the danger of their influence being diminished and
   their interests being ignored. Small states in Europe and within the
   European Union might find themselves in such a predicament. In order to
   overcome it, they are in need of effective strategies. Literature on the
   international relations of small states suggests that, despite their
   limitations, small states are able to pursue their goals and succeed in
   the international system. Small state studies employ the `small but
   smart state' concept for a small state that can maximize its influence.
   Despite being widely used, the latter lacks analytical value and remains
   a cliche. The objective of this article is to pin down the `small but
   smart' state strategy and based on that to provide a comprehensive
   framework for the analysis and the design of effective small state
   strategies. We suggest that the `small but smart' state strategy shares
   many elements with the entrepreneurial action, as the latter is extended
   from its business origins to include a specific strategy. We draw on the
   field of entrepreneurship to explore the ways it can enhance our
   understanding of the international relations of small states and we
   introduce a framework for the `small and entrepreneurial state'
   strategy. The notion of the `small and entrepreneurial state' adds more
   depth and rigor into our small state analyses as well as reinvigorates a
   fragmented and repetitive literature. Last but not least, our `small and
   entrepreneurial state' approach can be of use for both small state
   scholars and policy makers.},

Abstract = {Motivated by a previous finding that single-party cues have no effect in
   Japan and by the increasing `presidentialization' of Japanese politics,
   the present study examined whether the use of prime minister cues in
   place of single-party cues helps Japanese voters form policy
   preferences. In addition, to probe the effect of party cues that are
   unique to multiparty systems, the effect of multiple-party cues, which
   indicate that a policy is supported by multiple rather than single
   ideologically distinct parties, was investigated. The results of a
   survey experiment showed that while prime minister cues are not utilized
   by the supporters of incumbent parties, the supporters of opposition
   parties demonstrated significantly reduced approval of a policy when
   there was an indication that the prime minister supported it. The effect
   of prime minister cues on opposition supporters was stronger than that
   of Liberal Democratic Party cues, suggesting that leader cues are
   effective in Japan. Furthermore, a cue indicating that ideologically
   distinct parties support a policy enhances approval for that policy
   among the public, which suggests that multiple-party rather than
   single-party cues are informative in multiparty systems. Theoretical
   implications are discussed.},

Abstract = {Since the establishment of the China-U.S. diplomatic relationship, think
   tank exchange between both countries has undergone four phases, from
   very limited communication in the early years to a growing number of
   mutual visits, co-organized conferences and events, joint research
   projects, as well as representative offices or joint research/teaching
   programs set up in the past decade. China-U.S. think tank exchange plays
   a unique role in enhancing mutual understanding and mitigating distrust
   between both countries, thus contributing to bilateral strategic
   stability and closer cooperation. Under the Trump administration's trade
   war and decoupling attempts toward China, however, bilateral think tank
   exchange has experienced a significant decline over the past few years,
   marked by increasing restrictions on each other's visits, less
   willingness of some think tanks in such exchange, and more hardline
   policy stance on each other, especially from the American side. At this
   difficult time for China-U.S. relations, bilateral think tank exchange
   should be encouraged and strengthened so as to help bring the bilateral
   relationship back on track.},

Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL THEORY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {21},
Number = {1},
Pages = {4-24},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {In recent years, there has been a wide-ranging debate about the
   neo-republican principle of non-domination. Neo-republicans argue that
   domination is a capacity for one to intentionally use arbitrary power to
   interfere in someone's life. Critics of neo-republicanism argue that
   this definition of freedom as non-domination precludes a structural
   analysis of domination, which would explain and critique the ways in
   which societies produce structural domination unintentionally. The
   article focuses on capitalism's labor process and its labor markets. It
   argues that critics are correct to think that the neo-republican
   principle of non-domination has an insufficient scope, but that an
   alternative account of structural domination should still support the
   neo-republican idea that agency must be involved. Otherwise, we might
   simply fail to explain the social processes that reproduce structural
   domination. What is needed is to explain how the labor process creates
   incentives for agents to intentionally produce structures that have
   unintended, yet dominating effects, and in turn, how the intentions of
   agents are conditioned by their social positions. Domination is thus
   agential and structural.},

Abstract = {Does the executive's institutional hegemony represent a risk to the
   survival of democracy? By hegemony, we refer to the president's ability
   to control other institutions, particularly the legislature and
   judiciary. To answer this question, we develop two indices of
   presidential hegemony and analyze the duration of democratic regimes in
   18 Latin American countries between 1925 and 2016. The results show that
   executive hegemony is a major driver of democratic instability. This
   finding is robust to non-linear effects and to potential endogeneity in
   the relationship between presidential power and democratic backsliding.
   Our findings challenge traditional concerns about executive-legislative
   deadlock, and have significant implications for the nascent literature
   on democratic backsliding, which highlights executive aggrandizement as
   a risk factor.},

Abstract = {In research on authoritarian institutions, legislatures are portrayed as
   capable of resolving dilemmas between the leader and opposition members.
   Nevertheless, repeated interactions between a leader and their ruling
   coalition can lead to both contested dictatorships, in which
   institutions constrain the leader, and established dictatorships, in
   which the leader exercises near-complete control. To date, however, no
   one has examined the patterns by which powers vary across legislatures
   in different settings and over time. Using data from the Varieties of
   Democracy Project on legislative powers between 1900 and 2017, we
   conceptualize changes in the powers afforded to the national congress to
   characterize the development of regimes in either direction. The study
   expounds on the content of legislatures across regimes and the ways in
   which they change, encouraging scholars to further consider the
   relationship between regime dynamics and legislative
   institutionalization.},

Abstract = {This introduction presents the conceptual and analytical framework which
   constitutes the background for the special issue entitled `Varieties of
   Populism in Europe in Times of Crises'. More specifically, this
   contribution investigates how different populist parties in the European
   Union have been affected by the recent economic crisis and the more
   long-lasting political and cultural crises. Analytically, the article
   disentangles the role of the Great Recession vis-a-vis other factors
   (such as political and party system factors, but also structural social
   changes or cultural opportunities) in the growing strength of populist
   parties in various European countries. It argues that although the
   economic crisis has without any doubt provided a specific `window of
   opportunity' for the emergence of new political actors, which have
   capitalised on citizens' discontent, long-lasting political factors -
   such as the increasing distrust toward political institutions and
   parties - and the more recent cultural crisis connected with migration
   issues have offered further fertile ground for the consolidation of
   populist parties in several European countries. Furthermore, as
   confirmed by the articles presented in the special issue, the various
   crises have offered differential opportunities for different types of
   populism - both inclusionary and exclusionary.},

Abstract = {In recent years, citizenship revocation has become synonymous with
   terrorism, regarded as a practice reserved for the most dangerous of
   citizens. Yet in the UK revocation has a much longer history, spanning
   over 100 years, with a narrative that extends beyond the nation-state
   and into Empire. This paper asks what may be learned from a historical
   account of citizenship revocation? Exploring its emergence as part of
   the British Nationality and Status of Aliens Act 1914, this account
   suggests that revocation should not be analyzed in isolation but as a
   practice embedded in polices of immigration, naturalization, and
   emigration. This paper illustrates the ways in which these policies code
   subjects based on race, class and gender in order to govern their
   mobility. From this study, it argues that citizenship revocation cannot
   be explained solely through security claims and suggests that the 2018
   cases should be considered in the context of revocation's history.},

Title = {The Quest for Sustainable Development in the Context of Insecurity: Some
   Critical Reflections},
Journal = {STRATEGIC REVIEW FOR SOUTHERN AFRICA},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {41},
Number = {1},
Pages = {4-19},

Abstract = {This paper considers the possibility of realizing ``peaceful and
   inclusive societies for sustainable development; providing access to
   justice for all and building effective, accountable and inclusive
   institutions at all levels specifically in Africa{''}. This is goal 16
   of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). As
   configured, peace, security and development are treated as integral
   subsets of sustainable development. The paper contends that this goal
   holds the key to the realization of other SDGs in the African context.
   In examining the achievability of this goal, the concept and essence of
   development in general and sustainable development in particular were
   examined. The paper argues that the well-being of a state and its people
   is the primary essence of development. Furthermore, development is
   considered as connoting a state's capacity to provide enabling
   conditions such as peace and freedom that sustain general well-being.
   Development is also a characteristic of a state-system which cannot
   sustain itself in the absence of peace, security and democracy. The
   approach and method followed in the paper are largely qualitative and
   analytical. Data from documentary analysis were relied upon to develop a
   conceptual framework of peace, security, democracy and development.
   Findings show that the evolvement of sustainable development remains
   difficult in Africa because Africa's development trajectory remains
   largely disconnected and disjointed. For Africa to achieve sustainable
   development goals (SDGs), serious peace and security challenges must be
   effectively addressed. Broad suggestions to ensure that well-articulated
   development paradigm in which peace, security, democracy and policy
   stability are strategically positioned, linked and integrated to the
   degree that they provide mutual support and reinforcement to one another
   are made.},

Abstract = {This article aims to analyze contemporary debates regarding education,

   approaching the importance, the role and the type of education and
   knowledge that are relevant, are based on alternative visions with
   respect to human nature structured on different logical-epistemic
   approaches. While some positions associate education as a mechanism of
   individual emancipation, others consider that it is part of an exercise
   of domination. From the identification of four main currents
   (neoliberal, marxist-pedagogical, biopolitics and psychopolitics) a
   descriptive and compared study will be carried out in order to
   understand the logical-epistemic scaffolding of each of them.},

Abstract = {Privacy paradox is a phenomenon in which people who say they are
   concerned about their privacy behave as if they weren't, especially when
   it comes to social networks and the use of the Internet. The aim of this
   research was to determine whether individuals who are highly concerned
   with their privacy exhibit privacy protecting behaviour in an expected
   manner. To explore the privacy paradox, a privacy concerns scale was
   developed for this research based on the results of a previous study. To
   measure behavioural variables, three scales were adapted for application
   in Croatia, including the social dimension of behavioural control,
   general caution and technical protection. Participants were also asked
   some specific questions about their use of Internet and social networks.
   The survey was conducted using a questionnaire that was given to a
   convenience sample of 966 participants. The obtained results showed the
   existence of a privacy paradox on all comparisons at p < 0.001. Despite
   the fact that 90.7\% of the participants stated that their privacy is
   important or extremely important to them, a large number of participants
   uses online services from companies whose entire business model is based
   on the collection, analysis and sharing of user data. 99.3\% of

Abstract = {The present work tries to unravel the structural characteristics of the
   imaginary articulated by the Argentine center right in order to
   legitimize their governments and give meaning to the political reality.
   To respond to this objective, we will concentrate on reading the
   speeches of Presidents Menem and Macri, who have led governments that
   express this political color. We will research into two great dimensions
   that make up the foundations of the imaginary on which the center right
   works in our country. In the first place, we will try to account for the
   similar mythopoesis that both governments present. Secondly, we will
   dwell on the relation of elective affinity between a lexicon of
   interiority, a way of understanding and working on the self inscribed in
   the literature of self-help and the notion of state, market and
   individual presented in presidential speeches.},

Abstract = {How does violence become publicly unacceptable? I address this question
   in the context of lynching in the United States. Between 1880 and the
   1930s, public discourse about lynching moved from open or tacit
   endorsement to widespread condemnation. I argue this occurred because of
   increasing publicity for lynchings. While locals justified nearby
   lynchings, publicity exposed lynching to distant, un-supportive
   audiences and allowed African Americans to safely articulate
   counternarratives and condemnations. I test this argument using data on
   lynchings, rail networks, and newspaper coverage of lynchings in
   millions of issues across thousands of newspapers. I find that lynchings
   in counties with greater access to publicity (via rail networks) saw
   more and geographically dispersed coverage, that distant coverage was
   more critical, and that increased risk of media exposure may have
   reduced the incidence of lynching. I discuss how publicity could be a
   mechanism for strengthening or weakening justifications of violence in
   other contexts.},

   Evidence from the French Senate},

Abstract = {The staggered renewal of parliamentary mandates is widespread in upper
   chambers, yet little understood. Comparative work has found that all
   members of a chamber are affected by upcoming elections, not merely
   those whose terms are up for renewal. In this study, we explore for
   which activities, and under which conditions, staggered membership
   renewal is associated with class-specific parliamentary activity,
   defined as systematically differing behaviour across two or more classes
   of members. We examine these questions with data on the French Senate.
   Drawing on insights from the study of political business cycles,
   legislative cycles, and previous scholarship on staggering, the article
   shows that behaviour varies over the course of senators' mandates, and
   that class-specific behaviour exists. However, staggering produces a
   different pattern of parliamentary activity than might be expected:
   proximity to elections reduces parliamentary activity of the class of
   senators facing re-election; by contrast, senators `not up next' become

Abstract = {In 2010 the Australian Labor Party selected Julia Gillard as leader,
   making her Australia's first female Prime Minister. Between 2010 and
   2015 there was a renewed focus on issues of gender inequality in the way
   that women politicians have been treated in Parliament and in the media.
   Specifically, women in positions of political and institutional power
   such as Julia Gillard, Julie Bishop, and Quentin Bryce, were critiqued
   on their clothing choices in the Australian media. In this article, I
   argue that the Australian media's attention to the fashion choices of
   women in politics is problematically gendered, because it subordinates
   aesthetic features that do not conform to hegemonic masculinity. I argue
   that in response to the dominant masculine aesthetic norm in politics,
   women politicians are using their sartorial choices to challenge this
   marginalisation of femininity in the political sphere.},

Abstract = {How does learning about democratic erosion in other countries shape
   opinions about the state of democracy in the United States today? We
   describe lessons learned from a collaborative course on democratic
   erosion taught at nearly two dozen universities during the 2017-18
   academic year. We use survey data, student-written blog posts, exit
   questionnaires, and interviews with students who did and did not take
   the course to explore the effects of studying democratic erosion from a
   comparative perspective. Do comparisons foster optimism about the
   relative resilience of American democracy or pessimism about its
   vulnerability to the same risk factors that have damaged other
   democracies around the world? Somewhat to our surprise, we find that the
   course increased optimism about US democracy, instilling greater
   confidence in the relative strength and longevity of American democratic
   norms and institutions. We also find, however, that the course did not
   increase civic engagement and, if anything, appears to have exacerbated
   skepticism toward activities such as protest. Students who took the
   course became increasingly sensitive to the possibility that some forms
   of civic engagement reflect and intensify the same threats to democracy
   that the course emphasized-especially polarization.},

Abstract = {Global Social Policy (GSP) has established itself as a distinct field of
   research over the past 25 years. Without doubt one of the leading figure
   to this advancement was Bob Deacon. He integrated several explanations
   and approaches into social policy research that had so far been distinct
   in other disciplinary fields, including concepts of International
   Relations (IR). That allowed to explain more about policy autonomy,
   inter-action between actors at the global level and potential impacts of
   international organisations on national social policies. Combining IR,
   organisational studies and GSP, this article wants to go a step further
   in this vein of GSP theoretical studies. We seek to make a contribution
   by running through a number of recently popular inter-organisational
   relations approaches within an IR context, and discuss how, and to what
   extent, they can be used to make more profound theoretical claims about
   the nature of GSP. The article first summarises the state of the art in
   GSP research with a view on international actors, particularly
   international organisations. Then we describe the specific
   characteristics of international organisations in existing GSP research
   and provide a number of theoretical considerations from organisational
   studies as part of IR scholarship that help construct a more nuanced
   understanding of how global actors function and interact. We link the
   theoretical accounts to empirical examples from the GSP literature, and
   detect what, and how, approaches and frames from this field may usefully
   tackle challenges GSP scholarship is facing.},

Abstract = {For at least the past four decades, the Christian Right's political
   advocacy has epitomized morality politics in the US. In recent years,
   however, the Christian Right has transformed how it approaches various
   moral and cultural issues, appealing to the language and process of
   political rights. This reframing of cultural concerns has coincided with
   the declining cultural status of conservative Christianity. This article
   analyzes three issue areas-abortion, free speech, and religious
   freedom-documenting how conservative Christianity has altered its
   approach to public politics, coming to embrace individual rights
   language and arguments over and above common morality. The article also
   analyzes the whether this growing rights talk has contributed to
   extending support to the rights of others, finding mixed results. As
   conservative Christians have embraced the rights commitment for
   themselves, there has been a corresponding growth of political tolerance
   for others. At the same time, there remain prominent challenges to
   supporting pluralistic politics. While questions about the commitment to
   pluralism remain, the evolution of the Christian Right's cultural style
   of politics has important implications, as the last vestige of
   communitarian politics routinely engages politics using the language of
   liberalism. Moral politics are now routinely rights politics.},

Abstract = {Sexual violence in wartime is not inevitable, and its prevalence varies
   substantially among armed groups and over time. This study investigates
   how the financing of rebel organizations influences their incentives and
   capacities to restrain sexual violence. We argue that the degree to
   which rebels rely on outsiders to profit from natural resources
   influences the frequency with which they commit acts of sexual violence.
   Rebel movements that extort producers of natural resources are less
   reliant on the local population and more willing to risk alienating them
   by engaging in sexual violence. By contrast, smuggling of natural
   resources requires active cooperation with a broad network of criminals
   and civilians outside of the rebel organization's control. The need to
   sustain such cooperation provides rebels with an incentive to curtail
   widespread sexual violence. Using a new data set that codes rebel
   groups' natural resource exploitation strategies, we find empirical
   support for our expectations.},

Abstract = {Automation, digitalization and smart software fundamentally reshape the
   employment structure of post-industrial societies. The share of routine
   jobs is constantly shrinking while non-routine jobs at both ends of the
   skill distribution tend to grow. We contend that the existing political
   science literature has not sufficiently connected the distributive
   implications of technological change with contemporary political
   disruptions. The fact that disadvantages are strongly concentrated among
   blue- and white-collar routine workers in the lower middle class is of
   crucial importance. Routine workers are a large and electorally relevant
   group with all the necessary means for political participation.
   Increasingly bleak prospects in the labor markets of tomorrow create a
   demand for social, cultural, and economic protectionism. Socially
   conservative parties in general and right-wing populist parties in
   particular have recognized the electoral potential of disaffected
   routine workers and skillfully address and acknowledge their anxieties.
   We conclude that a lower middle class no longer protected from the
   vagaries of economic modernization is a potential electoral game
   changer.},

Abstract = {Parallel streams of literature in economics and management suggest that
   a centralized power structure tends to produce a top-heavy personnel
   structure in government bureaucracies. Supportive evidence is derived
   from a hand-collected dataset of ministry organization charts from 22
   European countries. The structure of the bureaucratic pyramid is more
   top heavy in Eastern Europe than it is in Western Europe. Within Eastern
   Europe, countries that have preserved Soviet-style bureaucratic power
   structures have the most top-heavy ministries, whereas others that have
   reduced power centralization by separating political and administrative
   power have less top-heavy ministry pyramids that are more like those
   found in Western Europe.},

Abstract = {Turkey came a long way from being a negative outlier on gender parity in
   the global scene to ensuring almost universal enrollment for girls.
   Effective education and social policy interventions together with
   national stakeholder mobilization enabled this progress. Nevertheless,
   Turkey has room to advance so that all girls finish secondary education
   with a robust foundation to become active citizens. This will require
   the Ministry of National Education to overcome its quality deficiency in
   schools and mainstream gender equality to educational pedagogy and
   practice. Most importantly, stakeholders should acknowledge the role of
   gender politics in girls' education and engage in a genuine discussion
   about education and empowerment of girls. This would require an
   inclusive dialogue, acknowledging Turkey's ethnic, religious, social,
   and cultural differences.},

Abstract = {The booming literature on the consequences of democratization for
   material welfare has produced no findings on the relationship between
   regime type and relative consumer prices. The literature largely shows
   that democracies favor masses over elites, generating the expectation
   that democratization should lower consumer prices. Yet it also finds
   that democratization boosts economic growth, an outcome that is
   partially contingent on making consumer goods expensive relative to
   capital goods. We argue that democratization lowers relative consumer
   prices since politicians under democracy can more effectively chase
   votes by satisfying consumers' demands for the immediate payoff of lower
   prices. Our statistical analysis of 160-plus countries over 60 years
   shows that democratization raises consumer advantage, which is the
   consumer price level relative to the price level of capital goods. We
   also provide evidence of the policy levers that democratizing countries
   have used to achieve this effect.},

Abstract = {Research on presidential coattails in elections has focused nearly
   exclusively on two-party systems like the United States. Much less is
   known, however, about presidential coattails in multiparty systems where
   electoral and governing coalitions are common currency. Under
   coalitional presidentialism, we argue that presidential coattails are
   diffused, benefiting the president's party but also her coalition party
   members, especially those most strongly associated with the coalition
   itself. Using electoral data from Chile and Brazil, two widely studied
   but distinct cases of coalitional presidentialism, we find strong
   evidence supporting this claim. The results carry important implications
   for students of coalitional presidentialism, presidential coattails, and
   party systems, more generally.},

Abstract = {Political theorists have argued that democracies should strive for high
   turnout, leading to an argument for the introduction of compulsory
   voting, one of the surest ways to increase turnout. Others have warned
   that this obligation comes at a cost of lower quality votes. We
   investigate these claims by examining the impact of compulsory voting on
   proximity voting. First, we examine individuals' voting behavior in
   three countries with strong compulsory voting laws: Australia, Belgium
   and Brazil. Election surveys in these countries include a hypothetical
   question about the likelihood of voting without legal obligation. We
   continue with an examination of the effects of compulsory voting in
   Switzerland, which varies across cantons. Our results support the
   reluctant voter' hypothesis: Compelling voters to vote tends to weaken
   the impact of proximity considerations on electoral behaviour, although
   this effect remains limited and is only significant in half of the
   elections that were investigated.},

Abstract = {In this article, I explore the relationship between sorting and the
   value that individuals assign to compromise. Analyzing four separate,
   nationally-representative surveys from 2007 to 2016, I show that a
   reliable asymmetry among partisans exists regarding their preference for
   political leaders who compromise. Among persons with right-leaning
   identities, high levels of overlap between partisanship and ideology
   undercut the professed desirability of compromise and amplify the
   association between compromise and selling out one's principles.
   However, when individuals are asked about the specific extent to which
   one's ``side{''} deserves greater deference in the policymaking process,
   differences between persons with left- and right-leaning identities
   disappear. Well-sorted individuals are uniformly unwilling to distribute
   policymaking demands equally. Although this disconnect is emblematic of
   the general tension between abstract principles and episodic behavior
   (or ``practicing what you preach{''}), it also highlights how the
   introduction of material threat may challenge expressive commitments to
   lofty ideals.},

Abstract = {Here, we present Party Facts (), a modern online database of political
   parties worldwide. With this project, we provide a comprehensive
   database of political parties across time and world regions, link party
   information from some of the core social science data sets, and offer a
   platform to link political parties across data sets. An initial list of
   4000 core parties in 212 countries is mainly based on four major data
   sets. The core parties in Party Facts are linked with party information
   from some of the key social science data sets, currently 26. From these
   data sets, we have included and linked about 15,000 party observations.
   Party Facts is an important step in developing a more coherent
   operationalization of political parties across time and space and a
   gateway to existing data sets on political parties. It allows answering
   innovative party research questions that require the combination of
   multiple data sets.},

Abstract = {The resurgence of separatist movements in Scotland and Catalonia
   illuminate the ebb and flow of such movements over time. The catalysts
   of separatism in post-industrial democracies are largely treated as
   circumstantial, but intergenerational data on attitudes towards
   independence might assist the development of a general theory of support
   for separatism. This replace draws on the case of Quebec, leveraging a
   half-century worth of public opinion data to investigate
   intergenerational shifts in attitudes towards separatism. Historical
   data from the Canadian Election Study (CES 1968-2011) allow us to test
   the relationship between attitudes towards independence among youth in
   Quebec and general levels of support for separatism. Coupled with this
   are the more than 1 million observations from the 2011 Canadian federal
   as well as the 2012 and 2014 Quebec provincial editions of Vote Compass.
   This last dataset allows us to estimate the variation in support for
   Quebec independence for very precise age groups defined at the
   year-of-birth level. The results show a clear generational cycle
   variation that appears correlated with specific series of historical
   events.},

Abstract = {Inter-municipal cooperation in Iceland has a history of many decades.
   There has been significant cooperation between smaller and larger
   municipalities in order to improve the provision of services, which in
   many cases has been difficult for the small and smallest units - a
   question of capacity. In this article, the main task is to look at the
   democratic aspect of inter-municipal cooperation arrangements. The main
   research questions are on consequences for democracy, democratic
   accountability, efficiency and decision-making in this context, which
   have been pointed out as the main democratic concerns by various
   European researchers. To answer this for the case of Iceland, responses
   to questions on the topic from two different surveys among local leaders
   are analysed. The main conclusion is that the general concerns stated by
   the above-mentioned researchers also seem to be present in the case of
   inter-municipal cooperation in Iceland.},

   hegemony},
Journal = {EUROPEAN POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {18},
Number = {1},
Pages = {24-36},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Its reliance on social media and television to mobilise supporters and
   popularise the figure of its charismatic leader, political science
   lecturer Pablo Iglesias, is one of the main characteristic features of
   Podemos, a new, left-leaning populist party that has shaken the
   political establishment of Spain since its irruption as a decisive
   political force in the 2014 European elections. Podemos could actually
   be defined as a `transmedia party', as it combines the use of social
   media to reach young constituents with traditional TV talk show
   appearances to reach a wider, and also older, audience. This dualism
   (traditionalism and innovation) is also present in Podemos' own
   configuration as a blend of a social movement and a vertically ruled
   political party, with a simultaneous presence outside and inside
   representative structures like parliaments and local governments. Far
   from hiding from recurrent accusations of populism, Podemos takes pride
   in being considered a populist movement. Actually, their leaders see
   their party-cum-movement as a practical implementation of the theories
   of the Argentinean philosopher Ernesto Laclau: their left-leaning
   populist formation is the necessary vanguard of a new democratic
   majority that will replace the current neoliberal hegemony. This unusual
   reflexivity is studied through a critical discourse analysis of
   published interviews with Podemos' leaders.},

Abstract = {We define racial transcendence as an elevated status in which
   evaluations of an individual are no longer shaped by the race of the
   attitudinal target or the race of the person making the evaluations.
   Observers argue that Oprah Winfrey transcends race, meaning that she is
   just as likely to receive support from non-Blacks as she is from fellow
   Blacks. But this argument may not follow when Oprah moves into the
   political arena. We use two surveys to demonstrate this: The first
   survey supports Winfrey's transcendence, while we see in-group support
   in the second. We find that Oprah enjoys her greatest support among
   racial fellows, and her favorability flows along the lines of race and
   gender: Her greatest supporters are Black women. Oprah's ability to
   offer political cues also flows along lines of race and gender: Those
   most likely to be influenced by her Obama endorsement are Black women.},

   Delayed Cultural Trauma},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF POLITICS CULTURE AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {32},

Abstract = {Cultural trauma theory has emphasised the role of social groups in
   narrating, and thereby attributing moral significance to, highly
   disruptive events. In contrast, this article draws attention to
   professions such as the police and the media, which act as fact-finders
   to establish the factual circumstances of events from which trauma
   narratives are created. The article offers a case study of the June 1994
   Matsumoto Sarin Incident in Japan, a terrorist attack in which members
   of religious movement Aum Shinriky gassed residential streets using
   sarin. Factual uncertainties surrounding the attack, in combination with
   institutional failings by fact-finders that resulted in a false
   accusation, meant that carrier groups did not identify the event as one
   that brought a collectivity's underlying values into question; in other
   words, cultural trauma as a discourse did not develop. It was only after
   Aum's second sarin attack on the Tokyo subway in March 1995, when the
   true perpetrators and motives were finally uncovered, that Matsumoto
   belatedly became recognised as a traumatic assault on Japan's civic
   values. This article suggests that a collaborative approach combining
   science and technology studies (STS) with collective memory studies
   could provide a fruitful avenue of further research.},

Abstract = {Organizations often announce their protest activities prior to their
   implementation to mobilize awareness, recruit supporters, and receive
   media attention. We are interested in the effectiveness of protest
   announcements-that is, under what conditions governments make
   concessions to avoid having an announced protest take place. Governments
   assess the costs and benefits of providing concessions by taking into
   account the level of credible threat of the announced protest and the
   costs related to concessions. We test these assumptions with a unique
   data set on protest announcements and concessions in Nepal (2007-2010).
   Using cross-sectional regressions, we demonstrate that protest
   announcements by unions, announcements with highly threatening tactics
   and announcements with minimal demands will bring about concessions from
   the government. We contribute to the growing literature on different
   protest tactics by providing systematic empirical evidence, for the
   first time, on the effectiveness of mere protest announcements.},

Abstract = {Reflecting a central premise of the collective securitisation model, it
   is argued in this article that both specific events and longer-term
   trends have galvanised and reinforced the EU discourse of increasing
   threat and risk around cybersecurity, at different points in time. Thus,
   whilst major cyberattacks have caused the EU to reflect with some
   urgency on the increasing threat and review its approach, new policy
   initiatives evolved incrementally thereafter, rather than being the
   product of any emergency action outside the EU's normal politics. It is
   shown further that, in the case of cybersecurity, discourses of threat
   and risk have continued beyond policy initiation, and that this
   discourse has very much run in parallel with further action and
   initiatives. Finally, this article demonstrates how collective
   securitisation and legislation in certain key areas related to
   cybersecurity can also be subject to EU institutional desecuritisation
   moves, leading to national policy differentiation following a
   precipitating event.},

Abstract = {Religion's effect on individual tendency to engage in political protest
   is influenced both by the resources available to citizens at the
   individual level and opportunities provided to religious groups and
   organizations at the country level. Combining data from last two waves
   of the World Values Surveys with aggregate data on religious regulation,
   we show that private religious beliefs reduce an individual's protest
   potential while involvement in religious social networks fosters it. At
   the country level, we find that government regulation of religion
   decreases individual tendency to protest, and has an especially
   detrimental effect on the likelihood of religious minorities joining
   peaceful protest activities. These findings are in line with opportunity
   structure theories that stress the importance of system openness for
   fostering political protest.},

Abstract = {Drawing on ethnographic data and interviews with 45 teachers, teacher
   trainers, and union officials in Oaxaca, Mexico, this article asserts
   that teachers' beliefs in ``Oaxacan exceptionalism{''}-the idea that the
   state is fundamentally different from the rest of Mexico-underpinned
   teachers' resistance against professionalization policies embedded in
   the Alliance for the Quality of Education, a sweeping reform inspired by
   the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. Teachers
   within Oaxaca's union chapter, Section 22, described the reforms as an
   imposition of policies ill-suited to the state's linguistic and cultural
   diversity, its economic disparities, and rural-urban divides. Resistance
   also symbolized local efforts to preserve Oaxacans' dissident teaching

Abstract = {Legislators are political actors whose main goal is to get re-elected.
   They use their legislative repertoire to help them cater to the
   interests of their principals. It is argued in this article that we need
   to move beyond treating electoral systems as monolithic entities, as if
   all legislators operating under the same set of macro-rules shared the
   same set of incentives. Rather, we need to account for within-system
   variation - namely, candidate selection rules and individual electoral
   vulnerability. Using a most different systems design, Germany, Ireland
   and Portugal are leveraged with both cross-system and within-system
   variation. An original dataset of 345,000 parliamentary questions is
   used. Findings show that candidate selection rules blur canonical
   electoral system boundaries. Electoral vulnerability has a similar
   effect in closed-list and mixed systems, but not in preferential voting
   settings.},

Abstract = {There is little doubt that the European Central Bank (ECB), and in
   particular its presidency, has taken the lead in tackling the euro
   crisis. But can this leadership be also characterised as charismatic?
   This article answers the question by focusing on language - a key
   component as well as a reliable indicator of charisma. By means of a
   software-assisted content analysis of the entire corpus of ECB
   presidential speeches, it is found that the crisis has indeed led to the
   emergence of the Bank's presidency as a charismatic euro leader. This in
   turn confirms the recent politicisation of the ECB, but at the same time
   might be seen as mitigating the problems related to the Bank's
   democratic deficit, to the extent that charisma can be seen, from a
   Weberian standpoint, as an alternative source of political legitimacy.},

Abstract = {This article focuses on Mexico's struggle with development-reflected in
   the country's continuing persistent poverty, inequality, lack of
   inclusion, and social mobility-as Mexico finds itself caught between
   global compromises (the Millennium Development Goals, 2000-15; the
   Sustainable Development Goals, 2015-30) on one hand and National
   Development Plans (NDP) on the other. I analyze three consecutive NDP
   since the transition to democracy in 2000 and look ahead to announced
   changes in the ``Project for the Nation 2018-24.{''} I also take stock
   of how international and national organizations have monitored and
   evaluated these issues. Doing so enables us to identify, problematize,
   and reflect on where Mexico is heading with this particular struggle. It
   has produced, I argue, a certain dissonance or even myth concerning
   development entangled between grand documents mirroring global
   compromises and a rather bleak reality when transformed into domestic
   policies for development.},

Abstract = {Transgender issues have recently emerged as highly salient topics of
   political contestation in the United States. This paper investigates one
   relevant factor in that ascent: intermedia agenda-setting between
   digital-native and legacy press news. Through a content analysis of the
   top-five digital-native and top-five legacy press online news entities
   from 2014 to 2015, we investigate the dynamics of intermedia
   agenda-setting in the context of transgender topics, both at the level
   of attention to transgender topics in general and at the level of
   attention to specific issues related to the transgender community (e.g.
   anti-transgender violence). Results indicate significant causal effects
   of digital-native coverage on legacy press coverage at the level of
   general attention to transgender topics. However, results also indicate
   that at the level of specific transgender issues, digital-native
   coverage drives legacy press coverage on some issues, which legacy press
   coverage drives digital-native coverage on others. Implications for
   intermedia agenda-setting in the digital news media environment and for
   the future of transgender political rights movements are discussed.},

   Organise the Electoral Count in Germany's Most Populous State},

Abstract = {The organisation of the electoral counting process is a complex task
   that, in Germany, is delegated to local authorities. This article
   presents novel data from a representative survey of local communities in
   North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany's most populous state, to describe and
   to explain the variation of the ways in which the electoral count for
   major elections is organised. The findings are: (1) local communities
   differ greatly in the ways they recruit poll workers for election day
   and in the ways the counting teams are composed; (2) the inclusion of
   parties in the recruitment of poll workers, the only main prescription
   in the legal framework, is not heeded by one third of all local
   communities, and (3) most importantly, actual election results such as
   the proportion of invalid votes systematically and widely co-vary with
   the ways in which local authorities organise the counting process - a
   pattern that should not exist. This article discusses the implications
   of these patterns for the electoral integrity of Germany during the
   electoral administration process.},

Abstract = {Social science seldom takes religion seriously. Graeme Wood shows the
   folly of this neglect in The Way of the Strangers, his portrayal of the
   apocalyptic religious ideas held by some of the most ardent ISIS
   followers. The actions and devotion of members of the Islamic State
   cannot be understood without grasping what Wood is telling us. Still, a
   central question remains: Do these religious ideas inevitably lead to
   violence? Here the jury is still out, since a focus solely on religion,
   without the socio-political context, can give a skewed perspective on
   the motives of this violent politico-religious movement.},

Title = {What to do about inequality? Public opinion support for the European

Abstract = {This paper investigates individual's perceptions of inequality and the
   impact this has on mass public opinion support for the European Union
   (EU) in the Republic of Ireland. This question is posed in the context
   of the onset of the economic and financial crisis of 2007/8 as the
   crisis can be regarded as a critical juncture in Ireland's relationship
   with the EU as a result of the economic downturn and the widening of
   economic disparities individuals have experienced. Ireland is a critical
   case in examining EU support as since its accession to the EU in 1973 it
   is often considered an exemplar of what the EU could offer small member
   states with a strongly pro-integrationist mass public. Using Ordinary
   Least Squares (OLS) multiple regression analysis on 2009 European
   Election Study (EES) data, this paper shows that individuals' concerns
   about inequality lowers support for the EU as it is currently
   constituted, but increases support for continued European integration.
   This suggests that individual-levels of support may be in a precarious
   state, yet they can be salvaged as individuals in Ireland regard the EU
   as the institutional-driving force to address market-generated
   inequality.},

Abstract = {The concept of migration and development (M\&D) and practices in that
   area have lain on many countries' political agendas for decades, with no
   clear focus or coherent strategy knitting together the various
   stakeholders working in the sphere. This article analyzes the main
   conceptions of M\&D in the discourses and practices of Spanish NGOs and
   compares them with the focuses that have arisen in the academic sphere,
   for a look into primarily five issues: whether NGOs have their own focus
   on the migration-development nexus or are swayed by public institutions'
   guidelines; whether NGOs steer their actions more toward preventing and
   restricting migration or toward promoting development; whether NGOs also
   consider potential effects on development in receiving countries;
   whether NGOs entertain the idea of participatory actions where immigrant
   persons hold centre stage; and whether NGOs fulfil their civic and
   political function as a propounding force to contribute to democratic
   governance in migration matters.},

Abstract = {Alliance with sworn political opponents is becoming a growing phenomenon
   within the realm of political alliances. Here, two or more competitive
   political parties join hands to defeat a particular common opponent.
   During election, alliance partners face election together and distribute
   electoral seats mutually to avoid vote share. However, ensuring vote in
   favour of opponent alliance candidate is only possible when voters
   prefer to cast vote for the alliance candidate. Thus, this is crucial to
   know influencing factors that shape voters' voting intention in favour
   of opponent alliance candidate. This study is an attempt to empirically
   investigate factors that have significant influence to shape voters'
   voting intention for opponent alliance. The result shows that opponent
   alliance perceived fit impacts opponent alliance voting intention
   positively. Opponent alliance brand trust has a positive impact on
   opponent alliance voting intention. In addition, opponent alliance
   preference impacts opponent alliance voting intention positively.},

Abstract = {The purpose of the article is to address the question of ``contract{''}
   within Karl Marx's works. At first, it gives an overview of the lexical
   usage of the two German words to define contract, namely Vertrag and
   Kontrakt. Secondly, it focuses on some major sources, dividing them into
   1. legal and political philosophy (Hegel, Savigny, Gans) 2. proper legal
   sources (Code Napoleon, German and English common law) 3. Marx's
   quotations of contemporary economists. Finally, concentrating on the
   expression ``money as general commodity of contract{''} (quoted from S.
   Bailey), it investigates the connection between contract and money,
   trying to show how it represents an important shift in the way of
   conceiving social relationships within the modern capitalist society.},

Title = {Clientelistic Activation of Mexican Voters Between Vote Buying and
   Political Communication},
Journal = {POLITICA Y GOBIERNO},

Volume = {26},
Number = {2},
Pages = {171-203},
Abstract = {This research analyses the clientelistic outreach in the context of
   modern campaigns in new democracies like Mexico. We argue that Mexican
   parties intensely engage in clientelistic practices due to two combined
   factors: a) electoral reforms that created incentives for parties to
   invest heavily on direct contact campaign strategies and b) adaptation
   of modem campaigning (Gary get-out-the-vote campaign operations) that
   enable them to maximize the distribution of electoral gifts as part of
   their political communication strategy. This type of clientelism is not
   distributed by traditional machine politics targeting the poor. Instead,
   parties in Mexico have adapted modern political campaigning creating an
   effective network of clientelistic outreach. The empirical evidence for
   this article comes from an original survey conducted during the 2012
   presidential election and the 2015 National Electoral Study (CIDE-CSEs).},

Abstract = {Although Congress often uses grants and other fiscal incentives when
   delegating policy to the states, it also incorporates nonfiscal
   arrangements, or joint partnerships, into legislation. These
   partnerships include joint state-federal oversight boards,
   intergovernmental task forces, as well as other nondistributive programs
   and services. We examine the conditions under which Congress chooses to
   increase joint partnerships in a formal model of intergovernmental
   delegation and test the implications of the model on federal laws from
   1973 to 2010. We argue with evidence that Congress may rely on
   collaborative nonfiscal partnerships with states and localities when
   technical uncertainty increases but is less likely to do so when
   political uncertainty rises. Our theory extends existing models of
   delegation to provide an important step toward a broader theory of
   legislatively designed collaborative governance.},

Abstract = {This paper focuses on the role of contemporary art in international
   relations and world politics. In IR, art is often examined within the
   framework of cultural diplomacy, country branding, and soft power, or
   approached as a site of resistance. We argue that the concept of
   heteronorny offers an alternative conceptual framework for analysing
   contemporary art in world politics. It highlights the interaction of
   various fields such as art, commerce, the state and media. We concretise
   this approach with an analysis of the Venice Biennale. We show that the
   Biennale is heteronomous in the sense of being an arena where actors
   from various fields struggle for power by accumulating different types
   of capital. We focus our analysis on the Russian national pavilion in
   2011-2015 and show how the efforts of the country's elite to legitimise
   its position intertwined with the projects of the state, sponsors,
   artists, curators and art market actors.},

Abstract = {The political influence of interest groups manifests in different ways.
   Interest groups may affect which political problems attract attention as
   well as the political decisions aimed at solving these problems.
   Crucially, different types of groups may be successful in respect to
   these different dimensions of influence. Economic groups have been
   described as engaging more in ``insider{''} politics affecting public
   policy decisions, whereas citizen groups engage more in ``outsider{''}
   politics affecting agenda setting. This study investigates the
   multidimensional character of interest group influence and links it to
   group type as well as lobbying strategies. The study is based on
   original survey data collected among Danish and British interest groups
   in 2011-2014. We find two related but distinct dimensions associated
   with agenda-setting and decision-making lobbying success. The analyses
   show that citizen and economic groups influence politics in different
   ways due to their choice of strategies and their different types of
   resources. Thus, group type has a direct as well as an indirect effect
   on lobbying success. This relationship is present in both pluralist UK
   and corporatist Denmark.},

Title = {The subjective and objective violence of terrorism: analysing ``British

Journal = {CRITICAL STUDIES ON TERRORISM},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {12},
Number = {2},
Pages = {228-249},
Abstract = {This article examines how Zizek's analysis of ``subjective{''} violence
   can be used to explore the ways in which media coverage of a terrorist
   attack is contoured and shaped by less noticeable forms of
   ``objective{''} (symbolic and systemic) violence. Drawing upon newspaper
   coverage of the 2017 London Bridge attack, it is noted how examples of
   ``subjective{''} violence were grounded in the externalisation of a
   clearly identifiable ``other{''}, which symbolically framed the
   terrorists and the attack as tied to and representative of the UK Muslim
   community. Examples of ``systematic{''} violence were most notable in
   the ideological edifice that underpinned this framing but also in the
   ways in which newspaper reports served to draw upon British values in
   the aftermath of the attack. This directed attention away from the
   contradictions within the UK, towards narratives that sought to
   ``fix{''} these contradictions through eradicating the problem of ``the
   other{''} and/or by violently protecting the British values ``they{''}
   seek to undermine. As a consequence, newspaper coverage worked to uphold
   the illusion that ``peace{''} could be achieved by eradicating terrorism
   through further forms of objective violence, including, internment
   without trial; the ``ripping up{''} of human rights; and closer
   surveillance of Muslim communities. Indeed, it was this unacknowledged
   violence that worked to maintain British values in the press' coverage.},

   (2006-2017)},
Journal = {POLIS-POLITICHESKIYE ISSLEDOVANIYA},
Year = {2019},
Number = {3},
Pages = {145-156},
Abstract = {Language regime, based on a normative recognition of the co-official
   status of regional language, is needed in institutionally maintained
   public consensus. This consensus depends on a set of interlocking
   factors: the content and scope of language preferential policy, concerns
   and claims of political actors embroiled in language politics, and the
   changing political context. The article analyses the role of language
   policy as a topic in the electoral programs of the political parties of
   Catalonia in the context of the Barcelona Madrid conflict. It focuses on
   the electoral agenda and political parties' involvement in language
   politics. By a comparative analysis of party programs, we offer insights
   into the variability of language claims and their links with the
   position of parties in the conflict. The comparison indicates that the
   co-official status of Spanish Castilian and Catalan in regional
   linguistic space is not to be disputed. However, regional and national
   parties variously interpret and approve of this co-official `` status.
   For regional branches of national parties, there is united support for
   Spanish Castilian and Catalan having equal status. Regional parties
   advocate the dominant position of Catalan, the next development of
   language preferential policy. They claim to improve Catalan as tool.for
   consolidation of community. Operational contestation of a language
   regime is in the rhetoric of Catalan Independentists. The status 7 of
   Catalan, and discussion about the content and scope of language
   preferential policy, plays a symbolic role in the conflict between
   Catalonia and Spain. The reinforcement of claims of Independentists to
   re-evaluate the parity of Catalan and Spanish Castilian acts as an
   instrument of ethnic mobilization.},

Abstract = {Big data and data science are transforming the world in ways that spawn
   new concerns for social scientists, such as the impacts of the internet
   on citizens and the media, the repercussions of smart cities, the
   possibilities of cyber-warfare and cyber-terrorism, the implications of
   precision medicine, and the consequences of artificial intelligence and
   automation. Along with these changes in society, powerful new data
   science methods support research using administrative, internet,
   textual, and sensor-audio-video data. Burgeoning data and innovative
   methods facilitate answering previously hard-to-tackle questions about
   society by offering new ways to form concepts from data, to do
   descriptive inference, to make causal inferences, and to generate
   predictions. They also pose challenges as social scientists must grasp
   the meaning of concepts and predictions generated by convoluted
   algorithms, weigh the relative value of prediction versus causal
   inference, and cope with ethical challenges as their methods, such as
   algorithms for mobilizing voters or determining bail, are adopted by
   policy makers.},

Abstract = {Economic elites regularly seek to exert political influence. But what
   policies do they support? Many accounts implicitly assume economic
   elites are homogeneous and that increases in their political power will
   increase inequality. We shed new light on heterogeneity in economic
   elites' political preferences, arguing that economic elites from an
   industry can share distinctive preferences due in part to sharing
   distinctive predispositions. Consequently, how increases in economic
   elites' influence affect inequality depends on which industry's elites
   are gaining influence and which policy issues are at stake. We
   demonstrate our argument with four original surveys, including the two
   largest political surveys of American economic elites to date: one of
   technology entrepreneurs-whose influence is burgeoning-and another of
   campaign donors. We show that technology entrepreneurs support liberal
   redistributive, social, and globalistic policies but conservative
   regulatory policies-a bundle of preferences rare among other economic
   elites. These differences appear to arise partly from their distinctive
   predispositions.},

Abstract = {In this paper I will illustrate Proclus' philosophy of mathematics
   following contemporary constructivist approaches, mainly those of
   mathematical intuitionism. Presenting him as a pre-intuitionist author,
   I will attempt to contribute to the current discussion by analyzing
   certain claims of ancient philosophy in this field. It is my hope to
   fill this gap by a comprehensive reevaluation of Proclus' philosophy of
   mathematics. I will explore the origins of Proclus' theory of the
   constructivist mind in ancient and late ancient philosophy (Aristotle,
   Plotinus and the Stoics) as well as the sources of Proclus' position in
   the Academic controversy between Menaechmus and Speusippus concerning
   the nature of theorems and problems.},

Abstract = {Natural resources legislation is part of Mexican environmental policy.
   Monitoring compliance with legislation contributes to the management and
   conservation of resources and that offenders compensate for the damages
   generated. Inspection is a method used by the authorities to monitor
   compliance and achievement of objectives. In the country there is the
   Federal Attorney for Environmental Protection to monitor compliance with
   the law. Environmental inspectors are also called ``Street-level{''}
   bureaucrats or `frontline workers{''}, who are in charge of performing
   inspection tasks in the field, but they are poorly studied. The present
   study, through interviews, addresses the experiences and perceptions of
   the ``bureaucrats at street-level{''} of the Guanajuato Delegation
   Federal Attorney 19 within the framework of the application of natural
   resources legislation. Knowing the experiences and perceptions provides
   information on how the implementation actions of the environmental
   policy in the field actually happen. The findings show the existence of
   legal, territorial and material factors that limit the proper
   application of natural resources legislation.},

Pages = {193-208},
Abstract = {The term ``minority{''} has been the subject of controversy for several
   decades and its meaning is something that transcends the law. Thus, the
   conceptual construction of minorities must consider a philosophical,
   legal, social and political approach. It is intended to clarify that,
   according to time and place, among other criteria, the meaning of
   minority may contemplate or exclude groups of individuals. For that, we
   used research of a qualitative nature, of the documentary and
   interdisciplinary bibliographic type in the Brazilian and international
   doctrines. It has been shown that minority is a dynamic concept, since
   minorities are redefined over time.},

Abstract = {The English suburbs are dying. Years of austerity have slowly changed
   the landscape. Poverty is now common in the suburbs. Since 2014, life
   expectancy has been falling across most of England, especially in the
   suburbs. Now infant mortality rates are also rising year on year (unlike
   anywhere else in Europe). In hindsight it is not surprising that the
   majority of suburban English people voted Brexit, most noticeably in the
   Home Counties. Middle England is understandably angry. No more fortitude
   in the face of adversity and the hiding of emotions. The stiff up lip
   has slipped. Change is in the air.},

Abstract = {In this article we investigate about the relation between the State as
   employer and the public sector unions. We understand that this tie has
   certain peculiarities compared to the boss-union relation in the private
   sector. In the state sector there are combined persistently the properly
   labor interests (related to the role of the State as employer) with the
   political interests (associated with the position of the State as public
   power), and this is compounded by a permanent coexistence between trade
   unionists and officials in the public agencies and by the possibility of
   effective union competition in the sector. which generates a specific
   dynamic among the actors involved. Starting from some key concepts such
   as ``political exchange{''} and ``power resources{''}. we carry out the
   analysis of a case of public sector unionism where this link -which is
   developed from the strategy and negotiation game between the actors- is
   examined in depth. Finally, we allow ourselves a series of general
   reflections of a theoretical nature to try to understand the actions and
   decisions taken by the unions in this sector and by the State as
   employer.},

Abstract = {The paper explores the relationship between the government of a virtuous
   man and the government of laws in the thought of Algernon Sidney. For
   him, unlike other republicans, the former should take precedence over
   the second where the virtue presents itself as a possibility. However
   the practical difficulty that this involves leads to recognize the
   necessity of the government of laws. The study also seeks to show the
   conditions under which laws and virtue are mutually compatible.},

Abstract = {In this article, I explore the elusive function of rhetoric as a means
   to political pacification. With particular reference to Hobbes's
   doctrine of the prophetic foundation of commonwealths, I contend that
   public persuasion, while being in most cases subversive and harmful, can
   sometimes cultivate men and make them more sociable. I purport thereby
   to qualify Hobbes's denunciation of the seditious character of
   persuasion, and to question his alleged depreciation of common judgment
   as intrinsically gullible and passive. I argue in conclusion that there
   is more continuity on this score between Hobbes and Machiavelli than
   usually acknowledged, but also that this affinity threatens the unity of
   Hobbes's argument.},

Abstract = {As the single ruling party, the Communist Party plays an essential role
   in public administration and policy making in China. Under general
   secretary Xi Jinping's program of ``modernizing the governance system
   and governing capability{''} of the party since November 2013,
   administrative power is migrating from the government to the party. The
   party bureaucracy is interlaced with the state bureaucracy to produce a
   rare model of governance, which in turn has created many conceptual and
   theoretical issues for the study of good governance. This article
   analyzes China's party-dominated governance model. Key issues of
   legitimacy, accountability, and meritocracy are discussed in an effort
   to delineate the advantages and problems of this model, analyze how it
   helps to shape the Chinese polity, and shed some light on good
   governance in general.},

Abstract = {We introduce primaries-both closed and open-into a Downsian model of
   two-party electoral competition allowing the two candidates in each
   party's primary to differ in valence as well as in policy platform. The
   good news is that the introduction of either type of primary acts as a
   stabilizing force since equilibriums exist quite generally, serves as an
   arena for policy debates since all candidates propose differentiated
   platforms, and guarantees that each party's nominee is of higher quality
   than its primary opponent. Moreover, primaries tend to benefit the party
   whose median voter is closer to the overall median. The bad news is that
   the winner of the general election need not be the candidate with the
   highest overall quality since primaries that are too competitive can
   prove harmful. Given the differences between open and closed primaries,
   we show that the choice of primary type is particularly important and
   may determine the winner of the general election.},

Pages = {282-296},
Abstract = {In what ways do Cubans capitalize on inequalities created by
   globalization in order to advance socially and economically within a
   socialist system? What roles do migration and social reproduction play
   in the daily lives of Cubans at home and abroad, and how do these
   strategies advance the cause of the global capitalism? Theoretically,
   this paper utilizes William Robinson's conceptions of transnational
   social reproduction and the global working class, Gurminder Bhambra's
   theory of connected histories, and theories of transnationalism. These
   theories are used to analyze the experiences of Cubans resettled in
   Syracuse, New York, to provide a multilayered, relational look at
   globalization.},

Year = {2019},
Volume = {10},

Abstract = {This article makes a reflection about the way in which, since the 1970s,
   a ``geopolitics of fragmentation{''} has taken place, referring to the
   fragmentary form of production of the world capitalist space that tends
   towards processes of differentiation and unequal development and, at the
   same time, to others of levelling and equalization, to promote the
   articulation of the whole spatial production. The concept of
   ``infrastructural power{''} is proposed as a point of reference for the
   analysis of the production of material spaces and spatial fixes, in
   order to understand the geopolitical role played by infrastructure as a
   levelling element and of spatial equalization. In this way, the article
   proposes to understand OBOR project as a fragmentary, differential and
   unequal form of production of space that responds to: 1) the dynamics of
   Chinese capitalism and the necessary articulation of different spaces
   for its reproduction; 2) its tendency towards overaccumulation and 3)
   the increased inter-capitalist competition. Thus, a new geopolitical
   logic of production and articulation of fragmentary spaces is proposed
   which aims to materialize in Eurasia and Africa, and which now also
   includes Latin America, a region in which there are various geopolitical
   consequences derived from OBOR, especially in the field of the
   historical dependence.},

Abstract = {This paper explores the role of women in leadership in Latin American
   Regionalism and, more specifically, the incorporation of gender
   commitments at the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States
   (CELAC), focusing on the case of the overlapping mandates, during the
   period 2011-2014, of three women in the Presidencies of Chile, Argentina
   and Brazil: Michelle Bachelet, Cristina Kirchner, and Dilma Rousseff,
   respectively. The paper draws on feminist approaches and the literature
   of women and leadership, and incorporates peculiarities pointed out in
   the literature of Latin American regionalism, such as weak institutions,
   presidential diplomacy, and active transnational advocacy networks. The
   main argument advanced is that the effect of women in leadership cannot
   be taken for granted as gender was not a priority during the governments
   of these presidents. The more diffuse commitment to human rights, which
   they all shared, as well as their symbolic empowerment effect might have
   strengthened the gender cause advanced by civil society and
   transnational advocacy networks.},

Abstract = {How do individuals respond to internal security threats in
   non-democracies? Does violence make individuals more supportive of a
   strong state? Are the effects of violence on individual attitudes
   uniform, or are they heterogeneous with respect to the identity of the
   perpetrators? We field an online survey experiment on a national sample
   of Chinese citizens, in which respondents were randomly selected to view
   reports on violent acts in China. We show that exposure to violence
   makes individuals more supportive of a strong state: respondents
   randomly exposed to violence are more likely to approve police use of
   lethal force, and this effect is particularly strong among the less
   wealthy Han Chinese. We also find suggestive evidence that individuals
   exhibit intergroup biases in their reaction to violence.},

Abstract = {In this article, Tom Keatinge, Florence Keen and Kayla Izenman look at
   how right-wing terrorist and extremist movements raise funds, and how
   this should be reflected in counter-extremism and counterterrorism
   financing strategies. They highlight the importance of acknowledging the
   growing threat posed by right-wing terrorism and extremism, and thus the
   need to develop: an increased understanding of related fundraising
   strategies (including the relevance of significant numbers); the
   articulation of a more robust legal definition of extremism and greater
   willingness of the UK government to engage - at a strategic and
   political level - with the threats posed by right-wing extremism; and
   finally, greater collaboration between public and private sectors to
   enable the identification and disruption of related, enabling funding.},

Journal = {POLITICA Y GOBIERNO},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {26},
Number = {1},
Pages = {3-40},
Abstract = {This article analyzes how the tension between the district median voter
   and party policy preferences affects a Members of Congress (MC)
   disposition to toe the party line versus siding with the district in
   Latin America. It analyzes MCS in the lower chamber of 16 Latin American
   countries based on face-to-face MC and voter surveys, i.e. the district
   median voters' and parties' left-right placement and MCS' responses. The
   findings suggest that MCS only claim to deviate from the party line by
   siding with the district as the parties' position moves closer to the
   districts' median. Robustness checks support this tendency: As the party
   position moves closer to the district median position, MCS are more
   likely to display lax attitudes towards party discipline and attach more
   importance to getting resources for their districts. Overall, the
   findings contribute to an understanding of the effect of the tension
   between district and party preferences on party loyalty in Latin America
   and the sequential steps leading to party unity in legislative votes.},

   an expression of the natural interaction of state sovereignty and

Abstract = {After the coup of 1987, more than 150,000 mostly Indo-Fijians left Fiji
   for other countries, principally North America and Australasia. The best
   and the brightest have left and many more would if they only could,
   draining the country of the talents and skilled manpower it can
   ill-afford to lose. There is by now much information available on the
   sociology and economics of migration from Fiji, but rather little is
   known about the extent of rupture and emotional trauma that displacement
   entails. The following story aims to capture the private experience of a
   couple of Indo-Fijians who migrated to Australia.},

Pages = {299-321},
Abstract = {George Speight's improbable intervention in Fijian politics through an
   attempted putsch opened fresh wounds in Fiji's body politic. Ostensibly
   carried out to depose a government headed by an Indo-Fijian prime
   minister, it had other causes with deep roots in traditional Fijian
   politics and hidden political agendas. The country was held to ransom
   for 57 days and the siege finally ended with the intervention of the
   Fijian military. Speight was not the principal instigator of the crisis
   but the figurehead for other individuals and interests. Speculation
   about the actual masterminds of the putsch continues while Speight
   languishes in jail unlikely ever to taste freedom again. The putsch now
   seems like a bad dream but, at the time, it unleashed much fear and
   confusion that threatened to damage the country irreparably.},

Journal = {LABORATOIRE ITALIEN-POLITIQUE ET SOCIETE},
Year = {2019},
Number = {22},
Abstract = {Historiography has long focused on the causes of the radicalization of
   protest in Italy in the 1970s, and on the means developed by the State
   to react to terrorism, but the political conflict was not only a
   confrontation between institutions and terrorist groups. In the fight
   against political violence, the role of popular resistance is essential.
   The analysis attempts to identify the forms of such mobilizations, and
   in particular public demonstrations, and their developments, both in the
   fight against attacks linked to the ``strategy of tension{''} and those
   committed by underground armed organizations of revolutionary
   inspiration. Particular attention is paid to factors that appear to
   encourage mobilizations, and in particular to the sometimes conflicting
   emotions that permeated the society confronted with acts of terrorist
   violence. The anti-terrorist mobilization is therefore a response to the
   desire to express indignation, to oppose fear, to demonstrate the
   growing distrust of the State, or to prove the isolation of terrorist
   organizations. In the end, the 1970s appear to be a crucial decade for
   the formation of a political culture of citizen opposition to violence -
   as evidenced by the persistence of these mobilizations on the
   anniversary dates of the main attacks, which structure a living memory
   of these events.},

Abstract = {Research commonly finds that citizens are loss averse: they dislike
   losses far more than similarly sized gains. One implication is that
   arguments for policy change framed in terms of losses to be avoided
   often have a larger impact on public opinion than arguments framed in
   terms of gains to be enjoyed. Although several scholars have observed
   this pattern with respect to public opinion, we know far less about the
   effect of loss- and gain-framed arguments on political activism. This is
   a critical omission given the disproportionate impact of political
   activists on the policymaking process. Using field and survey
   experiments, we investigate the impact of gain- and loss-framed
   arguments on climate change activism. We find that loss-framed arguments
   can be less mobilizing, even when they are otherwise more persuasive,
   than gain-framed arguments. Our results deepen our theoretical
   understanding of what motivates political activism, especially in an era
   of professionalized politics.},

Abstract = {Mixed electoral systems are often associated with the hope of combining
   proportional election outcomes with a concentrated party system, and
   thus achieving the best of both worlds in electoral system design. It is
   especially the mixed-member proportional (MMP) variant that has retained
   a good reputation in this regard. Via a comparative analysis, we analyze
   whether or not the general praise for MMP systems is corroborated
   empirically. Our results show that the performance of MMP systems is
   heavily influenced by technical details, and elections conducted under
   MMP vary broadly with regard to possible proportionality-concentration
   combinations.},

Abstract = {Universities, colleges, and their academic programs are under increasing
   pressure to demonstrate positive job outcomes for graduates. A degree in
   political science confers on students a host of transferrable skills,
   but career paths for using those skills are not always clear. We present
   one method for leveraging the resources of the campus career center in
   order to increase career efficacy and decision-making confidence.
   Namely, we present a collaborative course-Careers in Public Service-that
   offers two career interventions: exploration and skill building. We
   further present evidence that the course is effective in increasing
   career self-efficacy and maturity, even for nonmajors interested in
   public service careers. We conclude with advice for fostering a
   program-career center collaboration and offering a similar course within
   political science curriculum.},

Abstract = {In this article, I analyse committee assignments in the Dutch Tweede
   Kamer across multiple legislative periods (1994-2012). This legislature
   is important to consider in the ongoing debate about committee
   assignments given that its electoral system minimises
   constituency-related assignment factors. The theoretical framework
   comprises the congressional theories of legislative organisation but
   highlights the involvement of parliamentary party groups in the
   assignment process. The hypotheses are tested using a
   multiple-membership multilevel model with additional evidence from 28
   interviews with legislators. The results indicate that legislators'
   educational and occupational backgrounds are important factors in the
   assignment process but show that partisan influences matter as well.},

Abstract = {The embassy secretary is an often neglected and invisible figure in the
   history of Renaissance diplomacy. This contribution explores the various
   functions of this type of secretary by way of a diplomatic duo, namely
   Bernardo de' Medici, Ambassador of Florence to the court of France
   between 1544 and 1545, and Jacopo Guidi, his secretary. Analyzing the
   material elements of diplomatic dispatches - primarily the indications
   of the author, the handwriting and courtesy formulas, but also close
   analysis of the texts - it shows the secretary as one of the main
   figures in diplomatic pratices. Through this study, the secretary
   emerges as the ambassador's right hand man, the second member of a pair
   of complementary figures, and not as a mere subordinate to his master.},

Journal = {NORDIC JOURNAL OF HUMAN RIGHTS},

Volume = {37},
Number = {3, SI},
Pages = {216-233},
Abstract = {The `business and human rights' (BHR) field emerged amidst concerns over
   the adequacy of national legal systems and institutions in addressing
   human tights impacts of global market integration. BHR relies on
   governance networks and advocacy that transcend a `national' paradigm.
   Yet BHR norms and initiatives remain anchored in national governmental
   entities and processes. BHR thus prompts reflection on the coherence and
   relevance of `domestic institutionalisation' of human tights. First,
   this article briefly explores how BHR disrupts the paradigmatic view of
   domestic human rights institutions, given its transnational character
   and because BHR addresses market as well as state actors. Secondly, we
   show how BHR re-draws the perimeter of the national human rights system:
   by triggering business-focused activities by existing national human
   rights actors; by drawing new government entities and market actors into
   domestic human rights implementation; and via national components of
   associational or hybrid governance mechanisms. Next, we argue BHR's
   extension of the ontology of human rights institutionalisation suggests
   the relevance of mufti-level governance theory in analysing the BHR
   field. In concluding we observe that BHR further highlights the need to
   contextualise the concepts of human tights institutionalisation and
   national human rights institution within global market society.},

   consultations on the adjudication of mining title to deal with this
   scenario, the emblematic case of the municipality of Cajamarca will be
   taken as a reference. The article is the product of a
   theoretical-deductive analysis, in which documentary sources are
   analyzed based on critical hermeneutics. The main result of the analysis
   of the Cajamarca case is to increase the understanding of the tension
   raised from the theory by the approaches of agonistic democracy and the
   criticisms of the liberal models of formal democracy},

Abstract = {The concept of active measures, which is part of influence operations of
   Russia, covers a broad and complex range of activities, including
   political, military, economic, diplomatic, media focused as well
   operations of secret services. During the past few years, these
   activities affected various regions of the European Union. The article
   aims to identify and analyze tools of Russian active measures used
   within the European Union countries with different geopolitical patterns
   and relations to Russia. Specifically, the study focuses on three state
   actors - Austria, Italy, and Bulgaria. First, in the theoretical part
   authors deconstruct the concept with the use of comparison to similar
   ones: hybrid warfare and information warfare. Next, authors consider the
   concept of active measures as the most proper for analyzing Russian
   influence operations in the European Union. The analysis and comparison
   of case studies have both shown clear differences and similar patterns
   in used active measures tools, such as an essential position of extreme
   right parliament parties. The concept of active measures has proven to
   be a helpful tool when analyzing Russian influence operations in its
   typical complexity.},

Title = {REQUEST FOR CHANGE: FACTORS AND CAUSES OF ITS ACTUALIZATION, KEY
   COMPONENTS, AND POTENTIAL CARRIERS},
Journal = {POLIS-POLITICHESKIYE ISSLEDOVANIYA},
Year = {2019},
Number = {5},
Pages = {119-133},
Abstract = {This article analyzes the results of the all-Russian sociological
   surveys that, in recent years, were realized by the Federal Center of
   Theoretical and Applied Sociology of the Russian Academy of Sciences.
   The main purpose of this article is to identify important shifts in the
   mood and expectations of Russians, from the point of view of the future
   of the state. The authors pay special attention to the reasons requests
   for changes have become actualized in the public consciousness, as well
   as its main components and its potential actors. According to the
   authors, the actualization of this request was the result of a sharp
   change in the vector of public priorities that represents a reaction a
   significant part of Russian society has to the authorities' inability to
   ensure their obligations, under the so-called ``paternalistic
   consensus{''}, which for many years remained the basis of the request
   for stability. It is shown that this request, firstly, is still of an
   intrasystemic nature and focuses the authority (more likely, through
   wishes rather than requirements) on the evolutionary change of society,
   not on the radical institutional transformation. Secondly, this request
   is very amorphous, both in its ideological content and in its social
   base, and focuses mainly on the today's socio-economic realities.
   Thirdly and lastly, the youth is its main bearer and the most obvious
   beneficiary; however, sociological polls demonstrate that other social
   groups and strata are also interested in overcoming the existing status
   quo and in initiating constructive changes. The request is focused
   substantively on such basic ideas as a) the minimization of various
   social inequalities; b) social justice, c) democracy, d) the greatness
   of the state. At the same time, the majority of the citizens who took
   part in the sociological polls consider that Russia should base its
   state's greatness and status as a key international player on its
   inclusion in the most economically developed and politically influential
   countries of the world, not on building up its military power. It talks
   about the public reevaluation of the state's role and the dissolution of
   state values as a key tool for the realization of the common good. The
   vast majority of Russia's citizens today support demands for the
   authority's openness, providing opportunities for citizens to influence
   authority through legitimate democratic procedures. A growing number of
   ``selfsufficient{''} Russians are striving to orientate themselves in
   their daily lives, not on assistance from the authorities, but on their
   own forces. However, the readiness of such ``self-sufficient{''}
   citizens for collective action is low, they consider themselves as
   supporters of change, but not as the actors of social change.},

Abstract = {Political theory lags behind other subfields in political science in
   rigorously testing what helps foster critical thinking (CT). Yet some of
   the greatest temptations to engage in motivated reasoning can be found
   in normative political contexts. This study uses multiple regression
   analysis to explore nine semesters of data from an introductory course
   in political theory. Three results stand out: (1) as the stakes of an
   assignment decrease, so do CT scores; (2) as the number of course
   assignments increase, CT scores fall; (3) when preparatory exercises
   matter, theory-specific CT exercises outperform generic ones. A theory
   of student rationality is put forth. Implications for course design,
   program assessment, and future research are discussed.},

Abstract = {In 2018 Costa Rica faced unprecedented elections due to the
   radicalization of the party supply, the diminished role of the
   traditional parties, and the unexpected continuity in government of the
   incumbent party with the presidency of Carlos Alvarado. During the
   campaign, the focus shifted from economic to self-expression issues
   (sexual education, equal marriage, abortion). Together with
   sociodemographic variables and the evaluation of the incumbent
   government, religion had an important explanatory weight on vote choice,
   especially after the advisory opinion of the Inter American Court that
   recognized the fundamental rights of LGBTI people during the campaign.
   We discuss the consequences fOr the current government and the future
   elections.},

Abstract = {The article presents the results of a comparative research study aimed
   at identifying the conditions for victories and defeats of radical right
   populist parties in modern Europe. First, the author provides
   theoretical justification for why such victories and defeats depend on
   the strategy of both radical right populists and their competitors from
   the traditional party families along three problematic dimensions -
   economic, cultural and European. After that she elaborates a hypothesis
   that the success of a radical right populist party is a result of its
   convergent strategy along the economic dimension in conjunction with the
   prevalence of divergent strategies among the mainstream parties along
   the cultural and European dimensions and tests it on the data of 12
   right populist parties using the qualitative comparative analysis (QCA).
   The empirical results partially confirm the hypothesis, identifying the
   link between the success of a radical right populist party and its
   commitment to a convergent economic strategy combined with the divergent
   strategies of the mainstream parties along the cultural and/or European
   dimensions. However, the research did not reveal the conditions for the
   defeat of such parties and did not explain the cases of Great Britain
   and France, where the radical right populists achieved notable success
   despite the fact that most identified conditions were absent. This begs
   further research with a focus on outliers. Such research may expand the
   list of success/defeat factors for radical right populists, taking into
   account the distribution of voters' preferences in various dimensions of
   the political space.},

Abstract = {Higher social capital is often associated with better quality of
   democracy (Putnam 1993, Warren 2001). Social capital is a unique type of
   resource in the sense that the more it is used, the more it becomes
   available, and therefore it is important to explore how social capital
   can be generated. In this paper, we evaluate the potential that churches
   and religious organizations present in creating social capital. We
   identify structural constraints faced by churches and religious
   organizations engaged in this process. We argue that institutional
   survival concerns and social understandings of the roles played by
   religion and church in democratic societies may influence the potential
   for social capital to be constructed in the context of religious
   participation as well as the type of generated social capital. Moreover,
   we also discuss the implications of epistemological choices on measuring
   the relationship between church participation and social capital, and
   advocate methodological diversity and interdisciplinary research
   initiatives, at times, in the detriment of generalizability.},

Abstract = {This research paper aims to analyse the implementation of the tourism
   project Riviera Nayarit and so to assess its results as an instrument of
   public policy for local economic development in localities with strong
   tourism activity in Bahia de Banderas municipality. To carry out the
   analysis, this paper is based on the foundations of klario Polese (1998)
   Theory of Development from the roots o endogenous development, in his
   study about urban and regional economy, therefore, the assessment of the
   results is made by using the analysis of variance as a way of comparing
   the means of the variables at two different time-slots over time. Then,
   the variables are contrasted to determine policy causality through the
   Tukey-B test and estimated with SPSS-21. The balance of evidence,
   Ceteris Paribus, shows the existence of a strong spatial segregation
   derived, almost exclusively, from the government determination to
   promote local economic development by exploiting all types of available
   resources in those areas subject to touristic activities.},

Abstract = {The essay introduces the work of Robert Kurz and the somewhat
   marginalized species of value critique that he is associated with:
   Wertkritik On the basis of a critical historiographical account of the
   ``New Marx Reading,{''} it argues that the theoretical and political
   differences between Wertkritik and other value-critical currents cannot
   be glossed over or dismissed as mere territorial strife but must instead
   be understood as an expression of a more fundamental disagreement about
   the nature of capitalism and the role of ``critique,{''} the distinctive
   feature of course being the insistence on a proper theory of crisis. The
   essay presents Kurz's particular version of Wertkritik but argues
   against his abandonment of the notion of class struggle and proposes to
   supplement Kurz's analysis with Theorie Communiste's more historically
   grounded analysis of the present period of capital.},

Abstract = {Modern socio-political discourse on various layers of communication
   exploits the notions of post-truth, post-truth politics and fake news,
   which became topical in the wake of the Brexit referendum and US
   Presidential Campaign of 2016. These events, as well as many others,
   caused a shift in political science and exposed a need for the
   reconsideration of the impact of online space on the development of
   socio-political systems all over the world. Besides, these events
   exposed a research need for political content studies in the online
   space at micro and macro-levels. The online processes are complex and
   non-linear, thus, require complex and hybrid analytical methods - for
   example, a combination of network analysis, mathematic analysis and
   linguistic and discourse analysis - the tools used by the authors of the
   article to study the political content produced during the Trump's US
   Presidential Campaign 2016. The purpose of the research was to identify
   the peculiarities of political content production and the impact it
   could have on prospective voters (such as shaping public opinion,
   agitation and construction of a required expected behavior). The
   empirical foundation of the research is metadata of the social networks,
   required for a network analysis; likewise, the text corpus, a set of
   messages produced by D. Trump's team during the US Presidential Campaign
   2016 in the same social networks, was the empirical base for linguistic
   discourse analysis. The network analysis, which originates from the
   theory of complex networks, was applied to study of the process of
   political content consumption by online users (prospective and active
   voter groups), and in particular, how the production capacity of social
   network users, as regards the produced or spread political content, can
   determine their roles (the opinion leaders, the sensors, the
   implementers, the readers, the reputation players). The linguistic
   discourse analysis allowed to identify the key peculiarities of the
   researched political content, produced as a part of a successful
   marketing campaign (aimed at promoting a candidate for the presidency)
   in social networks and online space as a whole. The study of the Trump's
   US Political Campaign 2016 revealed that the online dominance, acquired
   via social network marketing (which is a result of communicative
   strategies exploitation), can convert into a political dominance in the
   offline space.},

Abstract = {Government parties suffered defeat in the November 2017 regional
   elections in Slovakia. The Direction-Social Democracy (Smer), the senior
   coalition partner, managed to remain the party with the largest share of
   elected regional deputies. However, its strength was significantly
   reduced, both when compared to the 2016 national elections and the 2013
   regional contests. The democratic center-right opposition managed to
   coordinate and compete effectively against the governing parties. Its
   success was apparent in the gubernatorial contests, where its candidates
   defeated most of the Smer-backed incumbents. The democratic opposition
   was less successful in elections to regional assemblies. Their most
   significant result is a dramatic increase in the share of independent
   deputies who constitute the largest virtual group of deputies.},

Abstract = {The article reconsiders the relations between past and present in the
   era of ``Erinnerungskultur{''}, i.e. remembrance culture. It describes
   the semantic careers of the terms ``Zeitgeschichte{''} (contemporary
   history) and ``Aufarbeitung{''} (coming to terms with the past) in the
   representation of the past in Germany after 1989. By discussing the
   inherent tension between both attitudes of coping with the past and its
   historical burdens, the article reflects upon the characteristics of
   today's historical discourse: a remarkable alliance between politics and
   historiography, the dominance of teleological perspectives, and the
   revival of the belief in the concept of historical lessons ({''}historia

   with there is a discussion on the notion that the State is an
   aggregation of ideological and repressive apparatuses and on the
   position according to which the State is an instrument. This is followed
   by a rejection of Althusser's and Poulantzas's claims in the light of
   the thesis that the State is the material outcome of a correlation of
   forces in the context of a specific mode of production but that there is
   a limit to the changes that may be made within the capitalist mode of
   production.},

Abstract = {Recent readjustments in power relations between actors and levels of
   Mexican government, the upsurge of violence in many areas of the
   country, and the changes within the newsrooms have posed new challenges
   for the exercise of a free press. These transformations make useful
   revisiting Hughes' argument (2006) about the possibility of the
   emergence of a ``civic{''} press. Firstly, Hughes' book is discussed
   from the perspective of literature on Mexican transition, which explored
   institutional changes and public opinion, but leaving aside the
   relevance of media in this process. Secondly, we discuss new challenges
   for the study of mass media in non-Western democracies, pointing out the
   research agenda introduced by Hughes' book. Thirdly, we offer a critical
   view of journalism models proposed by the author, emphasizing the
   contextual conditions that have weakened the efforts to establish a
   civic journalism within the newsrooms. The text concludes with Hughes'
   response to the discussion.
   This text is product of the debate that took place on October 29th, 2018
   in the framework of the Interdisciplinary Seminar on Studies on the
   Press and Power of CIDE's Journalism program.},

Abstract = {Scholarly literature highlights the systematic actions taken in the
   modern Middle East to destroy the Kurdish language. With a primary focus
   on Turkey, scholars have described this process as a policy of
   linguicide, or language genocide, which is ``the extermination of
   languages, an analogous concept to (physical) genocide.{''}(2) In
   contrast, similar processes at work in southern Kurdistan (Kurdistan of
   northern Iraq) have often been described as ``linguistic
   suppression.{''}(3) This paper argues that linguistic suppression does
   not adequately describe the Iraqi Kurds' experiences. Rather, linguicide
   better captures the practices of cultural genocide that have targeted
   this group. This paper focuses on how the Kurds in modern-day Iraq were
   subjected to linguicide under the Language Education Policy (LEP) from
   1932 to 1991. This policy was established during the monarchy
   (1921-1958), and advanced through the time of Saddam Hussein's regime
   (1979-1991).(4) While much scholarly work has associated the process of
   linguicide with the birth of a nation-state,(5) this article further
   argues that linguicide in the Iraqi Kurdish case predates the formation
   of the Iraqi nation-state.},

Abstract = {This article critically assesses claims that India has entered a new
   party system after the 2014 general elections, marked by
   renationalisation with the BJP as the new `dominant' party.' To assess
   these claims, we examine the electoral rise of the BJP in the build-up
   to and since the 2014 general elections until the state assembly
   elections in December 2018. Overall, we argue that despite the emerging
   dominance of the BJP, a core feature of the third party system -a system
   of binodal interactions- has remained largely intact albeit in a
   somewhat weaker form. Furthermore, by comparing the post 2014 Indian
   party system with key electoral features of the first three party
   systems, we conclude that the rise of the BJP has thrown the third-party
   system into crisis, but does not yet define the consolidation of a new
   party system.},

Abstract = {Europe's authoritarian populists claim that the miracle of 1989 never
   happened. All too often, even their counterparts tend to believe this.
   However, this is simply not true. The events following Perestroika,
   which reached their peak in 1989, were incredible, unprecedented, and
   marked by many illusions but they were not an illusion in themselves.
   Since then, people and societies, spaces and cultures, politics and
   economies have been shifting and changing in Europe, albeit in a
   different way to that predicted by the social scientists, with their
   linear constructs, concepts and theories of transition. But instead of
   mocking those who thought that 1989 marked the ``end of history{''}, we
   should avoid such retrospective teleology and ask what spaces of
   experience and expectation were behind such perceptions. The
   micro-history of this ``historical moment{''} as a history of
   contingency has yet to be written. This history is more than just
   remembrance and educational instruction. It is an armoury for sharpening
   the senses.},

Abstract = {The article is a summary of the results of the study of images of power
   and politicians carried out since 1993. This unique project provided a
   vast array of empirical data on the state of political consciousness of
   Russian society, presented in the new book ``Power and Leaders in
   Perceptions of Russian Citizens. A quarter century of observations.
   (1993-2018){''}. In the article, which is a journal version of the
   Conclusion of the book, the author tries to rise above empiricism and
   find answers to a number of complex theoretical questions that are
   debated in modern political science, such as the nature and prospects of
   democratic transit in Russia; the problem of overcoming the value split
   of post-Soviet society; most important contradictions of the mass
   political consciousness. 25 years of participatory observations allowed
   the author to offer her own interpretation of the theory of political
   perception, test the author's methodology of analyzing political
   consciousness and show possible vectors for its further development.},

   spending: an analysis of the federal and regional elections in Belgium},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ELECTIONS PUBLIC OPINION AND PARTIES},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {29},
Number = {1},
Pages = {41-60},
Abstract = {Research on the link between gender and campaign finance in proportional
   electoral systems suggests that the campaign expenses of female
   parliamentary candidates are significantly lower than those of male
   candidates. On the basis of data on 10,436 candidates for nine
   consecutive elections in Belgium (1991-2014), this article examines
   whether there is indeed a gender gap in campaign expenses, and in
   particular whether this coincides with the introduction of legislative
   quota laws in the Belgian flexible-list system. We distinguish between
   realistic candidates that run for election from winnable list positions
   and unrealistic candidates running from lower ranked positions. The
   results show that, among unrealistic candidates, the gender gap in
   campaign spending arose again after the introduction of more severe
   gender quotas. With regard to realistic list positions, however, the
   significant difference between male and female candidates in the most
   strict quota phase disappeared, indicating that female realistic
   candidates were able to catch up financially with their male
   counterparts. The Belgian experience could provide useful insights for
   other countries with flexible-list systems regarding the implementation
   of legislative gender quotas.},

Abstract = {In the years since 11 September 2001, pundits, politicians and scholars
   of terrorism and international relations routinely have declared that
   9/11 ``changed everything{''}. This article explores not only how those
   decisions transformed the United States and the global response to
   terrorism, but also how both the decisions and response sustained a
   sense of fear. Further, they made possible, to paraphrase then candidate
   Joseph Biden's critique of former New York Mayor Rudy Guiliani, the
   framing of so much of the global political debate about terrorism, and
   national security references as simply 9/11 accompanied by a noun and a
   verb. Finally, the article examines the consequences of this framing for
   not only our understanding of terrorism, but also our understanding of
   terrorism and violence within the current global system.},

Title = {Empowering local government or just passing the austerity buck? The
   changing balance of central and local government in welfare provision in
   England 2008-2015},
Journal = {REGIONAL AND FEDERAL STUDIES},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {29},

Pages = {45-65},
Abstract = {This paper asks two questions: first, how did the balance of
   decision-making between central and local government in welfare policy
   in England change between 2010 and 2015? Second, to what extent has that
   led to divergence in the extent and manner of such provision? It finds
   significant areas of policy where local flexibility has been increased
   (such as council tax benefit, crisis loans, and funding for specialist
   housing), either through a change in the tier of government responsible,
   or unringfencing' of grants allowing local authorities greater
   discretion in whether to deliver particular services, although in other
   important areas decisions on welfare remain firmly centralized. It also
   concludes that in areas where responsibility has been localized,
   divergence has been immediate and substantial. Localization may well
   reduce entitlements where local authorities enjoy a financial reward for
   so doing and political costs are low.},

   Change: Comparing the External and Internal Dimension},
Journal = {POLITICS AND GOVERNANCE},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {7},

Pages = {327-338},
Abstract = {Climate change policy is a key example for globalized multi-level
   governance, involving the European Parliament (EP) both as legislator of
   internal European Union (EU) regulation and discursive agent in global
   climate negotiations. Based on the comparison of decision-making in
   external and internal climate change policy, the article investigates
   the link between the role of the EP as a political actor and arena for
   the interaction of competing party groups: Does EP involvement in
   negotiations on legally binding legislation prompt or constrain partisan
   polarization in comparison to declaratory statements about future goals
   of climate action? Harnessing a discursive institutionalist theoretical
   framework, the article compares EP resolutions about annual Conferences
   of the Parties (COPs 20 to 24) with the revision of four legislative
   acts for Phase IV of EU Climate Action: namely, emissions trading,
   effort sharing between Member States, the promotion of renewable
   energies, and energy efficiency standards. Using roll-call voting data
   and the review of legislative documentation, the contribution tracks the
   emergence and negotiation of political conflict in these two sets of
   cases. Overall, the case studies indicate a low level of external
   politicization, as indicated by low party group polarization,
   internalization of political conflict at the committee level, and
   compromise-building between issue dimensions.},

Abstract = {Parliamentary control of the armed forces is a core norm of the liberal
   security sector reform paradigm. Western governments and transnational
   actors have spread this norm to democratizing states through financial
   and technical assistance. This article examines its diffusion to two new
   democracies of the Global South, Indonesia and Nigeria. Past research on
   civil-military relations has relied on historical and rationalist
   explanations of ideational and institutional change. Employing diffusion
   theory, this article adopts an alternative approach. The findings
   display major differences: while Nigerian reformers contented themselves
   with a mere mimicry of the new externally propagated norm, the
   Indonesian contestation over parliamentary oversight has produced
   `constitutive localization'.},

Abstract = {Despite the fact that US presidential candidates commonly position
   themselves as Washington outsiders, this broadly populist positioning
   has thus far been significantly undertheorized. On the one hand,
   scholars of political representation have explored how politicians
   connect with political audiences; on the other, populism research has
   focused on the construction, mainstreaming and appeal of populist
   performances. A detailed theorization of the paradoxical performative
   operation by which self-styled political outsiders come to be more
   effective in connecting with political audiences than accomplished
   politicians has yet to be undertaken. This article explores the
   performativity of outsider positioning, paying particular attention to
   its effect on perceptions of legitimacy. The article investigates
   legitimacy as a complex and paradoxical performative phenomenon that
   involves multiple competing sources of agency. The case is made that, by
   discouraging the perception of the political system as a unified whole,
   populist-style performances by mainstream politicians undermine
   institutional legitimacy. In a way that is at odds at odds with the
   cooperative demands inherent in the US federal government, these
   performances encourage the perception that the self-styled outsider is
   engaged in a strictly competitive zero-sum game with the institutional
   structure and its representatives.},

Abstract = {Focal days of protest are increasingly common to episodes of
   revolutionary mobilization. This paper explores the significance of
   focal days in patterning sustained protest in Egypt and Tunisia from
   2011 to 2012. In Egypt, resource-poor activists exploited the confluence
   of worshippers on Fridays to mobilize mass transitory protest. This
   reliance on ritualized action hindered cross-sectoral coordination and
   meant mass protest often failed to inflict a direct economic cost. In
   Tunisia, there was no focal day of protest, in large part due to the
   coordinating hand of trade unions. In consequence, mass protest was more
   likely to span multiple sites, sectors, and tactics. These results
   suggest that oppositions can sustain mass mobilization even absent
   organizational capacity, but a reliance on a focal day limits the
   potential of protest over a political transition. Supplementary analyses
   point to the applicability of our findings to a number of other Arab
   Spring countries.},

Abstract = {In this study, we examine the individual-level characteristics of
   extremists' pursuit of chemical/biological (CB) agents. Using three
   different maximum likelihood estimation techniques, we identify three
   key findings. First, older extremists are more likely to pursue CB than
   younger extremists. Second, extremists who are jobless or are students
   are more likely to pursue CB than employed extremists. Third, Islamist,
   far right, and far left extremists are less likely to pursue CB than
   single issue extremists. We do not find any evidence that gender or
   education have an effect on whether an extremist will pursue CB agents.
   Since there has been little quantitative examination of unconventional
   weapon choices among violent extremists, this study makes an important
   contribution to the literature on CB adversaries.},
