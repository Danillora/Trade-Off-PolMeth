Abstract = {This article provides an introduction to the collection of short
   articles in recognition of the 25th anniversary of political scientist
   Michael C. Dawson's pioneering book, Behind the Mule: Race and Class in
   African-American Politics (Princeton 1994). Each article in this special
   Dialogues section uses data from the 2016 Collaborative Multiracial
   Post-Election Survey (CMPS) to help us understand the ways in which
   linked fate continues to be instrumental to the discipline of political
   science and the social sciences more broadly, as well as its limitations
   to our understanding of group identity in American political behavior
   and public opinion. This introduction also offers a brief overview of
   the articles included in this special PGI Dialogues section.},

Abstract = {In their seminal Presidents and Assemblies, Shugart and Carey regard
   executive prerogatives over legislation as a potential threat to
   democratic stability. This article asks whether this claim is also valid
   beyond presidential systems. A long-term analysis of four cases
   (Britain, France, Sweden and Germany) over the 1866-2015 period leads to
   three preliminarily conclusions. First, executive prerogatives - the
   veto, privileges in the introduction of certain pieces of legislation
   and decree powers - can also be found in (emerging) parliamentary and
   semi-presidential systems. Second, even legislatures in non-presidential
   systems are able to balance the representativeness and efficiency of
   legislation. Third, there is evidence that the origins of this ability
   lie in the occurrence of and successful defences against vital threats
   to legislative democracy. Taken together, these findings suggest that
   executive prerogatives over legislation are not a problem (as envisaged
   by Shugart and Carey) but a potential solution with respect to
   democratic stability.},

Abstract = {This article seeks to demonstrate, largely from practitioners'
   perspectives, the growing evolution in understanding and implementation
   of meaningful human rights standards within the policing context. In the
   early 2000s, human rights were perceived and treated as a rather
   restrictive framework in UK policing. They are now more readily seen as
   a set of tools that guide and help the police to balance the views and
   interests of all parties to the criminal justice process. Human rights
   values enable police in the UK to better endeavour to do the right
   thing, `without fear or favour'.},

Number = {3},

Abstract = {In one of the first quantitative articles published on Latino linked
   fate, Sanchez and Masuoka (2010) found that immigrants and those with
   lower incomes are those with the strongest levels of linked fate and,
   that interestingly, the experience of discrimination did not have a
   significant effect on linked fate. They concluded by discussing the
   possible dampening role assimilation and social mobility might have on
   Latino political cohesion. But over a decade has now passed since the
   original data collection used in Sanchez and Masuoka (2010) and many
   events have occurred which lead us to expect changes in how Latino
   linked fate is formed. This article offers an update to our
   understandings of Latino linked fate by comparing the predictors of
   linked fate between 2006 and 2016. The comparison shows that the
   predictors of linked fate levels are different between these two years
   and that the experience of discrimination plays an important and
   significant role in the formation of Latino linked fate in 2016.},

Abstract = {This paper is concerned with the role of International Relations (IR)
   expertise and the academia-policy nexus in contemporary Russia. Drawing
   on interviews with Russia-based scholars, it posits that while there
   exist formal channels of knowledge diffusion between academia and the
   state, there is no clear-cut relationship between knowledge produced in
   academia and the uses of this knowledge by the state. Scholars'
   attitudes towards policy impact, while generally skeptical, span a broad
   spectrum. Some are convinced that achieving impact is impossible, some
   declare unwillingness to interact with the policymaking world, while
   others find providing expert advice difficult but possible under certain
   conditions.},

Abstract = {How can coalition cabinets make policy decisions if the policy
   preferences of the coalition partners are private information? We use a
   mechanism design approach to study the important process of coalition
   governance in this setting. We show that, among all possible mechanisms
   that could structure decision making within a coalition government, the
   mechanism that leads to the ``best{''} policy compromise among coalition
   partners when members' preferences are private information is
   ``constrained ministerial government.{''} This gives each particular
   cabinet minister considerable policy-making power within her policy
   jurisdiction, subject however to the key constraint that other cabinet
   members maintain some control by setting a bound on how far policy can
   be changed from the status quo. Our analysis develops a systematic
   account of what is gained and lost by using any given decision-making
   procedure and of what types of ``compromise{''} are feasible or
   desirable when public policy is made by coalitions.},

Abstract = {The following paper analyzes the relationship between the most important
   multinational corporations in Argentina and the Kirchnerist governments
   during the period 2003-2015. The analysis of the content of the economic
   policies of the period, the context in which they were implemented, and
   the reactions they provoked in foreign companies and their
   representatives, allows us to notice three moments in the relationship
   between the latter and the government: a first stage characterized by an
   open dialogue and a boom in the negotiations between companies and the
   government; a second period marked by the growth of tensions and the
   progressive closure of the dialogue; and a last stage characterized by
   the centralization of the decisions in a reduced group of state actors
   and a marked distance between the multinational companies and the
   government.},

Abstract = {Ethnic minority groups have been and remain underrepresented in the
   British political system. However, we know little about how white
   immigrant origin groups-who share outgroup status based on non-native
   history, but differ to ethnic minority groups in terms of not having
   minority status-compare. Further, contemporary representational study
   also must concern itself with the quality, not just presence, of
   representation provided. This research therefore longitudinally compares
   the access to parliamentary roles for ethnic minority, white immigrant,
   and white British MPs. It finds that visibility of non-native status
   holds back descriptive representation-based on both appearance and
   non-British sounding names.},

Abstract = {To this day, Colombian democracy must face, among other challenges, the
   search for a political and social balance between a number of modern
   ideologies with a secular sense and the great diversity of evangelical
   Christian religious expressions that every day have more freedom for
   their practices, and that through politics they want to take the
   ``divine message{''} to transform society. The objective of this article
   is to ``Identify the ideological profile of the militants of the main
   Christian-evangelical political movements in Colombia{''}, which
   implies, assessing their impact on the country's political culture. It
   was developed through the documentary methodology, close to the
   hermeneutics of the sources. In short, the socio-political events and
   processes that surround these communities are complex for various
   political, doctrinal and subjective reasons, hence the importance of
   defining - as close as possible - the ideological profile of the groups
   studied since their The belief system determines what cultural and / or
   political values are important to them. Also, an approach was made to
   the ideological system of the MIRA political party, a
   neo-Pentecostal-based Christian party that has been in Colombia the
   longest since the Political Constitution of 1991.},

Abstract = {While terrorism and violence tend to move in parallel, the Abu Sayyaf
   Group (ASG) has brought this to new heights in its quest to attain an
   Islamic State in southern Philippines. Though small compared to other
   Islamist organizations, namely the Moro National Liberation Front and
   the Moro Islamic Liberation Front, its violent acts-kidnapping,
   beheading of hostages, among others-have more than made up for its size.
   In fact, it has been the most brutal terrorist movement in the
   Philippines. Partly due to this and the allegiance of its leadership to
   the equally brutal transnational terrorist group, Islamic State, its
   leader Isnilon Hapilon was designated as the Amir of Southeast Asia. The
   group was responsible for the Marawi Siege, which ran for five months
   from May to October 2017, and is considered the worst terrorist-linked
   bloodbath in the country. The deaths of pro-Islamic State leaders such
   as Hapilon are unlikely to change this key DNA of the ASG and of
   terrorism in the Philippines in the near future.},

Abstract = {The article examines the effects that positive and negative experiences
   with applying for social welfare have on the individual's propensity to
   protest. We investigate how being denied or granted social benefits or
   services as well as the interaction of these two experiences influences
   self-reported prospective protest behaviour. We also explore the
   moderating role of one's financial situation on these effects. Referring
   to the scholarship on protest motivations and emotions as well as on
   policy feedback, we hypothesise that receiving social welfare might have
   a different impact on the propensity to protest, depending on the other
   experiences people have had with the welfare state. In order to verify
   the hypotheses, we use survey data from nine European countries,
   gathered within the LIVEWHAT project. One of the major findings is that,
   although both being denied and being granted benefits or service
   positively affect the propensity to protest, the experience of receiving
   benefits moderates the impact of being denied benefit/service on

Abstract = {Studies regularly conclude that ordinary Americans lack the knowledge
   they need to form meaningful political preferences, leading to
   inefficient or counterproductive policy making. Our study of
   conversations about policing among black residents of highly policed
   neighborhoods challenges this prevailing account. We find that people
   possess dual, contradictory knowledge about how the state should operate
   based on written law and how it actually operates as a lived experience;
   that their knowledge is attained through involuntary encounters with the
   state rather than through civics education; and that this knowledge,
   rather than functioning to improve preferences to be communicated to an
   elected official, serves to help individuals distance themselves from
   the antidemocratic face of the state. Our findings point to a rethinking
   of political knowledge and its role in contemporary American democracy.},

Abstract = {Until recently, political ambition has largely been considered to be a
   product of the institutional and political environment. We argue that
   individual personality plays a significant role in nascent political
   ambition and progressive ambition. Using a nationally representative
   survey in the United States and a survey of public officials, we find a
   strong relationship between personality traits and nascent ambition. We
   find that individuals with higher levels of extraversion and openness
   are more likely to consider running for office, while agreeable and
   conscientious individuals are significantly less interested. We also
   find that personality traits do not relate to progressive ambition in
   the same way as they do to nascent ambition. In fact, they are weaker
   predictors of progressive ambition than they are of nascent ambition. We
   argue that democratic elections and public service attract certain types
   of individuals to seek office, which has implications for elite behavior
   and representation.},

Abstract = {This article examines the patterns of gender representation in the UK
   Civil Service to interrogate the claim that there was a regressive
   change in the proportion of women in the most senior grades of Whitehall
   under the UK Coalition Government (2010-2015). It does so by analysing
   both quantitative data covering civil service employment patterns during
   the Coalition years, complemented by new, primary qualitative data drawn
   from interviews conducted by the authors. The article presents an
   original explanation of these shifting patterns, emphasising the crucial
   role of `critical feminist actors' in driving forward gender equality
   and diversity agendas in Whitehall. It concludes by highlighting
   dilemmas and risks involved in this agency-based approach to equality
   and diversity, which relies on the personal drive and commitment of key,
   senior actors; and at the same time is subject to the vicissitudes of
   change in personnel and political environment.},

Abstract = {This study adapts the advocacy coalition framework (ACF) to help explain
   the puzzle of continuity and changes in U.S. nuclear diplomacy toward
   Iran. It shows how coalitions of governmental and nongovernmental actors
   promoted negotiation of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action to
   sharply curtail Iran's nuclear program in exchange for sanctions relief
   and engagement. This agreement remained in place from 2015 to 2018, even
   though President Trump and other opponents sought to dismantle the deal.
   This article demonstrates how competition and power balances shaped the
   foreign policy decision-making process over time. Evidence suggests that
   the ACF offers a compelling lens to explain continuity and change in
   foreign policy.},

Abstract = {This Practitioner's Note considers the disruptive function of Little
   Phil, a mobile app that seeks to democratize philanthropic giving.
   Although many of the cultural aspects of philanthropy - such as
   increased control over donation, tracking the impact of one's giving,
   and building interpersonal relationships with receivers - can be opened
   to any person with an app-hosting device and internet access, it cannot
   supplant the role of big philanthropy and solve Rob Reich's problem: how
   to domesticate private wealth so that it serves democratic purposes?
   Little Phil's disruption has in concept gotten us halfway to
   legitimizing philanthropy. Perhaps the uptake of citizens' panels by
   large philanthropic foundations will cover the remaining distance.},

Abstract = {Political crowdfunding is a relatively new process. Research has sought
   to unveil its functioning in particular case studies. However,
   crowdfunding in electoral campaigns remains largely unexplored and
   little is known about why some candidates are more likely to attain
   targeted donation levels than others. This article addresses this gap in
   the literature and analyzes the use of crowdfunding in the 2017 U.K.
   General Election campaign. It aims to explain the variation in
   candidates' ability to reach the proposed targets. The analysis uses
   original data collected from 100 crowdfunding projects, campaign
   websites, and the social media pages of the candidates during the
   campaign. The findings indicate that candidates with an aggressive
   message, who are realistic about their proposed target and who are
   already in office, are more likely to gather donations closer to their
   targets.},

Abstract = {Education and ethics were like two sides of a coin. This was stated by
   Hegel in the early modern period. However, these two concepts are viewed
   separately in the contemporary era. Therefore, the objective of this
   paper is to analyze both education and ethics enabling the well-ordered
   society to understand the relationship between education and ethics. The
   methodology adopted for this study was descriptive based on the previous
   literature. Hegel pointed out that ethics is the essential requirement
   of human beings and the reasonable way of individual existence. Only
   when individuals become members of the state can they truly achieve
   freedom and liberation. Education should be ethical education, that is,
   education is the intermediary of the individual's free will to realize
   the ethical essence. Education should remove the individual's subjective
   capriciousness and individualism, make them integrate into the ethical
   entity constituted by the social system and historical tradition, and
   realize the individual's self-improvement in the ethical entity. Hegel's
   principle of the philosophy of law is a work of political philosophy,
   which contains abundant educational thoughts. By discussing the
   self-movement process of objective spirit, Hegel explains how to realize
   the reasonable existence of man, that is, the existence as ethics.
   Ethics is the essence of human determinacy, which refers to the unity of
   individual will and universal will. It is only as a member of the
   ethical entity that an individual can truly gain freedom and liberation.
   Hegel pointed out that the highest ethical entity is the state. The
   ethical nature of an individual is reflected in becoming a citizen of
   the state.},

Abstract = {The present study tests the theoretical claim that Eurosceptics
   contribute to the Europeanization of national public spheres. Although
   advocating a renationalization of European politics, Eurosceptic parties
   can engender public media debates of transnational or European
   relevance. Through a comparative research design of two national cases
   (Sweden and Denmark), we examine the public discourse on the day
   following the 2014 European Parliament elections across three media:
   print, Twitter, and Facebook. Separating the discussions of Eurosceptic
   issues and actors from other topics of the election coverage, we find
   that the discourses about Euroscepticism exhibit a higher degree of
   Europeanization in four of the six media analyzed. Moreover, while we
   detect significant differences in valence between the Swedish and Danish
   press when reporting about the Eurosceptics, such national variation is
   much less pronounced on the social networking sites. The findings
   suggest, firstly, that Eurosceptics' contestation of the EU may have the
   unintended effect of giving national media debates a stronger European
   dimension. Secondly, the study warrants moderate optimism for the
   Europeanization potential of social media vis-a-vis traditional media
   structures: Print media was more Europeanized in scope, whereas social
   media publics were more aligned in their sentiment toward
   Euroscepticism.},

Abstract = {In the USA, gun deaths occur at a rate that is 25 times higher than that
   of other developed countries (Grinshteyn and Hemenway in Am J Med
   129(3):266-273, 2016. 10.1016/j.amjmed.2015.10.025). However,
   legislation targeted toward regulating firearms often fails to pass into
   law. While surprising to many observers, this policy response follows an
   established pattern in American politics: despite public support for
   tighter gun laws, the gun rights lobby often successfully suppresses gun
   reform due to their greater monetary resources, political savvy, and
   access to grassroots support than advocates of gun control (Bruce-Briggs
   in The Public interes 45:37, 1976; Goss in Disarmed: the missing
   movement for gun control in America, Princeton University Press,
   Princeton, 2006). However, laws that restrict domestic abusers from
   owning firearms have diverged from this pattern. This study identifies
   an element of advocates' political strategy that increased the
   likelihood of policy change: the prominence of domestic violence
   prevention advocates and ``strategic absence{''} of larger gun control
   groups in the policy debate. The insights generated by this study shed
   light on broader questions about advocacy strategy, the policy-making
   process, and the modern politics of firearms.},

Abstract = {2018 marks the twentieth anniversary of the Good Friday/Belfast
   Agreement and the establishment of devolved governance in Northern
   Ireland. Yet, whilst devolution has largely been held to have positive
   effects in Scotland and Wales with regards to both women's descriptive
   and substantive representation, this impact has been less discernible in
   Northern Ireland. Of the four regions of the United Kingdom, politics in
   Northern Ireland is arguably the most unfeminised-women have routinely
   seen lower descriptive representation in the Northern Irish Assembly and
   policy-making in areas such as reproductive rights lies far behind the
   rest of the UK. The article explores why politics is so unfeminised in
   the post-conflict context in Northern Ireland, by looking at efforts to
   feminine formal politics (especially the various peace/inter-party
   agreements and attempts to include women in formal politics) and efforts
   to politicise feminist activism (the work of the women's sector to
   influence policy-making in the province). It then explores some of the
   academic explanations as to why the feminisation of politics remains so
   difficult in Northern Ireland.},

Abstract = {Proponents of restrictions on the wearing of religious symbols in public
   institutions in Quebec have often framed their support in the language
   of liberalism, with references to ``gender equality{''}, ``state
   neutrality{''} and ``freedom of conscience{''}. However, efforts to
   account for support for restrictions on minority religious symbols
   rarely mention liberalism. In this article, we test the hypothesis that
   holding liberal values might have different attitudinal consequences in
   Quebec and the rest of Canada. Our findings demonstrate that holding
   liberal values is associated with support for restrictions on the
   wearing of minority religious symbols in Quebec, but it is associated
   with opposition to such restrictions in the rest of Canada. Moreover,
   this difference between Quebec and the rest of Canada in the
   relationship between liberal values and support for restrictions on
   minority religious symbols can explain Quebecers' greater support for
   restrictions.},

Volume = {2},

Abstract = {Populism is not a determinate political phenomenon, but a heuristic
   category deployed to diagnose the sources of danger to well established
   representative democracy through the workings of its core institutions.
   As a political charge, populism is deployed by defenders of established
   parties to denounce interlopers who threaten them at the ballot box and
   in less formal settings. When actualised, it is a natural political
   retribution for governmental ineffectuality in face of protracted
   crisis. Populism is no danger for Korea. The level of risk for populist
   triumph is the reciprocal of prior failure in democratic government.
   Both the Trump Presidency and the Brexit Referendum are populist
   responses to prior governmental failure in well-established democracies.
   Populism is always a consequence, not a cause, of political failure.},

Abstract = {This paper reconstructs and confronts Schmitt ` s and Arendt's
   theoretical approximation to the concept of `the political'. Schmitt and
   Arendt are, probably, two of the most relevant references regarding the
   origin of the problematization of the political; nevertheless,
   diametrically opposite. The thesis that guides this paper sustains that
   that is due to the fact that the political spaces of investigation and
   enunciation of the political directly affect the theoretical
   constructions which come off from those spaces of enunciation. This
   implies that the concept of `the political' is necessarily polysemic and

Abstract = {This article evaluates the performance of the Central American
   Presidential Summit, based on a political sociology approach of
   regionalism, and the concepts of political authority and rules
   compliance. The trajectory of the Presidential Summits since 1986, is
   examined through a theoretical approximation inspired by international
   relations sociologists and by applying an inductive methodology. The
   results indicate that almost since its creation, the Central American
   Presidential Summit did not achieve full operability according to its
   institutional design and diplomatic practices. The evidence suggests
   that presidential summits do not act as the driver of Central American
   regionalism. The article affirms that the weak political will from the
   member states explains the limited institutional performance of the
   Central American Integration System.},

Abstract = {The professionalization of politics and the disappearance of party
   organizations based on activists seems an inescapable trend. This
   article shows, by studying the Broad Front of Uruguay as a deviant case,
   the relevance of organizational rules for explaining the reproduction of
   party activism. Using data from both an online survey of people
   differing in their levels of engagement with the Broad Front and
   in-depth interviews with party activists, we show that those with
   relatively low levels of engagement-{''}adherents{''}-and activists
   differ in their willingness to cooperate with the party and in the time
   they devote to party activities. Also, we find that reducing the
   perceived efficacy of political engagement strongly decreases activists'
   self-reported willingness to engage with the party, while this reduction
   has no effect upon adherents. These findings suggest that the design of
   organizational rules that grant a political role to grassroots
   organizers can promote party activism.},

Abstract = {Countries across the world are faced with high levels of corruption. In
   an effort to combat the threat, governments have declared war on
   corruption and have consequently put in place some anti-corruption
   institutions. The causes of corruption are numerous and the consequences
   are devastating for the social, political and economic development of
   nations. The perpetrators of corruption are in most cases the public
   servants as they are charged with the day-to-day administration of the
   government. This means that the caliber of public servants; which is
   determined by their recruitment inter alia will influence their
   practices and conduct. Lesotho has adopted a Westminster model of public
   administration in which recruitment to the public service is supposed to
   be merit-based. However, the recruitment of top officers such as
   Principal Secretaries is politically motivated and this has consequently
   resulted into a highly politicised public service; literature points
   that there is a relationship between politicisation of the public
   service and corruption. In this paper, I scrutinize and explain the
   effect of a politicised public service on the high magnitude of
   corruption in Lesotho. This study is based on secondary data such as
   official government reports, newspapers and research reports. I argue
   that the highly politicised public service in Lesotho contributes to the
   corruption scourge that is besieging the country. I therefore recommend
   administrative reforms in view of depoliticizing the public service by
   removing the authority to appoint, promote and dismiss high-ranking
   public officers from the Prime Minister to a special Parliamentary
   committee that is inclusive of members from the ruling and opposition
   parties.},

   and impact of such programs? In this paper, we examine the contexts in
   which citizenship programs that embody the political aspirations of
   foreign states, are implemented. Embedded in local political realities,
   participants in these programs routinely question the ef?cacy and
   applicability of training modules focused on active citizenship and
   civic engagement. We argue that the proliferation of active citizenship
   programs for civil society organizations in practice serves to both
   bolster state legitimacy and discourage community leaders and activists
   from expressing political dissent. By submerging conflicting values,
   practices, and perspectives while encouraging civic participation based
   on conformity rather than dissent, active citizenship programs risk
   fostering a depoliticized civil society that is detached from the local
   political context.},

Abstract = {A notable gender gap in candidate selection still exists in Canada.
   While the five major political parties all used a similar decentralized
   candidate selection process in the 2015 Canadian federal election, the
   proportion of women candidates varied significantly by party. Placing
   the authority for selection with constituency-level party organizations
   limits the ability of parties to impose top-down gender parity policies
   and also, in principle, makes the process sensitive to demographic and
   political differences among constituencies. However, the results of
   mixed-methods analyses show limited influence of traditional local
   political and demographic variables, but a strong effect of party. The
   findings also show significant spatial clustering, suggesting that
   factors such as local social networks may help explain the variation in
   the nomination of women candidates. We conclude by discussing how party
   cultures and social networks might reflect supply and demand obstacles
   for potential women candidates, and how these factors might present
   challenges to achieving gender parity among federal candidates in
   Canada.},

Abstract = {We show that Brazilian voters strongly sanction malfeasant mayors when
   presented with hypothetical scenarios but take no action when given the
   same information about their own mayor. Partnering with the State
   Accounts Court of Pernambuco, we conducted a field experiment during the
   2016 municipal elections in which the treatment group received
   information about official wrongdoing by their mayor. The treatment has
   no effect on self-reported voting behavior after the election, yet when
   informing about malfeasance in the context of a vignette experiment, we
   are able to replicate the strong negative effect found in prior studies.
   We argue that voters' behavior in the abstract reflects the
   comparatively strong norm against corruption in Brazil. Yet on Election
   Day, their behavior is constrained by factors such as attitudes toward
   local political dynasties and the greater salience of more pressing
   concerns like employment and health services.},

Abstract = {In dominant-party regimes, party cadres' participation in decision
   making constrains dictators from arbitrarily changing policy.
   Dominant-party regimes are also better at mobilizing supporters in
   exchange for extensive patronage. The conventional wisdom is that these
   two mechanisms work together to prolong dominant-party regimes. However,
   under certain conditions, the elite-level constraints restrict
   autocratic leaders' ability to engage in patronage distribution. We
   focus on monetary institutions, arguing that when central bank
   independence overlaps with the collective decision making in
   dominant-party regimes, dictators have diminished control over the
   central bank. Thus, the central bank is effective enough to restrict
   expansionary fiscal policy, reducing the mobilization of supporters
   through patronage and increasing authoritarian breakdown risk. Analyses
   on data from 1970 to 2012 in 94 autocracies find that high central bank
   independence in dominant-party regimes increases the likelihood of
   breakdown. Moreover, independent central banks in party-based
   autocracies contribute to lower fiscal expenditures.},

Abstract = {In federal political systems such as the United States, there has long
   existed a view that citizens should be more politically competent at the
   local level than at the federal level of government. Recent studies have
   challenged this view. This article argues that these findings may
   reflect only one part of the broader picture. Through a review of two
   recent studies, I contend that research in this realm must consider more
   than only the level of government. Odd as this sounds, assumptions about
   varying levels of political competence at different levels of government
   have always been premised on the notion that local-level politics is
   smaller and less complex than federal-level politics. However, when
   local politics takes place today against the backdrop of small villages
   and towns as well as in large cities, these are assumptions that must be
   reevaluated.},

Title = {States, Last Resort, and the Obligation to Securitize},
Journal = {POLITY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {51},
Number = {2},
Pages = {378-394},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {This symposium article aims to showcase the strengths of thinking
   ethically about securitization using the concept of just securitization.
   It poses the research question: When, if ever, are states required to
   securitize? I argue that using the just securitization concept leads to
   three rival answers, each modelled on competing interpretations of the
   just war tradition's principle of last resort. The article examines the
   relative strengths and weaknesses of the literal strong last resort,
   ameliorated moderate last resort, and modified weak last resort
   principles. It then examines the validity of the three competing ethical
   stances regarding when states are morally required to securitize that
   can be generated from the respective interpretations of last resort.
   These ethical stances are: 1) securitization is never obligatory; 2)
   securitization is obligatory when it is necessary to achieving just
   cause; and 3) securitization is obligatory when it is expected to be the
   best option. While siding with the ethical stance contained within
   ameliorated moderate last resort, in which obligation remains tied to
   necessity, I caution that the utility of such a principle ultimately
   depends on intersubjective agreements among security scholars pertaining
   to definitions concerning, for example, the nature of viable
   alternatives to securitization.},

Abstract = {Do newcomers, also known as outsiders, think differently than
   traditional politicians in Latin American legislatures? We approach this
   question from an individual perspective, especially relevant in the
   personalist context of Latin America. We use interviews carried out in
   the current decade with up to 1,115 legislators in 17 countries. We look
   at opinions related to the perception of corruption as a problem in the
   country, same-sex marriage, and State regulation of the economy. Our
   work confirms the existence of a difference between newcomers and
   traditional politicians, even though it is only marginal. It goes
   against the common sense that points out at a clearer divide.},

Abstract = {Collaboration is an approach and concept of managing public policy in
   Makassar, Indonesia. Recently, the municipality of Makassar has
   capitalized on the collaboration of local government agencies regarding
   public affairs to prevent issues of Adolescent Reproductive Health
   (ARH). ARH is a strategic issue for local government so that it is
   solved collaboratively. The collaborating governmental organization
   comprises the Department of Education, Health, Family Planning, and all
   of the Urban Villages. This research employed a qualitative method
   focusing on the analysis of collaborative phenomena of local government
   agencies in Generation Planning Program through Adolescent Counseling
   Information Center (ACIC) and Adolescent Families Development (AFD) in
   Makassar. Data were obtained and analyzed in an orderly and structured
   manner with general qualitative approach. Based on the field research,
   the local government agencies collaborate in two ways. The first
   collaboration deals with the sectoral term which is the involvement of
   the government agencies related to adolescent reproductive health
   policy. The second collaboration deals with the regional term including
   the involvement of the Sub-District and Urban Villages in Makassar as
   grassroots bureaucracy. Collaborative themes and relations are the main
   findings in this article. An interesting theme in the idea of
   collaboration is mutual interdependence, while an exciting theme in the
   implementation of collaborative action is joint interaction.
   Organizational relationships in collaboration between local government
   agencies are coordination, consolidation, consultation, and command.
   This study concluded that sectoral and regional collaboration is proper
   in bringing a solution to public health affairs that are very complex.},

Abstract = {The state occupies a central place in the study of a range of political,
   economic, and social outcomes. This article brings into dialogue
   literature on the state and emerging research on criminal politics
   through a study of protection rackets. Conceiving of criminal protection
   rackets as institutional arrangements of extraction and domination, I
   develop a political economy framework to explain variation in forms of
   resistance to rackets. The framework shows that distinct configurations
   of economic and political resources influence the type of resistance
   available to subordinates. I illustrate the framework's utility using
   micro-level data on resistance to rackets in Latin America. Attention to
   how resource endowments shape patterns of resistance to projects of
   extraction and domination provides a novel window into the bottom-up
   dynamics of state building.},

Abstract = {Some scholars have argued that lower levels of media attention given to
   female candidates, relative to male candidates, may contribute to the
   under-representation of women in politics. Yet, other research suggests
   female candidates may receive more coverage than male candidates. To
   advance our understanding of this issue, we introduce and analyse a
   novel dataset measuring the weekly quantity of newspaper coverage given
   to 72 different candidates across 34 of the most marginal constituencies
   in the 2015 UK General Election. The data span 31 local and 6 national
   newspapers. Statistical analyses and two pairs of quantitatively
   matched, qualitative comparisons suggest that female candidates received
   more newspaper coverage than male candidates, even after controlling for
   several alternative predictors of media attention including party,
   incumbency and time until election. Our findings have important
   implications for debates about gender equality in British politics.},

Title = {Cameroon: State Policy as Grounds for Indigenous Rebellion. The Bakweri
   Land Problem, 1946-2014},
Journal = {CONFLICT STUDIES QUARTERLY},
Year = {2019},
Number = {27},
Pages = {39-58},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {The history of Africa in recent years has been marked by instability in
   the form of separatist movements, agitations for political rights and
   freedoms as well as open resistance against government action. This
   study about conflict over natural resources explores the leeway as well
   as the mechanisms that enhanced the alleged loss of land rights by
   Bakweri people in Fako Division of Cameroon and evaluates efforts they
   exerted to retrieve these appropriated lands. Cameroonian post-colonial
   state policy between 1963 and 1974 invalidated the provisions of a 1958
   Land and Native Rights Ordinance that had re-established customary
   rights over colonial entitlements to land thereby transforming homegrown
   people from owners to holders of their ancestral lands. This policy was
   exactly calculated to extort the inalienable communal property of the
   various peoples whose privileges to land were based upon immemorial
   usage and who were attached to their lands in life and limb. After about
   a century of persistent land hunger, they formed a Bakweri Lands Claim
   Committee (BLCC) to wrest their ancestral lands from alien occupants.
   Although the confrontation raged for about 150 years, the
   divide-and-rule policies of successive governments invalidated their
   efforts. According to research findings, the exacerbation of this
   imbroglio was another ploy by a French-speaking dominated apparatchik to
   totally dismantle and disrupt the nascent economy of the
   English-speaking part the country. Through their actions, government
   officials authenticated the fact that Cameroon law did not protect
   indigenous minority rights and openly demonstrated that Bakweri land
   rights could only be restored if Decree No. 74-1 of July 6, 1974 that
   established rules governing land tenure in Cameroon was amended. Whereas
   the Bakweri indigenes have struggled to restitute their land rights, the
   regime consistently exerted its authority by invoking the law that
   declares inter alia,{''} ... the state shall be the guardian of all
   lands{''}. But strangely enough, BLCC members have hailed this same law
   as a confirmation of their rights of private ownership and in 1999,
   their chiefs stated emphatically that ``this cannot possibly apply to
   CDC occupied lands {[}which] were known even to the German colonial
   administration and would have featured in the official German land
   registers ...{''}. Thus, while the Bakweri claimed private property
   rights, the state remained unyielding that the assertion was a farce and
   that is why its authority has remained primordial in a land surrender
   process that it initiated in 2003 and halted in 2014.},

Abstract = {Friedrich Hayek's account of ``spontaneous order{''} has generated
   increasing interest in recent decades. His argument for the superiority
   of the market in distributing knowledge without the need for central
   oversight has appealed to progressive democratic theorists, who are wary
   of the hubris of state planning and attracted to possibilities for
   self-organization, and to Foucaultians, who have long counseled
   political theory to cut off the King's head. A spontaneous social order,
   organized by an invisible hand, would appear to dispense with arbitrary
   power and foster creativity and individual liberty. This article
   challenges this view by highlighting the centrality of submission to
   Hayek's account of spontaneous order. It shows that Hayek struggles to
   obscure the providentialism underpinning the account of social order he
   derives from Adam Ferguson and the Scottish Enlightenment. Nonetheless,
   his own account of spontaneous order relies on faith in the workings of
   the market, and submission to unintelligible market forces.},

Abstract = {This article develops and evaluates a set of expectations regarding the
   mechanisms via which democratic experience could shape support for
   democracy. In line with previous studies, one straightforward
   possibility considered is that experience with democracy fosters greater
   affective support for democracy, making citizens of old democracies more
   supportive of this regime independently of government performance and
   other characteristics. Another possibility considered is that democratic
   experience mediates the importance of performance assessments in
   citizens' judgments about democracy, decreasing the importance of
   economic performance assessments, while increasing that of political
   performance assessments. Statistical analyses of public opinion data
   from 23 countries in the Americas indicate that the effect of democratic
   experience on support for democracy is not statistically significant.
   Rather, democratic experience conditions the effects of performance
   assessments on support for democracy. The evidence also supports the
   assertion that experience with democracy, and not economic development,
   is what conditions the effects of performance assessments on support for
   democracy.},

Abstract = {Studies interested in Indigenous voting in Canada tend to focus on
   socio-economic, cultural and political factors that explain their lower
   levels of electoral participation. While highly relevant given Canada's
   ongoing reality as a settler-colonial state, these studies are of
   limited help in making sense of recent increases in electoral engagement
   in Indigenous communities across the country. Using data from four
   elections between 2006 and 2015, this study focuses instead on why some
   Indigenous individuals vote and how they vote. Our analysis suggests
   that one of many possible reasons for the recent surge in Indigenous
   turnout has to do with the candidates presenting themselves for
   elections. Higher voter turnout in Indigenous communities corresponds
   with a higher proportion of Indigenous candidates. This trend is
   consistent with the literature on affinity voting. We also find that
   political parties who present an Indigenous candidate receive more votes
   in constituencies with a high proportion of Indigenous voters.},

Abstract = {What effect does the type of economic sanctions have on sanctions
   duration? Despite extensive research about their effect on sanctions
   success, little is known about how sanction types affect the duration of
   sanctions episodes. I argue that, among different types of economic
   sanctions, terminating foreign aid to target states (foreign aid
   sanctions) expedites target capitulation, because it imposes
   disproportionate costs on elites and crucial regime supporters. However,
   I also contend that the effect of foreign aid sanctions is rendered
   indistinguishable from other types of economic coercion over time, as
   target governments adjust to the adverse impacts of sanctions. The
   empirical tests using the Threat and Imposition of Economic Sanctions
   dataset provide supporting evidence for my hypotheses that foreign aid
   sanctions accelerate target capitulations, but this effect diminishes
   over time.},

Abstract = {Developing countries in China's neighborhood have occupied a unique
   position in China's foreign policy since the beginning of the 21st
   century. China's cooperation with neighboring developing countries has
   been intensified due to a number of factors including, among other
   things, growing overall national strength, increasingly urgent
   development needs of neighboring countries, and extraterritorial powers'
   shifting strategic focus. Over the past decades, closer economic
   cooperation between China and neighboring developing countries has
   facilitated the formation of a network of partnerships and sharpened
   China's sense of global responsibility. However, multiple challenges
   have to be tackled before China can elevate its relations with its
   neighboring countries to a new level, such as inadequate protection of
   China's expanding overseas interests, lingering misunderstanding and
   disputes between China and its neighbors, as well as interference from
   extraterritorial powers.},

Abstract = {We investigate the interplay between party communication and media
   coverage in putting EU issues on the agenda during the 2014 European
   Parliamentary election campaigns in Austria, Germany and the United
   Kingdom. A temporal pattern analysis focuses on the dynamic perspective
   of media-parties' interactions based on a quantitative content analysis
   of (a) the press releases published by parties and (b) the coverage of
   two leading newspapers per country 12 weeks prior to the elections. We
   find that most public discourses are started by the media; however,
   political parties especially in Austria are also quite successful in
   initiating discussions about EU issues. Interestingly, once an issue has
   been placed on the agenda, only a few parties take the opportunity of
   exploiting their issue-ownership in response to the media agenda. On the
   other side, media react to publications of all party types, even radical
   parties.},

Abstract = {Contemporary conceptions and practices regarding complicity have led to
   the surprising emergence of citizens who seek rather than flee
   complicity. The purpose of this is to gain standing to challenge
   controversial state practices. As in the recent Hobby Lobby decision,
   such attempts to demonstrate complicity are not motivated by a desire to
   take ownership over state actions, but to justify institutional reforms
   or individual opt-outs that would not be legitimized absent such a
   finding of complicity. This article highlights the danger posed by the
   proliferation of claims of this sort and works to unpack and critique
   the logic of such efforts to demonstrate complicity. Such claims rely
   upon implied political meanings of complicity, which affirm a strong
   connection between complicity, standing, and sovereignty. These
   political meanings of complicity are embedded in familiar conceptions of
   liberal democratic citizenship, but upon examination prove to be in
   tension with core liberal principles. By bringing to the surface the
   connection between complicity, standing, and sovereignty, this logic may
   be reformulated in such a way as to contribute to healthier modes of
   democratic participation.},

Abstract = {This article addresses the impact of EU-specific political knowledge on
   the perceptions of legitimacy towards the European Union (EU). Following
   the literature on attitude research, one can expect apositive as well as
   anegative impact. By implementing aquasi-experimental design with
   arepertory grid, the article confirms the negative impact of EU-specific
   political knowledge on perceptions of the EU's legitimacy. As
   EU-specific political knowledge increased, the perception of legitimacy
   decreased. At the same time, democratic norms and values became more
   important in the respondents' views. The results are in line with the
   phenomenon of critical citizens, whereby respondents' individual
   normative standards diverge from the reality.},

Abstract = {Populists are often identified based on their behavior, but the
   discursive element of their identities is also a frequently observed
   characteristic of this type of leader. We examine the determinants of
   populist foreign policy rhetoric in the case of Venezuela's Hugo Chavez.
   We argue that a leftist populist leader such as Chavez will focus on
   anti-imperialist themes, and we consider two mechanisms that may
   indicate the conditions under which he will use them: diversion, which
   would typically be expected from a populist, and capacity. We use
   time-series analysis of rhetorical data scraped from the entire corpus
   of Alo Presidente-Chavez's weekly television series-to test our
   hypotheses. The evidence supports the capacity mechanism, that Chavez is
   emboldened to use anti-imperialist rhetoric when the price of oil is
   high. His rhetoric, thus, matches his resources and ability to provide
   domestic and international goods to support his own identity as a
   protector and savior of the common people from domestic and global
   elites engaged in the imperialistic enterprise.},

Abstract = {Although Thaksin Shinawatra's three political parties, together called
   ``the TSP{''} in this article, overwhelmingly won all four elections
   between 2001 and 2011, explaining their dominance is a challenge.
   Nevertheless, this article attempts to shed some light on how the TSP
   politicized already latent cleavages, namely the basic split between the
   lower-middle class and the rural poor versus mostly Sino-Thai
   Bangkokians and the urban middle class, and made them even more
   significant. After the TSP was dissolved by court order following the
   2006 military coup, these deep divides transformed into two major
   cleavages, namely the dominating center-local dimension which pits
   Bangkokian and the urban pole against the provincial pole and the
   royalist and traditional establishment pole against pro-populist
   politicians. The TSP's ability to incorporate certain demands into its
   agendas pointed to its power to manipulate these cleavages. At the same
   time, its capacity to organize and mobilize certain groups deepened
   those divisions and allowed the party to win elections without having to
   institutionalize the party. The TSP's failure to develop a strong
   organizational structure was partly a result of frequent coups d'etat as
   well as its centralized style of leadership. The TSP's reach across
   groups spanning these two cleavages would allow the TSP to win the
   upcoming election without having to embrace the dynamics of change in
   voters' preferences. However, the precariously balanced relationship
   between the TSP and its supporters has to be carefully maintained, or
   the existing social cleavages may be increasingly difficult to sustain
   if new political parties emerge.},

Abstract = {Despite the traditional resistance to consider climate change as a
   national security issue, the security impact of climate change has been
   increasingly recognized by official discourses in China over the past
   few years. The Chinese perception on climate change has shifted from a
   development issue to a security topic; and two driving forces are behind
   the emergence of the climate security discourse: the shift of China's
   economy towards a ``New Normal{''} and the commitments China made in the
   Paris Agreement on Climate Change. Meanwhile, two modalities of
   discourse that characterize the Chinese context are also discerned. One
   that involves national security has a rather fixed procedure about how
   security can be spoken of and by whom; the other is more relevant for
   issues like climate change and air pollution. In both cases, even if the
   language of security is used with regard to climate issues, they are
   handled as normal politics and governmental actions are legitimized by
   the use of security language. Although China has taken on more climate
   responsibilities, it seems unprepared for global climate leadership
   because security considerations not only determine the country's
   participation but also limit its international commitments in global
   climate governance.},

Abstract = {The collection of articles in this special issue provides a
   comprehensive analysis of European Union decision-making during the
   Eurozone crisis. We investigate national preference formation and
   interstate bargaining related to major reforms of the Economic and
   Monetary Union. The analyses rely on the new `EMU Positions' dataset.
   This dataset includes information about the preferences and saliences of
   all 28 EU member states and key EU institutions, regarding 47 contested
   issues negotiated between 2010 and 2015. In this introductory article,
   we first articulate the motivation behind this special issue and outline
   its collective contribution. We then briefly summarise each article
   within this collection; the articles analyse agenda setting, preference
   formation, coalition building, bargaining dynamics, and bargaining
   success. Finally, we present and discuss the `EMU Positions' dataset.},

Abstract = {This article considers how a major influx of migrants from North Africa
   and the Middle East during 2015 led to an EU-initiated collective
   securitisation of the Schengen space. The events of 2015 represented an
   internal crisis for the EU. This was not simply because migration
   stretched host country facilities and created political division within
   and between the member states. The uncoordinated reintroduction of
   border controls by some member states threatened the unravelling of the
   Schengen Agreement itself. The consequent security discourse which then
   gained currency in EU documents strongly underlined the need `to go back
   to normality' and `to go back to Schengen', not only to manage
   increasingly tense relations among member states but also to preserve
   what was seen as a core achievement of the EU. Contrary to the
   expectations of mainstream literature on securitisation, the policies
   enacted in response to the securitisation of Schengen have violated
   neither `normal politics' of the EU nor existing or planned policies on
   migration and asylum despite the wide contestation of current EU
   migration and asylum practices. The article concludes that the normative
   dimension behind this collective securitisation should not be
   underestimated or too easily discounted.},

Title = {Can the online crowd match real expert judgments? How task complexity
   and coder location affect the validity of crowd-coded data},
Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL RESEARCH},

Abstract = {Crowd-coding is a novel technique that allows for fast, affordable and
   reproducible online categorisation of large numbers of statements. It
   combines judgements by multiple, paid, non-expert coders to avoid
   miscoding(s). It has been argued that crowd-coding could replace expert
   judgements, using the coding of political texts as an example in which
   both strategies produce similar results. Since crowd-coding yields the
   potential to extend the replication standard to data production and to
   `scale' coding schemes based on a modest number of carefully devised
   test questions and answers, it is important that its possibilities and
   limitations are better understood. While previous results for low
   complexity coding tasks are encouraging, this study assesses whether and
   under what conditions simple and complex coding tasks can be outsourced
   to the crowd without sacrificing content validity in return for
   scalability. The simple task is to decide whether a party statement
   counts as positive reference to a concept - in this case: equality. The
   complex task is to distinguish between five concepts of equality. To
   account for the crowd-coder's contextual knowledge, the IP restrictions
   are varied. The basis for comparisons is 1,404 party statements, coded
   by experts and the crowd (resulting in 30,000 online judgements).
   Comparisons of the expert-crowd match at the level of statements and
   party manifestos show that the results are substantively similar even
   for the complex task, suggesting that complex category schemes can be
   scaled via crowd-coding. The match is only slightly higher when IP
   restrictions are used as an approximation of coder expertise.},

   elected office},
Journal = {COMPARATIVE EUROPEAN POLITICS},

Abstract = {This article investigates the representation of women on the three
   sub-national levels of government in Germany from 1995 to 2013, drawing
   on a novel data collection. Although longitudinal trends point to an
   overall increase on the national level, we find large variations-both
   upturns and downturns-from one election to the next on the state,
   district, and municipal levels. Our results suggest that a saturation
   point in women's representation in subnational assemblies, located
   around 25\%, largely accounts for these fluctuations. Assemblies
   featuring a high proportion of female officeholders before an election
   are more likely to experience stagnation and declines in subsequent
   elections. Legislatures with a low share of female representatives prior
   to an election, by contrast, experience the largest positive changes in
   their proportion of women. These findings contradict established
   theories that lead us to expect women's representation to follow a
   self-reinforcing process, with parity as an end point. Rather, we find
   that women hit a `glass ceiling' far sooner.},

Abstract = {What explains online radicalization and support for ISIS in the West?
   Over the past few years, thousands of individuals have radicalized by
   consuming extremist content online, many of whom eventually traveled
   overseas to join the Islamic State. This study examines whether
   anti-Muslim hostility might drive pro-ISIS radicalization in Western
   Europe. Using new geo-referenced data on the online behavior of
   thousands of Islamic State sympathizers in France, the United Kingdom,
   Germany, and Belgium, I study whether the intensity of anti-Muslim
   hostility at the local level is linked to pro-ISIS radicalization on
   Twitter. The results show that local-level measures of anti-Muslim
   animosity correlate significantly and substantively with indicators of
   online radicalization, including posting tweets sympathizing with ISIS,
   describing life in ISIS-controlled territories, and discussing foreign
   fighters. High-frequency data surrounding events that stir support for
   ISIS-terrorist attacks, propaganda releases, and anti-Muslim
   protests-show the same pattern.},

Abstract = {How much do the political values of politicians endure throughout their
   careers? And how might the endurance be explained? This paper uses a
   unique longitudinal data set to examine the persistence of political
   values among national politicians: members of the British House of
   Commons, who completed Rokeach-type value ranking instruments during
   1971-73 and again 40 years later in 2012-16. The findings show
   remarkable stability and provide strong support for the persistence
   hypothesis which predicts that politicians develop crystallized value
   systems by their early thirties and largely maintain those values into
   retirement. This is consistent with the view that rapid changes in
   aggregate party ideologies have more to do with new views among new
   waves of recruits than with conversions among old members.},

Abstract = {Young men often make up a large share of newly arriving immigrant
   populations. How this impacts attitudes is unclear: young men have the
   potential to make substantial economic contributions, meaning attitudes
   toward them may be more favorable. However, young men may be seen as
   security and cultural threats, exacerbating anti-immigrant attitudes. I
   conduct a conjoint experiment on a sample of 2,100 Germans, asking them
   to evaluate groups of immigrants with randomly varying shares of young
   men. The results show that groups of immigrants with a large share of
   young men receive substantially less support. Further tests reveal that
   respondents also perceive of these groups as likely to pose security and
   cultural threats; there is no evidence that young men are viewed as
   having high economic potential. These results have implications for the
   importance of economic, cultural, and security concerns in underpinning
   attitudes toward immigrants.},

   Horn of Africa},
Journal = {AFRICAN JOURNAL ON CONFLICT RESOLUTION},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {19},
Number = {1},
Pages = {11-36},
Abstract = {Although research on natural resource and ethnic identity-based conflict
   abounds, studies which critically examine how the state
   fragility-conflict nexus shapes the contemporary security of the Horn of
   Africa are rather limited. Qualitatively designed, this study attempts
   to explore and explain security implications of such a nexus. Analysis
   of the regional security complex (RSC) and empirical data from the field
   reveal that conflict dynamics feed and fuel state fragility in the Horn
   of Africa sub-region. The presence of extra-regional security actors,
   who are competing for military bases along the coast of Djibouti, the
   spill-over effects of violence in Yemen, and the Iran-Saudi power
   rivalry, together with incompetent regional political leadership, tend
   to shape the security of the Horn. Hence, a new and innovative approach
   to contemporary security and political commitment are sine qua non since
   the existing institutions and policies are not fully capable of coping
   with the need for a new security regionalism. It is hoped that the
   recent rapprochement between Eritrea and Ethiopia, albeit at an
   embryonic stage, is and will be a positive force capable of bringing
   about a paradigm shift in security structure, and inducing a viable and
   sustainable economic, political and security community in the Horn of
   Africa.},

Abstract = {The article analyzes the prospects for the possible participation of the
   Russian Federation in the Convention on the International order of
   alimony recovering and Other Forms of Family Maintenance in 2007.
   Identified factors contributing to the ratification of the Convention,
   as well as circumstances that create certain difficulties. Among the
   first are: universality of the Convention; compliance of many provisions
   of the Convention with the norms of family, civil procedural legislation
   and legislation on enforcement proceedings of the Russian Federation;
   the existence of a real mechanism that facilitates the effective alimony
   recovering abroad, and thereby satisfies the vital needs of needy family
   members. Among the factors of a ``restraining nature{''}, some
   differences were noted in the provisions of the Convention and Russian
   legislation regarding entities entitled to alimony. In addition,
   Russia's accession to the Convention may require a review of national
   legislation on the provision of free legal aid. However, the system of
   reservations and declarations of amendment or cancellation of the rules
   provided for in the Convention allows to mitigate the constraints. As a
   result, it was concluded that for the Russian Federation, ratification
   of this Convention will have a greater effect and will solve the problem
   of receiving alimony from abroad.},

   left-wing manifesto since 1964, and that Jeremy Corbyn's party produced
   its most left-wing manifesto since 1992 and the election before the
   advent of New Labour. The article also finds that the ideological space

   Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionists published the most right-wing

Abstract = {Efficient security and defence are critical for the preservation of
   values important to the citizens, such as freedom, sovereignty,
   territorial integrity, democratic order, protection of life, health and
   basic rights and freedoms, ability to fulfil the country's obligations
   arising out of international treaties and agreements, as well as the
   capability to resolve critical situations and to face threats of
   violence and aggression. The Armed Forces of the Slovak Republic are
   created for the purpose of preserving peace and security, providing the
   defence of the state and fulfilling the country's obligations arising
   out of international treaties. The present study addresses the issue of
   the Armed Forces of the Slovak Republic deployment in NATO operations
   after the Warsaw Summit. In addition to operations and missions, NATO
   and its allies and partners are involved in many other activities such
   as defence and political reforms, military planning and exercise,
   scientific cooperation and research, information sharing or humanitarian
   aid. The results show that the humanitarian and ethical aspects of
   resolving international disputes and crises are of increasing
   importance. They have a growing influence on political decisions whether
   to use the armed forces and on the limiting needs for their deployment.
   The Armed Forces of the Slovak Republic must develop its cooperation
   with NATO countries in future, participate in the operations/missions
   and support the peace and security on the international scene.},

Title = {Voter Response to Hispanic Sounding Names: Evidence from Down-Ballot
   Statewide Elections},
Journal = {QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {14},
Number = {4},
Pages = {401-437},
Abstract = {The study of how voters respond to ethnic heuristics is complicated by
   the possibility that candidates differ along other dimensions that
   affect voter choice. This paper focuses on down-ballot statewide
   elections in which voters are plausibly ill-informed about candidates
   but can still infer race and ethnicity via the informational content in
   their names. Using nearly two decades of election results from the state
   of Texas, we find evidence of voters switching party support when their
   party's candidate has a distinctively Hispanic name. This result is more
   pronounced in counties that are expected to have higher levels of racial
   animosity. These findings are important since holding lower statewide
   office is a valuable stepping stone for minority politicians who aspire
   to higher office.},

Abstract = {By studying a series of mobilizations initiated by French Mutual Benefit
   societies against the European Union `Insurance' Directives between the
   1990s and the 2010s, we seek to identify the interaction between
   different factors likely to explain the failure of corporate attempts to
   promote their interests at the European level. The lack of strategic
   resources explains the difficulty faced by the actors under study in
   reaching the agenda. But once this gap filled, cognitive factors and
   their incapacity to legitimate the values underlying their demands to
   the European Commission eventually explain the failure of their
   mobilization.},

   specificite des termes retenus, de leur evolution et des visions du
   monde auxquelles ils renvoient. Un premier coup de sonde sur l'immediat
   apres Seconde Guerre mondiale montre ainsi un discours depreciatif sur
   le capitalisme commun a la centrale syndicale chretienne, la CFTC, et a
   la centrale de sensibilite communiste, la CGT. Un deuxieme eclairage
   porte sur les annees 1960 et insiste sur la richesse des analyses
   produites par la CFDT, critique de l'action des firmes multinationales
   mais aussi des pratiques consumeristes. Enfin, une derniere partie met
   en regard les mots choisis par les syndicats de salaries avec ceux

Title = {MIDDLE EASTERN CHRISTIANS IN DIASPORA AND THEIR POLITICAL ACTIVISM
   TOWARDS THEIR COUNTRIES OF ORIGIN},
Journal = {POLITICKE VEDY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {22},
Number = {4},
Pages = {57-80},
Abstract = {A contemporary globalized world brought intensive research of diasporas
   and their connections to their countries of origin to social sciences.
   These two-way connections are economic, cultural and political. This
   text was focused on political activities. Transmigrants can be
   politically active or passive towards their homelands. Transmigrants are
   usually interested in the events in their homelands where their
   relatives still live. They benefit from modern technologies, and several
   authors speak about digital diasporas. These diasporas monitor
   persecution in their homelands. They establish organisations to boost
   their fundraising, inform the public and to lobby the governments,
   primarily in the West, and supranational institutions. The emergence of
   Middle Eastern Christian diaspora is connected with armed conflicts,
   religious or ethnic discrimination in the Middle East in the last two
   centuries. The decline of Christians in the Middle East relates to their
   massive emigration to Western countries. This article attempted to
   gather theoretical information about diaspora activism, bring some
   innovative typologies, present the general attitudes of Middle Eastern
   Christian transmigrants towards their homelands and show specific
   strategies of the Assyrian and Coptic Middle Eastern Christian stateless
   diasporas. The emphasis was put on the comparative method. The author
   identified various tactics and group opinions among Coptic
   transmigrants, represented most visibly by laical modernist and church
   traditionalists, while the Assyrian transmigrants are politically more
   coherent in criticizing governmental structures. However, members of
   both groups think they do their best to improve the living conditions of
   their coreligionists in the turbulent Middle East.},

Abstract = {With the overall intention of stimulating the debate on food democracy,
   this thematic issue aims to shed fresh light on the complex relationship
   between food and democracy in different contexts. New theoretical
   perspectives and empirical analyses are presented that explore, sharpen,
   question, and expand the potential of food democracy as both, an
   analytical lens onto the state and development of contemporary food
   systems, and as a political idea for transforming the dominant
   agri-industrial food system. In this editorial to the thematic issue
   ``New Perspectives on Food Democracy,{''} we briefly recapitulate the
   existing debate on food democracy, explain the goals and overarching
   questions of the thematic issue and provide an overview of the assembled

Abstract = {Although ideological polarization can create problems for governability
   and democratic stability, this article argues that it also has
   beneficial effects in new democracies. By clarifying the political
   alternatives, polarization creates strong links between parties and
   voters, and thereby instills accountability mechanisms that force
   parties to remain responsive to evolving voter preferences. A
   comparative historical analysis of six South American cases demonstrates
   that the vast differences in the quality of representation in the 1980s,
   immediately after many countries in the region returned to democracy,
   were rooted in an early bifurcation of party systems in the first half
   of the twentieth century: while prolonged periods of ideological
   conflict occurred in some countries during this period, polarization was
   aborted by various means in others. By showing that ideological
   moderation may help formal democracies survive, but that aborting
   conflict in the long run severely hampers key aspects of the quality of
   democracy, this study suggests a revision of conventional views
   regarding ideological polarization.},

Abstract = {Existing research suggests that voters tend to respond positively to
   legislator independence due to two types of mechanism. First, dissent
   has an indirect effect, increasing a legislator's media coverage and
   personal recognition among constituents (profile effects). Secondly,
   constituents react positively to dissent when this signals that the
   legislator has matching political or representational preferences
   (conditional evaluation). This article presents a third effect: dissent
   acts as a valence signal of integrity and trustworthiness. Consistent
   with the valence signalling mechanism, it uses new observational and
   experimental evidence to show that British voters have a strong and
   largely unconditional preference for legislators who dissent. The
   findings pose a dilemma for political systems that rely on strong and
   cohesive parties.},

Abstract = {This study analyses the experiences of exiles within international rugby
   union in Britain. The emphasis is on challenging existing sociological
   assumptions surrounding national identity and sports labour migration.
   Eight international rugby exiles were invited to take part in
   semi-structured interviews and several themes emerged. The major
   findings from the study demonstrate that exiles are subject to an array
   of cultural attachments and personal experiences which shape their
   national identities. As migrants, their repositioning in relation to the
   nation is increasingly deemed to be the norm in rugby union. However,
   additional influences were also shown to persist to varying degrees.},

Title = {Investigating Hegemony Struggles: A Transdisciplinary Research Framework
   in Three Steps},
Booktitle = {STRUGGLES FOR HEGEMONY IN ITALY'S CRISIS MANAGEMENT: A CASE STUDY ON THE
   2012 LABOUR MARKET REFORM},
Series = {Contributions to Political Science},
Year = {2019},
Pages = {41-56},
Abstract = {The present chapter acts as a double link: with regard to the approaches
   discussed in Chap. 2, it aims to move towards the concrete
   operationalization of cultural political economy (CPE), its critical
   political economy approach and critical discourse analysis (CDA) in the
   form of an innovative transdisciplinary research framework; in the
   context of the overall project, in turn, it aims to connect this
   research framework with its empirical application in the Italian case.
   Before entering into the details of the framework and of its
   operationalization, however, some introductory remarks about its
   rationale are paramount. At a high level of abstraction, we have seen,
   this book is basically concerned with the renewed salience of questions
   of continuity and change in modern capitalist economies, especially in
   the aftermath of the economic and financial crisis burst out in
   2007/2008. In this context, it is particularly interested in the nexus
   between semiosis and structuration in bringing about socio-political
   changes and in the study of related struggles over hegemony (see Chap.
   1).
   From a CPE standpoint, this basic research interest finds expression in
   a research agenda focused upon `a series of what, who, and how questions
   in the examining of the making of hegemony' (Sum 2009, p. 198, emphasis
   in the original; see also Sum 2012; Sum and Jessop 2013, pp. 196-230).
   However, when moving from a sheer theoretical level to a more strictly
   empirical-analytical one, this research interest is bound to encounter a
   basic problem: how to operationalize the range of theoretical insights
   discussed in Chap. 2? And, in this attempt, how to overcome the
   weaknesses of traditional policy analysis, interpretive policy analysis
   and historical materialist approaches alike? 1 For different reasons, in
   fact, each of these three understandings of policy analysis is
   confronted with some key problems (Brand 2013; Buckel et al. 2014, pp.
   22-26): the rationalist paradigm in policy analysis must face criticism
   concerning its functionalist bias, the lack of a macro-perspective as
   well as its tendency to bracket questions of power and domination;
   interpretive policy analysis, which has emerged as a response to many of
   these critical aspects, is still seen to suffer from a basic deficit in
   state theory, as it becomes evident in its `thin' conception of the
   state; finally, an opposite problem plagues historical materialist
   approaches, in which the dimensions of polity and politics often come to
   obscure the own dynamics of specific policies and these latter, as a
   result, are interpreted as the more or less functionalist
   `{''}outcomes{''} of predominant social relations, especially of class
   relations' (Brand 2013, p. 425).
   Against this background, Sect. 3.1 recalls the argument advanced in
   Caterina (2018), which merges CPE, historical materialist policy
   analysis (HMPA) and CDA of practical argumentation to develop a
   transdisciplinary research framework for empirical investigations of the
   making and challenging of hegemony with a specific interest in questions
   of strategy. The concrete operationalization of this framework is dealt
   with in Sect. 3.2, which illustrates the interconnections among the
   three approaches and provides methodological information about the data
   and sources used. Section 3.3 concludes with a review of the main
   arguments concerning the theoretical-methodological conception and
   operationalization of the whole project.},

Abstract = {Until recently, the study of representation at the subnational level was
   hobbled by the lack of high-quality information about public opinion.
   The advent of new data sources, however, as well as of new methods such
   as multilevel regression and poststratification, has greatly enhanced
   scholars' capacity to describe public opinion in states, legislative
   districts, cities, and other subnational units. These advances in
   measurement have in turn revolutionized the study of subnational
   representation. In this article, we summarize new approaches to the
   measurement of subnational opinion. We then review recent developments
   in the study of the role of subnational public opinion in the political
   process and discuss potentially fruitful avenues for future research.},

Abstract = {This article argues that rather than being an automatic consequence of
   the rising importance of palm oil in Indonesia's economy, the inclusion
   of palm oil in Indonesia's set of national interest priorities in its
   international relations was a result of an intentional campaign run by
   palm oil companies. Taking the subjectivist assumption on national
   interest as the starting point and drawing on the narrative policy
   analysis literature, this study investigates the process of inclusion by
   unpacking the discursive framework that enables such a process to be
   successful. It finds that palm oil companies employed
   ``objectification{''} to frame the growth of the palm oil industry as a
   shared interest of the public and ``delegitimization{''} to frame
   opposing voices as the manifestations of foreign interests. Such
   discursive frameworks provided unambiguous and straightforward foreign
   policy direction, but at the same time prevented a more comprehensive
   understanding of the complex issue of palm oil.},

Volume = {9},

Abstract = {This study creates a nested typology of non-OECD countries to understand
   the nature of the challenges facing them. Due largely to problems of
   insufficient data, previous studies have focused on wealthier nations'
   political, developmental and health indicators. Developing nations are
   classified using cluster analysis based on seven key health and
   development factors: income inequality, under-nutrition, government
   share of total expenditure on health, total expenditure on health as a
   percentage of GDP, DPT3 vaccination coverage, number of physicians per
   1000 people and infant mortality. I find tiers of country clusters
   characterized by above average health and development and below average
   health and development. These tiers then subdivide into seven relatively
   distinct categories. By identifying groupings of countries that share in
   particular arrangements of health and development challenges this
   research may assist policymakers, and health and development scholars to
   identify broad but appropriate strategies for country clusters.},

Abstract = {Civil society actors' reduced ability to take political action and adopt
   critical positions towards public institutions is often ascribed to the
   ``marketisation{''} of the local welfare systems in which non-profit and
   third-sector organizations operate. This reading of the depoliticisation
   of civil society is correct, but it has a number of shortcomings,
   including the assumption that civil society actors are passive agents
   that are overwhelmed by the depoliticisation mechanisms to which they
   are subjected. Instead, this paper explores how civic organizations -
   albeit unintentionally - engender depoliticisation dynamics that shrink
   their critical strength. To do so, it draws on Gramscian arguments
   regarding civil society and politics and uses them to illuminate a case
   study of a local governance strategy (V'Arco Villoresi Green System),
   involving both experts and civic groups. The main finding of the
   research is that civil society sustains what Gramsci called
   ``economism{''}, i.e. a radical rejection of politics, which may be
   enacted by civil society both when non-critically adhering to governance
   arenas and when contesting them. The analysis undertaken contributes to
   our understanding of the depoliticisation of civil society, shedding
   light, on the one hand, on how this process is not solely due to factors
   external to civil society and, on the other hand, on what the author
   calls the implicit dimension of politics.},

Abstract = {Integration within the European social dimension, understood as the EU's
   competence in the field of employment and social policy, has been
   fraught with obstacles. Divisions between the EU's Member States have
   limited integration and resulted in a complex and piecemeal system of
   governance that is low down on the EU's list of priorities. The UK is
   often regarded as a major obstacle limiting the scope of integration in
   the field and this is not without good reason. Historically, the UK has
   formed coalitions to block policy negotiations within the European
   Council and has pushed for minimal neoliberal obligations in the field.
   The UK's departure from the EU could result in a step-change for the
   European social dimension. However, as this article will argue, the UK's
   departure from the EU will do little to alter the current dominance of a
   neoliberal market-led ideology, as it currently transcends the political
   agency of the UK.},

Title = {Defining Women's Representation: Debates around Gender Quotas in India
   and France},
Journal = {POLITICS AND GOVERNANCE},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {7},
Number = {3},
Pages = {124-136},
Abstract = {In 1999, after a heated debate on gender parity in political
   representation, the French constitution was amended to include the
   principle of ``equal representation{''} of both sexes. This paved the
   way for the introduction of gender quotas. In the same period, a bill
   providing reservations for women at the national level provoked a
   political crisis in India. The objective of this article is to compare
   both debates, looking in particular at the way women's representation
   was framed. In France, the main argument against quotas was that
   republican representation should be unitary and transcend social
   differences, but at the end of the 1990s, women in mainstream politics
   were seen as one element of the dual nature of human kind, different
   from other categories such as class or race. In India, the specific
   representation of certain groups (Dalits, lower castes, tribal groups)
   had been the traditional framework for political representation since
   independence in 1947. But when the bill proposed to extend reservations
   to women, opponents of the project claimed that women did not constitute
   a category in themselves, and that sex should be intersected with caste
   and religion for the attribution of quotas. Looking at parliamentary
   debates, articles, and tribunes supporting or opposing quotas in both
   countries, we show that the arguments mobilized reveal different
   conceptions of the political representation of gender difference, which
   are partly transversal and partly specific to each country.},

Abstract = {In this paper, the authors analyse a new institution for the Russian
   legal system, namely, the contract of succession institution. It is a
   qualitatively new way to transfer property, which was legislated as a
   supplement to the existing grounds of succession.
   It is noted that one of the advantages of this type of succession is
   that this type of agreement enables a property owner not only to outline
   the circle of successors during his/her lifetime but also to stipulate
   clear conditions for their entry into rights of succession. That is,
   thanks to this agreement, it becomes possible to determine to whom and
   what kind of property will be transferred after the death of the owner,
   and what conditions must be met for this.
   In this paper, the authors correlate a contract of succession with mixed
   categories: they compare (only by some criteria) a contract of
   succession with a unilateral transaction - a last will and testament.
   The authors conclude that the institution of the contract of succession
   is a symbiosis of succession and contractual legal relations (mixed
   nature), which may lead to certain problems in the future during the
   enforcement of the current legislation.},

Abstract = {Over the last fifteen years municipalities in Russia have lost a
   significant part of their financial autonomy: the average share of
   transfers from regional budgets to municipal budgets has doubled.
   Simultaneously, municipalities have lost their political autonomy from
   the regional authorities. The article is dedicated to finding answers to
   such questions as whether the growth of the financial and political
   dependence of municipalities went hand in hand with the politicization
   of regional intergovernmental transfers and whether election results
   affect the amount of funds received by municipalities from regional
   budgets. The authors used an original dataset on two types of
   intergovernmental transfers, the distribution of which depends on
   regional authorities, for 70 municipalities of the Perm Krai and the
   Novgorod Oblast, 2013-2017.
   The regression analysis conducted by the authors confirmed the
   hypothesis that redistribution of budgetary funds between municipalities
   is decided on political grounds, but this holds true only at the
   beginning of the electoral cycle, which is consistent with the model of
   rewarding a loyal electorate. As is the case at the federal level, this
   is about rewarding those who produce ``good{''} electoral results and
   punishing those who produce ``bad{''} electoral results rather than
   courting swing voters or buying off most problematic territories. The
   fact that the municipality has its own parliamentarian in the regional
   legislature can also contribute to obtaining more transfers. Municipal
   needs for infrastructure have no impact on the size of transfers.},

Journal = {CONTEMPORARY POLITICS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {25},

Pages = {150-171},
Abstract = {There is a recent surge in the use of state-sponsored cyber operations
   by states against foreign political institutions, including efforts to
   sway electoral outcomes by influencing voters. Yet cyber statecraft
   research has focused more on operations designed to yield a direct
   military advantage or reward, rather than as a subtle tool of influence.
   We seek to address this gap in the literature, first by conceptualising
   a typology of state-sponsored operations constituting cyber voter
   interference' (CVI), second by theorising a causal mechanism through
   which CVI can influence the cognition and behaviour of voters contingent
   on specific local conditions within a target state, and third by testing
   the plausibility of our theoretical model via two case studies of recent
   elections in the United States and France, both of which saw credible
   accusations of cyber interference by hostile foreign actors. We find
   that the evidence supports the plausibility of the theorised model, and
   our argument that the success of CVI is mediated by specific conditions
   within the state being targeted.},

Abstract = {One representative currents in contemporary political science is
   historical institutionalism. In this article, are based on the premise
   that currently two epistemological paradigms predominate in political
   science: the paradigm of classical mechanics and the systemic approach.
   It is argued that the historical institutionalism is supported by the
   idea of causality of the paradigm of classical mechanics but has been
   enriched by introducing the systemic approach in the study of political
   processes. It is conclude, that analytical categories such as
   strategies, trajectories and joints, typical of the historical
   institutionalism, are explained as a product of a systemic vision of the
   world of politics.},

Title = {GREENING THE CONCEPT OF STATE CRIME},
Journal = {STATE CRIME},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {8},
Number = {1},
Pages = {39-58},
Abstract = {Green criminologists often deploy the notion of harm to capture patterns
   of environmental victimization sitting outside the narrow and legalistic
   confines of environmental ``crime{''}. In doing so, their analytical
   gaze is cast wide, resulting in a lack of focus on states and their
   specific obligations to protect citizens from such victimization. The
   current article addresses this by using the dialectic conception of
   state crime to direct criminological attention towards these
   obligations. Using its constituent elements of human rights, deviance
   and legitimacy, the article examines the state duty to protect
   environmental human rights, the importance of involving opposition
   groups in research on deviant state activity and the challenges faced by
   scholars attempting to evidence the illegitimacy of such practice. In
   doing so, the literature from state crime and green criminological
   scholarship is synthesized, resulting in a concept of state
   environmental crime that is of utility to both fields.},

Abstract = {This introduction highlights four themes about the politics of suburbia
   which are developed in the collection. First, what constitutes suburbia
   is multiple and constantly changing. This is reflected in diverse and
   evolving architectures and economic conditions. Second, the idea of the
   suburb as synonymous with the pinnacle of betterment is taking a
   battering as suburbs are now looking the worse for wear. `Just about
   managing' families and the `squeezed middle' are to be found in the
   suburbs. Third, in post-2016 Britain, Brexit is the new political
   fault-line where regional variations manifest themselves, and this is
   reflected in distinctive suburban politics, producing strange bedfellows
   spanning Surrey and Sunderland. Fourth, voting patterns reflect the
   dynamism of the modern suburb. The social and physical environment of
   the suburb may shape attitudes to some extent, but incomers have brought
   their politics with them.},

   proposal. For this, Chinese foreign policy documents for Latin America
   and the Caribbean will be analyzed, speeches given by President Xi
   Jinping during his official trips to the region, documents issued during
   the summits of the China-CELAC forum, in addition to documents and
   agreements reached during and after the two forums of the Belt and Road
   Initiative held in China in 2017 and 2019 respectively. Finally, some of
   the projects that are already carried out under the initiative will be

Pages = {371-394},
Abstract = {This paper looks at how Hezbollah has legitimised its use of violence
   against Israel, distinguishing between distinct phases in its
   resistance. The paper compares Hezbollah's discourse and behaviour with
   the ethical principles underpinning the Just War tradition (JWT) and the
   Islamic rulings on war. The paper contends that despite its terrorist
   label and the criticism surrounding its weapons, the group satisfied
   several conditions specified by the JWT and Islam. A big exception is
   the last resort criterion because, in Hezbollah's view, armed resistance
   against Israel is the one and only option. Moreover, despite its
   intention to destroy Israel and its readiness to sacrifice fighters for
   this purpose, Hezbollah has shown restraint in its violence in line with
   the Islamic proportionality principle. Finally, the study points to the
   need for further research on the Islamic just war principles and on
   their role in judging the morality of Islamic non-state armed groups.},

Journal = {POLIS-POLITICHESKIYE ISSLEDOVANIYA},
Year = {2019},
Number = {5},
Pages = {43-55},
Abstract = {The effect of complicating the nature of violence - the transition from
   its traditional, relatively ``simple{''} forms to increasingly complex
   ones - is considered in this article. The author shows the failure of
   the two dominant approaches ``overcoming{''} this, as have been
   historically prevailing, with the help of the following: 1) retaliatory
   violence against primary violence and 2) the ``treatment{''} of violence
   through a formal rationalization of people's vital activity; this
   actually leads not to its denial, but to the imposition of some forms of
   violence over others and to changes of rigid punishments with
   ``softer{''} ones. As a result, more complex manifestations of violence
   are formed - the author defines this effect as the spiral of the
   complication of violence. The factors that determine its dynamics are
   shown, which include: the accelerating change in people's material,
   economic and social conditions as life changes under the influence of
   industrial revolutions; the emergence of globo-local-enclave
   interdependencies, accompanied by the growth of complex violence between
   civilizations, states and non-state entities; anthropogenic violence on
   the planet. The complicated manifestations of violence have ambivalent
   consequences on the nature of interaction of social actors: on the one
   hand, there have been unprecedented challenges in the form of privatized
   violence, ``hybrid illegal-legitimate{''} wars, illegitimate sanctions,
   and ``liquid evil{''}; but on the other hand, bridges are created that
   contribute to the integration of people and cultures. According to the
   author, the consequences of the spiral of the complication of violence
   dictate the need to move to new trends in the development of human
   relations, to search for answers to the emerging challenges in the
   context of humanistic policies. Of particular importance is the
   acceptance of the humanistic turn in modern knowledge. In practical
   terms, this is needed for working out adequate strategies to deal with
   metamorphoses of violence.},

Title = {LIMITS OF LAW IN ENDING IMPUNITY FOR STATE CRIME: TIME TO RE-FRAME THE
   INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL COURT'S MANDATE?},
Journal = {STATE CRIME},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {8},
Number = {2},
Pages = {219-240},
Abstract = {Adopting a definition of state crime as deviance, rather than
   international crime committed by states, this article critically
   evaluates the limits of law and the efficacy of the Rome Statute in
   delivering the International Criminal Court's mandate. It suggests that
   the replication of domestic criminal justice responses- crime defined by
   the state, an emphasis on individual culpability, reliance on deterrence
   and the rule of law - is unsuitable for conceiving and tackling state
   criminality at a supranational level. States may evade the jurisdiction
   of the Court and exploit delays caused by the Courts' formal rules of
   procedure and evidence. They may also depend on the non-cooperation of
   state parties to bring perpetrators to justice and the lack of political
   unity within the United Nations Security Council. With increasing resort
   to domestic courts and national agencies to close the impunity gap, it
   is timely to revisit the Court's mandate, to clarify its function as a
   supranational regulator in respect of a limited range of offences,
   rather than the decisive method of ending impunity for state crime that
   some have claimed and for which others had hoped.},

Abstract = {The US National Defense Strategy - like that of its peer competitors -
   relies on artificial intelligence (AI) for a military edge in potential
   conflict as well as a deterrent to such conflict. This reliance on AI
   raises two challenges: a changing relationship between the Department of
   Defense (DoD) and industry; and widely held safety concerns about the
   military use of AI. Recent tensions in that relationship potentially
   imperil the success of US strategy. In this article, Larry Lewis
   explains that the use of technology in war is not a new problem, and
   presents an action plan for improving mutual understanding and dialogue
   between the DoD and industry. While individual companies should choose
   their own path, this process should lead to a better shared
   understanding of risks and ways to better promote safety for the
   military applications of AI.},

   Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities},
Journal = {NORDIC JOURNAL OF HUMAN RIGHTS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {37},
Number = {3, SI},
Pages = {234-258},
Abstract = {The 2006 Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD)
   epitomises the institutional turn of the international human rights
   regime in two ways. It requests that States Parties conform to specific
   organisational features, and aims at transforming not only state
   behaviour, but also social norms of all actors in society, to anchor a
   human rights approach to disability. At the centre of this exercise lies
   CRPD Article 33 on `National Implementation and Monitoring', which
   foresees that States Parties should establish or appoint focal points,
   coordination mechanisms and independent monitoring bodies. In addition,
   the principle of participation permeates the Convention.
   This article analyses attempts by norm entrepreneurs to design models
   for human rights systems based on the CRPD, and in particular the
   convergence of those models towards institutional arrangements inspired
   by new governance theories. Building upon a study of Article 33
   scholarship, the article discusses the validity of such interpretations.
   It calls to carefully consider the implications of those new
   governance-oriented interpretations, notably how they challenge the role
   of courts and litigation, and potentially recasts the meaning of rights
   and responsibility. The article concludes on the need to better
   integrate different treaty compliance paths.},

Abstract = {This article tries to reveal the sociopolitical and linguistic problems
   of the Western Balkan region. It refers to the territories of four
   countries: Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Montenegro and Serbia. The
   aim is to demonstrate the thread of a yearing and a linguistic struggle
   through the regulations of the language as a standard in the mentioned
   states (institutional nationalistic tendency) and the reaction to its
   implementation into society (civilian tendency of reconciliation). More
   than 150 years ago these states achieved linguistic unification (though
   not uniformly), officially sharing the denomination Serbo-Croatian or
   Croatian-Serbian within the wider political unity in the state(s) of
   Yugoslavia(s) during the 20th century, which then disintegrated into
   four national languages (Bosnian, Croatian, Montenegrin, Serbian). This
   division ``resurrected{''} in a particular way in 2017 as an interstate
   civil project, the Declaration on the common language, and became the
   centre of linguistic-political controversies. We present an historical
   overview of the battlefield of the symbolic versus the communicative
   function of the language. We will refer to the separatist and unitarist
   linguistic game that occurs at those times when the basic human and
   social needs such as participation, understanding and, above all,
   national, cultural and linguistic identity are satisfied.},

Abstract = {The article investigates the way in which Giacomo Leopardi's work and
   the critical interpretations of the forties and fifties inspired by
   Francesco De Sanctis and Antonio Gramsci can shed light on the poetics
   of Italo Calvino and his predilection for speculative fiction. While
   Calvino never penned articles specifically on Leopardi - one of his
   favourite authors - he often had occasion to discuss the celebrated poet
   and author with a number of different specialists. This article sets out
   to identify the interpretations that influenced Calvino and his
   exchanges with writers and critics such as Franco Fortini, Elio
   Vittorini and Cesare Pavese, Giulio Bollati, Sergio Solmi and Carlo
   Salinari, who were engaged in analysing Leopardi's work at the time. The
   ``dialogue{''} among these different authors highlights the Italian
   cultural context of the fifties, how Leopardi's work was received during
   that period and the function ascribed by Calvino to speculative fiction.},

Abstract = {How does the experience of economic shocks affect individuals' political
   views and voting behavior? Inspired partly by the fallout of the
   financial crisis of 2008, research on this question has proliferated.
   Findings from studies covering a broadening range of countries and
   economic contexts highlight several notable patterns. Economic
   shocks-e.g., job loss or sharp drop in income-exert a significant and
   theoretically predictable, if often transient, effect on political
   attitudes. In contrast, the effect on voting behavior is more limited in
   magnitude and its manifestations less understood. Negative economic
   shocks tend to increase support for more expansive social policy and for
   redistribution, strengthening the appeal of the left. But such shocks
   also tend to decrease trust in political institutions, thus potentially
   driving the voters to support radical or populist parties, or
   demobilizing them altogether. Further research is needed to detect the
   conditions that lead to these distinct voting outcomes.},

Abstract = {This article addresses the problem of international law enforcement
   within the War on Cyberterrorism. Hybrid conflicts have replaced the
   traditional ones, and new threats have emerged in cyberspace, which has
   become a virtual battlefield. Cyber threats - cybercrimes,
   cyberterrorism, cyberwarfare - are a major concern for Western
   governments, especially for the United States and the North Atlantic
   Treaty Organization. The international community has begun to consider
   cyberattacks as a form of terrorism, to which the same measures apply.
   Because the term ``terrorism{''} is ambiguous and legaly undefined,
   there is no consensus on a definition of the derivative term
   ``cyberterrorism{''}, which is left to the unilateral interpretations of
   states. Pretending to consider the cyberspace domain as traditional
   domains, and claiming to apply IHL for the sole purpose of lawfully
   using armed forces in contrast to cyberterrorism is a stretch. This
   paper addresses the question of whether or not current laws of war and
   international humanitarian law apply to cyber domain, and gives some
   recommendations on how to tackle this issue.},

Abstract = {After being a neutral actor for decades in the complex South China Sea
   (SCS) territorial disputes, Indonesia has seen itself compelled by
   China's assertiveness to become firmer about protecting its territorial
   sovereignty around the Natuna Islands (NI). Jakarta is alarmed by
   China's claims that it has undeniable historical fishing rights in the
   NI territorial waters because they undermine Indonesia's territorial
   sovereignty. Our analysis loosely adopts the securitization conceptual
   framework proposed by the Copenhagen School to reveal that Jakarta
   swiftly securitized the NI issue between 2014 and 2016. Using a
   combination of quantitative and qualitative methods, this paper unpacks
   how the Indonesian printed mainstream media discussed the NI in recent
   years. By the end of 2016, the Indonesian media portrayed China's claims
   that it has historical fishing rights in the NI territorial waters as
   the most urgent national security threat to Indonesia, i.e. the NI issue
   was securitized. This analysis shows that the Indonesian people accepted
   Jakarta's security discourse, i.e. Jakarta had successfully securitized
   China's claims over the NI territorial waters. This paper makes a new
   contribution to the securitization literature by simultaneously
   analysing the Indonesian news and social media outlets.},

   Chisinau (Moldova), largely failed because of the citizens' low turnout.
   Why do recall referendums fail and, in particular, why was this boycott
   strategy successful? My assumption is that the referendum was perceived
   not only as a tool to eliminate a major political competitor and thus
   weaken the anti-presidential opposition, but also as a wider attempt to
   gain extensive political control. I will use secondary data and data
   obtained from a focus-group research in order to show that the following
   factors determined the outcome of the boycott: the popular mistrust of
   institutions and parties, the perceived decisive importance of the
   Capital's control nationwide, the citizens' will to prevent the
   concentration of power, and the perception of the broader geopolitical
   stakes of the recall.},

Abstract = {Why do parties and candidates decide to go negative? Research usually
   starts from the assumption that this decision is strategic, and within
   this framework two elements stand out: the prospect of electoral failure
   increases the use of negative campaigning, and so does time pressure
   (little reaming time to convince voters before election day). In this
   article, we contribute to this framework by testing two new
   expectations: (i) political actors are more likely to go negative when
   they face unfavourable competitive standings and voting day is near; and
   (ii) they are less likely to go negative when they faced a substantive
   degradation in their competitive standing over the course of the
   campaign. We test these expectations on a rich database of newspaper ads
   about national referenda in Switzerland and provide preliminary
   empirical evidence consistent with those expectations. The results have
   important implications for existing research on the strategic
   underpinnings of campaigning and political communication.},

Abstract = {Even though partisan cues are widely recognized as a primary force
   shaping voter behaviour in a referendum, their effect on a decision
   whether to attend or abstain from voting has not yet been carefully
   studied. Our analysis of the pre-referendum survey data gathered before
   the 2015 citizen-initiated referendum in Slovakia leads to two important
   conclusions: First, parties' recommendations whether to attend or
   abstain from voting influence voters' behaviour in a similar fashion as
   their suggestions for which side to vote for. Moreover, in certain
   institutional settings, the partisan cues related to mobilization have
   an even stronger impact on voters than endorsements for who or what to
   vote for. Second, the provided party recommendations must be unambiguous
   and clear. Lower clarity cues are reflected in voters' behaviour to a
   lesser extent.},

Abstract = {This research examined how partisan media as a campaign ad platform
   affect voters, focusing on partisanship, ad platforms, and ad platform
   credibility. In a 3 (conservative party supporters, liberal party
   supporters, nonpartisans) x 2 (conservative and liberal ad platforms) x
   2 (a high level and a low level of ad platform credibility) factorial
   design, participants saw a campaign ad surrounded by either a
   conservative medium or a liberal medium. The results reveal that
   nonpartisans' perception of platform credibility makes a significant
   difference in the recall of the ad, while partisans' perception of
   platform credibility did not, which suggests that nonpartisans'
   heuristic information processing can translate into systematic
   information processing in political advertising.},

Title = {STRUCTURING POLITICAL SCIENCE AND INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS ARTICLE IN
   VIEW OF SCIENCE INFORMATION QUALITY},
Journal = {POLIS-POLITICHESKIYE ISSLEDOVANIYA},
Year = {2019},
Number = {1},
Pages = {167-181},
Abstract = {The successful promotion of Russia's social science and humanities
   journals indexed with international scientometric databases is based on
   the revised understanding of the quality of scientific publications in
   view of diverse and comprehensive criteria, with highly structured
   information as a frontrunner. Thoroughly formatted publication
   requirements are determined by excessive information flows and
   information overload in modern society and considered as a primary
   information-selection criterion highlighting adequate quality levels.
   The author conducted a study to single out prevailing types of
   publications among highly cited papers published in reputed journals
   specialized in international relations and political science. The
   research also aimed to find out what structuring and formats are typical
   of such journals and publications. Within the research, the author
   selected the top 100 most quoted papers in the field of international
   relations and political science in Scopus database brought out from 2013
   to 2018 as well as another 70 articles published in 22 Scopus-indexed
   journals ranking Q1. The publications empirically proved that the most
   popular types of journal papers in the field cover original articles
   (encompassing both conceptual and research articles), and literature
   reviews. Analyzing 170 papers, the author singled out the typical
   formats for theoretical and empirical articles, defining the components
   that historically tend to lack from Russian scientific articles. Their
   absence often prevents Russian submissions to international established
   journals from being accepted, as they are required for international
   readership to rightly percept information. The recommendations by the
   author may be of use in encouraging Russian journals in the field of
   international relations and other social sciences to get adapted to the
   international standards of scientific publications and successfully
   evolve in pursuit of higher international journal rankings.},

Abstract = {In Campania, unlike Sicily, there has never been a tradition of social
   opposition to the mafia phenomena. The anti-Camorra movement
   (1980-1983), in fact, emerged as an answer to the wave of violence of
   the first Camorra ``war{''} (1978-1983) for the control of drug market
   and of the public funds for reconstruction after the earthquake
   (November 23, 1980). It was first of all the workers' movement (the
   trade unions and the Communist Party) that initiated what would be
   called the ``marching season{''}. But it's the entry of Church and
   students (in connection with the Palermo agitations following the
   murders of La Torre and dalla Chiesa) which confers an original feature
   to the mobilization. The position adopted by the Episcopal Conference in
   Campania contributes to build a unitary movement that is characterized
   by its ethical, even political, value. The student mobilization, on the
   other hand, is a real challenge to the regional ``power system{''}, a
   reaction to the ``strategy of tension{''} atmosphere created by the
   political and criminal violence of the Camorra. Thus, a harmony is
   established between the various components of the movement that
   qualifies itself as civil resistance in defence of constitutional
   freedoms.},

Abstract = {Although the use of expert judgment to make estimates and comparisons is
   criticized, it is becoming ever more widely accepted in the academic
   community for estimating phenomena that have no objective measures. But
   the heterogeneity of the information recovered from experts could
   introduce some bias in the estimates that scholars use to make
   comparisons and to test hypothesis. My proposal is to apply the Aldrich
   \& McKelvey scaling procedure and the Poole \& Palfrey generalization,
   to show the relationship between the ideological expert autopositioning,
   the ``true ideological{''} position of the experts and their level of
   political information. To show this I test three alternative hypothesis
   on ``ideology and information{''} in a sample ofmexican subnational
   experts. Mexican subnational experts have heterogeneous level of
   political information, but in general it is high. However a fraction of
   experts have low levels of political information and correlate with
   moderate positions of the political space. In contrast, extremist
   experts show high levels of political information.},

   exploring the changes in representations (how war is depicted) and
   production processes (the links between the military and videogames

   that representations have moved from a focus on the 9/11 wars to
   depicting conflicts set in the past and/or future, so depoliticising
   popular culture. In terms of production, there have been corresponding
   changes, with a loosening of the historic links between the military and

   discretion as a limit to presidential action. To address this question,
   we examine the use of delegated authority in unilateral orders from 1951
   to 2009 and relate these to the ideological underpinnings of the
   institutions delegating and overseeing the use of this discretion
   (Congress and the Court). Our findings indicate that presidents are
   likely to issue unilateral directives with more substantive discretion
   when ideologically farther away from either the medians in Congress or
   the Supreme Court, but more likely to scale back their use of discretion
   when both branches are jointly ideologically distant from the president.
   The results demonstrate support for both an assertive and restrained
   president when relying upon delegated authority to act unilaterally.},

Abstract = {This work addresses the conflict of the United Neighbors for the Defense
   of a Safe Environment (VUDAS) against the permanence of the Porta Hnos
   company, a producer of bioethanol in Cordoba, Argentina. From the
   content analysis of ten in-depth interviews, it emerges that one of the
   main devices of power that are deployed on this conflict is the
   political system, which works as a complex structure of power that
   controls and limits the struggle. Thus, we have aimed to investigate the
   way in which this structure is articulated and the strategies that are
   opposed to it. Finally, it is concluded that the articulation of the
   power mechanisms that produce the political process device configure
   states of exception that unfold over the subjects in struggle exposing
   them to the exercise of arbitrary power without guarantees and
   encircling their political struggle.},

Abstract = {En s'appuyant sur les resultats d'enquetes recentes conduites dans une

   institutions qui encadrent l'activite economique sont beaucoup plus que
   des regles formelles et des normes informelles. Ces institutions sont
   egalement, et surtout, des conventions sociales qui imposent constamment
   des parametres forts sur comment les enjeux socio-economiques sont
   penses et sur la maniere dont on peut agir sur eux. En effet, c'est
   parce qu'elles faconnent les attentes des acteurs et des populations
   concernees qu'il est heuristique, voire essentiel, d'analyser les <<
   cultures >> capitalistiques, c'est-a-dire les hierarchies de valeurs
   qui, dans tel ou tel espace social, impactent lourdement le changement
   ou la reproduction institutionnelle. Cette these centrale est ensuite
   etayee a travers des exemples empiriques developpes d'une part a
   l'echelle d'une industrie specifique (l'agro-alimentaire) et, d'autre

Journal = {POLITICS AND GOVERNANCE},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {7},
Number = {3},
Pages = {83-92},
Abstract = {This article explores the issues faced by the EU in developing its
   international roles post-Brexit, using a combination of discursive
   analysis and role theory to investigate the development and performance
   of roles in a number of linked arenas. Central to this analysis is the
   assumption that whatever form Brexit takes, the EU and the UK will
   remain closely entangled, and thus that the post-Brexit role assumed by
   the UK will shape the evolution of EU external action. But a key task
   for analysis is to place the impact of Brexit into the array of wider
   forces affecting EU external action, and this is a key aim of the
   article. The article begins by exploring the discourses of globalism
   characteristic of UK and EU foreign policies, as focused by the debates
   about `global Britain' and EU global strategy since 2015. It then
   introduces a simple framework for considering the roles conceived and
   performed by the EU, and their potential impact in the post-Brexit
   world. The article then considers three areas of EU external action, and
   the ways in which they might be shaped by a post-Brexit world: trade and
   development, transatlantic relations and security and defence policy.
   The conclusion discusses the implications of the cases, especially in
   relation to the conversion of discursive role constructs into
   performable roles-a problem central to EU external action-and concludes
   that whilst the impact of Brexit will be significant, it is likely to be
   less fundamental than the impact of the challenges faced by the EU in
   the global arena more broadly.},

Abstract = {The Olympic Games represent an homage paid to the supreme sporting
   event, which should remain a magical contest, full of passion and
   humanism. This competition needs to be protected all over the world, but
   now more than ever because of the usual excesses of violence, rivalry
   and nationalism, more or less explicit, or a series of complex
   situations, for example, Iraq, Afghanistan, countries in conflict in
   Africa, continued warfare due to poverty or excess of oil in Latin
   America and the Middle East, eternal Arab-Israeli conflict, migration,
   health threats etc. Paradoxically, the Olympic Games must be enjoyed and
   regretted for gaining so much importance. On a sports level they become
   increasingly significant despite the existence of world championships
   for each sports discipline, and from the social perspective the Olympic
   Games are the perfect scene for exposing at the highest level the
   demands, the protests, and the fight for protecting the fundamental
   human rights. This article analyzes how human rights were promoted
   within the Olympic Games during the period when at the presidency of the
   International Olympic Committee (IOC) was in charge Juan Antonio
   Samaranch. In 1980, Samaranch became the president of the IOC, a
   position he will hold for twenty-one years and which will allow him to
   manage two major revolutions of sport: women's participation in all
   Olympic competitions and economic expansion. With Samaranch at the helm,
   women had access to all the competitions of the men's program, except
   boxing and wrestling. Not least, professionals gained the right to
   participate officially, with athletes rewarded by sponsors before and
   after the competitions.},

Abstract = {In recent years, there has been a surge in the study of representation
   and elections in local politics. Scholars have made progress on many of
   the empirical barriers that stymied earlier researchers. As a result,
   the study of representation and elections in local politics has moved
   squarely into the center of American politics. The findings of recent
   research show that local politics in the modern, polarized era is much
   more similar to other areas of American politics than previously
   believed. Scholars have shown that partisanship and ideology play
   important roles in local politics. Due to the growing ideological
   divergence between Democrats and Republicans, Democratic elected
   officials increasingly take more liberal positions, and enact more
   liberal policies, than Republican ones. As a result, despite the
   multitude of constraints on local governments, local policies in the
   modern era tend to largely reflect the partisan and ideological
   composition of their electorates.},

Abstract = {The 18th CPC Congress marked a new era for China's domestic and foreign
   policies. Building on traditional Chinese culture and Marxism, China has
   achieved remarkable progress in diplomatic theory building in terms of
   theoretic framework, issue orientation, and methodologies, and now it is
   now time for systematic integration. While preparing for the CPC 19th
   Congress, we should heighten consciousness of practice and theory,
   enhance issue awareness, grasp the essence of the matters, conduct
   analytic researches, and work at effective solutions, and stress
   summarization and crystallization, thus forming new concepts and
   theories. While building China's system of diplomatic theories, it is
   necessary to better align foreign policy with security and domestic
   policies; integrate diplomatic philosophy, theories, strategies, and
   policies; properly handle the relationships between Chinese
   characteristics, international relevance, and worldwide significance;
   and increase the applicability of theories in diplomatic practice.},

Abstract = {This article looks at citizenship from a position of liminality - that
   of Sri Lankan Tamils in India. It is based on fieldwork conducted with
   different groups of Sri Lankan Tamil refugees and repatriates in and
   around Keezhputhupattu camp (Tamil Nadu), in Ceylon Quarter
   (Pondicherry) and in Chennai. No matter what their legal status is, they
   all position themselves on the refugee-citizen spectrum and, by doing
   so, they find themselves standing in-between its two opposed poles. From
   there they build their political subjectivities by negotiating,
   appropriating and sometimes rejecting Indian citizenship and Sri Lankan
   refugeehood. It is through their relationship to this position of
   in-betweenness that, we argue, citizenship, but also refugeehood,
   acquire new meanings.},

Abstract = {This study examines naturalization choices and processes among Filipina
   marriage migrants in South Korea. Drawing on interviews with 89 Filipina
   marriage migrants and nine of their spouses, we show how naturalization
   can become a site of bargaining where female marriage migrants
   strategize to maximize security and optimize their life options within a
   patriarchal host society. Citizenship is, for most marriage migrants,
   informally tied to their fulfillment of gendered expectations as wives,
   mothers and daughters-in-laws. As such, Filipina marriage migrants'
   political incorporation cannot be separated from their gendered
   performance in the family. We also examine how personal resources such
   as education and employment prospects influence migrants' bargaining
   potential. By focusing on the different social positions of and
   resources available to female marriage migrants, we show the complex
   ways in which both gender and human capital influences marriage
   migrants' legal and substantive citizenship.},

Abstract = {This article provides an engagement with American paleoconservatism at
   the level of its intellectual foundations. Although relatively unknown
   in the mainstream media, this anti-establishment strain of radical
   conservatism has provided intellectual ammunition to a wide range of
   agents and ideological forces challenging the prevailing liberal order
   nationally and internationally, positions that have at different times
   resonated with political movements including the Tea Party, the
   Alt-Right and Trumpism. The analysis begins with an exposition of the
   paleoconservative critique of contemporary liberal democracy and global
   liberal governance, in the context of the transformation of the American
   right and the ideological contest with neoconservatism since the early
   1980s. We then move on to examine the neo-nationalist agenda championed
   by paleoconservative intellectuals in response to the perceived
   consequences of multiculturalism, neoliberal globalization and
   internationalist foreign policies, revealing an intellectual project far
   more substantive, complex and encompassing than its frequent reduction
   to `populism' allows. For what is at stake in this politics is not only
   the democratic gains of the twentieth century, but also the political
   terrain upon which our dominant conceptions of the political are being
   re-amalgamated and represented into new struggles over the meaning and
   future of human co-existence under conditions of globalization.},

Abstract = {This article investigates the career paths of Central European Members
   of the European Parliament. Based on an analysis of biographies and the
   results of a quantitative survey about career ambitions with MEPs from
   the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, Slovakia and Slovenia, this paper
   outlines both the career paths that lead to the European Parliament and
   the perspectives for a career after the EP mandate. Central European
   MEPs are more strongly linked to national politics than the MEPs of the
   EU-15, and they are even more embedded in their countries of origin than
   the MEPs of the first directly elected EP were in 1979. However, local
   politics is a much less frequent recruitment base for future MEPs in
   Central Europe than in the ``old{''} Member States. The political
   experience and career ambitions of Central European MEPs disprove the
   popular myth, according to which the European Parliament is essentially
   a retirement home for politicians who have no future political goals.
   The majority of Central European MEPs plan further career steps at the
   European or national levels, and only approximately a third of them can
   be considered as ``European pensioners{''}.},

Abstract = {The importation of foreign models is part of Brazil's institution
   building story, owing to its Portuguese colonisation and the influence
   of European countries and the United States. After the transition to
   democracy and the Constitution of 1988, the scenario began to change.
   The country developed social policy innovations that rose to a national
   scale when the Workers' Party took office. These innovations started to
   spread globally, and international organisations began to recommend
   Brazilian social policies. Examples of Brazilian policies that have been
   transferred are the Family Allowance and the National School Feeding
   Programs. How has Brazil moved from importing foreign institutions to
   becoming a Southern country reference in terms of social policies? The
   main argument here is that Brazil, while building itself into a rising
   power, has developed new patterns of policy transfers that have so far
   been overlooked by the field literature. Through a process-tracing
   analysis of Brazil's social policy diffusion, we have been able to
   identify different forces that facilitate these transfers, such as a
   quest for international legitimacy, the role of ``policy
   ambassadors,{''} the joint efforts of various national institutions,
   Brazilians occupying positions in international organisations, and the
   creation of institutions designed for these policy transfers.},

   idea, deeply rooted in national historiography, that in the market of

Abstract = {January 2019 marked the halfway point of the Trump administration, a
   presidency that has been embroiled with disruption and a break from
   traditional US trade policy. Under Trump's leadership, the United States
   has pulled out of the Transpacific Partnership (TPP), threatened to
   leave the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), started a trade
   war with China, and imposed tariffs on traditional allies on the grounds
   of national security considerations. 2019 will be a pivotal year for
   global trade in which uncertainty surrounding a few key trade
   developments in the first half will determine the extent to which the
   global trading system will be interrupted for the remainder of the year
   and the years to come.},

Title = {Environmentalism undercover: The environmental dimension of public
   support for domestic water charges},
Journal = {ELECTORAL STUDIES},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {62},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Research shows that environmental attitudes can affect support for
   environmentally-beneficial policies. However, it is unclear whether
   environmental attitudes can influence support for such policies when
   they are not being primarily framed through an environmental lens. Using
   data from the 2011 Irish National Election Study, this paper examines
   the issue using the case of support for the reintroduction of water
   charges. This was a contentious issue with debate largely focusing on
   the proposal as an austerity measure, but the proposal also had
   environmental implications. The results find that while individuals'
   willingness to prioritise environmental protection over economic growth
   did not affect their support for water charges, their willingness to
   make individual sacrifices for the environment did. Moreover, voters'
   position on this policy impacted their vote choice. The findings are
   particularly important given the struggles that governments are facing
   in implementing environmental taxes and charges.},

Abstract = {A president's most precious commodity is time, and nowhere is this
   scarcity more apparent than with respect to international travel.
   Personal presidential involvement in diplomatic relations has proven to
   yield significant benefits, and yet traveling to engage in face-to-face
   diplomacy is often prohibitively expensive for American executives in
   time and attention. Given such restrictions, when and where do
   presidents choose to travel? We use a data set of more than 750
   presidential trips spanning more than one hundred countries and a
   century of history to investigate the domestic and international factors
   influencing when, where, and for what reason presidents are likely to
   travel abroad. We provide a detailed examination of presidential travel
   over time and find that domestic political contexts influence
   presidential propensities to travel consistent with expectations based
   on allocating time and attention as limited resources.},

Title = {Compared to what? Media-guided reference points and relative economic
   voting},
Journal = {ELECTORAL STUDIES},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {62},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The idea of the relative economy, or benchmarking economic voting, has
   been around for a long time. However, the choice of international
   benchmark(s) remains underspecified, especially in cross-national and
   time-series studies. This paper argues that the selection process of
   benchmark(s) should be guided by the theory suggesting that voters
   benchmark countries that are similar, familiar, and connected, and that
   media guide voters to appreciate these reference points. Using domestic
   media coverage from Lexis-Nexis spanning 22 languages, 29 democracies,
   and over 30 years, this research identifies the unique reference points
   across time and space. Analysis of this novel dataset shows that voters
   react strongly to relative economic performance when they make vote
   choices. Moreover, the benchmarking effects become more pronounced with
   highly educated populations, but are not affected by clarity of
   responsibility.},

   of entry and permanence in the workplace, or their salary remuneration,
   has been a constant in the last two models of economic development, the
   so-called stabilizing development and neoliberalism. Its precarious
   conditions will be sharpened with the neoliberal model since the
   principles of competition, efficiency and dismissal will be imposed. The
   new government, that of the fourth transformation, annulled the
   educational reform of the previous neoliberal government and, with new
   educational laws, intends, in all orders, to end teacher precariousness.},

Journal = {POLITICAL BEHAVIOR},

Abstract = {Gender and politics research argues that men are more hawkish and
   supportive of militarized confrontations with foreign foes, while women
   ostensibly prefer more diplomatic approaches. This suggests that, after
   a militarized confrontation with a foreign power, women's likelihood of
   voting for the incumbent will both decrease and be lower than that of
   men. Our individual-level, cross-national examinations cover 87
   elections in 40 countries, 1996-2011, and show only some support for
   such notions. Women punish incumbents when their country is targeted in
   a low-hostility militarized interstate dispute (MID) or when their
   country is the initiator of a high-hostility MID. The low-hostility MID
   initiation and high-hostility MID targeting scenarios, meanwhile, prompt
   women to be more likely to vote for the incumbent. Importantly, men's
   reactions rarely differ from women's, casting doubt on the existence of
   a gender gap in electoral responses to international conflict.},

Abstract = {Bill Moyer observed that there are eight stages in a social movement:
   seeming normal, exposing injustice, ripening conditions, taking off,
   losing heart, winning the majority, reaping success and consolidating
   achievement. For more than 30 years, Hong Kong people have been striving
   for democracy. Applying Moyer's model, Hong Kong should be now at a
   stage close to reaching its ultimate goal of establishing a genuine
   democratic system in the territory after years of work, especially the
   triggering event in September 2014 and the occupation during the
   Umbrella Movement. However, Moyer's model cannot be mechanically applied
   to the case of Hong Kong in light of the unique situation faced by Hong
   Kong people. Hong Kong's authoritarian sovereign holds the final key to
   Hong Kong's door to democracy. Unless there is a significant shift in
   the balance of powers in the Chinese polity, Hong Kong's democracy may
   be so near and yet so far.},

Abstract = {It is both academically and practically valuable to construct a
   multi-dimensional scale to assess the effectiveness of the Communist
   Party of China's (CPC) policy toward Taiwan. The author constructed a
   One China identity scale based on national identity theory and the CPC's
   political advocacy and actions toward Taiwan. Using panel data from 271
   members of Taiwanese student delegations to Mainland China from 2016 to
   2017, this study explored the changes in their sense of a One China
   identity. The results showed a significant increase (0.11, 5.19\%) in
   the average ratings of the investigated students' One China identity.
   The regression equation constructed by the current study was able to
   explain 10.94\% of the total variance of the One China identity scale,
   and all three hypotheses were supported. Following the exchange program,
   Taiwanese students appeared to have a greater sense of a One China
   identity. Their impression of Mainland China had improved, their
   acceptance of the CPC's regime had increased, and their preference for
   authoritarianism had increased.},

Pages = {459-479},
Month = {JUN 7},
Abstract = {This paper reassesses theorizations of the basis of social unity in a
   polity, arguing that what I call the joint activity approach provides a
   more dynamic understanding of social unity as well as a more inclusive
   sense of solidarity. The paper begins by reconsidering the major
   alternatives in the history of political philosophy, as different views
   take different ties, bonds and relations as most fundamental to
   citizens' sense of unity and togetherness in society. In view of this
   plurality, the paper first sets up a distinction between conceptions of
   social unity that are based on the existence of shared or common grounds
   such as national identity (Kymlicka, Tamir, Miller), identification with
   the institutions of a polity (Mason), patriotic identification with the
   constitution (Habermas) or an agreement on the principles of justice
   (Rawls) as the source of citizens' sense of unity; and conceptions of
   social unity that rely on the joint and ongoing activities of citizens
   ?productive (Durkheim and Marx) and political (Aristotle)?as their
   basis. Second, the paper evaluates the implications of these different
   theoretical conceptualizations of social unity for the issue of social
   inclusion, integration and solidarity. It argues that the former
   conceptions are similarly limited in their capacity for inclusive
   solidarity since all of them focus on what citizens already share in
   common without paying sufficient attention to the production of what
   they take to be shared in society. The paper contributes to the growing
   literature on solidarity by bringing the widely neglected joint activity
   view back to the debate.},

Abstract = {The term `toxic masculinity' (TM) was coined in the 1990s by
   sociologists and psychologists. It has since been appropriated by
   scholars and commentators interested in gendered behaviours, policies
   and outcomes in politics. However, despite the attention belatedly being
   paid to masculinities as part of that research, the analysis of,
   specifically, TM's part in shaping political practices remains
   underdeveloped. This article proposes a move in this direction by
   designing a conceptual framework for exploring TM inside political
   parties. We adapt findings from the original TM literature to generate a
   series of indicators of TM spanning the vital realms of party political
   activity: its policy positions, accompanying discourse and the formal
   and informal practices - often behind the scenes - that express the
   party's values broader ethos and outlook. We then test the framework
   using a paired comparison of two parties of the populist right where we
   might expect to see relatively high levels of TM: the Alternative for
   Germany and the UK Independence Party. Our empirical findings give us
   confidence that drawing on the concept of TM can provide us with novel
   insights into the interplay between masculinity and political party
   cultures. We also hope that it will inspire a significant body of new
   research into TM in political parties from across the party spectrum as
   well as globally.},

Year = {2019},

Month = {2019 NOV 24},
Abstract = {Money markets, finance, credit instruments, and other markers of what
   Lenin called ``the highest stage of capitalism{''} are the mechanism
   through which global inequalities are maintained, expanded, and
   determined. Accounting practices like double-entry bookkeeping and cost
   accounting have long determined what is thinkable within this realm.
   Scholars and political actors have also employed the term
   ``authoritarian neoliberalism{''} to signal the particular ideological
   constellation and subsequent subjectivities that are salient in the
   present moment. This paper posits a theoretical framework for
   delineating accounting as a political tactic for changing the mode of
   production of knowledge and supporting revolutionary accounting
   subjects. Consulting the literature on critical accounting theory, this
   paper engages ideas such as ``citizen public debt audits{''} and
   ``emancipatory accounting{''} in order to investigate the dynamics of
   tactical resistance that have emerged around issues of finance and
   accounting within a radical democratic and Marxist tradition of
   theorizing political strategy.},

Abstract = {Despite the conventional wisdom that legislators are reluctant to
   support funding restrictions impacting troops in harm's way, the degree
   of congressional deference varies across legislators. This article
   argues that the level of constituent support of the president affects
   this variation. Because the deployment of troops is a salient event that
   highlights the connection between the president and the war, voters'
   view of the president becomes an effective indicator of voters'
   preference regarding the war. Thus, legislators whose constituents
   support (oppose) the president are more (less) likely to support the
   president's war policy. However, in the absence of major wars,
   constituent support of the president has no such effect. A series of
   analyses of House votes demonstrates how major wars condition the
   significance of voters' view of the president.},

Abstract = {More research than ever before uses public opinion data to investigate
   society and politics in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA). Ethnic
   identities are widely theorized to mediate many of the political
   attitudes and behaviors that MENA surveys commonly seek to measure, but,
   to date, no research has systematically investigated how the observable
   ethnic category(s) of the interviewer may influence participation and
   answers given in Middle East surveys. Here we measure the impact of one
   highly salient and outwardly observable ascriptive attribute of
   interviewers-nationality-using data from an original survey experiment
   conducted in the Arab Gulf state of Qatar. Applying the total survey
   error (TSE) framework and utilizing an innovative nonparametric matching
   technique, we estimate treatment effects on both nonresponse error and
   measurement error. We find that Qatari nationals are more likely to
   begin and finish a survey, and respond to questions, when interviewed by
   a fellow national. Qataris also edit their answers to sensitive
   questions relating to the unequal status of citizens and noncitizens,
   reporting views that are more exclusionary and less positive toward
   out-group members, when the interviewer is a conational. The findings
   have direct implications for consumers and producers of a growing number
   of surveys conducted inside and outside the Arab world, where migration
   and conflict have made respondent-interviewer mismatches along national
   and other ethnic dimensions more salient and more common.},

Title = {The evolution of strategic studies in the Spanish academic community:
   Analysis of its research agenda (1978-2018)},
Journal = {REVISTA ESPANOLA DE CIENCIA POLITICA-RECP},

Abstract = {The strategic studies have emerged at Spanish universities in recent
   decades, as a subfield of specialised knowledge with contributions from
   multiple disciplines, particularly from the political science. The aim
   of this research note is twofold: on the one hand, to examine its
   research agenda in order to fill a gap in the Spanish scientific
   literature, mapping its evolution between 1978 and 2018; on the other
   hand, to contribute to the broad international academic debate about its
   development. Thus, it presents the events that have aroused the interest
   of the academic community and analyzes the addressed areas and strategic
   issues. To this end, a content analysis has been conducted of more than
   700 articles published in nineteen scientific journals printed in Spain.
   First of all, the results show the effective growth of the academic
   production, especially in the last twenty years. Second of all, it is
   noticed that the Spanish research agenda has been mainly influenced by
   the competition between great powers and their impact on the
   international order, the emergence of international terrorism, as well
   as the Spanish ``military problem{''} and Spain's participation in
   international organisations. The conclusions point to the focus of
   research on the political level, the state sphere and with an
   international security perspective, to the detriment of a deeper
   strategic reflection on the political effects of the use of armed force
   and defence and military policies.},

Abstract = {This article discusses the recent literature on policy diffusion and
   puts forward a new articulation of its political dimensions. Policy
   diffusion means that policies in one unit (country, state, city, etc.)
   are influenced by the policies of other units. The diffusion literature
   conceptualises these interdependencies with four mechanisms: learning,
   competition, coercion and emulation. The article identifies a model of
   diffusion that is dominant in the diffusion literature. According to
   this model, policies spread because decision makers evaluate the policy
   implications of the actions of other units. It is argued that the role
   of politics remains in the background in this model, and the article
   shows how going beyond a narrow focus on policy adoptions helps us to
   consider the politics of policy diffusion more explicitly.},

Abstract = {To date, most research finds education to have a positive effect on
   trust. Education increases people's social intelligence, making them
   better able to distinguish between trustworthy and opportunistic types.
   Alternatively, education allows people to attain privileged social
   status, making them more resistant to deceit and exploitation by
   opportunistic types. In this article we show that this is not always the
   case. The relationship between education and trust is mediated by state
   efficacy; where the state is relatively efficacious, trustworthy types
   largely survive, while the opposite is true with relatively weak states.
   In weak states, highly educated people should be the least trustful. We
   empirically demonstrate this theoretical insight with survey data from
   three continents, Europe and Africa at the extremes and Latin America in
   the middle. We provide some indirect evidence in favor of social
   intelligence as the key mechanism linking education and trust.},

Abstract = {Do ethnic riots affect prosocial behavior? Acommon view among scholars
   of ethnic violence is that riots increase cooperation within the warring
   groups, while cooperation across groups is reduced. We revisit this
   hypothesis by studying the aftermath of the 2010 Osh riot in Kyrgyzstan,
   which saw Kyrgyz from outside the city kill over 400 Uzbeks. We
   implement a representative survey, which includes unobtrusive
   experimental measures of prosocial behavior. Our causal identification
   strategy exploits variation in the distance of neighborhoods to armored
   military vehicles, which were instrumental in orchestrating the riot. We
   find that victimized neighborhoods show substantially lower levels of
   prosocial behavior. Importantly, we demonstrate that the reduction is
   similarly stark both within and across groups. Using qualitative
   interviews, we parse out two mechanisms that help explain the surprising
   reduction in ingroup prosociality: Victimized Uzbeks felt abandoned by
   their coethnics, and variation in victimization created a feeling of
   suspicion.},

Abstract = {In conflict-prone societies, the fear of expropriation that accompanies
   a regime change reduces capital investment. These reductions in
   investments, in turn, harm the economy, amplifying the likelihood of
   regime change. This article studies the implications of these feedback
   channels on the interactions between globalization, capital control,
   state repression, and regime change. I show that processes that
   facilitate capital movements (e.g., globalization, economic
   modernization, and technologies that reduce transportation costs)
   amplify the likelihood of regime change in conflict-prone societies and
   strengthen the elite's demand for a strong coercive state. In
   particular, to limit their collective action problem and manage the
   political risk of regime change, capitalists support a state that
   imposes capital control. We identify two conflicting forces, the Boix
   Effect and the Marx Effect, which determine when capital control and
   state repression becomecomplements (NaziGermany) or substitutes
   (LatinAmerican military regimes) in right-wing regimes.},

Abstract = {We investigate retrospective voting in the Central-Eastern European
   countries since the democratic transition. We find that the phenomenon
   of `hyper-accountability' identified by earlier scholarship is still
   prevalent in the region - incumbents lose substantially on average.
   Economic conditions - unemployment and wealth - exert influence on the
   chances of incumbent re-election. However, contrary to expectations
   expressed in earlier scholarship, the influence of the economy on the
   election results does not strengthen over time. We also explore
   additional facets of retrospective voting and find that changes in
   socio-economic inequality are correlated with the vote share of
   incumbents. Finally, we also find evidence of an interaction between
   economic conditions and corruption as well as inequality when it comes
   to explaining incumbents' electoral results.},

Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {In today's data-driven campaigns, presidential targeting strategies rely
   on detailed perceptions about the political leanings and policy
   positions of Americans to decide which registered voters to contact and
   which messages to emphasize in their outreach. However, identifying
   supporters and opponents of a candidate's policy positions is far from
   foolproof. This reality results in some citizens encountering political
   message(s) on congruent issues, where their issue stance aligns with the
   messaging candidate, and others encountering incongruent issue
   message(s), where the candidate and message recipient do not share the
   same position. Examining official contact records from the 2012
   presidential campaign of Republican Mitt Romney, I find evidence that
   Romney's campaign had some success when targeting Democrats with
   congruent issues. Messaging Democrats with an issue where they and
   Romney share common ground is associated with decreased support for
   Obama, increased abstention, and increased support for Romney.
   Contacting Democrats with an incongruent message and contacting
   Republicans with either an incongruent or congruent issue message had
   minimal effects on the voting behavior of the recipient.},

Abstract = {This paper uses exit surveys of voters in four House primaries to ask
   how well voters are able to use primaries for the purpose of giving
   policy direction to their congressional parties. The surveys found that
   nearly half of voters could not recall the names of any candidate and
   that 11\% were uncertain or could not recall for whom they had just
   voted. The surveys also found that nearly 40\% of voters could not offer
   a political evaluation - that is, a like or dislike having political
   content - about any candidate, and that fewer than a quarter could offer
   political evaluations of as many as two candidates. The surveys found no
   evidence of policy-motivated voting in three of the four primaries, but
   substantial evidence of it in one. Yet even in that one race, voters
   split their support among three candidates sharing majority voter
   opinion on the key election issue and thereby opened the way for
   nomination of a candidate not sharing majority opinion. The paper
   concludes from this evidence that voters in these House primaries, and
   probably more widely, made little use of them for the purpose of giving
   policy direction to their parties.},

Abstract = {The PCWP agenda has contributed a great deal to the discipline of world
   politics, empirically, methodologically and theoretically. However,
   there is scope to expand upon certain aspects of this body of
   scholarship. In particular, the agenda is developing some unfortunate
   hierarchies in its focus on high-budget ?blockbusters? at the expense of
   data from the everyday. It is displaying a lack of imagination in terms
   of its methodologies and forms of output, despite the aesthetic and
   creative nature of many of the artefacts. Finally, it is evincing a
   reluctance to explore representations beyond the textual or the visual,
   at the expense of other forms of representation, including sound, taste
   or, as I argue in this paper, artefactuality.},

Abstract = {Radical populists in the Andes have combined a populist program and a
   multicultural agenda. However, while populism centralizes power in the
   hands of the leader and emphasizes the unity of the people,
   multiculturalism grants cultural rights that strengthen societal
   autonomy, generating an inherent tension between these two modes of
   incorporation. How are populist governments able to combine unity and
   fragmentation as well as centralization and autonomy? This article
   develops the concept of populist multiculturalism, focusing on the
   Movimiento al Socialismo (MAS) in Bolivia, which has supported autonomy
   rights while simultaneously curtailing their implementation.
   Specifically, it examines the implementation of indigenous autonomous
   governments and prior consultation and the relationship between
   indigenous organizations and the ruling party. The article also extends
   this concept to Ecuador and Venezuela.},

Abstract = {Do voters polarize ideologically when radical views gain political
   legitimacy, or does the rise of radical voices merely reflect societal
   conflict? We argue that elite polarization as signaled by radical
   parties' first entrance into parliament leads to voter divergence.
   Immediately after the election, legitimization and backlash effects mean
   that voters on both ideological sides move toward the extremes. In the
   longer term, this polarization is solidified because of radical parties'
   parliamentary presence. A panel study of Dutch voters shows that the
   2002 parliamentary entrance of a radical-right party indeed led to
   immediate ideological polarization across the political spectrum.
   Estimating time-series cross-sectional models on Eurobarometer data from
   17 countries (1973-2016) shows an additional long-term impact of
   radical-right party entry on polarization. The presence of radical
   voices on the right has polarizing effects, illustrating how such
   institutional recognition and legitimization can have a far-reaching
   impact on society.},

Abstract = {How does a party's organizational structure affect its chances of
   becoming a national party? While existing explanations of party
   nationalization focus on country-level institutional and societal
   variables, we argue that aspects of party organization such as the
   degree of centralization of authority, ideological unity and leadership
   factionalism also matter. By bringing the analysis to the party level,
   this article provides a multilevel analysis of institutional and party
   organization variables and disentangles the effect of each set of
   influences. We use original data on party organization and party
   nationalization for 142 parties across twenty European countries. This
   research contributes to the literature on nationalization and party
   development by advancing organizational strategies which parties could
   adopt in different social and institutional environments.},

Abstract = {Our focus is a puzzle: that ideological identification as ``liberal{''}
   is in serious decline in the United States, but at the same time support
   for liberal policies and for the political party of liberalism is not.
   We aim to understand this divorce in ``liberal{''} in name and
   ``liberal{''} in policy by investigating how particular symbols rise and
   fall as associations with the ideological labels ``liberal{''} and
   ``conservative.{''} We produce three kinds of evidence to shed light on
   this macro-level puzzle. First, we explore the words associated with
   ``liberal{''} and ``conservative{''} over time. Then we take up a group
   conception by examining the changing correlations between affect toward
   ``liberals{''} and affect toward other groups. Finally, we consider the
   changing policy correlates of identification.},

Abstract = {Political selection is important to authoritarian regime survival.
   Although selection outcomes are often observed, it is difficult to
   decipher elites' logic of decision-making due to their multidimensional
   preference and the opaque process. Employing a conjoint experiment
   conducted among over 300 government officials in China, this paper
   unpacks multidimensional elite preference in entry-level political
   selection. It finds that while elites comply with institutional norms by
   selecting candidates based on competence and loyalty, they also take
   into account personal preference by favoring those with political
   connections. Kinship ties to government increase a candidate's chance by
   over 20 percentage points, even though the candidate is not deemed more
   competent or loyal. These findings demonstrate that authoritarian elites
   do not always follow the logic of regime survival; there exists an
   agency problem in political selection that could undermine the
   effectiveness of the ruling class over time.},

Abstract = {This article investigates the Philippines' puzzling reversal of its
   position against China following its victory in the Permanent Court of
   Arbitration (PCA) on maritime claims in the South China Sea. Instead of
   asserting its de jure sovereign rights, which were reaffirmed by the
   PCA's decision, Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte instead opted to
   build stronger relations with China. Proposing a burden sharing
   analytical approach, the article argues that the Philippines is using
   China as leverage in its alliance with the United States. By exploiting
   the ``China Card{''} and downplaying the arbitration case, the
   Philippines has extracted concessions from Beijing and Washington. In
   capitalizing on the Sino-American rivalry, Manila has reaffirmed its
   strategic value within the U.S.-Philippines alliance while benefitting
   more visibly from Chinese foreign aid and investment pledges. However,
   the Philippines' policy posture vis-a-vis China reflects short-term
   diplomatic and economic tactics rather than an enduring strategic
   reorientation away from the United States.},

Abstract = {Despite the academic and military interest in the use of combined
   cyber-kinetic effects in future warfare, there is little that seeks to
   scientifically analyse the impact of combined cyber and kinetic military
   action. Current approaches to simulation focus on either the physical or
   cyber, but there are no current simulation approaches that combine these
   two domains. Military simulations in particular favor physical domains
   over cyber ones, relegating the uniqueness and nuances of cyber a second
   order consideration. Future warfare will incorporate a combined
   multi-domain conflict, and this includes cyber. To effectively simulate
   this, the uniqueness of each domain must be considered, including the
   interaction between domains to produce combined effects. This work
   introduces the Battlespace Integrated Cyber-Kinetic Effects (BICKE)
   simulation framework. The BICKE framework is designed specifically to
   combine the cyber and physical domains for the purposes of simulating
   mission impact. There is a requirement for researchers to measure the
   synergistic effects across domains.},

Abstract = {The human condition is an ineluctably temporal condition, and yet
   political theory has rarely and indirectly grappled with concepts,
   practices, and problems regarding time. Two notable recent exceptions
   are books by Julie L. Rose and Nichole Marie Shippen, both of which
   argue that free or discretionary time ought to be included in political
   considerations of justice. While their respective projects are valuable
   in themselves, their limitations also provide valuable illustrations of
   several fundamental problems that any political treatment of time must
   eventually consider. Drawing upon work on time from elsewhere in the
   social sciences and humanities, this essay critically examines three
   aspects of Rose's and Shippen's projects: 1) their unquestioning embrace
   of clock-time; 2) their neglect of phenomena of social acceleration; and
   3) their attempts to secure greater individual autonomy through temporal
   practices that are essentially disciplinary in nature. While the ``fight
   for (free) time{''} is indeed worth waging, doing so successfully
   requires a deliberate pluralism that acknowledges concepts and practices
   of time beyond the hegemony of the clock and calendar.},

Abstract = {In many developing countries the rural poor often depend on patrons to
   act as brokers in order to get public provision from the government. The
   broker facilitates provision in return for securing peasants' votes for
   politicians. Yet, low bargaining power of peasants allows patrons to
   appropriate public resources for themselves. I propose increasing
   peasants' bargaining power by connecting them to markets outside their
   village. Making use of a natural experiment found in the construction of
   a motorway in Pakistan, I find public provision to be significantly
   higher in connected villages when compared to those which are isolated.
   Moreover, I find that the beneficial impact of connectivity is felt most
   strongly by the lower classes, who are most vulnerable to exploitation
   when isolated.},

Abstract = {At least since Emma Lazarus's famous sonnet became associated with the
   Statue of Liberty, Americans have confounded important differences
   between immigrants and refugees. Cold War politics contributed further
   to that misapprehension. In recent years the continuing crisis at our
   southern border has rendered this confusion more evident and
   problematic. At the same time, a global refugee crisis of genuinely
   historic proportions has been unfolding. More than ever, it is critical
   to delineate carefully between the needs of refugees and the preferences
   of immigrants. Yet now there are strong counter-pressures at work,
   blurring critical distinctions between these two categories. These are
   particularly evident in the international political arena, where the
   United Nations Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) is highly susceptible
   to pressure from the media, academics, and activists to once again
   confound the two.},

Abstract = {The 2019 local elections were run in conjunction with European
   Parliament elections, a constitutional referendum to ease restrictions
   on divorce, and local plebiscites in Cork city, Limerick and Waterford
   on the introduction of directly elected mayors. Turnout was 50.2\%, the
   joint lowest in the history of the State. The elections were contested
   on a mixture of local and national issues and saw Fianna Fail and Fine
   Gael consolidate their positions as the two dominant parties in Irish
   local government, winning a combined total of 534 seats out of 949. The
   Green Party enjoyed a rise in local authority council membership from 12
   to 49 seats while Sinn Fein suffered a 78-seat loss. `New Irish'
   candidates and women fared quite well by past standards. Campaigning for
   the mayoral plebiscites was lacklustre and, amidst much confusion and a
   lack of information, the proposal was narrowly defeated in Cork city and
   Waterford. It passed in Limerick, where the expectation is that a
   mayoral election will take place in 2021.},

Volume = {64},

Abstract = {Conventional models of bargaining and reassurance under incomplete
   information assume that actors' behavioral signals are objectively
   cooperative or noncooperative. Even if actors are uncertain of each
   other's preferences, they know what types of actions the other will view
   as cooperative. Yet on many real-world issues, cooperation is
   subjective, and what constitutes a cooperative action is conditional on
   the receiver's preferences. We present a formal model showing that in
   these cases, two-sided incomplete information actually incentivizes
   honest behavior and facilitates credible signaling. Because uncertain
   senders do not know whether a particular action will be interpreted as
   cooperative, they have little incentive to misrepresent, and instead
   honestly pursue their true goals. Thus, where cooperation is subjective,
   mutual uncertainty is ``offsetting,{''} such that credible signals allow
   actors to quickly and accurately update their beliefs. We illustrate
   this logic through a case study of the Sino-Soviet split, and highlight
   the model's implications for contemporary U.S.-China relations.},

Abstract = {In Kazakhstan, the exchange of favors for money is an embedded practice
   in schools and universities. Grades, examination scores, admissions to
   educational institutions, and theses are frequently traded for cash.
   Based on in-depth interviews during fieldwork, this article describes
   the monetization of informal exchanges after market reforms, and
   examines how the use of personal contacts, kinship connections in
   particular, has changed from the socialist period. This article also
   demonstrates how the exchange of informal payments at educational
   institutions is related to vertical corruption in the education sector
   by highlighting the stream of illicit financial resources within the
   bureaucratic hierarchy.},

Abstract = {Scholars have only begun to examine the roles played by non-career SES
   and Schedule C personnel in managing the bureaucracy. This, despite the
   fact that these individuals help to establish, communicate, and
   implement policy, and despite the broad discretion presidential
   administrations have in appointing them, defining their duties, and
   allocating their positions across the federal government. As an effort
   to redress this neglect, we first provide an overview of what
   lower-level political personnel do and of the processes and constraints
   that determine how they are distributed. We then examine how changes in
   presidential administration have affected the allocation of political
   SES and Schedule C positions across departments. Although dramatic
   infusions of these personnel into some agencies can be tied to policy
   objectives, they appear to be idiosyncratic and driven more by the
   preferences of agency leaders than by the White House. As such, they
   provide little support for positive theories that frame the
   administrative presidency in terms of centralized strategic planning.},

   Role in Maintaining Economic Contractual Equilibrium at the

Abstract = {The jurisprudential and judicial legal trend tends to apply the
   principle of good faith at the pre-contracting phase as one of the most
   substantial principles governing this phase, since it is inconceivable
   that the parties are to negotiate in bad faith, and then must implement
   the contract in good faith, in accordance with the traditional legal
   rule that ``fraud spoils everything it touches{''}. However, the
   Palestinian legislature has ignored enacting legal provisions obliging
   the parties to abide by the principle of good faith in the
   pre-contracting phase causing a legislative deficiency in the
   legislative remedies of the subject of good faith in the pre-contracting
   phase. This paper seeks to prove that replacing a provision that
   requires good faith in negotiations with the provisions of tort
   liability causes many legal problems. To prove this, the legal
   provisions should be analysed which would also include determining the
   definition of the principle of good faith, and the function of that
   principle in achieving contractual equilibrium and the legal basis for
   this principle at the stage of negotiation which should also be
   analysed. Moreover, a comparative analytical approach with the French
   civil code is used to illustrate the Palestinian legislative
   deficiencies and the need to legislate a legal article which obligates
   the negotiating parties to behave in good faith, as this has become an
   unavoidable reality that should be dealt with to contribute to the
   stability of civil and commercial transactions. As such, the legal
   article should also specify the compensation to be claimed.},

Abstract = {The article is devoted to the experience of the application of a concept
   of militant democracy in modern Ukraine. This concept is relevant due to
   the prolonged domination of the communist totalitarian regime until
   1991, and also in view of the encroachment on the principle of
   territorial integrity in 2014. It is argued that Ukraine, formally
   consolidating separate instruments of militant democracy at the level of
   the Constitution of Ukraine, almost did not apply such instruments until
   2014. The active process of decommunization started in 2014, after the
   Revolution of Dignity; it was realised, in particular, in the
   declaration of lustration, as well as the banning of the two communist
   parties, but the most influential Communist Party remains officially not
   banned up till now. Also, the two parties, accused of infringement on
   territorial integrity, were banned in 2014. The issue of differentiation
   between aggressive words and aggressive actions of parties is analysed.
   It is argued that representatives of the parties, who during the twenty
   years of Ukrainian independence openly denied one of the key values of
   the constitutional order of Ukraine, its territorial integrity, became
   active participants of the temporary occupation.},

Abstract = {This article pays close attention to Michel Foucault's theory that
   political regimes are enlightened through courageous free speech. A
   Foucaultian enlightenment occurs not when philosophical reason
   completely replaces superstition and enthusiasm in the public sphere,
   but instead when the parrhesiast partially organizes competing claims to
   know and to speak the truth. While much of the recent scholarly
   literature on Foucault's later lectures emphasizes the political
   importance of the parrhesiast, less attention has been paid to the
   overlap and/or incompatibility between parrhesia and the other modes of
   truth-telling. Below, I explain Foucault's analysis of the basic modes
   of philosophical truth-telling: prophesy, philosophy, teaching, and
   parrhesia. I provide examples of speakers working within these modes in
   the ancient and modern world. I explain the overlap and tension between
   these modes, and I analyze Foucault's partial organization of them
   through the image of the parrhesiast. I briefly compare Foucault's
   position to the agonistic democratic theory of Chantal Mouffe and
   distinguish Foucault's view from consensus-based views of public reason.
   Finally, I provide practical and theoretical examples of parrhesiastic
   activity in the contemporary world.},

Abstract = {Media blackouts or election silence periods feature in several European
   democracies. However, this article argues that they have become
   democratic vulnerabilities in the context of increased Internet-based
   electoral meddling such as during \#MacronLeaks. Using both discourse
   and social network analyses, this study shows that the vacuum created by
   the inability of politicians and established media outlets to comment on
   the leaks empowered unregulated and unreliable sources which sought to
   drag the direction of the election away from the centre and towards the
   far right. Our findings have broad implications for understanding how
   social media activity is structured under the conditions of information
   leaks. The findings of this study may be relevant to other political
   events which involve the release of sensitive information via social
   media.},

Abstract = {In 2018, the Turkish economy suffered one of the most severe financial
   speculations in its 38-year open economy era. Some have tried to explain
   the causes of the financial turbulence solely by linking it to the
   deterioration in the macroeconomic indicators, such as the inflation
   rate and current account deficit. However, this approach cannot help us
   to understand the fundamental causes of the financial turbulence. This
   paper argues that internal and external shocks ranging from the coup
   attempt in 2016 to geopolitical risks hindered the designing and
   implementation process of the second-generation reforms Turkey needed to
   escape from its middle-income trap. As the reform process slowed down
   and the severity of shocks increased; uncertainties over economic
   performance and policies mounted. This uncertain environment paved the
   way for financial turbulence by providing opportunities for speculators
   to mislead the markets in line with their own interests.},

Abstract = {Cases of serious public harm (defined as policy and administrative
   failures resulting in fatalities), where there is a direct causal link
   with ministerial action or inaction, are few. Relevant examples in
   Australia are the home insulation program (colloquially known as `the
   pink batts' case), and the Oakden Older Persons Mental Health Service,
   and in New Zealand the Cave Creek viewing platform tragedy. Traditional
   parliamentary scrutiny mechanisms were employed to interrogate the
   failures that resulted in the home insulation and Cave Creek tragedies.
   However, the manner in which the full extent of the Oakden scandal was
   ultimately exposed in South Australia suggests that, in some instances
   in contemporary Australian politics, only integrity bodies independent
   of parliament with appropriately legislated powers have any chance of
   holding individual ministers responsible for public harm caused by
   serious policy failure and supporting the maintenance of legitimacy of
   the Westminster political system.},

Abstract = {This research aims to develop a deeper insight into the development of
   political science from the bibliometric perspective by analysing
   peer-reviewed journal articles (n = 1117) indexed in the Scopus database
   and published by authors from fifteen Central and Eastern European (CEE)
   countries in the period 1996-2013. Results indicate that the majority of
   articles (84\%) by CEE authors have been published in international
   journals and in the English language. The visibility of these articles
   in international journals, measured by the mean number of citations, is
   5.2 per paper, while the same indicator for CEE journal articles amounts
   to 0.2. Authorship analysis indicates a gradual but continuous increase
   in co-authorships. Additionally, there are significant differences in
   citations between single-authored and co-authored articles, both in
   international and CEE journals. Co-authorship among CEE authors is
   present in only 1\% of the analysed articles, confirming weak
   collaboration between political scientists in CEE countries.},

Abstract = {Peacebuilding is more likely to succeed in countries with higher levels
   of gender equality, but few studies have examined the link between
   subnational gender relations and local peace and, more generally,
   peacebuilding after communal conflict. This article addresses this gap.
   I examine gender relations and (non)violence in ethno-religious conflict
   in the city of Jos in central Nigeria. Jos and its rural surroundings
   have repeatedly suffered communal clashes that have killed thousands,
   sometimes within only days. Drawing on qualitative data collected during
   fieldwork, I analyze the gender dimensions of violence, nonviolence, and
   postviolence prevention. I argue that civilian agency is gendered.
   Gender relations and distinct notions of masculinity can facilitate or
   constrain people's mobilization for fighting. Hence, a nuanced
   understanding of the gender dimensions of (non)violence has important
   implications for conflict prevention and local peacebuilding.},

Journal = {POLITICAL BEHAVIOR},

Volume = {41},
Number = {3},

Abstract = {Opinions toward gay marriage, also known as same-sex marriage, have
   become dramatically more favorable in the last 20 years. Given the more
   accepting attitudes of younger Americans, generational replacement is
   one widely noted engine of change. However, the pace of shifts in public
   attitudes has been too rapid for this to be the sole explanation.
   Identifying other causes of increasing support has been difficult due to
   reliance on cross-sectional associations. Using nationally
   representative panel data from 2008 to 2016, we test three potential
   explanations for changes in public attitudes toward gay marriage. Our
   findings suggest that increased interpersonal contact with gays and
   lesbians, declining religiosity, and increasing levels of education in
   the U.S. all contributed to the rise in public support for same-sex
   marriage.},

Abstract = {In view of the robust link often inferred between autonomous journalism
   and the strength of a society's democratic institutions, and against the
   background of current challenges to journalists' traditional roles as
   purveyors of timely and independent information, we interviewed 352
   Canadian journalists about their social and political roles and the
   influences on their news choices. Comparison of their responses against
   an international data set (N = 27,567) suggests that Canadian
   journalists place greater value on detached monitorial roles and claim
   relatively greater autonomy from commercial and other influences on
   their work. Further, in comparing these findings to an influential panel
   study from 1996 to 2003, we conclude that the Canadian journalists'
   ``credo,{''} focused on neutral reporting and oriented more to perceived
   public interest than to business or audience interests, remains
   surprisingly intact despite contemporary pressures on news forms and
   business models. This professed neutrality is mitigated by a desire to
   promote diversity and tolerance.},

Abstract = {The Indian elections of 2019 have worked to transform the mode of
   authoritarian power held by the central government through methods of
   state violence. Through the example of the electoral process in West
   Bengal, restricted by state intervention and plagued by violence and
   repression, this article will attempt to critique various stances taken
   against authoritarianism in postcolonial democratic contexts. It finds
   that the traditional left has become ineffectual, and that populists
   lack sufficiently complex critiques to mount a systematic opposition.
   Hope, however, lies in the potential evolutions of the latter.},

Abstract = {This article explores the moderating effects of body obesity and
   subjective health status on the relationship between distance to the
   polling station and voter turnout in the Czech general election of 2017.
   Using insights from rational choice theory and the funnel model of
   turnout, multilevel logit models were used to examine whether the
   relationship between reported turnout and distance from home to the
   polling station was different for those who are obese and/or think they
   are in poor health. This study is based on analyses of the Czech
   Household Panel Survey data. The modelling results confirm that those
   who were obese and in poor health had a lower probability of voting as
   the distance to the polling station increased. Furthermore, this study
   found that being interested in the 2017 election outcome (instrumental
   motivation) did mitigate physiological limitations associated with
   getting to a polling station; however, thinking that voting is a civic
   duty (moral motivation) had no strong effect on the distance to the
   polls and turnout relationship.},

Abstract = {Much of the literature on fringe political parties in post-communist
   Europe focused on the relationship with mainstream parties. Little is
   known about what happens at the fringes, what are the features of
   politics at the fringes and when this type of politics becomes
   mainstream. This special issue moves beyond the notion of the fringe
   versus mainstream dichotomy: it is more `granular' in its approach and
   seeks to differentiate between different forms of `fringe' parties. The
   contributions aim to explore how and whether the fringe in
   post-communist countries changes in an age of populism and illiberalism.
   They represent an important attempt to take the fringe as a feature of
   politics that is not necessarily transient or a manifestation of the
   `growing pains' of post-communism.},

Abstract = {How do we measure the activity of legislators? I argue that, in addition
   to using measures such as how many bills they pass, we must also
   consider activities such as parliamentary questions, early day motions,
   motions for the agenda and one-minute speeches. One means for doing so
   is Akirav's activity scale developed in Israel. I use this scale to
   measure legislators' activity in two additional political systems - the
   United States and the United Kingdom. I also identify the
   characteristics shared by the most active legislators and the least
   active. The findings indicate that opposition, junior and committee
   chair legislators are more active than other representatives. While
   previous studies have investigated the cost-benefit analysis in which
   legislators engage regarding where and how to invest their time in their
   legislative work, this study is the first to conduct such an analysis
   about both their legislative and non-legislative activities. This more
   complete picture reveals their incentives for engaging fully in
   parliamentary work.},

Title = {Constructivism and the Logic of Political Representation},
Journal = {AMERICAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {113},
Number = {3},
Pages = {824-837},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {There are at least two politically salient senses of
   ``representation{''}-acting-for-others and
   portraying-something-as-something. The difference is not just semantic
   but also logical: relations of representative agency are dyadic (x
   represents y), while portrayals are triadic (x represents y as z). I
   exploit this insight to disambiguate constructivism and to improve our
   theoretical vocabulary for analyzing political representation. I amend
   Saward's claims-based approach on three points, introducing the
   ``characterization{''} to correctly identify the elements of
   representational claims; explaining the ``referent{''} in pragmatic, not
   metaphysical terms; and differentiating multiple forms of
   representational activity. This enables me to clarify how the
   represented can be both prior to representation and constituted by it,
   and to recover Pitkin's idea that representatives ought to be
   ``responsive{''} to the represented. These points are pertinent to
   debates about the role of representatives, the nature of representative
   democracy, and the dynamics of revolutionary movements.},

Journal = {POLITICAL STUDIES REVIEW},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {17},
Number = {3},

Abstract = {This article explores the potential of the concept of `dilemma', as
   introduced in Mark Bevir and R.A.W. Rhodes' interpretive political
   science, to understand and explain change within and beyond political
   institutions. This article argues that the current conceptualisation of
   the concept has been underdeveloped and the potential opportunities of
   using it have been overlooked. The concept of dilemmas must be developed
   in two directions: first, through a greater linkage with everyday
   practices and, second, through a greater linkage to the concept of
   power. To do so, this article draws on insights from the concept of
   `problematisation' as a way to explain change. This adds more detail to
   dilemmas by arguing that, while dilemmas pose problems for existing
   beliefs and webs of belief, they also erect boundaries over what is an
   acceptable answer or resolution to dilemmas. It is this simple yet key
   insight that offers an opportunity to further strengthen interpretive
   political science, and offers much potential for future research on
   political change.},

Abstract = {In this article, I critically engage with the populism literature, and
   predicated on a conceptualization of modern democracy as a mixed regime
   (combining oligarchy and democracy), I provide a mechanism to connect
   populism-in-power to authoritarianism. As such, I elucidate a particular
   populist path to authoritarianism in a competitive setting by exploring
   two questions. First, what is the impact of populism-in-power on the
   modern democratic mixed regime? Second, what is the locus of populism in
   a modern democratic institutional framework? Utilizing the Turkish and
   Argentinean cases as illustrative examples of populism-in-power, I
   conclude that, first, unless a populist vision is accompanied by
   democratic institutions outside of the spectrum that modern democracy
   offers, when that vision which sacralizes and singularizes competitive
   elections becomes preponderant, it will lead to the opposite of its
   claim of making the people sovereign, and instead will make the rulers
   sovereign. Second, I argue that although there is no internal
   contradiction between modern democracy's liberal or constitutional and
   democratic elements, there is still a paradox surrounding modern
   democracy. This paradox is found between the sources of its imaginative
   appeal and its practice as a mixed regime, and this is where we should
   place the perennial potential of populism.},

Abstract = {Are the components of policy ideology in the American states fixed, or
   do they change over time? We document a change in the ideological
   loading and internal consistency of state firearms laws. While state
   policy liberalism has long correlated positively with restrictive gun
   regulation, this relationship strengthened over the 1986-2016 period.
   Moreover, states' gun policy regimes have become more internally
   consistent since 1986, and newly salient issues, such as concealed-carry
   laws and assault weapons bans, have been enfolded into the existing
   dimension of regulatory restrictiveness. This process also corresponds
   to a shift in the geographic bases of the Republican and Democratic
   Parties toward nonurban and urban areas, respectively. The changes in
   gun policy patterns across states reflect dynamic representation of
   voter ideology. The results suggest that certain modeling assumptions
   used to generate cardinal state policy ideology scores in prior research
   ought to be revised. Related Articles Joslyn, Mark R., and Donald P.

Abstract = {Politicians routinely campaign on a large platform of new policies and
   policy changes they hope to pursue once in office. Presidents, however,
   are unique in their ability to accomplish this given the multiple
   avenues by which they can enact policy change. Using each presidential
   agenda between 1964 and 2010, we evaluate the circumstances under which
   a president's policy goal is realized via an executive order or a law
   passed by Congress. Previous studies have only considered these avenues
   independently, but when we consider them in concert with one another,
   new patterns emerge. Our results indicate that a president's proposal is
   most commonly addressed in tandem with Congress through the traditional
   legislative process. However, the level of polarization, presidential
   approval, the composition of government, and the type of issue being
   addressed increase the probability of a proposal being addressed
   unilaterally via executive order rather than by passing a law.},

Abstract = {Electoral officials play a crucial role in instilling confidence in
   elections and democracy. They are involved in the most important tasks
   of running elections, from registering voters to counting the ballots.
   This article employs survey data from 35 countries from the sixth wave
   of the World Values Survey (2010-2014) which asks respondents about
   their perceptions of electoral integrity and the quality of democracy in
   their country. The analysis demonstrates the relationship between
   perceptions of the fairness of electoral officials and two important
   outcomes: confidence in the fairness of the vote count, and perceptions
   of the overall quality of democracy. It additionally considers under
   which circumstances this relationship is most pronounced and shows that
   the relationship between an individual's perceptions of electoral
   officials and perceptions of electoral integrity is more pronounced in
   countries where there is a low liberal democracy index.},

Abstract = {Previous studies on flexible-list systems demonstrate that party
   selectorates promote candidates with a high number of preference votes
   to better list positions in the next election. This research note asks
   whether these rank promotions are limited to candidates in unrealistic
   list positions at the lower end of the ballot or also include candidates
   moving into realistic list positions (i.e. electorally safer highest
   ranks). Using a longitudinal data set of candidates for 18 parliamentary
   elections in Flanders (Belgium), we first successfully replicate the
   earlier established preference vote-effect on future list positions, but
   subsequently show that promotions from unrealistic to realistic
   positions are relatively rare. Moreover, preference votes do not seem to
   affect the ability to move upwards on the list or to receive a realistic
   position at the next election when controlling for incumbency and list
   position at the previous election. Robustness tests using different
   operationalizations for realistic position lead to similar empirical
   results. Preference votes do not seem to matter for realistic list
   positions.},

Abstract = {In order to better understand the dynamics of international cooperation
   on democracy promotion with authoritarian regimes, this article looks
   into the processes and results of negotiations on democracy (promotion)
   between the European Union (EU) and two of its North African neighbours
   (Morocco, Tunisia) in the decade leading up to the Arab uprisings.
   Asking if, how, and to what effect the EU and its Mediterranean partners
   have negotiated issues related to democracy promotion, it analyses
   official documents issued on the occasion of their respective
   association council meetings in 2000-2010. It shows that partners have
   indeed addressed these issues since the early 2000s, however, without
   engaging in substantive exchanges. Most of the time, conflicts have been
   neither directly addressed nor resolved. Where there are traces of
   actual negotiations leading to an agreement, these are clearly based on
   a logic of bargaining rather than arguing. These findings challenge the
   picture of harmony and cooperation between the EU and Morocco.
   Furthermore, they point to the low quality of these exchanges which
   reinforces the dilemma of international democracy promotion in
   cooperation with authoritarian regimes.},

Abstract = {Despite the hopes and political promises of the 1990s that
   socio-economic transformation would occur in South Africa, the country
   continues to be plagued by high levels of poverty and inequality. The
   question of why this transformation deficit exists arises, often with
   debate surrounding answers where forms of binary logic are foregrounded,
   for example, coloniality/decoloniality and Eurocentrism/Afrocentrism,
   among others. I depart from binaries-based approaches and instead focus
   on analyses revealing mechanisms that prevent transformation. These
   mechanisms are evident in Mill's analysis of the development of
   democracy, Marcuse's critique of advanced industrial society, Deleuze's
   commentary on disciplinary and control societies, and Princen's
   descriptions of traffic control measures. Outlines of these analyses are
   offered in the spirit of `knowing the enemy' that is a mix of structural
   mechanisms, identifiable without over-reliance on binary relationships,
   oppositions and tensions. Oppositions and tensions of this binary nature
   have been prominent in transformation rhetoric in South Africa, but the
   country's transformation deficit indicates that a new language
   (Wallerstein, Princen) might still be helpful in dealing with various
   conceptual and practical challenges. Adopting a manner of expression
   less inclined towards emphasis on binaries may be a step in the
   direction of the new language.},

Abstract = {When and why do electoral commitments enhance parties' ability to
   implement their preferred policy in multiparty governments? We propose
   an audience costs theory whereby strong platform commitments enhance
   parties' negotiating positions in multiparty cabinets but only when they
   are on a salient policy issue for core voters and the party controls the
   policy-relevant portfolio. Utilizing new data on portfolio allocations
   in eight parliamentary democracies over 40 years, we show that absent a
   strong platform commitment, control of the portfolio of social affairs
   by social democrats, alone, is not associated with changes in welfare
   generosity. Notably, our findings are independent of party size and hold
   in most multiparty legislative systems not dominated by three parties.},

Abstract = {This study examines public support for a key contested multicultural
   policy in contemporary Europe: the provision of religious schools. It
   makes two main contributions, one substantive and one theoretical.
   Substantively, the main contribution is to provide new experimental
   evidence demonstrating the existence of discrimination against Muslims
   on a central issue of multicultural social policy. Theoretically, the
   main contribution is to propose an explanation for variations in
   patterns of discrimination that highlights the role of individuals'
   motivation to control prejudice. Through moderation analysis, we show
   that individuals who express stronger motivation to control prejudice
   are more likely to treat Muslim and Christian requests for religious
   schools equally, and they are more likely to retain their support for
   Muslim schools in the wake of a threatening Islamist terrorist incident.
   Because we conducted the experiments in three countries, we in addition
   find societal-level patterns of variation: Individuals' motivation to
   control prejudice is more strongly associated with nondiscriminatory
   responses to the question of religious schools where a more
   multicultural path of accommodation has been pursued. This
   societal-level variation raises new hypotheses about how multicultural
   policies may interact with public opinion and underlines the importance
   of comparative experimental work.},

Abstract = {The increasing introduction of organizational innovations has changed
   the notion of party membership. Some political parties now offer
   multiple kinds of formal affiliation, whereas others offer a varied
   repertoire of modes of engagement in party activities without formal
   membership distinctions. However, little is still known about the
   consequences of these changes. This article studies the case of Podemos,
   a party that has adopted a considerably innovative approach to
   membership. Through an analysis of Podemos voters and affiliates, we
   find that the gap in resources between members and voters recurrently
   found in the literature remains relevant despite organizational
   innovation. Moreover, we investigate how members make use of the
   expanded options of involvement offered by the party. Findings suggest
   that even in extreme cases of organizational innovation members can
   still be grouped into concentric categories based on the intensity of
   their involvement. These categories, which are consistent with the
   patterns found in traditional party organizations, seem to be explained
   by members' ideological commitment rather than resources.},

Abstract = {This article analyses the political effects of the mixed parallel
   electoral system in Lithuania. According to the `best of both worlds'
   logic, mixed systems could combine advantages from both the majoritarian
   and proportional formulas. However, counterarguments were also presented
   in the literature, pointing to the possibility of the `worst of both
   worlds'. According to presented analysis of Lithuanian parliamentary
   elections between 1992 and 2016, the pessimistic scenario is expected
   when a mixed parallel electoral system is used in a new democracy with a
   weakly institutionalised party system and high volatility. Lithuania's
   mixed parallel system produces relatively disproportional election
   results. However, it also facilitates the fragmentation of party system.
   Moreover, the effects in a concrete election are hardly predictable,
   especially the seat bonus of election winner. Evidence in the article
   points to a conclusion that mixed parallel electoral systems could
   contribute to the `worst of all worlds' and new democracies should avoid
   them.},

Journal = {POLITICAL SCIENCE RESEARCH AND METHODS},

Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {How do personality traits condition the effects of campaign messages
   meant to mobilize voters? With two nationally representative US survey
   experiments, I show that common aggressive metaphors mobilize or
   demobilize voters depending on their traits. Aggressive metaphors
   increase the mobilizing impact of motivations to participate among
   aggressive individuals but decrease that impact among low-aggression
   people. For example, the language mobilizes strong partisans with
   aggressive personalities but demobilizes strong partisans low in
   aggression. This heterogeneity showcases the nuanced power of metaphors
   in campaigns, reaffirms the importance of personality in political
   behavior, and reveals the hidden role of aggression in non-violent
   political behavior for the first time. In practice, the net effects of
   aggressive metaphors can be positive, negative, or null depending on
   average traits in an audience.},

Abstract = {The neofunctionalist theory considers that cooperation among states in
   certain areas of common interest will make it possible an advance
   towards regional integration and the peaceful resolution of conflicts,
   due to the perception of the advantages derived from such integration.
   In reality, this neofunctionalist inspiration has been present in the
   European Union (EU) policies towards the Mediterranean Sea. The thesis
   moved forward in this article is that, in contrast to neofunctionalist
   expectations, the discovery of important hydrocarbon deposits that
   straddle the maritime boundary between Israel and Lebanon has
   contributed to foster more instability in an area where existing
   rivalries are especially sensitive to any shift in the balance of power.
   Moreover, the traditional US hegemonic role is clearly weakened and it
   cannot provide an effective mediation. As for the EU mechanisms for
   regional cooperation, they are not the appropriate tool to overcome this
   conflict due to the fact that they do not meet the existing security
   concerns, as the realist theory predicts.},

Abstract = {A vast literature debates the efficacy of descriptive representation in
   legislatures. Though studies argue it influences how communities are
   represented through constituency service, they are limited since
   legislators' service activities are unobserved. Using Freedom of
   Information Act (FOIA) requests, we collected 88,000 records of
   communication between members of the U.S. Congress and federal agencies
   during the 108th-113th Congresses. These legislative interventions allow
   us to examine members' ``follow-through{''} with policy implementation.
   We find that women, racial/ethnic minorities, and veterans are more
   likely to work on behalf of constituents with whom they share
   identities. Including veterans offers leverage in understanding the role
   of political cleavages and shared experiences. Our findings suggest that
   shared experiences operate as a critical mechanism for representation,
   that a lack of political consensus is not necessary for substantive
   representation, and that the causal relationships identified by
   experimental work have observable implications in the daily work of
   Congress.},

Abstract = {In the Brexit referendum in 2016, Scotland voted 62 per cent Remain, and
   England 53 per cent Leave. This article explores whether this came about
   because more people in Scotland considered themselves `strongly
   European' compared with people in England. Analysis of Scottish and
   British Social Attitudes survey data for 2017 shows that people in
   Scotland are significantly more inclined to say they are `strongly
   European' (45 per cent) than in England (34 per cent), a finding that
   holds true across the spectrum of socio-demographic and political
   variables. Nevertheless, the key predictors of being strongly European
   are similar in both countries: having liberal values, high levels of
   education, political party support, as well as being British, while in
   Scotland supporting the Scottish National Party and being in favour of
   independence are important. `Being European' has taken on different
   meanings in Scotland and England as the aftermath of the Brexit
   referendum works its way through the political process.},

Abstract = {Despite recurring elections and the transition to multiparty systems,
   authoritarianism has re-emerged in the Post-Soviet Space. Along with
   domestic factors, the external dimension should also be considered to
   fully understand this regional trend. Scholars depict Russia as a
   typical `black knight' for democracy. While most of the literature deals
   with the Kremlin's policies in the `new' Eastern Europe, this article
   pays attention to Russia's actions in the relatively understudied
   Southern Caucasus. Specifically, it investigates why and how Moscow
   tried to thwart democratization in Armenia, Azerbaijan and Georgia. The
   diachronic analysis addresses three periods, namely, Yeltsin's
   presidency, the first Putin presidency and the Putin-Medvedev diarchy.
   Findings suggest that the Kremlin implemented an increasingly nuanced
   and intentional black knight strategy in Southern Caucasus, aimed at
   gaining primacy in the Post-Soviet Space and recognition of its great
   power status.},

Abstract = {This article focuses on the manipulation of legislative rules in
   electoral authoritarian states. Electoral liberalization in
   authoritarian regimes creates the capacity for opposition forces to win
   legislative seats, but it does not ensure voice in the policy process.
   While the literature on institutional authoritarianism points to
   co-optation, dominant parties, and redistribution as mechanisms to
   control policy outcomes in authoritarian legislatures, we investigate an
   additional possibility: that electoral authoritarian regimes (EARs)
   select legislative institutions that allow free debate and unconstrained
   voting yet decouple electoral success from policy influence. Our
   analysis centers on the EAR in Hong Kong and its legislature, the
   Legislative Council (LegCo). We find that the LegCo's rules of procedure
   interact with electoral institutions to create considerable roadblocks
   to opposition initiatives, while at the same time facilitating the
   enactment of regime policies.},

Abstract = {Are the social networks of legislators affected more by their political
   parties or their personal traits? How does the party organization
   influence the tendency of members to work collectively on a day-to-day
   basis? In this paper, I explore the determinants of the relationships of
   legislators in the Brazilian Chamber of Deputies. I use exponential
   random graph models to evaluate the relative influence of personal
   traits versus party influence in generating legislator relationships.
   Despite a focus on personalism in Brazil, the analysis reveals that the
   effects of political parties on tie formation are roughly equal to the
   effects of personal traits, suggesting that networks may make political
   parties much more cohesive than contemporary literature would lead us to
   believe.},

Abstract = {This article investigates the electoral constraints on the inter-party
   mobility of candidates. We argue that the prevalent mode of interactions
   among candidates, voters, and parties in local, district-level electoral
   markets shapes the strategic constraints faced by potential party
   switchers. We suggest that strong linkages between voters and political
   parties reduce the market value of the candidates outside of their
   political parties, thereby constraining their inter-party mobility.
   These expectations are evaluated using candidate- and district-level
   data from Pakistan from 1988-2013. The results show that the strength of
   voter-party linkages in an electoral district, as measured by the lack
   of electoral volatility and the extent of straight-ticket voting in
   national and provincial elections, has a positive effect on the
   propensity of candidates to switch parties.},

Year = {2021},
Volume = {9},

Abstract = {The gender and age composition of a parliament impacts who is
   descriptively represented and marginalized and what types of policy
   ideas and solutions are brought forward or excluded. While important for
   both descriptive and substantive representation, scholarship on the
   intersection of gender and age in parliaments has thus far been limited.
   To broaden our understanding, we conducted a large-scale cross-sectional
   analysis of the gender and ages of over 20,000 representatives from 78
   national assemblies. We identified four types of gender-age patterns
   depending on whether women enter legislatures younger than men
   ({''}early birds{''}) or have served in parliament for a shorter period
   of time than men ({''}short tenures{''}). Most surprisingly, we found
   few countries exhibit the predicted ``double squeeze{''} pattern whereby
   women enter parliament older than men and have shorter tenures. Lastly,
   since most women enter parliament after child-bearing age, we conclude
   that the motherhood penalty still exists.},

Abstract = {There is a need to revamp transatlantic relations and its logic in the
   contemporary multipolar, globalized, and technologically advancing
   world. NATO's deteriorating deterrence and capabilities are linked to
   Europe's weaknesses, originating from inharmonious national preferences,
   industrial and policy divisions within the block, and an absence of
   effective, sustainable, and modern approach to address the strategic
   capability shortfalls. This article critically reviews European defense
   integration efforts before building upon current warfare trends, mainly
   space and artificial intelligence. It argues the vitality and mutual
   utility of transatlantic relations that can be addressed by focusing on
   civilian and private sector-driven investments into cutting-edge
   technology research.},

Abstract = {Political advertising on Facebook is the latest in a long line of
   developments in campaign practice, and is a tool that has been mobilised
   extensively in elections around the world. In this article, we explore
   what we know about Facebook advertising at elections and ask what
   existing data from the UK Electoral Commission can reveal about current
   usage. Highlighting the principles behind Facebook advertising, we argue
   that existing metrics offer little insight into current campaign
   trends-posing analytical, methodological and normative challenges for
   academics and electoral regulators alike. Moreover, we argue that these
   challenges strike at the heart of debates about democratic
   responsibility and the degree to which governments should cede
   responsibility to commercial actors who may have differing
   understandings of fundamental democratic norms.},

Abstract = {How do personal encounters with legal institutions shape citizens'
   confidence in those institutions throughout sub-Saharan Africa? Using
   Afrobarometer's cross-national citizen survey, we show that negative
   first-hand experiences with government courts and police erode citizens'
   trust in those state institutions but do not tend to disrupt citizens'
   perceptions of their authority to arbitrate or enforce the law.
   Individuals from diverse demographic backgrounds imbue state
   institutions with the right to perform their governance and
   law-enforcement duties, even after experiencing institutional
   incompetence or injustice. This article advances existing comparative
   research on legal institutions, which tends to conflate trust and
   legitimacy and overlooks the distinction between de facto performance
   and de jure authority. We suggest that rule-of-law institutions have
   deeper roots than some scholars have previously supposed.},

Abstract = {Reading Friedrich Hayek's late work as a neoliberal myth of the state of
   nature, this article finds neoliberalism's hostilities to democracy to
   be animated in part by a romantic demand for belonging. Hayek's theory
   of spontaneous order expresses this desire for belonging as it pretends
   the market is capable of harmonizing differences so long as the state is
   prevented from interfering. Approaching Hayek's work in this way helps
   to explain why his conceptions of both pluralism and democracy are so
   thin. It also suggests that neoliberalism's assaults upon democracy are
   intimately linked to its relentless extractivism. Yet the romantic
   elements in Hayek's work might have led him toward a more radical
   democratic project and ecological politics had he affirmed plurality for
   what it enables. I conclude with the suggestion that democratic theory
   can benefit from learning to listen to what Hayek heard but failed to
   affirm: nature's active voice.},

Abstract = {This article explores the construction of the category of youth criminal
   responsibility by community operators from a heterogeneous set of
   institutions, which worked with a Referral Centre of Buenos Aires
   province since 2015. In that center, alternative measures to deprivation
   of liberty are implemented towards young people of 16 and 17 years old
   who committed crimes. In-depth interviews and discourse analysis allow
   to unravel the cultural matrices which frame the socio-community
   intervention strategies and their influence in the identity
   configuration of the young people. Some results of the study allow to
   affirm that within the framework of the alternative intervention to
   deprivation of liberty the socio-juridical category of juvenile criminal
   responsibility is constructed in a reintegrative and stigmatizing way,
   intermittently, from discourses of different levels of morality that
   operate on the basis of ``subjective responsibility{''} strategies.},

Abstract = {Violent crime rates have increased dramatically in many parts of the
   world in recent decades, with homicides now outpacing deaths due to
   interstate or civil wars. Considerable variations exist across
   democracies in their violent crime rates, however: different autocratic
   experiences help explain why this is the case. Democracies emerging from
   military rule have higher homicide rates because they typically inherit
   militarized police forces. This creates a dilemma after democratization:
   allowing the military to remain in the police leads to law enforcement
   personnel trained in defense rather than policing, but extricating it
   marginalizes individuals trained in the use of violence. The results of
   cross-national statistical tests are shown to be consistent with this
   argument.},

Abstract = {Do economic sanctions turn the public against the target government or
   cause it to rally around the flag? How do sanctions affect attitudes
   toward the sanctioner? How does bad economic performance under sanctions
   shape support for the target government? Despite their importance, these
   questions have rarely been explored with survey data. Results from two
   surveys in Russia find that exposure to information about economic
   sanctions does not generate a rally around the flag, leads some groups
   to withdraw support from the target government, and reduces support for
   the sanctioner. Respondents also react more strongly to the reasons why
   sanctions were put in place-the annexation of Crimea-than to the
   sanctions themselves. These results suggest the need to reevaluate
   theories of the impact of economic sanctions and blame-shifting under
   autocracy.},

Abstract = {We offer a new perspective on the recent controversies surrounding the
   memorialization of comfort women in several American cities by shifting
   the focus from bilateral historical grievances and tensions between the
   national governments of Japan and South Korea, to the grassroots and
   transnational politics involved in the siting of these monuments. We
   find that the construction of a transnational Korean identity among the
   Korean diaspora in the USA, and their creation of a collective public
   memory of the comfort women are evidence of their growing political
   consciousness and engagement in American civic life, and it is notable
   that most of the leadership and membership of the main organizations
   involved are women. These women are part of the global feminist and
   human rights movements which advocate for the inclusion and recognition
   of the experiences of women during wartime and colonization. Therefore,
   the memorials are not only symbols of historic reconciliation and
   remembrance, but of the skillful and strategic organizing, activism, and
   leadership of Asian Americans. This article also shows how the movement
   is evolving through the development of educational and curricular
   initiatives in honor of the comfort women in the USA.},

Abstract = {Welfare state reform in times of austerity is notoriously difficult
   because most citizens oppose retrenchment of social benefits.
   Governments, thus, tend to combine cutbacks with selective benefit
   expansions, thereby creating trade-offs: to secure new advantages,
   citizens must accept painful cutbacks. Prior research has been unable to
   assess the effectiveness of compensating components in restrictive
   welfare reforms. We provide novel evidence on feasible reform strategies
   by applying conjoint survey analysis to a highly realistic direct
   democratic setting of multidimensional welfare state reform. Drawing on
   an original survey of Swiss citizens' attitudes toward comprehensive
   pension reform, we empirically demonstrate that built-in trade-offs
   strongly enhance the prospects of restrictive welfare reforms. Our
   findings indicate that agency matters: governments and policy makers can
   and must grant the right compensations to the relevant opposition groups
   to overcome institutional inertia.},

Abstract = {We explore what can be learned from authoritarian backsliding in middle
   income countries about the threats to American democracy posed by the
   election of Donald Trump. We develop some causal hunches and an
   empirical baseline by considering the rise of elected autocrats in
   Venezuela, Turkey, and Hungary. Although American political institutions
   may forestall a reversion to electoral autocracy, we see some striking
   parallels in terms of democratic dysfunction, polarization, the nature
   of autocratic appeals, and the processes through which autocratic
   incumbents sought to exploit elected office. These processes could
   generate a diminished democratic system in which electoral competition
   survives, but within a political space that is narrowed by weakened
   horizontal checks on executive power and rule of law.},

Abstract = {The China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) offers a massive platform
   for China and Pakistan to promote regional connectivity, trade growth,
   and infrastructure development. Pakistan views CPEC not only as an
   infrastructure and economic development program as well as a key
   initiative with wide-ranging implications for the country's domestic
   economy and social makeup, but also a potential ``game changer{''} in
   the regional situation. However, this project also faces grave internal
   and external challenges, such as route controversy, militancy, religious
   extremism, competing narratives, media propaganda, debt-trap accusation,
   and synergy of institutions. To make CPEC a sustainable project that
   benefits Pakistan and the whole of South Asia in the long run, both the
   Chinese and Pakistani governments need to address these challenges
   through greater transparency of the CPEC projects, as well as more
   consultation with all stakeholders involved, so as to ease their
   concerns about the profound implications of the grand project.},

Abstract = {In many ways, Donald Trump's presidency seems to mark the culmination of
   a long-developing crisis in American representation. In preceding
   decades Americans complained that their two major parties were
   increasingly stifling as many societal concerns as they voiced. Then
   Trump blew the previous lines of party competition apart and disrupted
   much of the political landscape. Yet if Trump has certainly introduced
   an atmosphere of crisis, we argue that much of his rise reflects
   predictable features of electoral democracy rather than a breakdown in
   its normal dynamics. We should expect democracies to confront endemic
   problems of muffling (when parties silence or obfuscate cross-cutting
   issues) and displacement (when muffled conflicts break out to shift
   parties' leadership selections, like in 2016). We set a qualitative
   account of the 2016 election against longer term data on American
   parties in comparative perspective to display these challenges.},

Abstract = {In recent years, populist leaders, movements, and parties have posed
   formidable challenges to liberal democracy in Europe, Latin America, and
   the United States. These challenges are rooted in representational
   crises: in particular, party systems and their diminishing capacity to
   integrate and represent broad popular constituencies in the democratic
   arena. To understand these institutional failures, it is essential to
   explore the changing patterns of partisan competition and representation
   under the constraints of market globalization and the social
   fragmentation which it has produced. These constraints create openings
   for populist contenders to politicize economic insecurities and cultural
   resentments, in opposition to traditional political establishments.},

Volume = {8},

Abstract = {The 2015 release of Harper Lee's novel Go Set a Watchman led to a
   frenzied reaction from admirers of To Kill a Mockingbird. This rush to
   decipher Atticus's racial attitudes overshadowed Lee's full unveiling of
   important new dimensions in the Finch family tale. First and foremost,
   the heart of both novels is the moral and political development of Jean
   Louise ``Scout{''} Finch. Scout's complicated education in civic, moral,
   and legal virtue requires readers to make sense of Atticus as a teacher.
   His lessons on justice and his political actions in Watchman illuminate
   his jurisprudence in Mockingbird as within the rule of law and civil
   rights traditions of a jurist such as Hugo Black. Finally, Watchman
   completes the arc of Jean Louise's education by illustrating the
   dangerous consequences of political life without friendship. Read
   together, the novels offer a coherent and extraordinary commentary on
   American political life and thought.},

Abstract = {The coordinated behavior of members of a state delegation to the U.S.
   Senate can provide constituents in a state greater representation in
   Congress. Despite this potentially improved level of representation
   through coordination, popular and scholarly accounts of the U.S. Senate
   often feature senators from the same state at odds with one another on a
   variety of policy issues. In this research, we investigate competing
   expectations regarding the frequency (across topics) of collaborations
   between members of a state delegation to the Senate. We then test our
   expectations using patterns in bill cosponsorship in the 103rd-110th
   U.S. Senates. We find that senators from the same state work together
   often on the development of legislation, and that this coordinated
   activity is consistent across a variety of bill topics across many
   sessions of congressional activity. Notably, same-state status is an
   even stronger predictor of support via cosponsorship than is same-party
   status, raising possible avenues of breaking through partisan gridlock.},

Abstract = {This article aims to develop a conceptual framework to address the
   economic dimension of right-wing populism. Moving beyond classic
   left-right economics and the divide between economic and cultural
   approaches, it argues that the political economy of right-wing populists
   is intertwined with cultural values in the construction of the `true'
   people as an economic community whose well-being is in decline and under
   threat, and therefore needs to be restored. Looking at populist
   traditions across Europe and the United States, the paper emphasizes the
   significance of `producerist' frames in economic populism. This is
   illustrated through an empirical analysis of differences and
   similarities in the economic policies and discourses of three
   established right-wing populist parties based in Europe (FN, SVP and
   UKIP), and the Tea Party and Donald Trump in the United States. We find
   that economic populist frames are common to all of the parties under
   scrutiny, albeit subject, however, to different interpretations of the
   producerist antagonism and groups. Our findings confirm that the
   intersection between economic populism and producerism provides a
   new-and fruitful-perspective on right-wing populism, while
   simultaneously demonstrating the relevance of a transatlantic approach
   to the study of the populist phenomenon.},

Abstract = {This study examines the approach taken by one Scottish council in the
   use of a place-based approach, aiming to investigate whether systemic
   mitigation of social risk can be achieved with place-based social
   innovation. Many local authorities have utilised the `Total Place'
   ideology in the UK as a means of redesigning the public service system.
   This paper presents a longitudinal review of The City of Edinburgh
   Council's approach to Total Place, based on qualitative documentary and
   interview data collected over five years from 2012-2017. The paper
   presents the experiences from approaches implemented in the city and
   learning points put forward to the council. It finds that social risk
   can be mitigated locally, but continued commitment and conscious effort
   to use the learning from their Total Places is required from the local
   authority in whatever future approach they take to localities working.},

Abstract = {Recent studies of economic voting have focused on the role of the local
   economy, but with inconclusive results. We argue that while local
   economic conditions affect incumbent support on average, the importance
   of the local economy varies by citizens' interactions with it. More
   recent and frequent encounters with aspects of the local economy make
   those aspects more salient and, in turn, feature more prominently in
   evaluations of the incumbent government. We label this process ``context
   priming.{''} We provide evidence for these propositions by studying
   local housing markets. Linking granularly detailed data on housing
   prices from Danish public registries to both precinct-level election
   returns and an individual-level panel survey, we find that when
   individuals interact with the housing market, their support for the
   incumbent government is more responsive to changes in local housing
   prices. The study thus provides a framework for understanding when
   citizens respond politically to the local economy.},

Abstract = {This article examines elite European discourses during the Greek
   financial crisis from its pre-history in September 2008 up to the
   arrival of the SYRIZA government in January 2015. The article employs
   the conceptual literature on Discursive Institutionalism (DI) and
   Historical Institutionalism (HI). Having coded 1,153 unique quotes drawn
   from a dataset of 15,354 news wires from Reuters, the authors argue that
   the communicative discourse of 63 senior European (and IMF) officials on
   the Greek crisis during that period demonstrates significant volatility.
   Four distinct narrative frames are identified: `neglect', `suspicious
   cooperation', `blame' and `reluctant redemption', punctuated by three
   discursive junctures in 2010, 2011 and 2012, which reflect the content
   of the changing communicative discourse of the Greek crisis. The
   article's contribution is twofold: empirically, it is the first to
   provide a systematic analysis of the protagonists' communication of the
   Greek crisis; and theoretically, it combines DI and HI in an effort to
   conceptualise an important part of our understanding of `bail-out
   politics' throughout the Eurozone crisis.},

Abstract = {Party identification provides citizens with an anchor from which they
   derive many of their political attitudes and issue preferences. But what
   happens when people encounter political debates that place their
   partisan identities and policy attitudes into conflict with one another?
   This article draws on an original experiment designed to study the
   effect of debates that cut across people's partisan identities and
   policy attitudes. The results show that cross-cutting debates make
   people less likely to engage in selective exposure, more likely to feel
   ambivalent toward their political party, and less likely to rely on
   party cues when rendering a judgment.},

Abstract = {Why do citizens join German parties? Do specific attributes and
   abilities play a determinant role in participation in political parties?
   The German Party Membership Study of 2009 enables us to answer these
   questions. On the basis of the telephone survey, we will address these
   issues by way of a systematic comparison of current party members with
   fellow citizens who never joined a party. For the purpose of analysing
   the individual-level determinants of joining a party, we use fundamental
   explanatory approaches to political participation: The socioeconomic
   standard model, the social-psychological approach, and the general
   incentives model. The results of our analyses clearly show that
   social-psychological attributes best explain the decision to join a
   party. Nevertheless, the findings for the determinants in both the
   socioeconomic standard model and the general incentives model complete
   the picture of citizens who are party members.},

Title = {Communication Deficit and Monetization of Political Contests at the

Abstract = {The current state of the office of the Electoral Commission (EC) of
   Ghana can be couched as a bleeding pillar in Ghana's electoral democracy
   pending crisis. In spite of the numerous reform measures undertaken by
   the EC to improve the quality delivery of its constitutional mandate,
   communication deficit and the increasing monetization of parliamentary
   and presidential contestation poses a serious threat to broader
   participation and competition in Ghana's future electoral fortune. Thus,
   the objective of the paper was to interrogate the issues of
   communication inefficiencies and monetization of political contestations
   by the Electoral Commission of Ghana and proffer pragmatic solutions
   that can be taken into consideration in years ahead due to the past and
   recent experiences of neighbouring countries within the sub-region. The
   study employed the qualitative research methodology to elicit responses
   from 12 experts in the field of elections. Apart from the primary data
   generated from the field, secondary sources were consulted to situate
   the discussion in the existing debate in the literature. The findings of
   the study revealed that monetization of the political contest has
   negative implications for a competitive political
   contest--disqualification of citizens with capable minds from contesting
   in a multi-party democracy) whilst communication deficit was found to be
   deepening public distrust in the Electoral Commission of Ghana. The
   study, therefore, recommended among others the creation of a three-man
   office solely responsible for managing the commission's website and
   other electronic outlets, and the immediate activation and
   implementation of the provision in the 2020 Strategic Plan of the
   Electoral Commission which has remained dormant after 2016 elections.},

Abstract = {This article examines the oxymoronic issues regarding the role of the
   state in higher education under the implementation of New Public
   Management (NPM) advocated by neoliberal ideology. According to its
   proponents, NPM can increase success and productivity and, thus, foster
   more democratic governance. In this NPM-driven web of relationships, the
   central issue always lies in whether the state should play minimal or
   maximal roles via a set of performative measurements. This article
   analyzes this interaction and relationship between the state and higher
   education, taking Indonesia as an object of analysis. It seeks to
   contribute to a better understanding of the theory and practice of
   public administration and public policy on education, particularly
   regarding the role of state in a particular context, like that of
   Indonesia, in which NPM and the neoliberal agenda are taking root.},

Title = {When Should We Use Unit Fixed Effects Regression Models for Causal
   Inference with Longitudinal Data?},

Abstract = {Many researchers use unit fixed effects regression models as their
   default methods for causal inference with longitudinal data. We show
   that the ability of these models to adjust for unobserved time-invariant
   confounders comes at the expense of dynamic causal relationships, which
   are permitted under an alternative selection-on-observables approach.
   Using the nonparametric directed acyclic graph, we highlight two key
   causal identification assumptions of unit fixed effects models: Past
   treatments do not directly influence current outcome, and past outcomes
   do not affect current treatment. Furthermore, we introduce a new
   nonparametric matching framework that elucidates how various unit fixed
   effects models implicitly compare treated and control observations to
   draw causal inference. By establishing the equivalence between matching
   and weighted unit fixed effects estimators, this framework enables a
   diverse set of identification strategies to adjust for unobservables in
   the absence of dynamic causal relationships between treatment and
   outcome variables. We illustrate the proposed methodology through its
   application to the estimation of GATT membership effects on dyadic trade
   volume.},

Abstract = {Voters frequently use demographic characteristics such as race or gender
   as shortcuts when evaluating politicians. We use two survey experiments
   to show that candidates' gender identity (specifically whether they
   identify as the same gender as the sex they were assigned at birth)
   functions as a similar cue. When a news story identified candidates as
   transgender, respondents rated them as more liberal and less likely to
   represent them, and less likely to receive their vote. The overall
   electoral penalty is moderated by voters' party, ideology, religiosity,
   and authoritarianism. In contrast to research on other demographic cues,
   we find that these effects persist even in the presence of cues about
   the candidate's party, suggesting that voters infer substantial
   information from politicians' gender identity.},

Abstract = {Under what conditions are individuals more likely to approve of human
   rights abuses by their governments? While various theoretical
   expectations have been offered about public approval of repression, many
   of them have not been directly tested. We analyze the effects of
   differing opposition tactics, differing government tactics, and legal
   constraints on approval of repression through a series of survey
   experiments in India, Israel, and Argentina. Our results indicate that
   violent action by opposition groups consistently increases support for
   government repression. In the context of contentious politics, we find
   that the effects of international law vary by national context. While
   our respondents in India were less likely to approve of their government
   when told the government violated international law, the same
   information likely increased approval of the government in our Israel
   experiment. The findings provide insights into the microfoundations of
   existing theories and suggest areas for theory refinement.},

Abstract = {Contemporary political science has fetishized a product of its own
   invention: the elite theory of democracy. American political science's
   understanding of ``democratic elitism{''} is founded on a fundamental
   misreading of the Italian School of Elitism and Joseph Schumpeter's
   political thought. This essay historicizes the early phases of the
   interpretive tradition known as democratic elitism, represented by the
   following authors: (1) Gaetano Mosca, Vilfredo Pareto, Robert Michels,
   (2) Joseph Schumpeter, and (3) Robert Dahl. I not only track how the
   Italian School's concern over the threat of plutocracy was suppressed,
   and their aspirations for political transparency discounted by American
   political science, but also trace the shift, over time, in the literary
   dispositions that undergird what we now call ``elite{''} or
   ``minimal{''} theories of democracy. I argue that in contrast to the
   Italian theorists' and Schumpeter's pessimism, Dahl infused optimism
   into his understanding of representative government with pernicious
   consequences for democratic theory.},

Abstract = {A striking characteristic of moral judgments is that people commonly
   assign value to particular actions, irrespective of what consequences
   the actions bring about. This phenomenon might be important to
   understanding political judgments, when people frequently purport to
   stand on principle, even when doing so comes at a substantial cost.
   Here, I draw on work in psychology that might help identify which
   citizens are insensitive to consequences in the context of political
   argumentation. I find that a particular facet of attitude intensity
   (moral conviction) identifies citizens who think about political issues
   in absolutist terms (studies 1 and 2) and who dismiss damaging
   information about policy consequences (studies 3 and 4). These results
   develop understanding of what attributes make different political
   arguments compelling to different people and illustrate the utility of
   attitude intensity measures as a way to account for the atomized and
   disorganized nature of political opinions.},

Abstract = {We contribute to the extensive literature on international influences on
   democratization and democratic breakdowns by conceptualizing hegemonic
   mechanisms of regime change and assessing them empirically. Our findings
   are based on a multi-methods approach and highlight the varying
   importance of hegemonic influences in post-1945 Latin America. We argue
   that us support for democratization was consistent in the wave of
   transitions to democracy that began in Latin America in 1978 and that it
   was decisive in many of these transitions. While past work has
   attributed responsibility to the US for the waves of democratic
   breakdowns from 1948 to 1956 and 1964 to 1976, an examination of the 27
   breakdowns from 1945 to 2010 gives reason to doubt this interpretation.
   Future research could use these conceptual and methodological tools to
   explore the role of other powers in waves of democracy and
   authoritarianism.},

Title = {Nigeria: Curtailing Electoral Violence through Information and
   Communication Technologies},
Journal = {CONFLICT STUDIES QUARTERLY},
Year = {2019},
Number = {27},
Pages = {70-92},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {This paper examined the contributions of the Information and
   Communication Technologies (ICTs) towards transparent and violence-free
   elections in African countries with specific focus on Nigeria, which is
   the largest democracy in the continent. Many countries have witnessed
   violent electoral contests, arising from the inability of the electoral
   umpire to conduct free and fair elections, hence the introduction of
   ICTs to correct the lapses. The objectives of this paper were to
   identify major ICTs gadgets for the conduct of elections in Nigeria and
   evaluate the extent to which the devices have curtailed electoral
   violence. The paper adopted an interpretive case study as its research
   methodology. The interpretive method is based on analogical deductions
   and re-analysis of relevant existing literature from secondary sources
   to generate new findings. Findings from the paper were that the ICTs
   have added tremendous values to the credibility of electoral process in
   Nigeria by securing elections from intense manipulation and violence
   through the use of electronic gadgets, including the use of Direct Data
   Capturing Machine (DDCM), Automated Finger Prints Identification System
   (AFIS) and the Smart Card Reader (SCR). However, it is concluded that
   the use of ICTs has improved electoral credibility but has not
   substantially reduced electoral violence in Nigeria as the electronic
   gadgets have relocated such electoral debacle from physical to
   electronic violence, and from manual to digital electoral manipulation.
   Digitalized electoral process in Nigeria is also faced with machine
   failure, system hacking and poor logistic supports. It is recommended
   that the usage of ICTs in the conduct of elections in Nigeria should be
   sustained as a complement, rather than supplement, to the traditional
   manual voting system in Nigeria. This recommendation is premised on the
   fact that Nigeria is not yet ripe for sole reliance on electronic voting
   system, which is largely challenged by inadequate power supply, derth of
   highly skilled ICTs technicians and high rate of ICTs non-compliance
   illiterate voters.},

Volume = {54},
Number = {2},

Abstract = {This article examines the determinants of the annual overall spending
   levels of political parties from a comparative perspective. On the basis
   of a dataset with 1,317 observations from 99 parties in nine European
   parliamentary democracies, we illustrate that the spending levels of
   parties - calculated on the basis of Nassmacher's index of political
   spending - have not systematically increased over the past decade. A
   multilevel analysis shows that, at the country level, spending levels
   are higher in countries with a longer tradition of public funding, a
   higher effective number of parties and a shorter democratic tradition.
   They are also higher in election years, but this effect is moderated
   when campaign spending limits apply. At the party level, spending levels
   increase with party strength and party age. Party ideology and
   government participation, on the other hand, do not have an effect.},

Abstract = {Voting Advice Applications (VAAs) fulfill different needs for different
   citizens. In national elections, the majority of users can be
   characterized as politically sophisticated citizens who use VAAs for
   entertainment purposes and confirmation of their party preference, but a
   significant minority uses VAAs to learn about politics and make an
   informed vote choice. VAAs might, however, play a different role in
   second-order elections, since in these elections campaign dynamics and
   information supply are very different. In the current research, we
   applied latent class analysis on user data from a widely used Dutch VAA
   (Kieskompas) for a supranational and several subnational elections in
   the Netherlands, to test if an extant typology of VAA users for national
   elections could be replicated. We find that the typology can be
   replicated for most of these elections, but also that the relative size
   of the groups of users differs across elections; in all second-order
   elections except for the provincial elections, more doubters and seekers
   are found relative to national elections. This suggests that VAAs are
   likely to have stronger mobilizing potential in these second-order
   elections.},

Journal = {POLITY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {51},
Number = {2},
Pages = {202-230},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Debates in political theory about national borders and free movement
   tend to focus on the abstract, static question of how much openness is
   ethically appropriate. In practice, however, any long-term realization
   of freer movement globally is likely to involve a dynamic patchwork of
   experiments that face setbacks from time to time. As Brexit revealed, a
   free movement zone can sometimes be broken up by a backlash to reclaim
   control of borders. In the world of policy and international law, there
   is some grudging respect for the acquired rights of individuals who have
   already moved across borders. But politicians and scholars fail to give
   enough weight to the expectation of many European Union citizens that
   the free movement zone would remain open to them. This article puts
   forth the view that a state's right to self-determination does not
   legitimately extend to closing borders, if openness has already been
   consolidated as an expectation and a social fact. It suggests that a
   proper account of cross-border social goods will chasten the undue
   deference given to the political sphere in curtailing openness. This
   argument has vital implications for migration policy in coming decades,
   offering normative clarity on why it would be improper to roll back free
   movement once achieved.},

Abstract = {Russia's government initiated pension reform in 2013 to resolve a
   crisis: the prolonged recession had created a huge Pension Fund deficit
   that required unsustainable subsidies from the state budget. The article
   analyzes four sets of influences on that reform: those from above
   (high-level policy makers), inside (government ministries, legislators),
   below (civil society, public opinion), and outside (international
   actors, policy learning). We find that the strongest influences come
   from above and inside, and analyze the conflicting policy preferences of
   key actors on reversal of pension privatization, indexation of payments,
   and age of eligibility. The policy process is protracted and fails to
   resolve major issues. Irresolution results from the leadership's effort
   to avoid blame for pension benefit cuts despite the weakness of civil
   society's influence. The current reform effort has been tentative,
   halting, and indecisive, indicating a government with a diminished
   capacity to resolve this major social policy problem.},

Abstract = {How do migration and immigration shape the political geography of
   American cities? In this article, we propose a mechanism of partisan
   sorting and demographic change which is tested using the mass migration
   of African Americans from New Orleans to Houston, Texas in the aftermath
   of Hurricane Katrina. We argue that differences in residential choice
   preferences among partisans combined with demographic changes which
   increase diversity can induce sorting by triggering flight (migration)
   among ideological conservatives. Using Hurricane Katrina evacuee data
   from schools in Harris Country along with a variety of empirical tools,
   we find evidence suggesting that African American Hurricane Katrina
   migration led to Republican flight.},

Title = {Caught in the Middle? Welfare State Legitimisation and Problematisation
   in German and Swedish Middle-class Discourse},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF POLITICS CULTURE AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {32},
Number = {1},

Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {When it comes to evaluating social and political developments, the
   category of the middle class takes a central position in public debates.
   The same holds true for welfare state research which assigns a vital
   role to the middle class, especially when redistributive measures have
   to be stabilised and legitimised. However, in these debates, it is
   largely overlooked that the middle class is an ambiguous concept which
   can bear a variety of meanings and argumentative functions. Against this
   background, this paper does not want to investigate what the middle
   class is, but rather how it gains meaning in discursive practices in
   different societies. Empirically, we compare German and Swedish media
   debates in regard to how meaning is attributed to the middle-class
   category as well as regarding the latter's role in the legitimisation
   and problematisation of the welfare state. The analysis reveals that
   while in the German discourse the middle class' well-being is considered
   to be the major aim of the welfare state and for the benefit of the
   whole society, the Swedish discourse is split into two threads: one
   which criticises the middle class for furthering social gaps and a
   second one which accuses the universal welfare state for constraining
   the autonomy of middle-class members. We argue that these differences
   between (and within) both discourses are due to different interpretive
   schemes which are anchored in the respective sociocultural context. The
   analysis thus demonstrates the additional value of an interpretive
   perspective which helps understanding the specific ways in which the
   welfare state becomes the object of political debate in different
   societies.},

Abstract = {This article examines the influence of economic crisis on voting
   preferences for the emerging Spanish parties (Podemos and Ciudadanos).
   We develop a multinomial model that tests their voting antecedents, and
   we find three results that may be relevant for the literature on the
   emergence of parties. First, a negative evaluation of the country's
   economic situation has a major impact on votes for the two parties.
   Second, the perception of corruption also plays a crucial role in
   understanding support for the two emerging parties. And third, both the
   evaluation of the country's economic situation and the perception of
   corruption interact to account for the emergence of both Podemos and
   Ciudadanos. We conclude that the emergence of new parties has an
   economic basis, but political factors - such as corruption - are not
   suppressed by this. Conversely, the two factors interact in order to
   finally give rise to the new parties.},

Abstract = {On account of poor living conditions, African Americans in the United
   States experience disproportionately high rates of mortality and
   incarceration compared with Whites. This has profoundly diminished the
   number of voting-eligible African Americans in the country, costing, as
   of 2010, approximately 3.9 million African American men and women the
   right to vote and amounting to a national African American
   disenfranchisement rate of 13.2\%. Although many disenfranchised African
   Americans have been stripped of voting rights by laws targeting felons
   and ex-felons, the majority are literally ``missing{''} from their
   communities due to premature death and incarceration. Leveraging
   variation in gender ratios across the United States, we show that
   missing African Americans are concentrated in the country's Southeast
   and that African American disenfranchisement rates in some legislative
   districts lie between 20\% and 40\%. Despite the many successes of the
   Voting Rights Act and the civil rights movement, high levels of African
   American disenfranchisement remain a continuing feature of the American
   polity.},

Abstract = {Some regions of the United Kingdom present more fertile grounds for
   consecutive incarnations of extreme right parties than others. In a
   study by Goodwin et al., the authors found evidence of the legacy
   effect, where an earlier cycle of activism by the National Front (NF),
   an extreme right political party active in the 1970s, emerged as a
   strong and significant predictor of membership in the British National
   Party (BNP) three decades later. While their study speaks to the
   supply-side arguments for extreme right success (organizational
   continuity and local cultural traditions in particular), here we examine
   whether a similar legacy effect can be observed with respect to demand
   for extreme right politics. As we are going to show there is some
   overlap between the share of votes cast for the NF and the BNP, yet
   there are a number of constituencies that do not adhere to this pattern.
   We conclude that while the supply-side legacy effect is not ruled out,
   the legacy effect hypothesis does not find support for demand-side
   explanation of extreme right support.},

Abstract = {The thoughts of the Gramsci, presented a national hegemony understanding
   with his masterpiece The Prison Notebooks, analyzed how capitalist
   system survives despite its deadly serious inner contradictions, was
   adapted to international system by Neo-Gramscian scholars and this new
   interpretation used to determine fundamentals of the global hegemony, as
   well. The contemporary world hegemony, accepted to begun in the 16th
   century with the United Provinces (Holland), and it is alleged that
   passed to the United Kingdom in the 19th century and then to the United
   States following to the Second World War. However, the economic
   recession, triggered by the crisis caused by the end of the bipolar
   world order following the end of the Cold War, peaked with the 2008
   global financial crisis. For this reason, American hegemony began to be
   questioned with a higher voice. In that case, the high growth rate
   provided by market-based reforms after Mao's death in 1976 has played an
   important role in bringing China into the forefront of the US as a major
   economic power since the early 2000s. Above mentioned situation, coupled
   with America's decline, has led to the emergence of rumors that China is
   the new hegemonic power of the world. However, when analyzed from the
   Neo-Gramscian perspective, a state, who could become a hegemon in the
   global level, should have a leading economic system, a socio-cultural
   and political superstructure suitable for this substructure, and a
   network of international organizations, that are fostering these values
   all over the world.},

Abstract = {How do perceived inequalities in allocation impact citizen satisfaction
   with state-distributed benefits in rentier societies? Resource-rich
   rentier regimes are widely theorized to maintain the economic and
   political satisfaction of subjects through wealth distribution. Yet,
   while qualitative research in the rentier states of the Arabian
   Peninsula has identified unequal distribution as a source of discontent,
   the relative importance of objective versus subjective factors in
   shaping satisfaction at the individual level has never been
   systematically evaluated. Here we assess the impacts of inequality on
   the nexus between wealth and satisfaction among citizens of the richest
   rentier regime in the world: the state of Qatar. Using original,
   nationally representative survey data, we test the effects of two
   separate mechanisms of unequal distribution previously identified in the
   literature: group-based discrimination, and variation in individual
   access owing to informal influence. Results show that perceptions of
   both group- and individual-based inequality dampen satisfaction with
   state-distributed benefits, irrespective of objective socioeconomic
   well-being. The findings demonstrate that even in the most affluent of
   rentier states, economic satisfaction derives not only from absolute
   quantities of benefits but also from subjective impressions of fairness
   in the distribution process.},

Abstract = {This research note adds to the emerging body of literature arguing that
   retrospective voting works on the level of political parties - for
   government and opposition parties alike - by investigating the
   generalisability of previous research findings. Furthermore, it tests
   whether there is a knowledge gap in retrospective voting on the party
   level. Using the data of the Icelandic National Election Study (ICENES),
   support is found for the argument that mechanisms of electoral
   accountability work both for incumbent and opposition parties. Second,
   while previous research raised doubts on the electorate's ability to
   hold governments accountable, there is no evidence of a knowledge gap in
   retrospective voting on the party level.},

Abstract = {When autocrats face threats of nonviolent mass mobilization, they are
   likely to respond with repression. However, when will the autocrat
   initiate, step up, or downscale repressive behavior during such protest
   events? We propose that signals of support from great power patrons play
   a pivotal role in emboldening rulers to engage in and intensify
   repressive behavior. To probe this hypothesis, we analyze how supportive
   and nonsupportive actions and statements of the great powers in the
   United Nations Security Council shape the repressive behavior of
   authoritarian regimes during three recent, and similar, cases of protest
   events: Burma 2007, Zimbabwe 2008, and Burkina Faso 2014. The cases show
   that the more unequivocal and consistent patron support for the besieged
   regime is the firmer and more violent are the responses to the domestic
   challengers.},

Abstract = {This article compares the mayoralties of the first two directly elected
   Mayors of London, Ken Livingstone and Boris Johnson. The position offers
   a commanding electoral platform, but few direct powers to lead a city
   widely regarded as `ungovernable' (Travers 2004). The two mayors had
   some obvious points of comparison: both were party rebels, mavericks and
   skilled media operators. Both also used publicity to make up for weak
   powers, but courted controversy and faced charges of corruption and
   cronyism. Utilising Hambleton and Sweeting (2004), this article compares
   their mayoralties in terms of vision, leadership style and policies.
   Livingstone had a powerful vision that translated into clear policy
   aims, while Johnson's time as Mayor was more cautious, shaped by a
   desire for higher office. In terms of style, Livingstone built
   coalitions but proved divisive, whereas Johnson retained remarkable
   levels of popularity. Where Livingstone bought experience and skill,
   Johnson delegated. In policy terms, the two Mayors found themselves
   pushed by their institutional powers towards transport and planning
   while struggling with deeper issues such as housing. Livingstone
   introduced the radical congestion charge and a series of symbolic
   policies. Johnson was far more modest, championing cycling, the 2012
   Olympics and avoiding difficult decisions. The two used their office to
   negotiate, but also challenge, central government. Livingstone' s rebel
   mayoralty was a platform for personalised change, but Johnson's one was
   for personal ambition.},

Abstract = {The concept of social innovation has grown in popularity in policy
   circles as a remedy both to government and market failure. We can
   usefully define social innovation as a new approach to meeting social
   needs by the empowerment of individuals through collaborative actions of
   governments, private enterprises, and civil society actors. The
   emergence of this new approach is best explained as a process of
   translation, by which we mean the movement of concepts across first
   sectoral and then national boundaries. In this process, imported
   elements are combined with existing ones to create new policy
   instruments. We first discuss the development of the social innovation
   approach through the translation of policy elements from the economic to
   the social sector. We then illustrate the further translation of policy
   elements across national borders through two Turkish examples of the use
   of smart cards to deliver social benefits.},

Abstract = {The traditional view according to which we adults tacitly consent to a
   state's lawful actions just by living within its borders-the residence
   theory-is now widely rejected by political philosophers. According to
   the critics, this theory fails because consent must be (i) intentional,
   (ii) informed, and (iii) voluntary, whereas one's continued residence
   within a state is typically none of these things. Few people intend to
   remain within the state in which they find themselves, and few realize
   that by remaining they are consenting to the state's lawful actions.
   Moreover, the various obstacles standing in the way of us leaving the
   state render our remaining involuntary. Thus, the critics conclude, few
   if any people can be considered to have consented through their
   residence. I argue that these objections fail and that the residence
   theory remains a viable option, at least for those who are not committed
   incompatibilists.},

   voting in young and established democracies},
Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL RESEARCH},

Abstract = {Economic prosperity is the best recipe for an incumbent government to be
   re-elected. However, the financial crisis was significantly more
   consequential for governing parties in young rather than in established
   democracies. This article introduces the age of democracy as a
   contextual explanation which moderates the degree to which citizens vote
   retrospectively. It shows a curvilinear effect of the age of democracy
   on retrospective economic voting. In a first stage after the transition
   to democracy, reform governments suffer from a general anti-incumbency
   effect, unrelated to economic performance. In a second step, citizens in
   young democracies relate the legitimacy of democratic actors to their
   economic performance rather than to procedural rules, and connect
   economic outcomes closely to incumbent support. As democracies mature,
   actors profit from a reservoir of legitimacy, and retrospective voting
   declines. Empirically, these hypotheses are corroborated by data on vote
   change and economic performance in 59 democracies worldwide, over 25
   years.},

Abstract = {How have Donald Trump's rhetoric and policies affected Arab and Muslim
   American behavior? We provide evidence that the de facto effects of
   President Trump's campaign rhetoric and vague policy positions extended
   beyond the direct effects of his executive orders. We present findings
   from three data sources-television news coverage, social media activity,
   and a survey-to evaluate whether Arab and Muslim Americans reduced their
   online visibility and retreated from public life. Our results provide
   evidence that they withdrew from public view: (1) Shared locations on
   Twitter dropped approximately 10 to 20\% among users with
   Arabic-sounding names after major campaign and election events and (2)
   Muslim survey respondents reported increased public space avoidance.},

Abstract = {Neo-republicans position James Harrington (1611-1677) as a seminal
   figure in a tradition that asks what set of institutions grant the
   individual freedom from domination. This article argues that the signal
   emphasis on freedom diverts us from the broader question of legitimacy
   motivating Harrington's republicanism. Harrington contends that the
   liberty property confers is a necessary but insufficient condition for
   de jure government. The popular liberty that a broad distribution of
   wealth secures must be supplemented by a Roman concept of authority in
   order for the regime to become legitimate. Republican legitimacy
   requires the marriage of popular power and aristocratic virtue; it
   demands both the wide distribution of property and the integration of
   authority as auctoritas into the political constitution. The elucidation
   of Harrington's dual theory of legitimacy makes it possible to reassess
   the distance separating a republicanism that follows Harrington from a
   liberalism that follows Hobbes.},

Abstract = {The 2014 killing of Michael Brown in Ferguson, MO intensified debates on
   policing in Black and minority communities and served as a major
   catalyst for protest movements such as Black Lives Matter (BLM). We
   assess the degree to which the volume and tone of news media coverage of
   policing and protests changed in the post-Ferguson environment. We also
   examine the impact of this volume and framing of news coverage on the
   legislative activity on policing across all 50 state legislatures.
   Observational analyses from two original data sets yield two key
   observations. First, the initial increase and subsequent decline in news
   media attention devoted to policing post-Ferguson are associated with
   corresponding rises and wanes in the amount of policing legislation
   proposed and passed across state legislatures. Second, the relative
   proportions of news stories framing either the police or protesters
   demanding police reform as legitimate correspond with the amounts of
   state bills working to either enhance police autonomy or increase police
   accountability, respectively. We discuss what these trends imply about
   the capacity of mainstream news media to influence policy responsiveness
   to the demands of protesters.},

Abstract = {This study explores the relationship between people's sexual identities
   and their tendencies to join political protests. When analyzing American
   National Election surveys from 2012 (n = 3813), gays and lesbians were
   more than twice as likely to protest as heterosexuals. To explain the
   increased activism of gays and lesbians, this study applied Patrick
   Egan's theories of political distinctiveness to the ANES data. After
   running a set of hierarchal logistic regressions, the link between
   sexualities and protesting became insignificant when issues of age,
   education levels, friendships circles, group memberships, and political
   ideologies were introduced into regressions. This suggests that gays and
   lesbians protested more often because they are younger, more educated,
   integrated into political networks, and are more likely to notice the
   negative consequences of social inequalities than heterosexuals.},

Abstract = {Are decentralization reforms in dictatorial regimes mere window dressing
   or can they deliver longevity for dictators? Many scholars in political
   science have argued that seemingly democratic institutions established
   in dictatorships play a crucial role in increasing the survival
   potential of the authoritarian regime by providing a channel to the
   dictator to co-opt members of the opposition, identify their bases of
   support and recruit effective coalition members. While most of the
   existing analysis has focused on national elections and political
   parties, we use primary data and social network methodology to analyze
   the 2001 decentralization reforms established during General Musharraf's
   military regime in Pakistan. We show that seemingly democratically
   empowering decentralized governance structures can also be used to
   distribute rents to political supporters through ostensibly legitimate
   channels. Therefore, this paper adds to the literature on institutions
   in dictatorships on two fronts in addition to providing crucial
   information about the political landscape in a strategically important
   country.},

Pages = {314-325},
Abstract = {Domenico Losurdo was convinced of the intrinsically political nature of
   philosophy: political judgment is the test that verifies or falsifies
   even the most complex metaphysics, which have no meaning if they are not
   related to the real world. Losurdo often had to defend himself against
   the accusation of political partisanship. Therefore, he was obliged to
   demonstrate constantly that he had mastered the history of modern and
   contemporary philosophy, together with its main theoretical nodes,
   better than anyone else. Over some 40 years of work, he showed a keen
   interest in classical German philosophy, studying its relationship with
   the French Revolution and altering our conceptions of it forever. He
   turned subsequently to examining liberalism, showing that it is not a
   theory of individual liberties but represents first and foremost the
   self-awareness of the ``free{''} community who perceive themselves as
   ``well-born,{''} that is, as aristocrats. Finally, he dedicated himself
   to the reconstruction of Marxism and historical materialism, starting
   from a redefinition of the concept of class struggle and undertaking a
   revaluation of ``Eastern Marxism,{''} linked to the anti-colonial
   struggle, in relation to ``Western Marxism.{''} His death leaves us
   poorer but the conceptual tools he forged will help us to continue his
   work.},

Abstract = {This article explores the efficacy of specifications grading in
   undergraduate political science classes. Specifications grading
   organizes instruction around a set of learning objectives and evaluates
   student success based on the achievement of carefully articulated
   specifications for each assessment. Assessments are considered
   satisfactory or unsatisfactory and final grades are determined based on
   satisfactory completion of groups (bundles) of assignments, with a
   bundle linked to each letter grade. The are several advantages to this
   system: (1) it allows students to be strategic in the work they choose
   to complete; (2) it allows students to know where they stand without
   having to calculate weighted averages; and (3) it facilitates more
   efficient and reliable grading. In this essay, we provide an overview of
   this technique, reflections on how it works in practice, and what we
   consider to be best practices for implementation in political science.},

Volume = {51},

Abstract = {Although there is a substantial literature on the causes and
   consequences of the initiation of primary elections in the United
   States, there is little documentation of changes in primaries after the
   1920s, and most research on the subject typically argues that political
   parties reasserted control over the candidate nomination process through
   changes to primary rules. In this article, I seek to make two
   contributions. First, I catalog and categorize changes in primary laws
   between 1928 and 1970. Second, I evaluate claims about why primary laws
   changed. I find no evidence that there was a consistent effort to
   increase party control over primaries. Rather, the states that had been
   most likely to experiment with primaries in the early decades of the
   twentieth century continued to do so in later decades, and these
   experiments were often driven by defects in existing laws or by changes
   in two-party competition. However, parties did adapt primaries to their
   ends.},

Abstract = {In his mature systematic writings, Karl Marx pointedly restricted the
   discussion of individuals as such. Instead of discussing individual
   characters, motivations, or desires, Marx treats people as `carriers'
   (Trager) of social relations. This essay contrasts this functional or
   structural approach to the Romantic socialism of Pierre Leroux, who
   conceptualized the individual in the symbolic terms defined by Romantic
   aesthetics. Though Marx's reduction of individuals to their social
   function played a valuable role in the development of his analysis of
   political economy, it has produced controversy across many decades and
   presented problems for the political project defined by Marxism. The
   Romantic conception of a symbolic intersection between the individual
   and society does not present a fully satisfying alternative to Marx, but
   this essay argues that it provides an important corrective to the
   conception of persons as carriers of social relations.},

   Polish Political Parties: Communicational and Organizational Potential},
Journal = {POLITOLOGICKY CASOPIS-CZECH JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE},

Abstract = {Despite the decrease in membership in European political parties,
   members still have an important role to play. In this paper we introduce
   the concept of high-quality membership (HQM) and show the organizational
   and communication potential of party grassroots. We distinguished
   factors to be taken into account in order to build the concept of party
   HQM. Only then is the organizational and communication potential of
   party membership able to be maximized. We argue that high-quality
   membership is valuable for parties because it helps them to establish
   and maintain links with voters, who then elect representatives into
   local, regional, and national governments; members help to collect
   information, understand problems and seek solutions important to local
   communities and to society in general; finally, HQM helps to improve the
   image of the party in society.
   The questions we raise in this article do not concentrate entirely on
   the above functions of party members since we advance that if a party
   would like to benefit from high-quality membership it must first obtain
   basic knowledge about its members, their needs, expectations and
   judgements. Therefore, in this article we discuss what kind of knowledge
   is necessary for parties to achieve the goal of HQM, and how the role of
   members is now understood and assessed by party leaders.},

Title = {Democratic Responsiveness: Different Approaches to a Concept with Ample
   Potential},
Journal = {POLITICA Y GOBIERNO},

Volume = {26},

Pages = {237-259},
Abstract = {After the transitional processes ended, new democracies faced challenges
   regarding the consolidation of political institutions and processes.
   This opened a pathway for a new research agenda: the quality of
   democracy. These studies re-opened the debate around a key concept in
   Political Science: responsiveness, which refers to a government's
   capacity to attend or respond to its citizens' needs or preferences.
   However, there are different theoretical approaches to this concept
   beyond the democratic quality research agenda. Based on this, this
   essay's main objective is to offer the reader a broad, complete and
   clear picture of the different analytical perspectives around the idea
   of government responsiveness. Additionally, a discussion about the
   relation of the concept of responsiveness with other close concepts that
   might be confused with, such as representation, accountability and
   responsibility is presented. Finally, the essay offers a review of the
   different ways responsiveness has been measured and analyzed empirically
   and also some reflections around the limitations of the concept.},

Abstract = {One of the important drivers of change within contemporary global civil
   society is the growing power and influence of private philanthropic
   foundations (PPFs). To illustrate this argument, this article considers
   the cases of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation (BMGF) and the Open
   Society Foundations (OSF), the largest and fourth largest PPFs in the
   world today by wealth or assets, and, especially, their founders. The
   article considers their influence within global civil society, within
   the context of international development, and the consequences of their
   activities for a range of international actors. This is done in the
   context of debate within the literature on the activities of PPFs, in
   which the articles sides with advocates of critical scrutiny. In
   developing its argument, the article draws on a range of sources
   including the financial statements and audited accounts of PPFs, of
   other non-governmental organizations and of selected inter-governmental
   organizations. It is argued that the BMGF and OSF are engines of
   neoliberalism and potent symbols of a second distinct `gilded age' and
   that their influence must be restrained through anti-trust measures and
   through greater taxation and regulation.},

Abstract = {Since the Nineties the crisis of traditional political families has
   become particularly intense in the democracies of Southern Europe, with
   an increase in electoral volatility, the contraction of party
   membership, and crises of confidence as well as of electoral consensus.
   In these democracies, alongside the traditional parties of the twentieth
   century, a generation of new political parties was born that reject the
   right/left division, politicizing a new cleavage between the low and the
   high of society, or - better - between the people and the elite. In
   Spain and Italy, the anti-political-establishment supply side is
   provided expecially by two new movement-parties, Podemos and the Five
   Star Movement. This article focuses on the comparison between these two
   new political parties, highlighting differences and analogies in terms
   of policy, identity, and organization. The research hypothesis developed
   in this paper refers to the different form and identity in which
   populism is expressed in the two national cases. From the methodological
   point of view, the comparison between the two parties will be conducted
   through the analysis of the text of the electoral programs of the two
   different political organizations in the European elections in the
   period running from 2014 to 2017.},

Abstract = {Keith Dear argues that AI will change decision-making in the defence and
   security arena in four principal ways. First, by enabling `cognitive
   manoeuvre' the use of predictive analytics to enable much earlier
   intervention. Second, by forcing humans to take themselves `out of the
   loop' for decision-making by out-performing them in an increasing number
   of domains. Third, by providing advice that is correct, but difficult to
   explain. Fourth, in the short term, by driving unprecedented rigour into
   decision-making processes, forcing decision-makers to be much more
   explicit about the mental models on which they are basing decisions, to
   enable comparison with automated analytics.},

Abstract = {This work explores how the environmental issue related to the expansion
   of natural resources' extractive sectors in Argentina was socially
   shaped over the last decades. To achieve the objective, it analyzes the
   ``territorial interpretative frames{''} of environmentalist action in
   three sectors and provides an explanation based on the social coalitions
   of the mobilization. The work shows that shared opposition to extractive
   activities did not translate into a same framing of the issue, and that
   the presence or absence of capitalized economic actors in the coalition
   or in the territory of mobilization has been a key factor in the setting
   of different frames of meaning.},

Abstract = {The long interim period of the Spanish Government in 2016 and the
   weakness of the Government finally installed, coupled with a highly
   fragmented Chamber of Deputies and the absence of a solid parliamentary
   majority, contributed to the emergence of a series of novel
   constitutional scenarios. The most significant of these was the rupture
   of the traditionally cooperative relationship between the Government and
   the Parliament, as shown by the three conflicts of powers that were
   brought before the Constitutional Court. The first was filed by the
   Congress against a Government it considered could not, absent its
   investiture, be subjected to parliamentary control. Others were filed by
   the Government against the Congress for processing legislative
   initiatives that violated its exclusive competence ex Article 134.6 CE,
   to veto parliamentary initiatives with budgetary impact. In this
   article, we study this second conflict, by first analyzing the legal
   configuration of the law of budgets, before continuing with the meaning
   and nature of the budget veto, issues of constitutional jurisprudence
   and the reforms proposed. We do this in order to propose a reform of the
   veto consistent with how it was envisioned in the Constitution, as an
   instrument for the Government's function of direction and policy
   orientation and not as discretionary brake at the disposal of the
   Parliament.},

Abstract = {Cybersecurity is coming to the forefront of the concerns of nations,
   organizations and individuals. Government agencies, banking systems and
   businesses have been crippled by criminal and malicious cyberattacks.
   There are many examples of cyberattacks in regions of tensions and armed
   conflict. There are no impartial international means to investigate the
   claims and counter-claims about cyberattacks. The international
   community more broadly lacks a way to deal with cyberattacks in a
   concerted manner. A new approach and capability should be considered for
   certain circumstances: cyberpeacekeeping. Peacekeeping has proven
   effective in physical space, and many of the same principles and methods
   could also be applied in cyberspace, with some adjustments. It could
   help prevent global attacks, and if an attack were to be successful, it
   could assist with recovery and conduct impartial investigations to
   uncover the perpetrators. The possibilities of a cyberpeacekeeping team
   at the United Nations to make cyberspace more secure are well worth
   exploring.},

Abstract = {If the government's adoption of computers represents the beginning of

   1970s. Through more than 30 years of construction and development since,
   China has made significant achievements and accumulated valuable
   experience in E-governance sand has begun to pave the way for
   E-governance construction suited to China's national conditions. With
   government information technology as the incision point and major
   government-funded projects as links, promoting the adoption of
   information technology in the national economy and society has been the
   key to the success of Chinese E-governance. In general, Chinese
   E-governance construction has undergone five phases of development: (1)
   the pilot phase characterized by data processing (1973-1983); (2) the
   vertical construction phase characterized by information management
   (1983-1993); (3) the beginning of key transaction systems characterized
   by transaction processing (1993-2000); (4) the comprehensive promotion
   phase characterized by E-governance guiding national information
   technology development (2000-2006); and (5) the deep application phase
   characterized by a service orientation (2006 onward). Corresponding
   achievements in E-governance have been made and valuable experience

Abstract = {Contemporary far-right politicians increasingly diffuse messages through
   social networks. This article argues that online communication may prove
   effective for political engagement because it can create emotional
   reactions against certain groups, in a process that I call ``emotional
   antagonism.{''} An example of emotional antagonism is online
   Islamophobia, which considers Islam as supposedly incompatible with
   democratic values and tends to conflate Muslims with migrants. Through
   qualitative observations and textual analyses of tweets, this article
   explores the following questions: How do certain online exchanges
   emotionally frame Muslims as the social ``others{''} in relation to
   European culture? Why and how does the Internet facilitate the spread of
   emotional antagonism? What type of political propaganda and
   participation is connected to affective online Islamophobia? The article
   analyses two case studies: 1) Islamophobic tweets sent in the aftermath
   of the British referendum in 2016, with the hashtag \#Brexit; 2)
   Anti-Muslim tweets that contain the hashtag \#chiudiamoiporti (close the
   ports), launched by Italian Vice Prime Minister Matteo Salvini in 2018
   to support anti-migration measures. The article shows that exploring
   emotional antagonism can add complexity to the current understanding of
   Islamophobic conflicts, of social media platforms' characteristics, and
   of political participation based on online communication.},

Abstract = {Drawing on qualitative fieldwork with differen key actors in Geneva,
   Switzerland, I apply procedural justice theory to the governance of
   prostitution. My findings show that the vice squad is ill-equipped to
   protect sex workers from violence and exploitation because their
   everyday practices during interactions with sex workers, aimed at
   creating trust, rely on affect alone. Conversely, the community RLD unit
   utilizes both fair treatment and a transparent decision-making process
   which successfully creates trust relationships with sex workers,
   increasing their willingness to report incidents of violence and
   exploitation. This has important implications for prostitution policy
   aimed at improving sex workers' safety.},

Abstract = {This paper exposes the controls to the Public Administration in Colombia
   and differentiates controls to the Participative Budgeting (from now on
   PP) in Medellin, making special emphasis on the social control exercised
   over this mechanism of participation which involves decisions taking and
   management of public resources. The investigation where this paper came
   from, proposed as hypothesis that the controls system, that rules the PP
   Budgeting in Medellin from 2012 to 2017, has presented failures
   regarding its implementation. This has influenced the control to be less
   effective during the delimited period. Within the conclusions, it is
   noted that specifically with reference to the social control, it is
   featuring problems related with the acquaintance of the citizenship
   towards the PP, the absence of accountability targeting the PP and the
   lack of citizen participation. All of which has led to having a weak
   social control of the PP during the study period.},

   Benefits},

Volume = {14},

Pages = {259-291},
Abstract = {This paper provides a novel test of the link from electoral rules to
   economic policies. We focus on unemployment benefits because their
   classification as a broad or targeted transfer may vary over time and
   across countries according to the geographical dispersion of unemployed
   citizens, the main beneficiaries of the program. A simple theoretical
   model delivers unambiguous predictions on the interaction between
   electoral institutions and the unemployment rate in contestable and safe
   districts. Due to electoral incentives, the difference in the
   unemployment generosity between majoritarian and proportional systems
   depends on the difference in the unemployment rate between contestable
   and safe districts. We test this prediction using a novel dataset with
   information on electoral competitiveness and unemployment rates at
   district level, and different measures of unemployment benefit
   generosity for 16 OECD countries between 1980 and 2011. The empirical
   analysis strongly supports the theoretical predictions.},

Abstract = {Human identity is not static but dynamic. It depends on somatic and
   cognitive development, culture and society. Human identity is now
   extending to cyberspace of digital media. According to Turkle,
   cyberspace acts as a mirror in which one can get to know one another.
   However, virtual identity is not entirely virtual because it is
   continually linked to real identity through cognitive functions and
   abilities. The author focuses on two risks of expanding identity in
   cyberspace of digital media, which are cybersex and narcissism.
   Narcissism and cybersex are two risks that currently endanger especially
   children and adolescents. Therefore society should pay particular
   attention to education. Media education, with special emphasis on
   critical thinking, is a necessity.},

Journal = {POLITIX},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {32},

Pages = {31-58},
Abstract = {The concept of civility has become a highly polarizing one, from both an
   academic and an ideological perspective. While some view it as a
   paradise lost, to others it is but a booby-trapped watchword, a
   law-and-order device, reactionary by nature. This situation warrants a
   genealogical approach if one is to shed light on how this binary
   opposition has been allowed to prevail. This article shows how the rise
   of incivility as a public issue in France from the 1990s has contributed
   to splitting the study of civility and incivility into two separate
   domains, setting up the debate on civility as an ideological struggle
   centered on the question of order, in which civility is placed on the
   side of reactionary thinking. It will be shown that ethnographic
   surveying of civil interactions calls for us to move beyond this binary
   perspective, ultimately considering civility as a dynamic activity
   aiming to fine-tune public behavior, where the relationship of
   conventions to an ordinary sense of fairness is critically assessed and
   subjected to an iterative survey by city-dwellers, as opposed to being
   blindly applied or rejected.},

Abstract = {The aim of this article is to enrich the concept of national identity by
   employing the concept of habitus proposed by Pierre Bourdieu to
   establish a dialog between aspects of identity construction from above
   and its acceptance or rejection from below by national subjects. Taking
   the case of Quebec and the study of individual trajectories as a
   starting point, a debate is conducted amongst the proposals of the
   different levels of government, the political parties and civil society
   organizations, and compared with the identitarian transformations of the
   interviewees. The article concludes with the evidence of the differences
   between the proposed identity and the national habitus and suggests some
   of the reasons for these transformations.},

   Non-Response: A Randomized Experiment Assigning Mode of Interview},
Journal = {POLITICAL SCIENCE RESEARCH AND METHODS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {7},
Number = {1},

Abstract = {Technology and the decreased cost of survey research have made it
   possible for researchers to collect data using new and varied modes of
   interview. These data are often analyzed as if they were generated using
   similar processes, but the modes of interview may produce differences in
   response simply due to the presence or absence of an interviewer. In
   this paper, we explore the differences in item non-response that result
   from different modes of interview and find that mode makes a difference.
   The data are from an experiment in which we randomly assigned an adult
   population to an in-person or self-completed survey after subjects
   agreed to participate in a short poll. For nearly every topic and format
   of question, we find less item non-response in the self-complete mode.
   Furthermore, we find the difference across modes in non-response is
   exacerbated for respondents with low levels of cognitive abilities.
   Moving from high to low levels of cognitive ability, an otherwise
   average respondent can be up to six times more likely to say ``don't
   know{''} in a face-to-face interview than in a self-completed survey,
   depending on the type of question.},

Title = {Democratic demand and supply: a spatial model approach to satisfaction
   with democracy},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ELECTIONS PUBLIC OPINION AND PARTIES},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {29},
Number = {3},
Pages = {381-401},
Abstract = {Satisfaction with democracy (SWD) is a commonly used indicator, and its
   determinants have been analysed extensively. But what does
   dissatisfaction with democracy substantially mean? This paper tests if
   satisfaction is actually a coherent consequence of citizens considering
   democratic supply and demand. It starts from the simple idea that
   satisfaction can be explained by the distance between what ``should
   be{''} and what ``is{''}; between democratic expectations and reality. I
   capture this idea in a spatial model of democratic support, where size
   and direction of the gap between citizens' expectations and evaluations
   of democracy determine levels of satisfaction. I use data for 26
   countries from the European Social Survey. Taking into account both
   expectation-surplus and evaluations-surplus gaps, I find that
   satisfaction is affected by both the size and the direction of the
   distance between expectations and evaluations. The main finding is that
   liberal criteria of democratic quality are generally agreed upon amongst
   citizens, and that a perceived lack of their realization is the
   strongest predictor of dissatisfaction. Democratic input dimensions like
   direct participation and output criteria like social justice are more
   disputed, and create dissatisfaction amongst those wanting more of them
   as well as those wanting less.},

Abstract = {This article analyzes two versions of memory constructed upon forced
   displacement due to the armed conflict in Colombia: the official
   versions and the reserved versions of the victims. It is based on
   doctoral research results carried out from 2012 to 2016, with people
   displaced by the armed conflict at the end of the last century, who came
   to inhabit urban settlements in the periphery of the city of Medellin.
   These people now define themselves as new nomads and chameleonic
   subjects, weavers of interrupted coexistence forms, ephemeral but
   intense, with random encounters or in moments of necessary connection
   for their survival. The memory of these strange ways of being and
   traveling through the city is the basis for suggesting memory policies
   that contribute to repair damage, to question modern planning of the
   established city and to propose cities which include the ways of living
   recreated by the displaced. These spaces should coincide with the
   spatio-temporal changes of the 21st century, the century of the decline
   of certainties.},

Abstract = {The 2016 US Presidential election was unique for many reasons,
   especially the widespread endorsement of falsehoods about the candidates
   and the electoral process. Using a unique experiment fielded the week
   prior to the election, we examine whether correcting information can
   overcome misperceptions about election fraud. We find that providing
   counter information is generally ineffective at remedying misperceptions
   and can, depending on the source, increase endorsements of
   misperceptions among Republicans. Although information from a
   fact-checking source is generally unconvincing, when given with evidence
   from an unlikely source - in our experiment, Breitbart News - both
   Republicans and Democrats decrease beliefs in voter fraud.},

Abstract = {In this collaborative inquiry, we - Felix, a Grade 11 student; Tim, a
   high school social studies teacher; and Michelle, a literacy education
   professor - explore civic engagement and the politics of literacy in the
   classroom as developing practices f or engaging in sociopolitical
   issues. We consider the ``means and mechanisms{''} by which students in
   a Grade 11 Canadian History class were invited to ``scrutinize the
   values and priorities{''} of Indigenous peoples and European explorers
   in Nouvelle-France, and to come to a deeper understanding of exploration
   and settlement in relationship to exploitation and colonization. We
   share how it happened that negotiating a written assignment to produce a
   piece of visual art allowed Felix to create a personal and political
   expression of the important concepts of the unit, demonstrating that a
   wider range of civic engagement and literacy practices have an important
   place in the classroom. In the process, we highlight tensions in
   multiliteracies pedagogies and wonder at the assemblage created by Felix
   :s literacy artifact. Together, we are inspired to consider the kinds of
   critical and creative expressions that an art piece and its entangled
   practices, connecting texts, inspirations, and ideas produce, and the
   engaged sociocultural, political and historical inquiry that can emerge
   when the curriculum is learned in relation to becoming an artist,
   student and activist.},

   His work has not been translated into Hebrew, and only a few people read
   his books in Israel. It was a light-hearted attitude to life and a poem
   by Brodsky that turned the former physicist into a writer. Today, he
   earns his living as a radiologist. Another square root will have to

Abstract = {This article traces certain conceptual elements inherent to the
   psychoanalytic notion of mass psychology in two of the most important
   works of Niccolo Machiavelli (1469-1527): The Prince and the Discourses
   on the First Decade of Titus Livy. It is possible to find in the works
   of this Florentine a psychological theory that offers an expression of
   human desires and affections. The author bases this form of thought on
   acute empirical observation and knowledge of the past. Machiavelli
   analyzes the city as a locus of conflicting desires: the desire of the
   people not to be oppressed versus the unlimited ambition of the nobles.
   It is possible to find incipient elements typical of mass psychology
   developed later by Freudian psychoanalysis in Machiavelli's account of
   conflicting desires, but above all in the relationship between the
   prince, the nobles and the people, as well as in the characterization of
   the latter.},

Title = {ON METHODS OF ESTIMATING CURRENT CONDITION AND OF FORECASTING SOCIAL
   INSTABILITY IN CENTRAL ASIA},
Journal = {POLIS-POLITICHESKIYE ISSLEDOVANIYA},
Year = {2019},
Number = {2},
Pages = {59-78},
Abstract = {This paper examines sustainability factors of political regimes in
   Central Asia after the Arab Spring. According to the contemporary
   political notion, Central Asia consists of five states, viz. Kazakhstan,
   Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, and Turkmenistan. The countries of
   Central Asia have a number of similarities with the states of the Arab
   world, which became the epicenter of revolutionary movements after 2011.
   These characteristics are - a high share of the youth population, social
   inequality and fragmentation, poor quality of state governance,
   geographical proximity to instability areas (Afghanistan, the Middle
   East), etc. Thus, many experts expected that the wave of revolutions
   would come to Central Asia. However, political regimes in the region
   have managed to keep stability. The research tests (de)stabilization
   factors by means of regression analysis. The core of the model includes
   analytical tools applied for the Arab Spring events. Five key factors
   are used: 1) extent of society and elite fragmentation 2) share of
   marginal groups in the population (jobless youth) 3) type of a political
   system 4) existence / lack of the large-scale conflicts in the recent
   past 5) extent of international actors' intervention into Central Asia
   home affairs. As a result, it was revealed that stability in the Central
   Asian region is provided, first of all, with low concentration of the
   marginal youth in the big cities as a considerable part of youngsters
   are the labor migrants who works abroad. The type of political system is
   an important factor too. As well as in the Arab world, the Central Asian
   autocracies and imitation democracies are exposed to socio-political
   destabilization more than monarchies or consolidated democracies. The
   situation becomes complicated as Central Asian political regimes have
   lack of procedures to transfer political power. Democratic institutions
   are poorly developed and distorted there. Moreover, state leaders have
   to face a vague choice to select successors. In addition, stability was
   affected by consolidation of elite around current leaders who subdued
   ethnic or clan loyalty in favor of personal loyalty to them. At the same
   time, fragmentation strengthening can considerably increase probability
   of inner conflict and further destabilization. We found out that
   Tajikistan and Uzbekistan have the largest potential for
   destabilization. Kyrgyzstan and Turkmenistan, on the contrary,
   neutralize the arising prerequisites to tension strengthening within the
   country. Basing on regression modeling, we compared Central Asia states
   with Arab ones. By the moment, any of Central Asia states has not
   reached the level of potential instability at which Arab Spring
   revolutions began. Nevertheless, dynamics of recent years indicates
   growing probability of protest movements in next years.},

Abstract = {This paper presents a case study of Polish American Christmas events in
   Toledo, Ohio in 2013 through interviews and participant-observation
   ethnographic research.(1) It also briefly examines the history of the
   Polish American presence in Toledo, as well as the challenges the
   community faces now that its members no longer live in geographically
   concentrated neighborhoods. Despite the changing tastes of Toledoans
   both of Polish origin and other backgrounds, as well as controversies
   surrounding some Polish American events, a noticeable Polish American
   presence remains in the city and region, and is especially active around
   Christmas time.},

Abstract = {In this article we recover the classical anarchist deployment of
   republican tropes of non-domination, tyranny and slavery, to expose the
   conservative limits of the contemporary neo-Roman republican revival.
   For the anarchists, the modern nation state and the institution of
   private property are antithetical to freedom as non-domination, acting
   as structural constraints to freedom rather than the means for its
   realisation. We re-examine the grounds of this critique to advance two
   arguments. First, that a commitment to either the state or private
   property represents an unwarranted positive moral and ethical commitment
   that skews the negative theory of freedom contemporary republicans seek
   to develop. Second, the prior moral commitment to the state renders
   neo-Roman republicanism fundamentally conservative. Anarchist theories
   of freedom as non-domination push much further than the contemporary
   republican revival seems to permit, opening new possibilities for
   institutional and constitutional innovation while remaining consistent
   with the core republican normative value of non-domination.},

Abstract = {This article proposes to analyse the Integration Right as a possible
   successor of the traditional State project, with the emergence of a new
   political paradigm, which is cooperative, transnational and regulator.
   To that end, the research problem revolves around the following
   question: in what way the integration schemes can be seen as a new
   paradigm of the State, replacing the old project with a new one of
   transnational cooperation? Using the dialectical method, the general
   objective is related to the study of integration schemes with the focus
   on a new paradigm of State theory, presenting as specific objectives:
   (1) to make an analysis of modernity and changes in the structure of the
   State; (2) to describe existing integration schemes with a view in
   particular to the European Union; (3) to point out the possibilities of
   a new paradigm of State model, specifically a cooperative, transnational
   and regulator State arising from the evolution of integration schemes.},

Abstract = {A review of the collective monograph ``Armed forces in the Modern
   East{''} edited by D.V. Streltsov discusses the role of the armed forces
   in the socio-political development of the eastern states. The authors of
   the monograph focus on the legal status of the armed forces, its role in
   providing security, its participation in political and economic
   processes, as well on the relationship between the army and society, and
   important issues of the armed forces reforms. According to the authors
   of the book, the study of the role of the armed forces in the eastern
   states policy did not lose its relevance for many years. This role has
   deep roots in the history of the formation of statehood, the
   peculiarities of political processes in the Afro-Asian world,
   modernization processes, which were objectively related to the active
   role of the armed forces. The authors pay special attention to
   civil-military relations, which vary widely depending on the specific
   conditions in the eastern states studied: Egypt, Israel, Turkey,
   Pakistan, India, Myanmar, Thailand, Indonesia, China, North Korea, and
   Japan. The authors show that the periods of increasing the role of the
   military in political and economic processes had not only negative, but
   also positive aspects. The armed forces often acted as guarantors of the
   statehood during crises and served as a support in carrying out social
   and economic reforms. The authors conclude that due to the high
   potential of conflict in the East, the influence of the military will
   remain high in most states, although not necessarily in direct form. At
   the same time, in many cases, certain mechanisms of checks and balances
   have been created, preventing immoderate influence of the military.
   Thus, societies to a certain extent adapted to the historically high
   role of the military.},

Abstract = {This article presents a contextual discourse on the communal conflict in
   Nigeria, using the Ife-Modakeke crisis as a case study. It
   conceptualises the key terms to understand the dynamics of communal
   conflict and its peacemaking processes vis-a-vis government as an
   institutional mediator. It reviews existing studies on communal conflict
   resolution and empirical underlying assumptions. It argues that
   peacemaking processes demand serious attention of government in a
   non-partisan mediation perspective. It x-rays the possible roles of
   government in peacemaking processes as well as its commitment problems.
   In concretising government efficacy, adaptable peacemaking principles
   are discussed for communal conflict resolution within the sociopolitical
   space of Nigeria and beyond. The paper concludes that governments can
   play a significant role in communal peacemaking, and recommends a few
   valuable principles.},

Abstract = {This paper investigates Hannah Arendt's writings on tragic
   unreconciliation and pariah humour as offering creative strategies for
   confronting the deadening of emotion that enables people to become
   reconciled to what they should refuse or resist. She offers a
   distinctive contribution to debates on reconciliation and justice, I
   suggest, by articulating a tragic approach to unreconciliation. Yet
   Arendt recognised that tragic accounts of violence can reinforce denial
   and resignation. In writings on the `hidden tradition' of the `Jew as
   pariah,' Arendt suggests that humour can be an important response to
   tragic accounts of political violence and a strategy for awakening an
   emotional response in those who cannot perceive tragedies to which they
   have become reconciled. As arts of refusal, tragic unreconciliation and
   pariah humour invoke and subvert the tragic imagination to reveal
   possibilities for solidarity, responsibility, and transformation that
   challenge problematic forms of reconciliation - reconciliation to one's
   role as a participant in, or bystander to abuse, reconciliation as
   self-abnegating assimilation, and reconciliation as compromise,
   scapegoating, or denial.},

Abstract = {In several of her writings Hannah Arendt claimed to have found the real
   political philosophy of Kant in a so apparently disconnected work from
   this field as was the Critique of Judgment. Inadvertently Kant would
   have opened inadvertently a new horizon for current politics and moral;
   fields which, since they are performed together with others, demand to
   represent others in our judgments. With this article I will try to
   present briefly the political reading that Arendt draws from Kantian
   thought, the development that she makes from it and its significance in
   contemporary political theory.},

Abstract = {In her 1906 booklet, ``The Mass Strike, the Political Party, and the
   Trade Unions,{''} Rosa Luxemburg described her basic concept of
   democracy and emphasized the importance of spontaneity in proletarian
   mass movements. According to Luxemburg, socialist party leaders should
   accept and support the spontaneity of the workers, as it would result in
   an increase in readiness for action and creativity on the part of the
   masses; it would also strengthen labor organizations. The strong
   connection between spontaneity and creativity in the proletarian mass
   movements is also found in other of Luxemburg's works, such as ``The
   Crisis of Social Democracy{''} (1915), her unfinished manuscript on
   ``The Russian Revolution{''} (September/October 1918) and the
   ``Spartacus Program{''} (December 1918). Analyzing the anti-war mass
   movements in Germany from 1916 until 1918, we can see that Luxemburg's
   concept of the close connection between spontaneity and creativity
   became reality, especially during Germany's successful November
   Revolution in 1918.},

Abstract = {In July 2018, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador (AMLO) was elected President
   of Mexico in the largest electoral landslide in Mexico's democratic
   history. As a self-proclaimed transformational candidate, AMLO made big
   promises in areas of great concern for Mexican citizens:
   anti-corruption, criminal violence and security, and the economy.
   Support for AMLO remained extremely strong in 2018; however, to retain
   that support he will need to make concrete progress in these areas. AMLO
   and his party coalition face formidable challenges, not the least of
   which are high expectations from citizens bent on major changes in
   governance and policy outcomes. Critics are concerned about a united
   executive and legislative coalition unchecked by countervailing powers,
   threatening a potential return to the presiden-cialismo of the twentieth
   century.},

Abstract = {The author draws attention to the fact that the status and prospects: of
   the world energy market are extremely important for such a leading
   ``player{''} as China. The conditions of the market affects alignmeat of
   priorities in the country's own development model, as well as
   ``hierarchy{''} of external suppliers of hydrocarbons, and the intensity
   of cooperation with them.
   It is predicted that in the XXI century, despite rapid growth of the
   renewable energy sector, gas consumption will grow most rapidly.
   The article emphasizes that the leading strategic priority of China's
   modern energy policy is the accelerated gasification of the country.
   Moreover, at the current stage of development, China is inclined to
   choose such national energy strategy that will provide for a more
   complete self-sufficiency in energy resources. China has decided to bet
   on the natural gas. And China's state authorities are making significant
   efforts to increase domestic production and rise natural gas imports as
   well.
   At the same time, the status of China's gas market due to historical
   circumstances (namely the high-inertia transition from coal to gas)
   should still be characterized as non-systemic and low-competitive. The
   author emphasizes that the problem of efficient use of gas is aggravated
   by the emerging irrational ratio of final gas and coal prices among
   consumers.
   The article proves that among the determining: directions of China's new
   state policy in the energy sector, a very important role will he played
   by further improvement of gas pricing both in terms of domestic pricing
   and price competition between gas exporters.
   It is recognized that the mechanism of natural gas pricing in the
   Chinese market is still far from perfect. The lack of transparency and,
   at the same time, the unpredictability of how these prices are
   determined complicate investment decisions by both producers and, in
   many cases, by industrial gas consumers too.
   It is noted that the most important role will be played by rethinking
   the role of State regulation in the pricing policy of the fuel and
   energy complex of the country and overcoming the challenges of the
   current system of natural gas pricing.
   It is concluded that the issues of pricing in the domestic gas market
   are among the most pressing for the industry, and the current pricing
   mechanism needs to be reformed in the direction of strengthening the
   role of market forces.},

Abstract = {The article is devoted to the study of the ``soft power{''} of Russia in
   the near abroad in comparison with the ``normative power{''} of the
   European Union. The work consists of two parts. The first section is
   devoted to the categorical understanding of the concept of ``soft
   power{''}. Much attention is paid to the resources producing
   ``attractiveness{''}. It is shown that there are no universal components
   of ``soft power{''}. The second part of the paper deals with the
   ``soft{''} component of Russian foreign policy in the post-Soviet space.
   In academic and expert circles, there is an opinion that Russia's ``soft
   power{''} is poorly developed (in comparison with European countries).
   The article shows that this thesis is not correct: Russian foreign
   policy norms and principles in the eyes of the majority of post-Soviet
   States look more attractive than the European Union.},

Abstract = {This article analyses a panoramic spectrum of methodological approaches
   to the study of political processes and political reality, reacting to
   the publication of the Handbook ``Modern Political Science:
   Methodology{''} that incorporates chapters prepared by the thirty three
   leading Russian political scientists. The authors observe a gradual, but
   more and more decisive, retreat from the formerly dominating principles
   190 of the Marxist methodological paradigm in modem Russian political
   science. Directions, and the scale of application and implementation
   within the political science in modem Russia of key methodological
   paradigms of world political science, include: positivism, behaviorism,
   structuralism., system analysis, constructivism, etc. A conclusion is
   made regarding the ``mosaic{''} or composite character of methodological
   grounds of most of Russian political science schools and books, and the
   almost complete absence of ``pure{''} methodological lines. The article
   leads the reader towards the conclusion that political science in Russia
   is reaching not quite methodological maturity and unity, but at least
   wide methodological pluralism, enabling researchers to apply in their
   studies all main worldly spread methodological achievements and
   paradigms.},

Abstract = {In this article I argue that it is important to find a language to
   describe youth engagement practices in informal settings. I argue that
   many young people do not have the resources to be heard on visible
   platforms. but their work, and meaning making practices might provide
   important information about their ideas and relay key concepts about how
   communicational practices are constructed. Drawing on embedded,
   ethnographic and artistically informed projects with young people in
   communities, I argue for a deeper kind of listening. Artistic forms such
   as poetry, visual art, dance and music are important modes of
   engagement. I draw on cultural practice theory together with theory from
   new literacy studies and media studies to explore four questions:
   How do you craft what you know?
   How do you speak/make what you feel?
   How do you transform practice?
   How do you articulate action?
   I see these as components of the process of producing relationally
   oriented modes of address that others can also engage with. Taken
   together, they suggest a language of description for the mode that is
   civic engagement communicational practice, that is, oriented beyond
   individual experience but drawing from experience to make change happen
   in relational ways.},

Abstract = {Biographical data of terrorists and overlapping theories indicate that
   ostracism has the power to promote a terroristic mindset. This effect,
   however, has not been investigated empirically so far. The current
   studies aimed to fill this research gap and test this relationship
   experimentally. Inclusionary status was manipulated in an online and a
   lab study. To assess how far participants would go on behalf of a
   terrorist group, participants were introduced to a pro-democracy and
   animal protection terrorist organization, and asked for their degree of
   agreement to their actions. Study 1 showed that ostracized participants
   always favored more extreme options to support a terrorist group
   compared to participants in an inclusion or a neutral control condition,
   which grew from non-violent means to property damage. In Study 2,
   ostracism increased the willingness to destroy property on behalf of a
   terrorist group. Indicating an underlying mechanism, this effect was
   mediated by a low sense of control. The findings are consistent with
   theoretical and empirical work of both ostracism and terrorism research,
   and provide one of few pieces of experimental work to illustrate a root
   of radicalization.},

   doctrine of sovereignty to sovereign funds. Based on the review of
   activities of sovereign funds of such large countries as, e.g., the
   People's Republic of China, available investment arbitration rulings,
   the article focuses on the obstacles preventing the application of
   traditional doctrine of sovereignty to multi-faceted legal status of
   sovereign funds and specific features of use of the concepts of absolute
   and functional immunity when enforcing the court judgments and arbitral
   awards against the sovereign funds. Following the analysis, the
   conclusion is drawn that there is currently a serious gap in
   international law re: sovereign funds' treatment and there is a need to
   outline the key prospective directions on how this gap can be overcome.},

Abstract = {In this article, I highlight the daily life of three intermarried
   families in Vienna during the interwar years, the Nazi oppression and
   the immediate postwar period. All three families led secular lives with
   varying ties to their Jewish and non-Jewish environment. After the Nazi
   takeover in March 1938, intermarried families along with the Jewish
   population experienced immediate discrimination and ostracism. This
   paper aims to outline how the Nazi takeover affected these families in
   their day-to-day encounters with non-Jews as well as their relationships
   with friends and family members. ``Mixed marriages{''} and their
   families navigated between Jewish and non-Jewish worlds, usually not
   fully belonging to any side. Thus, most of them experienced social
   isolation and a lacking sense of belonging, while others - mostly
   younger generations - sometimes found new forms of community. During the
   last years of the war their protection became more precarious and even
   trivial infractions against Nazi laws could lead to imprisonment and
   deportation. Since ``mixed marriages{''} and their families did not
   officially learn about the key factors of their safeguarding, they were
   left to their own instincts on how to uphold their protection.},

   democracy and consolidation of democratic civil society in Spain through
   a position of political neutrality. By abstaining from any active role
   in political parties, abandoning pretence of moral monopoly and
   embracing pluralism, it helped facilitate the establishment of civil
   society. Analytically, the path dependence mechanism, Huntington's
   theory of democratization and the secularization of religion theory are
   used to explain the how the Spanish Catholic Church helped establish the

Abstract = {The activity of public management is usually thought of as antithetical
   both to politics and political theory/philosophy. The so-called New
   Public Management theory illustrates how public management theories can
   rest on a discourse of technical and economic rationality in order to
   hide its political content and to distance it from public discussion. By
   arguing that technique needs politics, we will reveal the political
   ideology underlying its management premises. Finally, we defend that
   public management theories should always be assessed from the normative
   insights of political theory/philosophy.},

Abstract = {Medieval Europe before the Reformation and Moscow Russia before the
   Troubles are viewed in an ideally-typical manner as carriers of basic
   social and mental unities: faith and church organization, sacred empire
   as the Rome's usccessor, basic social relations. As a result of the
   Reformation and the religious wars each of the European unities was
   destroyed, but parts of the former Pax Christiana continued to closely
   interact and compete with each other, to fight for leadership, that led
   to intensive modernization of the leading Western European powers with
   known global consequences. Moscow State after the Time of Trouble
   restored its unity in all three aspects. The features of the state and
   society here were significantly transformed as a result of the Schism,
   the formation of the Russian empire, administrative reforms of the 18-19
   centuries, but the basic properties of etatism, centralism, priority of
   service, and power instrumentalization of the moral and religious sphere
   remained. The Russian social-political cycles have the phases:
   successful mobilization, stagnation, crisis, attempts of liberalization,
   authoritarian scroll-back. The cyclical dynamics is explained by the
   interrelation of the following factors: 1) the primacy of
   military-compulsory ({''}colonial{''}) administration as a means of
   retaining and managing vast territories; 2) the state priorities of
   military power, size of the territory, and the volume of export
   products; 3) the order of military service as a basic model for
   political and social institutions; the corresponding weakness of
   autonomous capital and business activity; 4) the mental, cultural and
   property gap (lack of vertical solidarity) between the elites and the
   bulk of the population. 5) the monopoly of state religion (or forced
   atheism). Thus, unity of political power, religious and ideological
   monopoly can lead a country to military triumphs and even geopolitical
   success for decades but in the longue duree this unity generates
   vulnerability.},

Abstract = {Of those political machines created by governors in the mid-1990s in the
   Russian regions, the most effective were those in the national
   republics. Several reasons contributed to this, the main ones being the
   density of patronage networks among the ethnic minorities in the
   countryside, the economic legacy of the Soviet era, as well as the
   politicization and institutionalization of ethnicity. All this allowed
   the regional elites to integrate ethnic minorities into the
   clientelistic structure of distributing symbolic and material goods in
   exchange for their electoral support. However, at the present stage the
   autonomy of the national republics has been reduced by the federal
   authorities. Based on analysis of the results of 2018 presidential
   elections, the article examines the electoral consequences of changes in
   the relations between the center and the regions and of changes in the
   functioning of regional political machines. The analysis enabled us to
   realize the diversification of the electoral behavior of ethnic
   minorities in different republics. Based on a comparative analysis of
   five regions of Russia, the author explains the reasons for this
   diversification.},

   Destruction amidst Nation-Building and ``International Security{''}},
Journal = {GENOCIDE STUDIES INTERNATIONAL},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {13},
Number = {1, SI},
Pages = {92-131},
Abstract = {``Genocide in Kurdistan{''} most often refers to events that are
   recognized as having occurred in Iraq during the late 1980s and early
   1990s. Scholars also connect it with events in Turkey's early years as a
   republic. This article describes how some scholars' expansive conception
   of Kurdistan encompasses regions that also witnessed genocides as large
   as or larger (in quantitative terms) than these two cases. Armenians,
   Assyrians, Yezidis, Mandaeans, Shi'i Arabs, and Greek Orthodox
   Christians witnessed extermination campaigns at various points in
   Ottoman, Persian, Iraqi, and Turkish history. What is remarkable about
   Upper Mesopotamia is that these genocides may have reduced native
   populations in absolute numbers, as compared with ancient or early
   medieval figures, and to a greater extent than after the genocides of
   the Kurds or other groups. Like the work of Raphael Lemkin, this
   article's analysis will not be limited to the period since the Genocide
   Convention entered into force. Instead, it presents evidence of
   continuities between the denationalization strategies, official
   pretexts, and regions mentioned in histories of the various genocides in
   Upper Mesopotamia.},

Abstract = {The politics of comparison in the Israel-Palestine conflict is largely
   encapsulated in the use of two analogies. The first is the
   `Holocaust-Hitler analogy' used by Israel and its supporters, which
   portrays Israel as a beleaguered nation surrounded by Nazi sympathisers
   who seek to destroy it as the Jewish homeland. The second is the
   `apartheid analogy', which compares the conflict to that of
   Apartheid-era South Africa and portrays Palestinians as being the
   victims of racism and settler colonialism. This article analyses why,
   how and with what desired impact these two comparisons are invoked.},

Title = {STUDENT MOVEMENTS AND THE POWER OF DISRUPTION},
Journal = {PARTECIPAZIONE E CONFLITTO},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {12},
Number = {1, SI},
Pages = {112-141},
Abstract = {We seek to clarify the nature of militant student protest by proposing a
   theoretical distinction between two types of student-movement-initiated
   disruption that are too-often viewed as similar: structural disruption
   within educational institutions, centered around students' refusal to
   perform their role as such; and invasive disruption of other
   institutions, in whose functioning students do not have a routinized
   role. By drawing on a newspaper-based database of student-initiated
   protest in Argentina, triangulated by analysis of secondary accounts of
   these events and in-depth interviews with the activists who planned and
   implemented the protest, we seek to understand the strategic logic that
   leads to disruptive protest and to explore the differing dynamics that
   characterize structural and invasive disruption.
   Both structural and invasive protest by students (and other organized
   social groupings) can successfully interfere with the normal functioning
   of society and can therefore create usable leverage against
   institutional power holders. However, the tactical choice and the
   outcome of such confrontations derives from a complex equation of
   situational variables. The variables specific to student protest include
   the institutional target designated for disruption, whether the target
   has the formal authority and/or resources to grant the demanded reform,
   whether non-students who work or otherwise participate in the targeted
   structure support or oppose the demands and tactics of the students, and
   whether the protesting students have active allies among various
   non-student stakeholders.
   We conclude that structural disruption on campus can be a surer and less
   difficult-to-implement strategy, that it can generate leverage without
   the creation of alliances with outside groups and can force concessions
   if the administration has the authority and resources to deliver
   meaningful reform. In many circumstances, however, the institutional
   educational leadership cannot deliver meaningful concessions, and
   students therefore consider invasive disruption of neighboring
   structures aimed at delivering more comprehensive reforms, and
   consequently face far more complicated strategic and tactical decisions
   if they wish to generate productive leverage. These strategic and
   tactical choices rely on congealed experience from current and prior
   student protest and their capacity to generate alliances mediated by
   their understanding of what can succeed.},

Abstract = {This paper engages with Zadie Smith's The Embassy of Cambodia and Najat

   the young female protagonists. As literary works, they capture in
   narrative form the difficulties of carving out a space for migrant women
   in contemporary Europe and suggest that engaging with the major
   challenges coming to Europe today through narrative is one way to stake
   a position. Only after rewriting the story can female migrants embrace
   Europe.},

Abstract = {The LMPs of the municipalities must accept determinants that constitute
   rules of higher hierarchy within their own spheres of competence. The
   materialization of normative contents of higher hierarchy requires
   hiring, an activity beset by problems that hinder and divert the
   realization of those contents that are inserted in the LMPs.
   From the question: Which problems make possible a public policy for the
   planning of state contracting in a way that contributes with the proper
   realization of the legal determinants of higher hierarchy from which
   policies planned on the Colombian LMPs are underpinned? The initial
   components were determined for the formulation and design of a public
   policy for the planning of Government contracting that ensures the
   accomplishment of the purposes of the State regulated from the
   determinants of higher hierarchy. The research employed a design based
   on the qualitative methodology supported by the historical hermeneutical
   approach and focused on documentary research.
   As public problems the indeterminate status of the principle of
   planning, the neglect of Law 80 of 1993 to economic theory, the
   incompleteness of the state contract and their obligatory renegotiation;
   the risks, the theory of unpredictability, the contractual equation and
   the economic equilibrium in contracts, and the exclusion of state
   entities.},

Abstract = {Elections are a socio-political institution, during which holding it is
   determined what the nature of the reforms will be in the next few years.
   It is important that the legitimacy of the electoral process is high and
   that key reforms are determined by competent government officials. The
   basic element of elections is a high level of competition, which should
   exist not only between various political entities that exercise
   eligibility to vote and right to be elected but also within such
   structures fighting for power.
   The paper contains an analysis concerning the issue on the functioning
   of the proportional vote distribution institute. According to the
   election results, it is necessary to determine how many seats will go to
   a certain party, which, according to the proportional system, has
   overcome the percentage barrier. In world practice, there is a whole
   range of proportional distribution methods that form two large groups:
   the largest remainder methods and the dividers methods. There are
   discussions on this parameter, and each country has adopted its own
   methodology. In Russia, with a proportional distribution of seats, one
   of the largest remainder methods is used, namely, the Hare method. The
   study will reflect the analysis of the functioning of proportional
   distribution systems in Russia and in the world.},

Title = {Money, State, Hegemony: A Political Ontology of Money},
Journal = {NEW POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {41},
Number = {2},
Pages = {313-328},
Abstract = {This article develops a political understanding of the money-form, its
   relation to value, to society, and to the state. It argues that the
   value of assets is based on societal relations. These value relations
   are expressed in a general measure of value - money. Money serves as the
   equivalent for all asset values. This general equivalent is
   conceptualized as a master signifier. Based on Laclau's political theory
   and theories of International Political Economy, the article argues that
   it is the master signifier, which not only defines the assets' value
   relations, but also constitutes the assets by assigning value. It
   follows that the value of an asset can only be determined when it can be
   expressed in money, and that asset values can only be made comparable
   when they can be related to this general money-form. Furthermore, the
   transition from a specific object or credit to the money-form is
   theorized as a political process. Money ultimately represents a specific
   political relationship resulting from hegemonic struggles. To
   conceptualize money as a master signifier makes it possible to
   understand money not as a neutral measure of abstract value but as a
   general measure of value relations resulting from political processes
   and social struggles.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE EDUCATION},

Volume = {15},
Number = {1, SI},
Pages = {37-48},
Abstract = {Active learning techniques are being use with increasing frequency in
   the classroom and more time is being dedicated to designing and
   implementing them. However, the literature still suffers from a lack of
   rigorous empirical methods to test the effects of simulations. Most of
   the claimed benefits of utilizing simulations, and other active learning
   techniques, are improved soft skills and higher order thinking like
   empathy, confidence, public-speaking abilities, and interpersonal
   skills-all of which don't lend themselves well to scientific
   measurement. This gap in the literature is especially troubling
   considering that time spent using simulations is time not spent using
   other methods. This article seeks to test the differing impacts of
   simulations versus traditional lectures over the long-term using a
   simple 30-minute simulation and rigorous experimental methods. The most
   important results show that students learn more initially from a
   lecture, but that students who were exposed to the simulation were
   better able to retain that information over the long-term.},

Title = {``NEW TRIANGLE{''} IN RELATIONS BETWEEN CHINA, RUSSIA AND THE USA},
Journal = {SRAVNITELNAYA POLITIKA-COMPARATIVE POLITICS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {10},
Number = {2},
Pages = {69-85},
Abstract = {The emergence of a ``new triangle{''} in relations of China, Russia and
   the United States has become an objective reality. By its nature,
   structure, content, functionality and influence, the current triangle
   differs from the ``great triangle{''} of the PRC-USA-USSR that existed
   in the past. In the relations of the three countries there is no
   definite rut of change, at the present stage their prospects are open.
   In the Sino-Russian-American ``new triangle{''} there are many changes
   that can be divided into background changes and immediate changes that
   affect the structure of relationships. Changes in the ``triangle{''} are
   not mechanical, isolated from the outside world and unilinear, they are
   determined by the interaction of many factors. Theoretically, in the
   ``triangle{''} of China, Russia and the United States there are many
   possible models, the choice of which is not exclusively subjective and
   depends largely on the overall situation and real needs.
   Creating a union is instrumental and theoretically there is no need to
   completely eliminate it from the set of diplomatic tools. Within the
   ``triangle{''}, the Sino-Russian partnership without an alliance
   represents the best model, the conclusion of an alliance can only be a
   forced choice. The conclusion of the Sino-Russian alliance would imply a
   perception of the United States as an open enemy, and although the
   alliance can weaken the threat, designating a great power as an enemy
   will in itself create tremendous strategic pressure. A great strategic
   success for China would be to prevent the appearance of the enemy, and
   especially not to allow the partner to turn into an enemy. Equally
   important is maintaining good ties with the other two powers at an even
   higher level of diplomacy. Although the likelihood of a Chinese-Russian
   military-political alliance is very low, the continued deterioration of
   Chinese-American and Russian-American relations could push China and
   Russia to create some kind of Asian bloc. China rejects the mentality of
   the Cold War and the ``zero-sum game,{''} but it is able to rationally,
   effectively and constructively use the structure of the
   Chinese-Russian-American triangle.},

Abstract = {Why do political parties in parliamentary systems undertake actions,
   such as joining a coalition government, that will entail significant
   costs for their members in subsequent elections? Recent research points
   to the incentive structures faced by differentially positioned members
   of a parliamentary party: unlike backbenchers, MPs who hold a
   ministerial portfolio can use the prerequisites of executive office to
   shield themselves from the costs of governance. This article tests the
   theory of executive particularism by examining the electoral fortunes of
   government ministers in India. Sitting government ministers are found to
   outperform other candidates; however, tests of causality fail to
   demonstrate that holding a ministerial portfolio causes this electoral
   benefit. Instead, it appears that a candidate's electoral performance
   enhances the likelihood of being granted a ministerial portfolio in the
   first place. This finding raises questions about the generalizability of
   claims that party elites can use ministerial office to shield themselves
   from the costs of governing.},

Abstract = {Hannah Arendt's account of imperialism has become an unlikely source of
   inspiration for scholars invested in anti-colonial and postcolonial
   critique. However, the role of settler colonialism in her thought has
   come under far less scrutiny. This essay reconstructs Arendt's account
   of settler-colonization. It argues that Arendt's republican analysis of
   imperialism hinges on her notion of the boomerang effect, which is
   absent in settler-colonial contexts. Arendt recognized some of the
   distinctive features of settler expansionism but reproduced many of the
   ideologies that sustain practices of settler-colonial conquest. This
   interpretation sheds light on the promises and limits of contemporary
   retrievals of Arendt's analysis and critique of imperialism by
   foregrounding the specificity of settler colonialism as an axis of
   ongoing colonial violence.},

   Estimations},

Abstract = {While most common-space estimations rely upon members who served in both
   the House and Senate as ``bridges{''} to scale the remaining members,
   this assumes that these ``bridge members{''} do not change their
   preferences when they change chambers. Such an assumption conflicts with
   standard notions of representation, that is, that legislators' votes
   reflect (at least to some degree) the wishes of their constituents. We
   examine the constancy of this common-space voting assumption by focusing
   on a subset of House members who move to the Senate: those who come from
   statewide House districts. Using these members as the bridge actors-and
   thus bridging by constituency explicitly-in a one-dimensional item
   response theory model, we find that the standard assumption of chamber
   switchers in common-space estimations is technically, but immaterially,
   false. While there are statistically distinguishable differences in
   House and Senate voting records for chamber switchers, they are not
   sufficiently large to meaningfully undermine bridging.},

Abstract = {This study aims to provide a comprehensive view of the role of political
   information in retrospective voting by simultaneously investigating the
   effects of levels of information on the individual level and the
   availability of information on the contextual level. It is argued that
   the sophistication-gap in retrospective voting is confined to those
   contexts in which it is hard for voters to assign responsibility for the
   country's state of affairs to the correct political party/-ies. Contrary
   to this expectation, analyses using the CSES data show that there is a
   larger difference in retrospective voting between voters with different
   levels of political information in high-clarity contexts, while voters
   do not seem to hold incumbent parties to account at the polls in
   low-clarity contexts - irrespective of their level of political
   knowledge. However, additional analyses show variation in this result
   depending on the data and measures used.},

Abstract = {This paper argues that the factors that induce transcontinental and

   simplistic generalizations. It states that Africa's transcontinental and
   transnational migratory phenomena from the medieval period to the
   post-modern era were a two-way street. While Africans migrated abroad,
   the continent has also continuously served as a magnet for migrants from
   other continents. Thus, despite the exaggerated portrayal of African
   migration to Europe and North America, the available data sources show
   that transcontinental and transnational African migration is microscopic
   compared to the global migratory trend.},

Journal = {PEACE ECONOMICS PEACE SCIENCE AND PUBLIC POLICY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {25},
Number = {4, SI},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Religion has been taking an increasingly contentious character
   worldwide. Deprivation, grievances and protest by religious groups seems
   to be on the rise. Previous research has shown that the marginalization
   of ethnic groups can contribute significantly to violent conflict.
   However, we know little about religious groups as existing research has
   lacked the necessary fine-grained data. This paper introduces the
   ``Religious Minorities at Risk{''} dataset comprising data on 771
   religious minorities worldwide for the period between 2000 and 2014. The
   dataset contains pertinent worldwide information on relevant
   characteristics of these minorities, especially those that may explain
   their motivation and capability to mobilize. Such characteristics
   include objective deprivation in religious, economic and political terms
   as well as corresponding subjective grievances and intensities. The
   dataset also includes group-related features and structural variables
   that arguably influence minorities' capability to mobilize. Moreover,
   while previous studies have focussed exclusively on violence, we now
   have more information available on the exact character of mobilization
   enabling scholars to distinguish between peaceful and violent forms of
   mobilization.},

Title = {The Effects of Partisan Trespassing Strategies Across Candidate Sex},
Journal = {POLITICAL BEHAVIOR},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {41},
Number = {4},
Pages = {897-915},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Candidates frequently engage in partisan trespassing strategies where a
   candidate will highlight issues and traits associated with stereotypes
   of the opposing political party. Successful trespassing messages should
   lead voters to associate candidates with qualities that fit into
   stereotypes about both Democrats and Republicans, increase electoral
   support for a candidate, and expand a candidate's base of support. Few
   studies, however, investigate whether there are differences in the
   effects of trespassing strategies across candidate sex. Through three
   survey experiments, I show that trespassing strategies have both
   positive and negative effects for female candidates. Voters associate
   female candidates who trespass with more issues and traits associated
   with the opposing political party, but voters also associate female
   candidates with fewer partisan qualities. This trade-off is one that
   both female and male candidates experience. Male candidates, unlike
   female candidates, can successfully attract more electoral support from
   out-partisan voters with trespassing strategies. These findings have
   broad implications for the viability of female candidates in national
   and state elections where candidates must secure support across a broad
   coalition of partisan and out-partisan voters.},

Abstract = {One of the main focal points of studies on interest groups and lobbying
   has been the different strategies that groups use. Despite the fact that
   political actions can target both the state and the market, these have
   not been examined together within either the literature on lobbying or
   social movements. Moreover, while it is now accepted that groups use
   combinations of inside and outside strategies, these combinations have
   been difficult to measure in practice. This paper develops a method for
   measuring configurations of strategies using principles of qualitative
   comparative analysis and demonstrates the method's application to 24 NGO
   campaigns in Italy and the UK across four issue areas: cage eggs, ocean
   plastics, antibiotics in farming and digital civil rights. I find that
   inside and outside strategies are used differently in the state and the
   market, and that market strategies can be used either to supplement
   lobbying on public policy or to directly target companies. These
   findings imply that it is worthwhile including market strategies in
   studies, as they improve our understanding of the ways in which NGOs
   address different audiences while lobbying.},

Abstract = {Election studies are an important data pillar in political and social
   science, as most political research investigations involve secondary use
   of existing datasets. Researchers depend on high-quality data because
   data quality determines the accuracy of the conclusions drawn from
   statistical analyses. We outline data reuse quality criteria pertaining
   to data accessibility, metadata provision, and data documentation using
   the FAIR Principles of research data management as a framework
   (Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability, and Reusability). We then
   investigate the extent to which a selection of election studies fulfils
   these criteria using studies from Western democracies. Our results
   reveal that although most election studies are easily accessible and
   well documented and that the overall level of data processing is
   satisfactory, some important deficits remain. Further analyses of
   technical documentation indicate that while a majority of election
   studies provide the necessary documents, there is still room for
   improvement.},

Abstract = {The new smoke free law (no. 15/2016) which bans smoking in all enclosed
   public spaces was accepted by the Romanian parliament in March 2016. We
   hypothesized that teenagers' smoking prevalence can be reduced with
   appropriate sociopolitical constraints. The aim of our research was to
   assess the teenagers' awareness of the law, and the changes occurred in
   their attitude and smoking behaviour between 2014 and 2016. Our
   cross-sectional study used self- administered questionnaires, completed
   by 7th grade students. The randomly stratified sample involved students
   from 21 localities, 21 schools, 55 classes from three Transylvanian
   counties. The results showed that those who were considered to be
   tobacco consumers smoked significantly less cigarettes after the
   implementation of the new law than before (an average of 3.51 sticks to
   5.72 sticks, p<0,001). Compared to 2014, in 2016 the smoking trends have
   changed, the usage of classical tobacco became less frequent, the
   electronic cigarette, the hookah, the homemade cigarette and cigar or
   the pipe have gained more popularity. The perception of the new law is
   positive, still highly influenced by smoking habits, since non-smokers
   have a more favourable attitude in this direction than the tobacco
   consumers.},

Abstract = {As part of a larger comparative project, ``Dynamic De/Centralization in
   Federations,'' this article studies the dynamics of Australian
   federalism since 1901. A constitution drafted in the 1890s left the
   majority of domestic governance responsibilities to the States. Within
   two decades, though, a process, continuing to this day, was underway
   whereby the financial power and the policy reach of the Commonwealth
   expanded in an apparently inexorable and irreversible fashion. This
   article charts those developments across both a broad sweep of policy
   domains and in respect of changing fiscal relations for the Australian
   case and attempts to provide a more systematic assessment of the extent,
   degree, and timing of change since Federation than previously attempted.
   It then relates the main patterns of change, over time and across policy
   domains, to the apparent mechanisms and, in turn, to a range of
   hypothesized causes.},

Abstract = {Social security in Mexico has gone through three phases during the
   twentieth century and early twenty-first: social security, social
   security, social protection -as has happened in other economies of the
   international context-. Currently, this system faces strong challenges
   in the face of a demographic change with a tendency of the young
   population that diminishes in the face of a growth of the adult
   population that will accelerate in the next decades. This situation is
   not exclusive to Mexico, but a situation that the world is going through
   during the present century. This situation requires the establishment of
   measures to make the social security system sustainable. This article
   addresses social security in Mexico and its transition to social
   protection, which, although it has made progress, faces problems in
   terms of coverage, sustainability, quality, efficiency, as well as the
   need to incorporate an important segment of occupied population that is
   in informality.},

Journal = {CONTEMPORARY POLITICAL THEORY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {18},
Number = {4},
Pages = {541-561},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Epistemic democrats are rightly concerned with the quality of outcomes
   and judge democratic procedures in terms of their ability to `track the
   truth'. However, their impetus to assess `rule by experts' and `rule by
   the people' as mutually exclusive has led to a meagre treatment of the
   role of expert knowledge in democracy. Expertise is often presented as a
   threat to democracy but is also crucial for enlightened political
   processes. Contemporary political philosophy has so far paid little
   attention to our reliance on experts and has not sufficiently addressed
   the question of how expertise can be used to improve the epistemic
   quality of democratic decision making. We believe this lack of interest
   is spurred by a too hasty acceptance of arguments dismissive of the
   political role of experts. The article examines a series of often-cited
   epistemic objections and concludes that several of them are overstated
   or misconceived, yet they all reflect real difficulties that need to be
   addressed. On this background, we tentatively outline a set of
   mechanisms that can contribute to alleviating the irreducible problem of
   epistemic asymmetries and ensuring that experts really are experts and
   use their expertise in the right way.},

Abstract = {Existing data sets on state interest group systems tend to be either
   cross-sectional (observations for only 1 year) or panel-style
   (observations of 2 years about a decade apart). In this paper, I
   describe a new data set based on raw counts of interest groups and
   organizations lobbying in the states collected by the National Institute
   for Money in State Politics, data which are observed annually from 2006
   to 2015. After several years of careful coding, I present initial
   analyses of this state interest group data broken out by economic sector
   (based on National Center for Economic Statistics codes), support for
   business policies, differences between membership organizations and
   other organizational types, like corporations and governments.
   Furthermore, I also explore how the broad contours of these interest
   group communities shift and change over time, allowing me to see whether
   any type of organized interest is able to dominate their state interest
   group system.},

Title = {UK policy on football supporters' trusts: a `window of opportunity'
   generated and exploited by the co-operative party},
Journal = {BRITISH POLITICS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {14},

Abstract = {The Co-operative Party is the independent sister-party of the Labour
   Party, with which it has had a formal relationship since 1927. Despite
   achieving consistently high levels of parliamentary representation for a
   small party, as well as its unusual `sister party within the same
   polity' status, it has been the subject of little academic attention.
   This article seeks to better understand the Co-operative Party by asking
   what influence it had over the 1997-2010 Labour government's decision to
   create the organisation Supporters Direct, which provides advice and
   assistance to football supporters groups in England which aspire to
   establishing supporters' trusts as a means of taking a financial stake
   in their clubs. Utilising Kingdon's multiple streams approach to analyse
   the `problem', `policy', and `politics' streams, it makes two core
   conclusions; (i) that policy entrepreneurs linked to the Co-operative
   Party were able to decisively influence the policy agenda of the Labour
   government and; (ii) that they did so without the involvement of
   Co-operative Party sponsored MPs instead influencing policy in a manner
   more consistent with an `advocacy' think tank.},

Abstract = {The Trump administration has reversed a 70-year consensus and
   transformed both the substance of trade policy and the postwar role the
   US has played in its global management. It has also reconfigured the
   role of the president in the domestic trade policy process. Armed with
   the power and influence the US amassed during its long run as leader of
   the post-war liberal world economy, the Trump administration has used
   trade as its principle coercive weapon in foreign policy. It has
   achieved some success, albeit at high diplomatic cost and by putting at
   risk America's long-standing structural advantages in the world economy.
   Given that domestic discontent with the liberal world economy has
   increased significantly, it is likely that the core aspects of Trump's
   trade revolution will endure, even if subsequent administrations soften
   Trump's provocative execution of it.},

Abstract = {The 2015 Paris Agreement established a new logic for international
   climate governance: the pledge-and-review system. In 2009, the same idea
   had been proposed in the Copenhagen Accord, but was then forcefully
   rejected by the negotiation community. Explaining this turnaround, I
   analyze the role of the United States in the international climate
   negotiations, using Putnam's two-level game framework and Snidal's
   k-group theory. U.S. domestic politics imposed significant constraints
   on the terms of the Paris Agreement, contributing to the emergence of
   the new treaty architecture. Until 2015, U.S. negotiators were either
   unable or unwilling to bring the demands of political actors at the
   domestic and international levels in alignment. President Obama achieved
   this alignment in 2015 by creating international support for a treaty
   without legally binding obligations that could circumvent a
   Congressional ratification barrier. The latter required a surprising
   move: the proactive engagement of China despite the structural context
   of hegemonic transition.},

Abstract = {The article examines the process of making an Islamist public sphere in
   Bangladesh and identifies the actors involved. It argues that Islamist
   social Islamization movements in the form of various da'wa (preaching)
   activities, madrassah activisms, and Islamist political parties'
   Islamization projects collectively contribute to the making of an
   Islamist public sphere. It shows how da'wa movements' everyday living
   experiences, madrassah's absolute authority over public Islam, and
   Islamist political parties' social welfare, and associated activities
   construct an Islamist imagination. A parallel counter Islamist
   discursive arena with secular discourse is in construction and
   circulation that formulates oppositional interpretations based on
   Islamist identities, interests, and needs. The article argues that
   instead of explicitly challenging the secular hegemonic discourse,
   Islamist social movements engage in a contested relationship with it,
   and gradually claim their separate position. It further maintains that
   although these Islamist movements differ ideologically, and vary the
   ways they perform and propagate Islam, they invariably contribute to the
   rise of an Islamist public sphere in Bangladesh.},

Abstract = {How has English-speaking Canadian political science conceived of the
   relationship between Quebec and Canada? Why has an issue that has been
   considered central for more than three decades become less attractive,
   if not marginal, within the discipline? The aim is to examine, from this
   example, the overlapping relationship between science and politics. The
   intent is also to show that Canadian political science has examined the
   Quebec/Canada relationship from four different angles: 1) its interest
   in Quebec politics was part of the urgency of the moment, based on a
   crisis that challenged the foundations of the political system; 2) it
   questioned the legitimacy of the sources of the dispute, namely the
   compatibility between the new expressions of Quebec nationalism with the
   presumed principles on which the Canadian political community had been
   founded; 3) Quebec nationalism also encouraged a reflection on the
   existence (or not) of ``English Canada{''} as a sociological and
   political reality; 4) the combination of the first three factors caused
   the prescriptions for getting out of, or resolving, the crisis to evolve
   over time, to the point of rendering research on this issue obsolete.},

Abstract = {European countries face a tremendous challenge in coping with human
   trafficking, a challenge that has been exacerbated by the increase in
   irregular forms of migration to Europe since 2015. European Union
   members have made progress in developing a legal framework to protect
   trafficking victims. Yet attempts to coordinate national laws fail to
   address the growing problem. Research is needed to understand why states
   fall short of EU goals. Through case studies of Germany, Hungary and
   Turkey, we examine the extent to which adoption of the European Union's
   Council Framework Decision on Combating Trafficking in Human Beings is
   associated with positive domestic changes. We focus on the effect of
   European Union membership status on implementation of victim protection
   policy. The results suggest that powerful EU members need incentives to
   cooperate that exceed costs, while capacity-building measures would
   likely drive change for candidates and newer members. Our findings help
   scholars predict when European legislative initiatives will likely
   translate into better domestic anti-trafficking measures. The findings
   also have broader implications for cooperative efforts in migration
   control and human rights protection.},

Abstract = {This study tests the relationship between public attitudes regarding the
   European Union and unilateral adoption of legal acts by the European
   Commission (i.e. directives and regulations). Relying on theories of
   policy responsiveness, as well as legislative gridlock, we present two
   hypotheses with competing expectations regarding the effect of public
   attitudes toward the European Union on policy-making activity in the
   European Commission. The first hypothesis suggests that the Commission
   will unilaterally adopt more legal acts when public support for the
   European Union is greater, while the second hypothesis suggests that the
   Commission will unilaterally adopt fewer legal acts when public support
   for the European Union is greater. Using time series error correction
   models and data from Eurobarometer surveys from 1974 to 2008, and the
   European Union's online legislative archive (EUR-Lex), these hypotheses
   are tested. The results support the second hypothesis, suggesting that
   the European Commission will increase unilateral legal act adoption when
   public attitudes are more negative toward the European Union, while
   decreasing unilateral legal act adoption when the public is more
   Europhilic. These findings indicate a possibility of responsibility
   trading between the institutions of the European Union and have
   important implications for our understandings of European policy
   processes, political responsiveness, and democratic governance in the
   European Union.},

Abstract = {Degrowth is establishing itself as a theory within the ecological and
   post-development scholarship. At the core of degrowth is a local-centric
   perspective, whereby small urban agglomerations are considered as the
   key actors of the political and economic system of an imagined
   post-consumerist and post-capitalist society. Degrowth proponents thus
   argue that the fundamental steps to achieve a truly democratic, socially
   just and ecological society should be taken at local level. However, in
   the degrowth theory a thorough debate about why the local level would be
   the most suitable spatial units to achieve degrowth is scarce. The
   importance of the small urban size appears to be axiomatic, rather than
   supported by substantive arguments. By engaging with non-mainstream
   strands of green political thought, this paper critically reflects upon
   the local-centred perspective at the core of the degrowth theory,
   identifying its main practical and theoretical shortcomings.},

Title = {Let's quarrel (streiten)! Introducing a Kantian framework for
   social interaction in international politics},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL THEORY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {17},
Number = {3},
Pages = {356-374},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Actors in international politics have been driven predominantly by two
   (maybe three) logics of social interaction: fighting, bargaining, and
   some arguing. Yet, if international politics is characterized by a lack
   of determinate laws unlike its domestic corollary, it would be
   unrealistic to expect leaders to simply rely on a singular mode of
   evaluating facts based primarily on cognition and interests. In turn, I
   offer quarreling to address this gap. As a type of affective social
   interaction based on the subjective validity of one's feelings and thus
   one that goes beyond mere disagreement to disapproval, quarreling tries
   to establish who is right about what is right. I establish a theoretical
   framework based on Kant's intuitions of a quarrel (streiten) and in so
   doing clarify both the purpose and utility of quarreling: to demand
   assent for one's feelings (in the absence of established rules and
   norms) and expose an underlying contention involving values.},

Title = {A mission-driven research program on solar geoengineering could promote

Abstract = {Over the past decade or so, several commentators have called for
   mission-driven research programs on solar geoengineering, also known as
   solar radiation management (SRM) or climate engineering. Building on the
   largely epistemic reasons offered by earlier commentators, this paper
   argues that a well-designed mission-driven research program that aims to
   evaluate solar geoengineering could promote justice and legitimacy,
   among other valuable ends. Specifically, an international,
   mission-driven research program that aims to produce knowledge to enable
   well-informed decision-making about solar geoengineering could (1)
   provide a more effective way to identify and answer the questions that
   policymakers would need to answer; and (2) provide a venue for more
   efficient, effective, just, and legitimate governance of solar
   geoengineering research; while (3) reducing the tendency for solar

Abstract = {This paper compares the social media posts of ISIS foreign fighters to
   those of ISIS supporters. We examine a random sample of social media
   posts made by violent foreign fighters (n = 14; 2000 posts) and
   non-violent supporters (n = 18; 2000 posts) of the Islamic State of Iraq
   and Syria (ISIS) (overall n = 4,000 posts), from 2009 to 2015. We used a
   mixed-method study design. Our qualitative content analyses of the 4,000
   posts identified five themes: Threats to in-group, societal grievances,
   pursuit for significance, religion, and commitment issues. Our
   quantitative comparisons found that the dominant themes in the foreign
   fighters' online content were threats to in-group, societal grievances,
   and pursuit for significance, while religion and commitment issues were
   dominant themes in the supporters' online content. We also identified
   thematic variations reflecting individual attitudes that emerged during
   the 2011-2015 period, when major geopolitical developments occurred in
   Syria and Iraq. Finally, our quantitative sentiment-based analysis found
   that the supporters (10 out of 18; 56\%) posted more radical content
   than the foreign fighters (5 out of 14; 36\%) on social media.},

Abstract = {Authoritarian governments talk about democracy frequently. Why do they
   do so? What does the term democracy mean in an authoritarian political
   language? This research uses a computer-assisted text analytical
   approach illustrating how an authoritarian government strategically
   manipulates the discourse about democracy to benefit itself. By
   analysing over a million political articles published in People's Daily
   over five decades, the study shows a refocusing framing strategy, in
   which the Chinese government defines democracy not with regime
   justification but with national policy priorities while denoting
   democracy most frequently alongside the fundamental values. With this
   strategy, the framed discourse appear to be consistent with the
   fundamental values in Western democracies but work for the preservation
   of the authoritarian regime.},

Abstract = {The Office of Living Victoria (OLV), was established in 2011 by the then
   Liberal-National Party Coalition Government. It was created in response
   to a water crisis and intended to revolutionise water management and
   delivery, challenging established authorities and practices consolidated
   under the previous Labor government in Victoria. There was a decidedly
   partisan motivation for its conception. The drive for new ideas and
   innovation created opportunities for policy entrepreneurs who won the
   competition against more conventional research advocacy, and determined
   the agenda of the new agency, in the process curbing an existing policy
   network. Yet within a short period, this initiative was mired in
   scandal, and ended in 2014 having failed to achieve its purposes. This
   article explores this instance of policy failure, assessing the policy
   trajectory of the OLV in relation to the concepts of partisanship,
   policy entrepreneurship, and policy networks.},

   measures of party policy shifts. In this article, data on European
   parties' position shifts on both European integration and left-right
   ideology is analysed, showing that this is problematic because, while
   alternative measures of party policy positions correlate strongly in
   cross-sectional analyses, alternative measures of parties' policy shifts
   are essentially uncorrelated in longitudinal analyses. Suggestions are
   offered on how to address this problem.},

Abstract = {As the first country to introduce proportional representation (PR),
   Belgium has attracted considerable attention. Yet, we find the existing
   explanations for the 1899 breakthrough lacking. At the time of reform,
   the Catholic Party was politically dominant, advantaged by the electoral
   system, and facing reformist Socialists. Nevertheless, they
   single-handedly changed the electoral system and lost 26 seats in the
   first election under PR. We argue that the Catholics had good reasons to
   adopt PR. Majoritarian rules tend to create high levels of uncertainty
   because they provide incentives for non-dominant parties to cooperate.
   Such electoral coalitions are facilitated by multidimensional policy
   spaces that make electoral coalitions other than between nonsocialist
   parties possible. PR reduces the effectiveness of cooperation between
   non-dominant parties, but such certainty comes at a price. In addition,
   in the presence of dominant parties, divisions over electoral system
   reform often result in intra-party conflicts that may be more decisive
   than inter-party conflicts.},

Abstract = {The paper opposes the idea developed by Enzo Traverso in his Left-Wing
   Melancholy, regarding the productivity of this passion for a politics of
   the left. It argues that it does not seem possible to ignore the bond
   which linked the revolutionary struggles in the XXth Century with the
   allegiance to new forms of total domination by the emerging communist
   regimes, and with the silence of the revolutionary fighters and parties
   regarding this new form of oppression. And that it is inconsistent to
   simultaneously advocate for the victims who died or were defeated in
   those revolutionary struggles, for those who gave their allegiance to
   the criminal domination of the new communist regimes, as well as for the
   victims of these new regimes.},

Abstract = {Governments often fulfill election pledges to remain in power; yet, it
   is unclear how pledge fulfillment and breakage actually affect public
   support for government. This article explores the tendency for
   governments to be penalized for unfulfilled pledges more than they are
   rewarded for fulfilled pledges. In two large-scale highly realistic
   online survey experiments (N = 13,000, 10,000), performed at the
   beginning and middle of a government's term in office, respondents are
   presented with a range of (real) election pledges. We find that broken
   pledges often are more important to government evaluations than
   fulfilled pledges, and that pledge fulfillment can produce decreases in
   support from nonsupporters that more than offset the marginal gains
   among supporters. Findings provide valuable evidence on asymmetries in
   political behavior, and a unique account of the ``cost of ruling,{''}
   the seemingly inevitable tendency for governments to lose support during
   their time in office.},

Abstract = {Despite prevailing myths of social harmony and cooperation Saskatchewan
   is a jurisdiction with a race problem rooted in a problematic colonial
   history. By highlighting the persistent racialization of educational
   opportunities and inequalities in Saskatchewan, we document the
   systematic assaults on Indigenous epistemologies, languages, and
   cultures that occurred within schools and implicate these schools in the
   production and reproduction of deeply embedded intergenerational
   educational disadvantage. The article makes the case that the colonial
   model employed by European settlers to marginalize the original
   inhabitants of the land evolved into a neocolonial model that continues
   the marginalization of Indigenous peoples in present-day Saskatchewan.
   In arguing that schools have failed Indigenous students rather than vice
   versa, we reframe current Indigenous educational disparities as an
   educational debt rather than an achievement gap and document the
   multiple ways in which that educational debt continues to socially and
   economically exclude Indigenous peoples, especially through the
   racialization of poverty. We conclude that only substantial compensatory
   educational funding, as part of a wider program of redistribution and
   poverty reduction, can address the educational debt and ensure equitable
   educational outcomes for Indigenous learners in Saskatchewan.},

Abstract = {This article provides a comparative assessment of the labor provisions
   in the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) and the North
   American Free Trade Agreement. It also evaluates new labor-related
   requirements incorporated in the rules of origin (ROO) rather than the
   labor chapter of the newer treaty. The ROO in the USMCA determine a
   labor value content requirement for passenger vehicles and light and
   heavy trucks. No previous free trade agreement mandates that a fraction
   of a product be made by workers earning a specific minimum wage to
   qualify for duty-free access. The new clause has raised concerns about
   its enforceability, which this article explores. Private compliance
   initiatives are presented as a means to strengthen compliance with the
   new labor regime without disrupting existing regional production
   networks.},

Abstract = {Are female government leaders more likely than their male counterparts
   to see their gendered identities and personal lives profiled in news
   coverage of their ascents? Are non-novel women leaders-those who are the
   second in their jurisdiction to achieve the top political job-less
   likely to experience media personalization than did the women who
   preceded them in office? By analyzing newspaper coverage of 20
   Australian and Canadian premiers, ten women and their immediate male
   predecessors, our study establishes that female premiers were more
   extensively personalized in news coverage than were male premiers,
   particularly in the Australian context. However, gender novelty and
   other factors proved significant. The proposition that an increased
   presence of women in leadership roles diminishes the salience of private
   lives and personal characteristics is supported by our study, suggesting
   that gender stereotyping of female political leaders will decrease over
   time as more women exercise political power.},

Abstract = {Over the past few decades, international organizations have increasingly
   granted transnational actors access to monitor and participate in their
   proceedings. Some observers have argued that stronger involvement of
   civil society may be a cure for the perceived democratic deficit in
   international political institutions. However, simply measuring levels
   of formal access tells us nothing about the degree to which access
   translates into participation. This article therefore examines the
   stability, or volatility, of two populations of transnational actors
   over a period of three decades. It finds significant differences in
   volatility between the two populations that levels of formal access do
   not seem to explain.},

Journal = {CAPITAL AND CLASS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {43},
Number = {4},
Pages = {543-560},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The purpose of this article is to deepen analyses of life production
   relations that are of central concern to the feminist global political
   economy frameworks around which this special issue is organized. While
   the original approach recognized ecological relations in its
   methodological synthesis of power, production, and social reproduction,
   most subsequent research engaging the approach focuses on areas such as
   household labor, health care, education, migration, and macroeconomic
   governance. Much less work, however, analyzes relations between capital
   accumulation and ecological life-producing relations that ultimately
   sustain human and non-human life. The article draws on elements of a
   `world-ecology', commodity frontier perspective, to argue for the
   integration of primary - ecological - production of the substance of
   life into the power, production, and social reproduction global
   political economy framework. The article draws on this synthesis to
   conduct a long-term analysis of one of the earliest commodity frontiers
   in capitalist history, Newfoundland fisheries in the Northwest Atlantic
   Ocean. Through an analysis of changing patterns of ecological
   production, household and community reproduction, state enclosure of
   ocean life production, and world market shifts, the article suggests
   that we need to move beyond narrow consequentialist analyses of the role
   of capital accumulation in ecological exhaustion toward broader,
   integrated analyses of change that reveal dynamic and perhaps more
   hopeful struggles and potential for sustainable and progressive
   conditions of intergenerational social-ecological reproduction.},

Abstract = {This article analyzes how the dominant narrative of Armenian national
   identity shapes perceptions of Armenian culture and offers examples of
   Ottoman Armenian craft art to bring to light an under acknowledged, yet
   intrinsically valuable, dynamic within Armenian cultural identity.
   Within studies of art history, cultural exchange between Ottoman
   Armenians and Turks has been ignored due to its inconvenience to the
   conflictual understanding of Armenian-Ottoman relations central to
   Armenian national identity. These artifacts speak out against reductive
   norms and offer an important addendum to the understanding of what it
   meant and continues to mean to be Armenian.},

Abstract = {Studies have shown that parties selectively emphasize different issues
   to compete with each other to raise the salience for their preferred
   issues and to appear competent in handling them. This study applies the
   selective emphasis framework on individual politicians. We argue that
   politicians compete with both politicians from different parties as with
   their party members. We expect that issue ownership matters to compete
   with politicians from different parties and issue specialization to
   compete with politicians from their own party. We studied the individual
   issue agenda of 144 Belgian politicians for a period of 9 months on
   Twitter, in the news and in parliament. Our results show that issue
   specialization is a consistent driver of the three issue agendas of
   politicians, while the effect of issue ownership varies across agendas.
   This means that both factors are not mutually exclusive and that
   combining them can be an opportune strategy for politicians.},

Abstract = {Based on legal interpretation, interviews with rejected asylum seekers,
   and decisions from hospitals and the County Governor, this article
   examines the degree of compliance with the human right to health care
   for adult irregular migrants in Norway. The findings indicate that a
   certain minimum of health care services is accessible for most. However,
   economic concern represents a heavy burden. Fear of deportation, often
   considered a barrier to health care in earlier studies, represents a
   problem for those who evade deportation and lack information about
   health-care providers' duty of confidentiality. Unclear legislation
   leads to uncertainty among health personnel. This uncertainty produces,
   in some cases, an arbitrary practice. The article suggests that the most
   serious gaps between health-care needs, national legislation, and
   international human rights obligations appear to exist concerning the
   lack of rehabilitation rights after surgery, the lack of health care for
   patients suffering from serious mental health issues, and the high
   threshold for treatment of chronic diseases.},

Abstract = {The world is arguably experiencing a resurgence of state-sponsored
   terrorism. Meanwhile, the crime-terror nexus is seen as a continued
   threat to global security and stability. However, there has been little
   attention paid to the use of organised crime by state-sponsored terror
   groups. This is because existing literature views the use of criminal
   fundraising as an alternative to state-sponsorship. Despite this, there
   are numerous examples of state-sponsored organisations which
   nevertheless engage in organised crime. This paper addresses this puzzle
   by comparing two competing theoretical approaches on the crime-terror
   nexus. Current literature tends to either focus on responses to economic
   necessity at the group level or on the broader structure of
   opportunities and constraints. A congruence analysis will be conducted
   using the case of Hezbollah to test these approaches to the specific
   issue of state-sponsorship and crime. The main finding is that
   approaches rooted in opportunity structures have significantly more
   explanatory power than those focused on group level motivation and
   necessity. This paper also finds a more complex role for state-sponsors
   with some states actively enabling crime. This suggests the need for an
   understanding of terror and crime which focuses on the internationalised
   political context as well as internal group dynamics.},

Abstract = {A new understanding of localization (glocalisation) with the post-1970
   globalization process has risen. The change and transformation of the
   role of state in globalization will also lead to change and
   transformation of the role of the city governments in the process of
   glocalization and they will seek to occupy a place in the global arena
   by constructing and monitoring their own entrepreneurial policies. While
   this quest leads metropolitan cities to follow different methods and
   strategies, it forces small cities to follow very different paths and
   strategies. While metropolitan cities grow enormously with their
   populations and activities and eventually come to resemble each other,
   small cites market themselves by highlighting their own original values
   and making themselves objects of recognition. Demands of tourists bored
   with metropolitan cities and the change in the demands of the tourism
   industry seeking authenticity have eased and encouraged this process.
   In this article the impact of glocalization (which can be described as
   the process of competition through focusing on differences in an era of
   homogenized globalization), on the efforts of small cities' and their
   administrator's sensitivity against the demands from the tourism
   industry and the effect of this on city life will be examined. Analyzing
   the aforementioned sensitivities and approaches will enable the analysis
   of the efforts of small cities that highlight their differences and show
   their originality in terms of cultural legacy, local food and drinks and
   festivities. Related to that, analyzing these efforts will make it
   easier to understand urban policies. In this way, the evolution of the
   slow, sustainable, peaceful, livable and ecological city in the
   glocalization process will be easier to analyze.},

Abstract = {This article engages new histories of the black frontline communities of
   the Underground Railroad to rethink both fugitive democracy and the
   transformative possibilities of sanctuary as its constitutive twin. We
   analyze the ways that communities of free blacks and fugitives in the
   border zones between the Antebellum US North and South crafted
   themselves as magnetic spaces of creative refuge that suggest we
   reconceive sanctuary as the generative twin of fugitivity. This insight
   enables us to theorize new ethical and political dimensions of Sheldon
   Wolin's concept fugitive democracy by illuminating how fugitivity as
   flight away from danger can be interwoven with sanctuary as flight into
   and toward alternatives. Specifically, we theorize three dimensions of
   fugitive democracy/transformative sanctuary-sanctuary tending, dramatic
   sanctuary, and disruptive hospitality. While some theorists have
   considered key motifs in Wolin's fugitive democracy to be opposed to
   vital themes disclosed in contemporary theories of black fugitivity, we
   argue that the power of black frontline communities stemmed precisely
   from their capacities to dynamically entangle political approaches
   (mis)taken to be at odds. For example, we suggest a theory and practice
   of tending involving both nurturing care and militantly defensive
   action, dramatic sanctuary performances that amplify public power by
   oscillating between tricky concealment and flagrant publicity, and
   disruptive hospitality that interweaves law-breaking harbor with
   strategies for juridical and institutional change. These insights open
   onto an alternative imaginary that can also provide a toolbox for
   building grassroots democratic power today, particularly in the face of
   emergent neofascism and escalating displacement worldwide.},

Abstract = {We argue that wealthy elites in democracies can limit their taxes by
   constraining the fiscal capacity of the state. Corrupting local
   officials and undermining fiscal capacity are some of the mechanisms by
   which high-income earners can lower their own tax liabilities, even when
   voters favor higher de jure levels of taxation. The incentive to
   undermine fiscal capacity is especially compelling when inequality is
   high, as the median voter is likely to support higher progressive
   taxation and redistribution. Using data from over 5,500 Brazilian
   municipalities, we show that localities with higher levels of inequality
   accrue less revenue from local property taxes. These results are robust
   to estimating a number of cross-sectional models as well as panel models
   with time and municipal fixed effects. Moreover, we show that
   municipalities with high levels of inequality are less likely to apply
   to a federal grant program to increase their capacity to collect taxes.},

Abstract = {When do groups-be they countries, administrations, or other
   organizations-more or less accurately understand the world around them
   and assess political choices? Some argue that group decision-making
   processes often fail due to biases induced by groupthink. Others argue
   that groups, by aggregating knowledge, are better at analyzing the
   foreign policy world. To advance knowledge about the intersection of
   politics and group decision making, this paper draws on evidence from a
   multiyear geopolitical forecasting tournament with thousands of
   participants sponsored by the US government. We find that teams
   outperformed individuals in making accurate geopolitical predictions,
   with regression discontinuity analysis demonstrating specific teamwork
   effects. Moreover, structural topic models show that more cooperative
   teams outperformed less cooperative teams. These results demonstrate
   that information sharing through groups, cultivating reasoning to hedge
   against cognitive biases, and ensuring all perspectives are heard can
   lead to greater success for groups at forecasting and understanding
   politics.},

Abstract = {This article examines how social identification and group networks, and
   their interactions, affect Moroccan and Turkish immigrants' political
   participation in the Netherlands. It uses the data generated by Roex et
   al. (Salafisme in Nederland. IMES Report Series, Institute for Migration
   and Ethnic Studies (IMES), Amsterdam, 2010) and conducts logistic
   regression analyses. It conceptualizes how social identifications,
   networks, and their interactions relate to voting, other
   institutionalized political participation, and noninstitutionalized
   political participation separately. Our main finding is that immigrants'
   origin-country identification affects voting turnout negatively, but
   other forms of political participation positively, for those who are
   more embedded in origin-country friend networks, and who visit the
   mosque more frequently. A difference between the two immigrant groups
   appears when we consider religious identification and networks.
   Religious identification has mostly positive effects on the political
   participation of Moroccan immigrants who are also embedded in religious
   networks, while it has solely negative effects among Turkish immigrants
   who are more embedded in religious networks.},

Title = {The Right Stuff? Assessing the Use of Rights Discourse in Same-Sex
   Marriage Ballot Measure Campaigns},

Volume = {51},

Abstract = {Proponents of same-sex marriage won four of five ballot measure
   campaigns in U.S. states in 2012. Many observers have argued that these
   victories occurred because advocates of marriage equality shifted away
   from rights-based appeals, and instead framed their cause as being about
   family, love, and commitment. This article tests this claim by examining
   campaign documents used in the nine marriage equality ballot measure
   campaigns that took place from 2008 to 2012. I find little correlation
   between the use of equal rights discourse and electoral failure, and
   argue that other factors may account for the observed differences in
   results. I argue that the popular narrative that the rights discourse
   was counter-productive to efforts to advance marriage equality is overly
   simplistic and possibly false.},

Abstract = {The recent spate of mass public shootings in the United States raises
   important questions about how these tragic events might impact mass
   opinion and public policy. Integrating research on focusing events,
   contextual effects and perceived threat, this article stipulates that
   residing near a mass shooting should increase support for gun control by
   making the threat of gun violence more salient. Drawing upon multiple
   data sources on mass public shootings paired with large-N survey data,
   it demonstrates that increased proximity to a mass shooting is
   associated with heightened public support for stricter gun control.
   Importantly, the results show that this effect does not vary by
   partisanship, but does vary as a function of salience-related event
   factors, such as repetition, magnitude and recency. Critically, the core
   result is replicated using panel data. Together, these results suggest a
   process of context-driven policy feedback between existing gun laws,
   egregious gun violence and demand for policy change.},

Abstract = {Recent studies of attitudes toward economic inequality suggest that most
   people around the world prefer very low levels of inequality, despite
   well-known trends toward greater inequality within many countries. Even
   within countries, people across the political spectrum are said to be in
   remarkable agreement about the ideal level of economic inequality. Using
   survey data from 40 countries and a novel survey experiment in the
   United States, we show that this apparent agreement is illusory. When
   relying on a widely used cross-national survey measure of Ideal Pay
   Ratios, preferred levels of inequality are heavily influenced by two
   well-documented sources of perceptual distortion: the anchoring effect
   and ratio bias. These effects are substantial and many times larger than
   the influence of fundamental political predispositions. As a result,
   these cross-national survey measures tapping preferences regarding
   economic inequality produce misleading conclusions about desired levels
   of inequality.},

Abstract = {When and to what extent do crises and significant events induce changes
   in political attitudes? Theories of public opinion and policymaking
   predict that major events restructure public opinion and pry open new
   political opportunities. We examine the effect of major events on
   support for public policies in the context of the Sandy Hook Elementary
   School mass shooting in December 2012 using a nationally representative
   panel survey of US adults. Across both cross-sectional and
   within-subject analyses, we find no evidence that Americans granted
   greater support for gun control after the Sandy Hook shooting. Our null
   findings persist across a range of political and demographic groups. We
   also find no evidence of attitude polarization as a result of Sandy
   Hook. Our results suggest that elite polarization in a particular issue
   area leads citizens to employ motivated reasoning when interpreting
   critical events, thereby reducing the capacity for attitude change. Our
   findings have important implications for identifying the conditions
   under which major events affect support for public policies and create
   political opportunities for policy change.},

Title = {Do local leaders know their voters? A test of guessability in India},
Journal = {ELECTORAL STUDIES},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {61},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Prominent theories of clientelism the exchange of benefits for political
   support depend on the assumption that politicians, through local agents
   immersed in local social networks, possess detailed information on
   voters' political preferences prior to targeting. This article provides
   the first direct test of this assumption. It develops a behavioral
   measure, guessability, which gauges the ability of elected village
   leaders, who often function as brokers and prominent vote mobilizers, to
   correctly identify the partisan vote intentions of voters in their
   locality. It then develops a method to estimate added informational
   value, which compares the performance of local leaders to
   low-information benchmarks that capture guessability rates that can
   feasibly be achieved by outsiders. Original data from surveys of voters
   and elected village politicians across 96 village councils in Rajasthan,
   India indicate that while these village leaders out-perform
   low-information benchmarks with respect to co-partisans, they perform no
   better than this baseline vis-a-vis non-co-partisans.},

Abstract = {Much has been written about efforts to expand women's social, cultural,
   and political representation, roles, and opportunities. However, as
   political scientists, we have done little to document the early history
   of incorporating women into the discipline. This article illustrates how
   the General Federation of Women's Clubs (GFWC) established the study of
   politics as an acceptable course of baccalaureate study for women:
   first, by crafting a model curriculum; second, by advocating for the
   creation of endowed chairs in political science at women's colleges;
   and, third, by publishing in scholarly outlets. The GFWC's efforts can
   be viewed as the first steps to the incorporation of women into the
   discipline-a question that continues to be the subject of much analysis
   and consternation by professional associations and the academic
   community.},

Title = {Nationalism and religion in Ireland: the apocalyptic rhetoric of John
   Mitchel},
Journal = {IRISH POLITICAL STUDIES},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {36},
Number = {2},
Pages = {167-184},
Month = {APR 3},
Abstract = {While the role of religion in the production of nationalism has been
   subjected to uneven forms of scrutiny, most of these approaches rely on
   an implicit or explicit identification between sectarian affiliation and
   the dominant social group articulating a particular form of nationalism.
   This article will create a more nuanced picture by demonstrating the
   influence of a rhetoric of religiosity originating from a social group
   that generally resisted incorporation into a nationalist movement. It
   will do this by locating nineteenth century Irish nationalist John
   Mitchel firmly within a tradition of Presbyterianism at a time that his
   co-religionists were dominated by unionism and nationalism was taking on
   an increasingly Catholic orientation. This will show the difficulties of
   applying classic accounts of religion and nationalism to the Irish
   context. The ability of John Mitchel to intervene within the discursive
   space of nineteenth century Ireland is provocative in this context
   because of the implication that Mitchel's intervention would imply the
   existence of a non-sectarian social space through which confessional
   motifs could be exchanged and circulate with a regularity that is not
   often granted to Ireland due to the dominant tendency to view political
   and social conflict through a sectarian lens.},

Abstract = {In this article I describe and defend an account of social freedom
   grounded in intersubjective recognition. I term this the `normative
   authorisation' account. It holds that a person enjoys social freedom if
   she is recognised as a discursive equal able to engage in justificatory
   dialogue with other social agents about the appropriateness of her
   reasons for action. I contrast this with Axel Honneth's theory of social
   freedom, which I term the `self-realisation' account. According to this
   view, the affirmative recognition of others is necessary for obtaining a
   positive relation-to-self and hence freedom. I identify several problems
   with this account, which challenge the connection Honneth draws between
   social recognition and freedom. I show how the normative authorisation
   account avoids these problems and captures some basic features of our
   everyday, normative interactions. Finally, I suggest that the account
   fits well with recent work on epistemic injustice. Specifically, it
   shows that securing the social conditions of freedom requires ensuring
   epistemically-just social relations. Thus, the normative authorisation
   account is an explanatorily powerful, inclusive theory of social freedom
   that fits well with wider accounts of justice and freedom. Thus, it
   represents the most promising way of understanding social freedom in
   terms of interpersonal recognition.},

Abstract = {In the context of conflict between Ukraine and Russia and increasing
   polarisation, symbolic boundaries between the two spaces are shifting.
   Here I investigated the themes and strategies of border-construction
   between the concepts of `Ukrainianness' and `Russianness' through
   everyday acts of communication of Russian-speaking Ukrainians. The
   article utilises materials of 14 in-depth interviews with Russian
   speakers from various Ukrainian regions (2018). The results show that
   the polarisation and hardening of borders between Ukraine and Russia
   prompted two responses: acceptance vs. negotiation/denial. The
   underlying tension behind opposing border-narratives was caused by the
   competition between ethnic and civic elements for the dominance in the
   national identity discourse.},

Abstract = {Since the end of the Cold War, a number of authors have affirmed the

   understanding of the international political situation in this early
   twenty-first century. Those authors who wish to revive Gro ss raum for
   the sake of their theoretical work overlook vitally important components

Abstract = {This article aims to advance the idea of transformative justice by
   building on and expanding the notion of `justice' beyond that
   traditionally offered by transitional justice discourse and practice.
   The need for a paradigm shift is warranted by the continued high levels
   of sexual and gender-based violence (SGBV), directed predominantly
   towards women, experienced in post-conflict contexts. Using the example
   of Cambodia, we argue that the scale of SGBV in a post-conflict country
   can be an indicator of the extent of `transformative' change taking
   place, and, thus, of the success of transitional justice processes and
   democracy consolidation, particularly regarding gender equality. Gender
   equality is essential for democratisation, as democracy should be both a
   political and a social project. Thus, democracy- and peace-building
   efforts require challenging entrenched power hierarchies and deep-rooted
   gender inequality, of which SGBV is symptomatic.},

Abstract = {Global governance is no longer a matter of state cooperation or
   bureaucratic politics. Since the end of the cold war, advocacy groups
   have proliferated and enjoyed increasing access to global governance
   institutions such as the European Union, World Trade Organization, and
   the United Nations climate conferences. This special issue seeks to push
   theories of interest groups and international non-governmental
   organizations forward. We argue that the advocacy group effects on
   global governance institutions are best understood by examining how
   groups use and shape domestic and global political opportunity
   structures. The individual articles examine how, when, and why domestic
   and global political opportunity structures shape advocacy group effects
   in global governance, across global institutions, levels of government,
   advocacy organizations, issue areas, and over time. As special interests
   are becoming increasingly involved in global governance, we need to
   better understand how advocacy organizations may impact global public
   goods provision.},

Abstract = {Growing hate speech in the global north has been seen as one
   characteristic of the present. The anti-migration rhetoric of Donald
   Trump and in relation to Brexit are by many seen as mainstreaming and
   accepting hate and, hence, creating fruitful soil to further
   dissemination of hate speech. Also, some media outlets strongly focus on
   producing and disseminating anti-migration rhetoric and hate speech.
   Within such an environment hate groups can grow both discursively and by
   executing physical violence against minority groups. This article
   focuses on hate speech in Iceland. It looks at homepages that
   disseminate hate or negative discourse against minority groups. Examples
   are taken of pages from political parties, information sites and groups
   with an open anti-migration agenda in order to analyse in which ways
   hate is expressed. Our findings suggest that negative discourses toward
   various minority groups are quite common and growing in Iceland. The
   majority of the negative speech is directed towards Muslims.},

   Comparative Analysis of Different Policy Sectors},

Abstract = {In recent years, green parties have gained, at least in some Western
   democracies, access to government at different levels. In 2011, a
   coalition between the Green Party under Winfried Kretschmann and the
   Social Democratic Party (SPD) came to power in Baden-Wurttemberg (BW)
   following 58 years of predominantly Christian Democratic (CDU)
   government in the state. The present paper analyzes whether this change
   of government has led to a corresponding ``green-red{''} policy change.
   Applying a fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA) to 12
   different policy sectors, we find evidence of remarkable changes in
   policy in some key areas related to Green politics, and evidence also of
   both Social Democratic reforms and path dependence in many other
   sectors. The results of our fsQCA show that the responsibility of Social
   Democratic politicians for the ministries in the respective policy
   sectors in financially relevant policy sectors was enough reason for the
   implementation of far-reaching reforms. Social Democratic ministries in
   financially relevant policy sectors with a rather low degree of
   political leeway brought in Social Democratic policy solutions.
   Moreover, a sufficient reason for some Green policy manifestations was
   the combination of Green Party ministries in more regulatory policy
   sectors with a rather high degree of political leeway.},

Abstract = {The Russian Federation has a wide arsenal of tools at its disposal for
   conducting information warfare to achieve its strategic objectives in
   the ongoing status conflict with the West. The active exploitation of
   conspiracy theories has thrived since pro-Kremlin forces started armed
   conflict against Ukraine in 2013-2014. This article focuses on the crash
   of Flight MHI7, widely used by the Russian media to fabricate various
   conspiracy theories which make out that the West and Ukraine are
   responsible for the disaster. This study examines several Russian
   outlets and TV channels and concludes that the Russian media often used
   falsified stories and emotional rhetoric in narratives they spread about
   the crash of Flight MH17. The narratives used to create these conspiracy
   theories claim that the incident was a Western provocation attempting to
   generate hostility towards Russia. In disseminating these kinds of
   conspiracy theories, the pro-Kremlin media created distrust against the
   West and the Ukrainian government among a larger audience and produced
   discomfort and disorientation about Western and Ukrainian news.},

Abstract = {This article aims to reflect on one of the central themes of Kantian
   political philosophy: publicity, considered the center of the accordance
   of politics with morals and the exercise of a public control of power
   implemented by the citizens. Starting from the Appendix of For perpetual
   peace, but referring also to other Kantian works, different meanings of
   the term ``publicity{''} are showed. For this purpose, the article
   focuses on a double level of analysis. First of all, the juridical one,
   that concerns the two transcendental formulas of Public Right, thanks to
   which Kant defines the accordance of politics with morals. They are also
   an instrument to define if a maxim, that determines political actions,
   is rightful or not on the base of its disposition to be publicized. The
   second level regards, instead, publicity meant as an ``enlightenment
   method{''}, linked to the public use of reason (different from private
   one, as Kant writes in Answering the question: what is Enlightenment?).
   This use, free and autonomous, must be accorded to everyone and it is
   directed to a Publicum that potentially coincides with the whole world.
   The republican form of government is the institutional context in which
   the two levels are welded together and where public control of power is
   structurally guaranteed. In the background there are two elements: the
   distinction between law and ethics from the Kantian political point of
   view and the role played by individual dispositions in the exercise of
   this public control.},

Abstract = {The European Union (EU) and China are on a quest to establish themselves
   as global actors. Still, both powers first need to create a stable
   neighbourhood that will not threaten their interests. Consequently, in
   2004 the EU launched the European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP), while in
   2013 China's Peripheral Diplomacy (CPD) was introduced. Against this
   background, this article aims to conduct a comparative analysis of both
   initiatives. Specifically, as there is a wide agreement that the ENP has
   failed to generate any impact on the EU's periphery, the research
   question is: To what extent could the CPD transcend the problems of its
   European counterpart? The article posits that both policies are rather
   similar in their inability to strike the right balance between
   protecting core interests and acknowledging the neighbours' needs. Thus,
   it is likely that the CPD, just like the ENP, will remain a policy with
   big potential but without effective results.},

Title = {Transformation of the Socio-Political Sphere in Digital Era: Some
   Problems of Value-Normative Harmonization},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF POLITICS AND LAW},

Abstract = {The article problematizes the functioning, on the one hand, of
   traditional value-normative regulators, ensuring socio-cultural
   integrity and social and political dynamics, and on the other, the
   development of standards for the development and application of digital
   algorithms, autonomous robotic systems and artificial intelligence. It
   discusses various approaches and theoretical and practical positions
   that argue and model the development of a socio-political organization
   in the digital era, and describe fundamental changes in political
   communication, law and order, public-power interaction, etc.
   The authors argue that the introduction of digital algorithms and
   robotic technologies radically changes the basic sociocultural meanings
   and the socio-political landscape, the formation of new types of social
   relations, where people, things, machines together form special modes of
   functioning, specific relations. The work proves that these cardinal
   changes require fundamentally new theoretical and methodological
   approaches to research, and new tools for political modeling and
   forecasting. The problems of legislative and ethical regulation of the
   processes of informatization and technological development of the
   society are discussed separately. The final part of the research shows
   that modernity poses the fundamental problem of correlating digital and
   socio-cultural trends in the development of political space, their
   contradictions and the inevitable convergence of socio-cultural,
   traditional socio-political dominants of development with digital trends
   and life forms. The article proves that harmonization of existing
   value-normative regulators and standards of digital algorithms and
   artificial intelligence systems being developed is necessary, since the
   latter can be a key guarantee for the formation of an effective system
   of social system development and its stability in the digital age.},

Title = {The unseen hands: Collaborative instrumental leadership in the British
   renegotiation case},
Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL RESEARCH},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {59},
Number = {2},
Pages = {444-464},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {The article contends that an important but overlooked explanation for
   the European Union's resilience in the past decade in the face of
   several existential crises has been the informal instrumental leadership
   roles played by EU institutional actors collaborating with each other.
   In this article, a theoretical framework is developed that can explain
   why EU governments, facing a crisis, would choose to informally delegate
   leadership tasks to a set of EU institutional actors. A three-part
   mechanism of collaborative instrumental leadership provided by
   institutions is devised that explains why governments informally
   delegate leadership tasks to EU institutions, and the effects of this
   informal delegation. The core of the article is a process-tracing case
   study that explores how collaborative instrumental leadership actually
   works. The case selected is the British renegotiation of their terms of
   membership in 2015-2016. While the case has become more-or-less
   forgotten because the shock `no' vote in the June 2016 Brexit referendum
   made its terms moot, the deal included quite exceptional reform
   proposals in which the EU bent over backwards to accommodate the United
   Kingdom, perhaps even going beyond the bounds of the EU Treaties
   themselves in the issue of immigration. Given this, analysing how
   collaborative instrumental leadership supplied by institutions
   contributed to producing the ambitious deal can shed light on the
   processes whereby intractable problems in the EU have been solved in the
   past decade.},

Abstract = {The EU's activation of Article 7 procedures against Hungary and Poland
   signals that it is beginning to take seriously the illiberal turn in
   Central Europe. However, the likelihood that the EU can restrain
   populist and illiberal tendencies in Hungary and Poland in the near
   future is slim. Despite the efficacy of the EU and other international
   organizations in promoting liberalism in these countries in the past,
   similar efforts are hobbled by a lack of political will and by
   significant bureaucratic hurdles. The impetus to protect the liberal

Abstract = {This article concerns the Islamic community in contemporary Russia and
   the dynamic identities of Muslim migrants there. The focus of this study
   is the religious and wider social practices of those Muslim migrants who
   are considered leaders of local micro-communities, enjoy respect within
   their religious community, and have steadfast religious authority within
   their circles. These practices are considered in their local religious
   and migrant contexts through the prism of such concepts as religious
   individualism, everyday lived Islam, and tactical religion. The author
   shows multiple ties that emerge between the region's Muslims,
   specifically between unofficial local leaders, and other believers who
   need this authority to elaborate their everyday Muslim practices in the
   context of migration and the authority crisis in Russian Islam. This
   study emphasizes the importance of the everyday in the formation of
   individual religiosity and shows how a local Muslim environment builds
   up around certain key figures outside the mosque.},

Abstract = {The partnership between Japan and India has steadily deepened since the
   formation of the second Abe administration. This article, through the
   analysis of Japan's India strategy, seeks to address how the
   Indo-Pacific idea has developed and what functions this policy idea has
   played in the development of Japan's India strategy. This article argues
   that the Indo-Pacific idea functioned as a linchpin to define goals the
   two countries would pursue and promote practical collaboration in
   various policy areas from the economy to security. Moreover, it worked
   as a normative weapon to diffuse specific values in dealing with
   maritime security and infrastructure development.},

Abstract = {Citizenship studies is highly relevant to understanding intersex,
   variations of sex characteristics (VSC), and Disorders of Sex
   Development (DSD), yet little scholarship exists to date about intersex
   citizenship. This article outlines and develops the foundations for a
   distinctive intersex citizenship studies, addressing health citizenship,
   children's citizenship, legal rights, and breaches of human rights
   experienced by intersex people and those with DSD. The paper presents
   original qualitative data from research in the UK, Italy and Switzerland
   with intersex people and their advocates, medics, and policy
   stakeholders. It shows that asserting citizenship is crucial for
   intersex people and those with VSC or DSD. This extremely marginalised
   population require social, intimate, children's and health citizenship.
   Intersex citizenship addresses both medical and human rights issues in
   an integrated way.},

Abstract = {This article asks if low political competition is associated with more
   restricted public procurement processes. Using unique Swedish municipal
   data from 2009 to 2015, it demonstrates that when one party dominates
   local politics, noncompetitive outcomes from public procurement
   processes are more common. What is most striking is that the risk of
   receiving only one bid, on what is intended to be an open and
   competitive tender, considerably increases with long-standing one-party
   rule. The article contributes to a significant body of work on the
   detrimental effects of low political competition, and the results are
   particularly interesting from a comparative perspective because
   Sweden-an old democracy with a meritocratic bureaucracy, characterized
   by low levels of corruption and clientelism-is a highly unlikely case in
   which to find such tendencies.},

Volume = {47},

Abstract = {In recent years irregular immigration has attracted increasing scholarly
   attention. Current academic debate casts the irregular immigrant in the
   role of the new political subject who acts out a right to have rights
   and/or as the rightless victim who is subjected to violence and abuse.
   However, the conception of the irregular immigrant as harbinger of
   political change and/or victim reifies the persistent dichotomy between
   inclusion and exclusion. It ignores that irregular immigrants are not by
   definition excluded from a normal life and that numerous immigrants live
   in the interstices between full legal inclusion and exclusion without
   democratic legal order being cast to ruin. The question that underlies
   this essay is: What concept of law can accommodate the unauthorized
   presence of immigrants (i) without reducing them to bare life,
   struggling to survive and/or assigning them a political agency and (ii)
   without taking recourse to the use of force and violence in a
   zero-tolerance policy? To answer this question, this article draws on
   what Agamben has coined the potentiality of the law and unpacks Judith
   Shklar's idea of different degrees of legalism.},

Title = {Polarization and correct voting in US presidential elections},
Journal = {ELECTORAL STUDIES},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {60},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Although some political pundits have expressed concern that political
   polarization has a deleterious effect on voter behavior, others have
   argued that polarization may actually benefit voters by presenting
   citizens with clear choices between the two major parties. We take up
   this question by examining the effects of polarization on the quality of
   voter decision making in U.S. presidential elections. We find that
   ideological polarization among elites, along with ideological sorting
   and affective polarization among voters, all contribute to the
   probability of citizens' voting correctly. Furthermore, affective
   polarization among the citizenry if anything strengthens, not weakens,
   the influence of political knowledge on voter decision-making. We
   conclude that to the extent that normative democratic theory supposes
   that people vote for candidates who share their interests, polarization
   has had a positive effect on voter decision-making quality, and thus
   democratic representation, in the United States.},

Abstract = {This article explores the different ways governments express dissent in
   the Council of the European Union (EU) through `No' votes, abstentions
   and recorded negative statements. A game-theoretical model is presented
   that studies voting behaviour and analyses how the national parliaments'
   levels of control over their governments' EU policies affect it. It is
   concluded that governments that are strongly controlled by their
   parliaments are not more likely to express dissent. However, when they
   do express dissent, they vote `No' more often. Parliamentary control
   depends on the presence of formal oversight institutions as well as the
   motivation of parliamentarians to hold their governments accountable.
   Empirical support is found in an analysis of votes on 1,387 legislative
   proposals that represent more than a decade of Council decision making
   in the period 2004-2014. This article contributes to the discussion on
   the involvement of national parliaments in EU affairs, and clearly
   distinguishes the different forms of dissent in Council decision making.},

Abstract = {In some of the most established and supposedly immutable liberal
   democracies, diverse social groups are losing confidence not only in
   established democratic institutions, but in the idea of liberal
   representative democracy itself. Meanwhile, an illiberal and
   anti-egalitarian transformation of democracy evolves at an apparently
   unstoppable pace. This democratic fatigue syndrome, the present article
   suggests, is qualitatively different from the crises of democracy which
   have been debated for some considerable time. Focusing on mature
   democracies underpinned by the ideational tradition of European
   Enlightenment, the article theorizes this syndrome and the striking
   transformation of democracy in terms of a dialectic process in which the
   very norm that once gave birth to the democratic project - the modernist
   idea of the autonomous subject - metamorphoses into its gravedigger, or
   at least into the driver of its radical reformulation. The article
   further develops aspects of my existing work on second-order
   emancipation and simulative democracy. Taking a theoretical rather than
   empirical approach, it aims to provide a conceptual framework for more
   empirically oriented analyses of changing forms of political
   articulation and participation.},

Abstract = {Despite the recent multiplication of publications on populism, an area
   that remains underexplored is the relationship between populism and the
   politics of insecurity, which refers to how perceived collective threats
   are framed and acted upon. The main objective of this article is to
   formulate an ideational framework for the analysis of populism as it
   intersects with the politics of insecurity. More specifically, the
   article focuses on right-wing populism, turning to the framing of
   migrants in the United States during the Trump presidency to illustrate
   specific claims about the relationship between populism and the politics
   of insecurity. As argued, the political framing of collective threats is
   a central aspect of populism. The role of framing points to the
   ideational side of populism, which is not a coherent ideology but a type
   of discourse through which perceived threats are strategically framed to
   both exacerbate collective insecurity and gather popular support by
   promising to shield citizens against these threats.},

Abstract = {This article revisits theoretical claims that separation of power
   systems will display an inverse relationship between presidential power
   and party strength. Shugart and Carey posited this as a general
   equilibrium within presidential democracies; later, Shugart proposed
   that the inverse relationship resulted from founding institutional
   choices shaped in turn by modes of democratic transition. We test both
   the equilibrium and the genetic versions of the inverse relationship on
   a large-N dataset of presidential systems from 1900 to 2016. We find
   strong significant empirical support for an inverse relationship between
   executive power and party system institutionalization. However, the
   relationship is more dynamic than would be predicted by theories based
   on institutional foundings alone. Through analysis of decree reform in
   Argentina and Brazil, we observe changes in the expected inverse
   relationship despite the absence of a constitutional assembly and the
   lack of any change in electoral rules or party authority.},

Abstract = {This article investigates the impact of policy complexity on the
   duration of legislative negotiations in the European Union employing
   survival analysis. We conceptualize policy complexity as a
   three-dimensional construct encompassing structural, linguistic and
   relational components. Building on this conceptual framework, we measure
   the complexity of 889 Commission proposals published under the ordinary
   legislative procedure between 2009 and 2018. Controlling for
   institutional and political drivers of legislative duration identified
   by previous studies, we show that different types of policy complexity
   influence the duration of the decision-making process in the European
   Union to varying degrees, at different points in time and partially in
   unexpected ways. On a general level, our study highlights that
   developing a better understanding of the origins and consequences of
   policy complexity in the European Union is a key task for scholars of
   European integration.},

Abstract = {How do voters evaluate women candidates in places where traditional
   gender norms are strong? We conduct a survey experiment in Malawi to
   assess both whether citizens discriminate against women candidates and
   how other salient candidate characteristics-political experience, family
   status, policy focus, and gendered kinship practices-interact with
   candidate gender to affect citizen support. Contrary to our
   expectations, we find citizens prefer women candidates ceteris paribus,
   and women and men with the same traits are evaluated similarly. Yet, we
   find two unexpected ways women candidates are disadvantaged in the
   electoral process. First, we find that citizens prefer candidates who
   are married with young children, a profile much more common among men
   than women candidates in practice. Second, we find pervasive qualitative
   reports of negative campaigning that likely affected citizens'
   evaluations of actual women candidates, while not affecting evaluations
   of hypothetical candidates. We discuss how our results speak to the ways
   gender biases operate in practice across political contexts.},

Abstract = {The extant theory of ethnic defection rests on the importance of ethnic
   identity shift and loyalism toward the regime, which were thus far
   presented as key explanations of side switching in ethnic conflicts.
   This article challenges the validity of these claims and proposes an
   alternative theoretical argument. This study argues that individuals
   mobilize against their coethnics on the side of government that
   explicitly challenges and opposes ethnonationalist aspirations of their
   own ethnic group due to perceived obligation of ethnic responsibility to
   protect their ethnic values. Ethnic defection is likely to occur when
   and if the rebels are suspected by their coethnics of violating or
   disregarding sociocultural, ideological, or religious values of their
   ethnic group. Third-party prorebel intervention is likely to further
   aggravate or even trigger ethnic defection. This argument is examined
   empirically in the case of progovernment mobilization during East
   Ukraine conflict in 2014 to 2015. Microlevel interview data from Ukraine
   demonstrate that Ukrainian Russian speakers mobilized for the government
   side, driven by the strong sense of ethnic responsibility, engendered in
   the perception that separatists misrepresent ethnic values of Ukraine's
   Russian speakers.},

Abstract = {University campus is not a violence free space; therefore, how do
   universities deal with this problem? This research note presents the
   results of a critical analysis of prevention and action protocols
   against sexual violence in Catalan public universities. Particular
   attention is given to the potentialities and shortcomings of such
   measures. The first section introduces the research that serves as a
   framework of this study. namely the European project ``Universities
   Supporting Victims of Sexual Violence: Training for Sustainable Services
   (USVReact){''}, as well as the methodology used. Next, we focus our
   attention on the legislation in which university policies on sexual and
   gender violence are grounded. Finally, we present the results of our
   analysis of the protocols. This work shows that sexual violence in
   Catalan universities remains a quite unknown and underestimated issue
   that has not yet received the required response.},

Abstract = {This article draws on major theories of committee organization to
   explain committee chair selection in contexts with high informational
   and organizational constraints. We test our theoretical expectations
   through a series of fixed effects conditional logit models run on an
   original data set which includes all legislators who have served in the
   Romanian Chamber of Deputies from 1992 to 2012. The findings indicate
   that sector knowledge matters more for committee chair selection in the
   first post-communist terms, while chair seniority and party credentials
   acquire relevance later on. The effect of sector knowledge is stronger
   than that of chair seniority for the committees that the members of
   parliament perceive to be the most important, while party leaders have
   privileged access to the chair position irrespective of how salient the
   committee is.},

Abstract = {To what extent does the economic crisis affect support for political
   protest? Since the outburst of the financial crisis in 2008 many
   protests have been mobilized against national governments and their
   austerity policies. In some countries, these actions were described in
   the media as having little support among the general public, while
   elsewhere these actions enjoyed significant public support. Surprisingly
   little scholarly work has examined this variation. We fill this research
   gap by investigating who approves of austerity protests, how bystanders'
   attitudes differ from the activists' approval of protests and how
   repertoires relate to the approval of austerity protests. The analysis
   uses original survey data from nine European countries affected by the
   recent economic crisis at varying degrees and demonstrates that protest
   experience, both at the country and individual level, relates to
   approval of anti-austerity protests. The severity of economic crisis
   increases is positively related to protest approval in general terms,
   but there are differences depending on the type of grievances and which
   forms of austerity protests are considered.},

Abstract = {Whilst much of the contemporary debate on regime change remains
   concentrated on transitions to and from democracy, this paper focuses on
   autocracy-to-autocracy transitions, a relatively understudied but
   particularly relevant phenomenon. Building on an updated typology of
   non-democratic regimes and through a qualitative case-by-case
   assessment, the present paper identifies 21 transitions from one
   dictatorship to another, out of 32 cases of autocratic breakdown during
   the 2000-15 period. Hence, after the fall of a dictatorship, the
   installation of a new authoritarian regime was almost twice as likely as
   democratization. Accordingly, the paper focuses on the 21 recorded
   autocracy-to-autocracy transitions and examines in which non-democratic
   regimes a transition from an autocracy to another is more likely to
   occur, which peculiar forms of authoritarian rule tend to be installed,
   and the specific ways in which the dismantling of the previous existing
   authoritarian rule is achieved.},

Abstract = {Scholars have identified many ways that politicians use carrots, such as
   vote buying, to mobilize voters, but have paid far less attention to how
   they use sticks, such as voter intimidation. This article develops a
   simple argument which suggests that voter intimidation should be
   especially likely where vote buying is expensive and employers have
   greater leverage over employees. Using survey experiments and
   crowd-sourced electoral violation reports from the 2011-12 election
   cycle in Russia, the study finds evidence consistent with these claims.
   Moreover, it finds that where employers have less leverage over
   employees, active forms of monitoring may supplement intimidation in
   order to encourage compliance. These results suggest that employers can
   be reliable vote brokers; that voter intimidation can persist in a
   middle-income country; and that, under some conditions, intimidation may
   be employed without the need for active monitoring.},

Abstract = {Pinning down the role of social ties in the decision to protest has been
   notoriously elusive, largely due to data limitations. Social media and
   their global use by protesters offer an unprecedented opportunity to
   observe real-time social ties and online behavior, though often without
   an attendant measure of real-world behavior. We collect data on Twitter
   activity during the 2015 Charlie Hebdo protest in Paris, which,
   unusually, record real-world protest attendance and network structure
   measured beyond egocentric networks. We devise a test of social theories
   of protest that hold that participation depends on exposure to others'
   intentions and network position determines exposure. Our findings are
   strongly consistent with these theories, showing that protesters are
   significantly more connected to one another via direct, indirect,
   triadic, and reciprocated ties than comparable nonprotesters. These
   results offer the first large-scale empirical support for the claim that
   social network structure has consequences for protest participation.},

Abstract = {Across a broad range of fields in political science, there are many
   theoretically interesting dependent variables that can be characterized
   as compositions. We build on recent work that has developed strategies
   for modeling variation in such variables over time by extending them to
   models of time series cross-sectional data. We discuss how researchers
   can incorporate the influence of contextual variables and spatial
   relationships into such models. To demonstrate the utility of our
   proposed strategies, we present a methodological illustration using an
   analysis of budgetary expenditures in the US states.},
