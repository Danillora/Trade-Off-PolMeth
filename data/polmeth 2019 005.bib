Abstract = {Why have growth rates diverged between India and Pakistan since the
   1990s? This article argues that differences in perceptions of political
   instability through the locations of political violence in the two
   countries have impacted growth through investment decisions. In
   Pakistan, kidnapping and terrorism in major cities has led to the
   domination of rent-implicated investment, thus limiting growth. In
   India, by contrast, political violence in the periphery or targeting
   minorities remains socially distant to the perspectives of investors,
   leading to more productive investments, and thus higher growth. The
   article provides a new set of explanations for differences in growth
   among middle-income countries by highlighting political instability and
   the salience of violence, the demand for rents as investments, and the
   limits of institutional explanations for growth outcomes.},

Abstract = {What explains rising partisan animosity in the United States? We argue
   that mass partisans' feelings toward the social group coalitions of the
   parties are an important cause of rising affective polarization. We
   first leverage evidence from the American National Election Study (ANES)
   Time Series to show that partisans' feelings toward the social groups
   linked to their in-party (out-party) have grown more positive (negative)
   over time. We then turn to the 1992-96 and 2000-2004 ANES Panel Surveys
   to disentangle the interrelationship between partisan polarization and
   social group evaluations. Individuals with more polarized social group
   evaluations in 1992 or 2000 report substantially more polarized party
   thermometer ratings and more extreme, and better sorted, partisan
   identities four years later. Notably, these variables exerted little
   reciprocal influence on group evaluations. Our study has important
   implications for understanding affective polarization and the role of
   social groups in public opinion.},

Abstract = {Political principals often face information deficits. This is especially
   true of the US judicial hierarchy; extant theories of ideological
   monitoring in this setting have therefore explored informational cues
   such as lower court ideology or dissent. Canonical models of this
   setting, however, have omitted litigants, implicity assuming they are
   not an important source of information. This paper develops a formal
   model that considers whether litigants can credibly signal information
   about noncompliance, and how litigants' signals interact with the cues
   of ideology and dissent. The model shows that litigant signals can be
   highly informative about doctrinal compliance, sometimes even crowding
   out the need for other signals. By contrast, litigants face difficulty
   communicating information about case importance; dissent, however, can
   be highly informative on this dimension. Accordingly, some informational
   cues may only influence limited aspects of the high court's case
   selection process.},

Abstract = {Laws that restrict and disclose the actions of lobbyists are attempts to
   protect elected officials from undue influence and preserve public trust
   in lawmaking processes. Imposing too many campaign finance restrictions
   and reporting requirements on registered interest groups, however, might
   discourage them from registering. I use an original data set compiled
   from several decades of lobbyist lists to determine whether these laws
   suppress registration rates among interest groups. More limits on
   campaign finance activities, but not heavier reporting burdens, are
   shown to be associated with depressed registration of interest groups.
   As unregistered interests are not subject to these regulations, this
   presents a paradox of political reform. Reformers can either restrict
   the campaign finance activities of organized interests or disclose their
   lobbying activities more fully, but not both. I provide estimated totals
   of registered interest groups given a set of laws that maximizes
   compliance.},

Abstract = {Government instability (cabinet duration) is an important feature of
   parliamentary democracy. Over time, the research on cabinet duration has
   improved in technical and theoretical sophistication. However, we note
   that little attention has been paid to the relationship between
   governments and the state itself. Our main hypothesis is that state
   capacity, e.g., factors such as state bureaucratic effectiveness and law
   and order, shape how easy it is for governments to implement the new
   policy and thus how well they can achieve policy objectives. We also
   argue that when state capacity is low, the ability to adequately respond
   to external shocks goes down, and instability increases. When testing
   this empirically we find that low state capacity does indeed help us
   predict an increased risk for early termination-in particular, whether
   the government ends through a replacement (but not by an early
   election). Using interaction effects, we also demonstrate that the
   effect of external shocks, such as an increase in unemployment, is
   conditional on state capacity. An increase in unemployment only has a
   significant effect on cabinet stability when state capacity is low,
   suggesting that the cabinet's (in)ability to address the economic
   problems is an important factor for understating cabinet durability.},

Abstract = {This article adds to the refinement of the concept of party
   institutionalization by focusing on its multilevel character, capturing
   possible variation between the institutionalization of the party elite
   and a party's base. Hence, we argue that debates around party
   institutionalization as an analytical concept can profit from clarifying
   whose behavior we actually theorize when specifying and operationalizing
   the concept's various dimensions. We illustrate this by focusing on
   different configurations of the internal property of routinization, more
   specifically, the presence or absence of elite-level and of base-level
   routinization. We hypothesize that distinct combinations influence
   whether and to which extent a party's overall organization can be
   considered routinized or not, which, in turn, affects
   intra-organizational dynamics. We illustrate the usefulness of our
   conceptual distinctions using comparative case studies of parties
   characterized by either elite-level or base-level routinization-from
   both established and new democracies-to illustrate each dimension's
   distinct implications for patterns of intra-party conflict and
   stability.},

Abstract = {In Stephen Skowronek's political time schema, Warren G. Harding is a
   regime manager tasked with restoring the Republican regime established
   by William McKinley after Woodrow Wilson's interregnum. Harding faced a
   particularly interesting decision, for although McKinley was the founder
   of the modern post-Gilded Age Republican regime, his successor, Theodore
   Roosevelt, was clearly a more dynamic and disruptive force in the party.
   The overlooked figure in this sequence, however, is William Howard
   Taft-in some ways a throwback to a pre-Roosevelt president, but one who
   prosecuted a reform policy agenda. Presented with three different models
   of presidential leadership, Harding ignored the progressive conservatism
   of Taft and returned to a mistakenly Whiggish view of McKinley's
   leadership. The result was a lost opportunity for Republicans in the
   1920s, setting up their repudiation in 1932.},

Abstract = {Previous work on political tolerance has overwhelmingly focused on
   established democracies. Consequently, our knowledge continues to be
   limited with regard to the drivers of tolerance in less democratic
   transitional and nondemocratic settings. In this paper, we examine what
   could best promote tolerance of least-favored political groups in such
   contexts. We use a survey experiment in Egypt to test competing theories
   through exposing respondents to different primes, emphasizing the
   importance of tolerance on the basis of religious, economic, or
   government endorsements. Respondents were then asked questions to gauge
   their tolerance levels toward their least-favored group. We control for
   the level of trust in government, religiosity, interpersonal trust,
   contact, and political knowledge. Our data show soaring levels of
   intolerance among Egyptians. However, we found evidence that priming
   respondents with the economic benefits of having a tolerant society is
   the most effective way to promote tolerant attitudes, especially among
   those with lower levels of education and younger age groups.
   Additionally, our analysis demonstrated that respondents' level of trust
   in government has a strong effect on tolerance attitudes.},

   specifically, whether voters are more likely to support legislators with
   similar personality traits to their own, who would presumably have
   similar process preferences, or legislators with valence personality
   traits, regardless of congruence, which are associated with better
   leadership. We first revisit the measurement validity of voter
   assessments of legislator personality in the 2014 and 2016 Cooperative
   Congressional Election Studies to demonstrate that such survey items are
   meaningful. Subsequently, we use these data to construct measures of
   personality congruence and valence and apply them to predict voters' job
   approval of legislators. Our results support the claim that voters
   evaluate legislators' job performance on the basis of perceived valence
   traits rather than legislators' congruence to voters' own personality
   dispositions.},

Abstract = {While the merits and perils of privatization have remained a contentious
   and often polarizing debate, privatization of public services remains
   commonplace throughout the world. For instance, over the last several
   decades, U.S. governments at all levels have routinely pursued
   contracting arrangements for corrections management, known popularly as
   prison privatization. In this article, state prison privatization (SPP)
   is examined in three ways. First, we use an externally focused policy
   diffusion framework to help explain the adoption of SPP-enabling
   legislation across U.S. states. Second, we explore the extent to which
   the American Legislative Exchange Council has influenced the adoption of
   prison privatization legislation. Third, we explore the role of state
   wealth inequality in determining a state's propensity to adopt prison
   privatization policies. Examining state-level data from 1979 to 2010,
   this article finds empirical support for each of these key theoretical
   assertions. Furthermore, we find evidence that the external diffusion
   effect may vary depending on the political orientation of the state.},

Abstract = {This article explicates Tocqueville's famous assertion that ``a new
   political science is needed for a world entirely new{''} by drawing a
   contrast with the old political science to be superseded. Part One
   establishes the evidence, contextual and textual, for the claim that the
   old political science to which Tocqueville refers is the Enlightenment
   project as interpreted by the self-proclaimed heirs of the philosophes
   in the revolutionary generation: the Ideologues. Part Two argues that
   taking this foil seriously allows us to see the novelties associated
   with Tocqueville's new democratic political science: the ways in which
   he hoped to avoid the dangerous temptations and seductions of the old
   and his subtle moralized interpretation of interet bien entendu. Much
   impressive recent scholarship recovers the importance of Tocqueville's
   aristocratic interlocutors; this article argues that he was also in
   veiled conversation with liberals of a particularly democratic and
   utilitarian kind, and that he self-consciously adopted their idealism
   and assumed their mantle.},

Abstract = {Existing research on party behaviour has largely focused on the drivers
   of issue salience in direct party communication. However, less is known
   about party-issue linkages in election campaigns covered by the mass
   media, from which most voters get their information about party
   positions. Against this background, this article explores how two
   important drivers of issue salience in direct party communication -
   issue ownership and systemic salience - play out in the media. Based on
   considerations about the news value of specific party-issue
   associations, one would expect both relationships to be particularly
   important in the media. Despite substantial similarities in party-issue
   linkages across platforms, a comparison of manifestos and newspaper
   content reveals evidence for this claim. In particular, smaller parties
   are hardly covered in the news on issues they do not own, while large
   parties are especially covered on salient topics. These findings
   contribute to our understanding of issue competition in mediated
   environments.},

Abstract = {Satisfaction with democracy is driven by the two mechanisms that affect
   citizens' income: the market and the state. When people consider that
   the levels of economic growth and redistribution are sufficient, they
   are more satisfied with the performance of democratic institutions. This
   relationship is moderated by personal income: since low-income citizens
   are more sensitive to changes in personal economic circumstances than
   high-income citizens, they give more weight to economic perceptions and
   opinions about redistribution. In this paper evidence is found of this
   conditional relationship in survey data from 16 established democracies.
   The results offer a rich characterisation of the state and market-based
   mechanisms that affect satisfaction with democracy.},

   political actors in the cities of Bogota and Medellin between 1998 and
   2015, based on the bibliographic inspection. This review includes the
   results on the ballot boxes, the discursive language and the analysis of
   the electoral data of Municipal and Town Council. The paper shows
   similar political processes and deep differences. The most important of
   these, shows the political party forces would no threatened the domain
   of the non-two-party options and clearly biased to the left since 2003
   and 2015 for the Bogota Government. On the other hand, in Medellin the
   traditional parties maintain high possibilities to return, that in fact
   obtain good results in some of the electoral events after the creation
   of new successful political forces.},

Abstract = {This paper lays out the perceptions of three different regions to
   describe Chinese perspectives on the 2014 Scottish Independence
   Referendum. Mainstream newspapers, cyber-opinions, and scholarly
   writings are three vectors to assess Mainland Chinese perception.
   Considering the limited number of academic reports about the referendum
   in Taiwan and Hong Kong, compared to that on the mainland, our
   conclusion about their perceptions is primarily based on mainstream
   newspapers. The article identifies two ideologically opposed
   perspectives. On the one hand, the dominant view in Mainland China (and
   in mainstream newspapers in Hong Kong and Taiwan) framed the referendum
   in negative terms, presenting it as a `threat' and a `problem'. On the
   other hand, the dominant view in Hong Kong and Taiwan praised the
   Scottish referendum as a model of participatory democracy. These
   contrasting perspectives are deeply rooted in distinctive ideologies and
   historical experiences.},

Abstract = {This paper challenges the tendency among contemporary historians and
   political scientists to read secularism and religion in Australian
   political history in binary terms. It is argued that this framework is
   anachronistic, creating a barrier to a proper appreciation of religion
   in Australian political history. In keeping with much British
   Enlightenment thinking, religion through much of Australia's history was
   deemed to have great social utility and its promotion was of central
   secular significance. This understanding framed the education debates of
   the second half of the nineteenth century as well as the social welfare
   reforms and institution building around the Federation period. Such
   developments cast doubt on claims that secularism of an exclusionary
   kind is a key element of the now widely invoked category of the
   Australian settlement.},

Abstract = {Democracy promotion through economic sanctions has become commonplace.
   Previous studies argue that an important challenge to the effectiveness
   of democratic sanctions is the contravening support of black knights.
   However, these studies underestimate conflicting interests between the
   target and its black knight. In this paper, I propose a bargaining model
   for understanding how targets obtain support from black knights. The
   target's main source of bargaining power is its threat to defect from
   the black knight and obtain support from an international rival.
   However, the credibility of this threat decreases with democratic
   sanctions because they hinder cooperation with a likely source of
   support, namely the sender. Therefore, targets take steps towards
   democracy to improve their bargaining position relative to the black
   knight. To probe my argument, I conduct a deep single case study of EU
   sanctions against Belarus between 2004 and 2016 with Russia as a black
   knight. Sanctions should have no effect in this paradigmatic case of
   black knight support. Yet, there is substantial evidence that democratic
   sanctions have increased the cost of electoral fraud and state
   repression in Belarus. This indicates that the conflicting interests of
   targets and their black knights provide windows of opportunity for
   democracy promotion.},

Abstract = {The article critically examines the South African Constitutional Court
   (ZACC) case law and doctrine on section 24 (right to an environment) of
   the Constitution of South Africa. It argues that the right has been left
   normatively impoverished, and especially the interaction and
   relationship with the cornerstone statute, the National Environmental
   Management Act (NEMA) remains unclear. This issue centres specifically
   around three core issues. First, it has not been settled whether section
   24 encompasses an individual right and an additional positive
   obligation, or constitutes a composite right. Second, the individual
   right contained in section 24 requires further definition and
   clarification. Key terms have not been given distinctive constitutional
   contours, and it remains uncertain to what extent legislative
   instruments such as NEMA are legitimately filling these gaps. Finally,
   it is unclear how the principle of constitutional subsidiarity applies
   to section 24 of the Constitution. Even assuming that the principle
   applies in essentially the same way as to other constitutional
   provisions, one cannot reasonably determine whether ordinary legislation
   reflects and gives effect to a constitutional right, if one has no clear
   notion of the latter's content.},

Abstract = {In the past year, academics and mass media alike have spoken of populism
   as a necessary condition for Donald Trump's success in the 2016 US
   presidential election. Despite the growing interest in populism for
   understanding the election, we have yet to provide a systematic analysis
   of the official campaign discourse and its use of populist rhetoric. To
   fill this gap, this article proposes an analysis of official campaign
   statements based on original text data from press releases published
   from January to June 2016 on campaign websites and tweets published on
   the official accounts of the three main presidential candidates: Hillary
   Clinton, Bernie Sanders, and Donald Trump. Data show that the Sanders
   and Trump campaigns relied on populist discourse to promote two opposing
   electoral agendas on the left and the right of the political spectrum.
   Clinton made limited use of populist discourse, mostly in response to
   the other counter-candidates.},

Abstract = {Presidential candidacies make part of the political elite, however the
   main studies have generally addressed this topic under the frame of
   electoral behavior, and not from the elite theory. This article aims to
   identify, through logistic regression analyses, which socio-demographic
   characteristics are more advantageous to win an election. It does not
   intend to explain the vote, but to define tendencies of electoral
   victory or defeat based on the profile of the candidacies; this is a
   study on political elites, not on electoral behavior. For this purpose,
   we built a database of 388 Latin American presidential candidacies from
   1993 to 2017. Once we have identified the most relevant aspects that the
   literature has pointed out, we present a methodological design that
   incorporates, in addition to individual factors, working as control
   variables, structural factors too, such as parties and party systems,
   officialism-opposition, and the level of socio-economic development.
   Results show that having relatives in political positions, links to
   large companies, or occupying high positions of political
   responsibility, significantly increase the probability of winning the
   presidential elections. Finally, the conclusions and the agenda for
   future research are presented.},

Abstract = {Bob Deacon's study of the Social Protection Floors initiative, led by
   the International Labour Organisation (ILO), entailed a pioneering study
   of the making of global social policy. Just how global is this `global
   social policy' in terms of both its making and its subsequent diffusion?
   African governments were minimally involved in the making of this global
   social policy. Most seem to have acquiesced in this global
   policy-making, as they have with other `global' declarations, in the
   expectation that it would have little effect on them. Nor, in Southern
   Africa, is there clear evidence of any significant effect. Even the
   social protection strategy documents adopted by either the African Union
   or national governments, typically written by external consultants, have
   generally avoided direct use of the concept of the social protection
   floor, while reiterating the commitment to `comprehensive' (and
   appropriate) social protection that predated the ILO-led initiative. The
   trajectory of actual policy reform in Southern African countries does
   not appear to have changed. There continues to be a disjuncture between
   `global social policy' at the global and African levels.},

Abstract = {This article presents the first cross-sectional analysis of attitudes
   toward Franklin Delano Roosevelt's Court-packing plan and seeks to
   evaluate whether citizens viewed this episode through a partisan or
   constitutional lens. While public opinion opposed the Supreme Court's
   invalidation of the New Deal, most Americans also opposed Court packing
   as a means to resolve this constitutional conflict. Instead, the
   analysis finds significantly more support for a New Deal constitutional
   amendment across most subgroups, including Democrats and individuals who
   believed the Constitution is too difficult to amend. These results not
   only inform debates about New Deal constitutionalism, but also they
   provide context for recent discussions about court packing, as
   constitutional norms continue to erode under Donald Trump.},

Abstract = {This article addresses long-standing challenges in conceptualizing
   andmeasuring de/centralization in unitary and federal systems. It first
   outlines a novel conceptualization of de/centralization and its relation
   to the unitary/federal distinction and a/symmetry, from which it derives
   static and dynamic typologies of state structures. Building on a
   critical review of the Regional Authority Index, the article develops a
   scheme for measuring de/centralization and applies it to map state
   structures in Western Europe from 1950 to 2015. This mapping exercise
   shows that the proposed scheme yields more accurate measures of
   de/centralization than existing indices and that de/centralization
   differs in kind, rather than merely in degree, between unitary and
   federal states. By enabling a more effective classification of cases in
   comparative analysis, the article offers a tool on which theoretical and
   empirical advances in understanding the causes and effects of state
   structures can be built.},

Abstract = {Previous studies have largely overlooked three key components of a
   scandal that could determine how it shapes election outcomes: the extent
   to which it is covered in the media, the potential that donors respond
   differently than voters, and the likelihood that the impact of scandals
   have changed over time. Examining U.S. House scandals between 1980 and
   2010, we find that while scandal-tainted politicians receive fewer votes
   and are less likely to win than otherwise similar legislators not
   embroiled in scandal, donors actually contribute more money to their
   campaigns after the scandal's revelation. Both of these effects,
   however, are limited to financial and sex scandals that garnered
   national media attention. Moreover, we find that voters are less
   punitive and donors are even more supportive in the post-1994 period of
   nationalized electoral politics.},

Abstract = {The article focuses on public school policy in Iceland, in a historical
   perspective, the teacher' s role and contemporary challenges in the
   school system. Attention is paid to the increased complexity of
   teachers' role as educators and that of guarding the welfare and
   well-being of the individual schoolchild. The ongoing changes in
   teachers' role are related to changed social and family conditions
   coinciding with development in society and (human service) welfare
   institutions. This may especially regard school children when confronted
   by crises in their parents' lives or other unexpected, harmful
   situations in their personal life. Results from Icelandic research on
   current socio-educational conditions of schoolchildren and their
   families are presented. Increasing cooperation between school, health
   and social system with an interdisciplinary approach is advocated.
   Referring to present knowledge and call for revised legislation and
   policy issues some ideas of renewal of service are presented and
   discussed.},

Abstract = {The 2017 crisis in the Gulf region, emanating from the claims of Qatar
   supporting terrorism as well as Iran's regional interferences, created a
   critical split among the Gulf monarchies. The Trump administration,
   facing the Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and the United-Arab Emirates line on
   the one hand, and Qatar on the other, refrained from taking sides and
   made efforts to appease the tension in a peaceful manner. The purpose of
   this article is to understand the reasons behind the US' approach to the
   recent Gulf crisis from a historical perspective. The main argument of
   the article is that the recent US approach to the 2017 Gulf crisis is
   derived from the approach adopted by the Nixon administration in the
   wake of the British withdrawal from the Gulf. The article also argues
   that the above-mentioned approach constitutes an element of continuity
   in American foreign policy towards the Gulf. For this purpose, the basic
   sources used in this work are the declassified documents of American
   administration on the newly independent Gulf states in the wake of
   Britain's decision to withdraw from the Gulf. The main questions of the
   article are what kind of approach the US adopted towards the Gulf in
   this period that coincides with President Nixon's term, what were the
   causes of this approach and what kind of connection could be established
   between then and now.},

Abstract = {What happens after longstanding policies are overthrown in fierce
   political battles, events scholars refer to as punctuated equilibrium?
   Do these new policies remain static and unchanging until the next big
   punctuation, or do they continue to change in explainable and
   predictable ways? In this article, we develop a model of postpunctuation
   policy change grounded in theories of boundedly rational decision-making
   by policymakers. Uncertain about how well the new policy will perform,
   policymakers learn to rely on competing interest groups for information
   or, under certain circumstances, look to other political jurisdictions
   for cues on how their policies ought to be further refined. We test our
   predictions by studying changes in state charter school laws from 1996
   to 2014. We find evidence of policy change, and even convergence, across
   states suggesting that policies after punctuation do change in ways
   explained as reactions to political pressures in an environment fraught
   with uncertainty.},

Volume = {41},

Abstract = {Tests of theories of the electoral origins of divided government hinge
   on the proper measurement of voter preferences for divided government.
   Deriving preferences for divided government from voters' ideological
   positions or responses to the standard American National Election
   Studies question inflates estimates of the proportion of people who
   prefer divided government. We present two alternative survey measures of
   preferences for divided government and evaluate the measures across
   multiple surveys. We find that the percentage of voters who prefer
   divided government is smaller than previous studies suggest. Voters who
   prefer divided government according to the new measures are
   significantly more likely than other voters to vote in ways that create
   divided government in both presidential year and midterm congressional
   elections.},

Volume = {49},

Abstract = {This paper focuses on the reasons that Italian interest groups decide to
   lobby together with like-minded groups ('friends'), or engage in
   networking activity with groups that have conflicting interests
   ('foes'), in order to influence public policy. How often do Italian
   interest groups recur to these lobbying strategies? What favours the
   construction of a coalition of more or less different interest groups
   lobbying on a particular issue? What, on the contrary, influences the
   decision to lobby individually? In order to answer these questions,
   original data coming from a national survey conducted on 1277 Italian
   interest groups are provided. Empirical results are interesting: from a
   descriptive point of view, business groups are more likely to engage in
   joint lobbying than other group types, whereas the same holds true for
   unions with respect to networking with rival organizations. From an
   explanatory point of view, groups that perceive themselves to be
   threatened by rivals' influence in policymaking, or by environmental
   challenges, are more likely to work in coalitions and to engage in
   networking: resources do not matter in `absolute' and `objective' terms,
   but in `relative' and `subjective' ones.},

Abstract = {Which leadership qualities are most likely to be emphasized in news
   reports about leadership competitions, and are they attributed
   differently to women and men candidates? To answer this question, we
   conducted content and discourse analyses of 2,463 articles published by
   the Globe and Mail newspaper on 10 women and 17 men seeking the
   leadership of Canadian political parties since 1975. Our results show
   that women candidates were subjected to more negative and gendered
   assessments of their communication skills, intellectual substance and
   political experience than were men candidates. We also found little
   evidence that gendered media discourses about political leadership have
   changed over time, especially in the case of women in the strongest
   position to become the country's first national party leader or prime
   minister.},

Abstract = {Fundamental changes are taking place both within national borders and on
   the international stage. While technological advances are accelerating
   globalization, which brings all the nations closer together, the
   resurgence of populism, protectionism and nationalism is causing greater
   divisions along racial, ethnic, and national lines. The spectacular rise
   of China and the growing weight of developing nations as a whole are
   changing the world's geopolitical and geoeconomic landscapes,
   constraining the West's influence in global affairs and strengthening
   the developing world's capacity in bargaining with advanced economies.
   In a new era of growing uncertainty and unpredictability, leadership and
   vision are the most valuable assets for any great power that seeks to
   shape a new world order according to its grand blueprints. From the
   Chinese perspective, an era of uncertainty does not only imply hidden
   risks and threats, but may also bring forth unprecedented strategic
   opportunities. Standing on the threshold of a new era with ever more
   readiness to claim its rightful place in the world, China is in the best
   position since the beginning of its modern history to play a significant
   role in fostering a new, truly multilateral order.},

Volume = {42},

Abstract = {EU actorness even in turbulent times has been re-affirmed by a largely
   overlooked phenomenon - namely, the emergence of the EU as an agent of
   collective securitisation. The fundamental claim of securitisation
   theory is that threat emergence and management are shaped by the actions
   of a securitising agent that explicitly links together the social
   construction of the threat with socially acceptable governance or policy
   measures. This concluding piece of the Special Issue proceeds from the
   twin assumptions that securitisation is possible within the EU space and
   that securitisation affects the nature and modalities of EU security
   governance across different policy domains. The concept of collective
   securitisation which frames these assumptions thus broadens our
   understanding of the EU as a security actor. Summarising the main
   findings of the Special Issue, the article first revisits the case-study
   evidence and then offers reflections on how collective securitisation
   relates to securitisation theory more broadly.},

Abstract = {Does military spending exacerbate income inequality? After the Cold War,
   many developed countries sought to reduce military expenditures in the
   face of a new security environment without the clear and present threat
   of large-scale international conflict. The literature has presented
   mixed evidence on the economic effects of military spending. Moreover,
   during this era analysts in the OECD have become preoccupied with the
   economic indicator of income equality. Our study examines the
   relationship between military expenditures and income inequality.
   Complementing the established literature on the subject, we find that
   these two phenomena indeed possess a positive relationship and it is
   unlikely that this association is due to random chance. Our results are
   robust to the inclusion of control variables common in the literature.
   These findings lead us to contemplate the historical and theoretical
   account of the peace dividend narrative.},

Abstract = {The aim of this article is to investigate whether or not and how
   immigration policies affect immigration flows. Such policy impacts have
   hardly been investigated so far as the necessary data is lacking. For
   the first time, two new datasets are combined to systematically measure
   immigration policies and bilateral migration flows for 33 Organisation
   for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) destination countries
   from over 170 countries of origin over the period 1982-2010. The study
   finds that immigration policies have an important effect on immigration
   flows and thus that states are able to control their borders. To some
   extent the control capacities depend on other factors in attracting or
   deterring immigrants. The article shows that the deterrence effect of
   restrictive immigration policies increases when unemployment rates are
   high. It appears that, in these contexts, states start to care more
   about effectively protecting their national economy. Moreover, policies
   are more effective for migrant groups from former colonies or when the
   stock of this group is already high in a destination country. In these
   circumstances, information on border regulations are more easily
   disseminated, which in turn makes them more effective.},

Abstract = {Echoing the call for `no taxation without representation', the
   development of modern taxation went hand-in-hand with Western
   democratisation. However, taxation appears to have lost its role in the
   third wave of democratisation. Unlike early democratisers, contemporary
   autocracies tend to introduce a ready-made modern taxation system before
   democratisation. With advice from international organisations, the value
   added tax (VAT), which mature democracies innovated, has been adopted
   for economic adjustment and development in globalised markets. Despite
   these divergences, it is argued in this article that a fundamental
   relationship between taxation and representation remains. Taxation
   inherently involves a social contract between revenue-seeking rulers and
   citizens, and thus involves their bargaining over representation.
   Therefore, the production of state revenue intervenes in contemporary
   democratisation as well. By factoring in the effect of the VAT in 143
   developing countries between 1960 and 2007, an entropy-balancing
   analysis has confirmed its important role in contemporary
   democratisation. The taxation-democratisation linkage has travelled from
   early to contemporary democratisation.},

Abstract = {In the last decades, Western democracies have witnessed an increase in
   the proportion of voters who make their electoral choice late in the
   campaign. Consequently, scholars have paid considerable attention to
   this phenomenon and attempted to identify the factors which influence
   time of vote decision. This article reviews the literature on the
   determinants of decision timing. Several studies suggest that women and
   young citizens are more likely to be late deciders. Besides, party
   identification has been shown to hasten the electoral decision, whereas
   attitudinal ambivalence and network cross-pressures have been found to
   delay the crystallisation of vote intentions. Moreover, previous work
   reveals that strategic voters decide later than do their sincere
   counterparts. Special attention is also devoted to the debate on whether
   the phenomenon of late deciding can be seen as the consequence of a lack
   of political sophistication or as the product of a high level of
   political engagement.},

Abstract = {This article explores the antecedents and behavioural consequences of
   party ambivalence in an election context, in which both abstract factors
   (e.g. feeling stranded in an ideological fight) and concrete factors
   (e.g. dissatisfaction with both parties' ability to handle economic
   issues) may arouse party ambivalence. Prior research reports different
   voting behaviours by ambivalent and univalent voters, though no coherent
   theoretical framework exists to explain these findings. To address that
   gap, the current article proposes a Model of Behavioural Strategies for
   Coping with Party Ambivalence, according to which ambivalent voters deal
   with the anticipated regret associated with making the wrong choices by
   adopting one of three coping strategies. First, they may avoid voting,
   because inaction is associated with less anticipated regret than action.
   Second, they may deny full responsibility by splitting their ticket.
   Third, they might attempt to reduce anticipated regret by jumping on the
   bandwagon and voting for a projected winner. Applications of the model
   to the 2016 Taiwanese presidential election provide support for these
   predictions.},

Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Conflict Conflict and its resolution have often been part of human
   history. While the post-colonial state has often been the focus when
   explaining the persistence of conflicts and its resolution in Africa,
   the benefits of such focus and analysis has not been enough to explain
   the intra-and inter-state nature of conflicts and conflict management in
   Africa. This necessitates a reconsideration of conflict management
   strategies. Such reconsideration will show the intricate ways conflicts
   and its resolutions are shaped, especially in post-conflict societies,
   through the instrumentality of Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR)
   mechanism. With Liberia as the focus and unit of analysis, it noted that
   the country has been the epicentre of several years of violent conflicts
   with both internal and external dimensions, raising questions about the
   effectiveness of the orthodox conflict management mechanisms given that
   the Liberian conflict was intractable for a long time. However, the
   adoption of alternative dispute resolution mechanisms has helped resolve
   most, if not all, of the conflicts. This paper, therefore, examines the
   local, traditional and communal alternative dispute resolution
   mechanisms used to solve the Liberian crisis. Specifically, the paper
   interrogates traditional methods of conflict resolution, inclusive of
   communalism, ethnocultural perception of conflicts and its resolution,
   well as epistemic and ethical protocols guiding peace-building efforts.
   This is with the aim to provide an understanding of Africa's peace
   initiatives, choices and options.},

   the approach for institutional participation, based on the existence of
   women's councils at the local and the district level. Thanks to a
   documentary analysis, interviews with key actors, as well as a
   questionnaire and a focus group directed to the organisations taking
   part in these structures, the study unveils the limits and challenges
   for developing gender equality policies with a participatory
   perspective; it also shows the transformative measures that could give
   impulse to such approach. All in all, this article presents new
   empirical material regarding the complex intersections between the
   institution and the movement, while shedding light on new practices with
   potential to be transferred elsewhere in Spain.},

Abstract = {Based on quantitative data and ethnographic research conducted on the
   November 13 memorials, this article aims to answer a seemingly simple
   question: Why do individuals stop in front of these memorials? Alongside
   analyses in terms of ``national communion,{''} ``mourning,{''} or
   ``resilience,{''} it aims to question the banality of these practices
   and their political significance. People who stop at memorials are not
   characterized by specific political attitudes or particularly strong
   connections to terrorist attacks. Their behaviors are shaped by ordinary
   interactions and their actions are defined by the material framework of
   memorials. This article argues that the political dimension of these
   practices lies in the physical presence and co-presence in these sites
   of memory. In these places, actors experience a ``regime of civility{''}
   that breaks with the ordinary forms of interaction in the city.
   Memorials then appear as places of ``positive rituals{''} that could be
   described as pure, that is, they do not necessarily produce lasting
   beliefs and behavioral changes, but they give participants the feeling
   that social relationships are transformed for an instant.},

Abstract = {This paper analyses the emergence of new political forces in the

   first thing we observe is that despite this new situation, power
   strategies have changed little and the new parties soon integrated into
   the dynamics of the system. It is true that we live in new parliamentary
   times in which the pluralism of groups is much more significant, but
   this has not generated great institutional instability. Stability is
   ensured probably not only due to the electoral system but also
   parliamentary rationalization which means that, after the investiture,
   the Government has an ``overload{''} with which to control political
   and, in particular, parliamentary life.},

Abstract = {Integration processes as the highest level of integration, in the
   formation of a common security and defense policy, have traditionally
   been - and remain to this day - the most difficult area of life of the
   EU. Firstly, it has always been especially difficult for EU member
   states to sacrifice a part of their sovereignty in the field of foreign
   policy and security. Secondly, the existing disagreements in the
   European Union on these issues have reflected the dichotomy of the EU
   member states that are trying to reconcile traditional atlantism with
   the security interests of the EU. The article analyzes the evolution of
   the military component of European integration at the current moment
   both in the context of international political changes in the field of
   global and regional security, and through new imperatives for the EU to
   gain strategic autonomy. In particular, special attention is paid to
   objective deep-seated changes in transatlantic relations after the end
   of bipolarity, primarily the crisis of allied relations in NATO, which
   in modern conditions inevitably leads to a structural demarcation of
   allies. The article proves that the European Union's adoption of the
   Global Security Strategy (GSS), and subsequent EU initiatives in the
   development of the GSS, opened a new period in the formation of the
   military autonomy of the Union.},

Title = {The art and politics of imagination: remembering mass violence against
   women},
Journal = {CRITICAL REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL SOCIAL AND POLITICAL PHILOSOPHY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {22},
Number = {5, SI},
Pages = {618-636},
Abstract = {This paper addresses the role of artistic memory in processes of
   redressing political violence and historical injustices. Combining
   philosophical reflection, insights from memory studies and examples of
   artistic practices, it focuses on how memory and imagination coalesce in
   problematising mass violence against women and resisting its `official'
   oblivion. The argument is that artistic memory work can foster
   collective memories of the painful past in ways that overcome both
   individual and national representations. To this end, this paper aims to
   explore various contemporary art productions as new models of
   memorialization, which deal with the representation of violence against
   women in armed conflicts and under political repression. The academic
   literature on the role of art in processes of dealing with the past
   tends to examine literature, film, theatre, painting and other more
   traditional artistic media of commemorating the victims of mass
   violence. In contrast, this paper explores the political potentialities
   of new artistic models of memorialization, namely participatory and
   collaborative artistic practices. Unlike the traditional media, they can
   commemorate victims performatively and collaboratively, simultaneously
   catalysing transnational solidarity and new forms of politics `from
   below.'},

   Performance: A Party-based Analysis of Land Elections in Germany,

Journal = {GERMAN POLITICS},

Abstract = {To what extent does the federal political arena contaminate the regional
   one in Germany? Does a party's position as government or opposition on
   the federal level have a systematic impact on its performance in Land
   elections? Land elections are often characterised as second order
   elections, but existing empirical studies that use real election data
   suffer from important methodological problems. Unlike previous
   approaches using survey data or comparing vote shares in regional and
   federal elections, we analyse contamination in two ways. First, we test
   whether a party's role at the federal level has a systematic impact on
   gaining or losing office at the Land level. Second, we examine the vote
   difference of parties relative to their result in the previous election
   in the Land. Drawing on a complete dataset of all Land elections from
   1949 to 2017, we find confirmation for two phenomena well known in
   comparative electoral studies. First, the anti-incumbency effect:
   government parties tend to lose votes. In the German context, as in many
   other multilevel systems, this is exacerbated by the second effect:
   contamination. Gaining power or votes on the Land level is very
   difficult when a party is in government on the federal level.},

Abstract = {The article attempts to describe the political form of Russia on the
   basis of the specifics of the landscape of Northern Eurasia, as well as
   the characteristics of settlement and management on this territory. In
   their turn, these factors determine such important features of Northern
   Eurasia as the initial autonomy and autarky of households, the lack of
   need for local communities to resort to external ``tools{''} and forms
   of macro-social organization (including political structures). At the
   same time, as shown in the article, external forces (sedentary
   civilizations) found it too costly, or even economically meaningless, to
   exploit such communities, because the costs of controlling the
   territories of Northern Eurasia exceeded the benefits of the surplus
   product.
   Under special conditions, primarily related to climatic cataclysms,
   local communities, however, united into large systems that implied
   certain political structures. In this case authorities played a
   borderline role between society and the exogenous highest force, acting
   as a mediator of political meanings. At the same time, authorities did
   not so much extract the surplus product produced in the society - rather
   they distributed the resources received from the outside sedentary
   civilization. They did so in accordance with the place of an individual
   in the hierarchy, his/her proximity to the mediator. Which political
   form was built - a ``common dress{''} for different communities included
   in the political body - depended on the source of higher meanings, the
   method for obtaining monopoly on translating those meanings, the
   existing options for acquiring the distributed resources, and the
   principles of distribution.
   The author traces how these features, which are in general inherent in
   Northern Eurasia, manifested themselves in the establishment and
   evolution of political forms in Rus, Russia, the USSR, and the Russian
   Federation.},

Abstract = {In this article, we present some results from an investigation into the
   participation of men in the paid care of dependent adults in Catalonia.
   In recent years, the increased need for long-term care has led to the
   growing institutionalisation and recognition of this work. To meet care
   needs, various services have been provided by social and comercial
   organisations, but the financial crisis and austerity policies have
   harmed the redistribution of care provision by reducing public spending
   and prolonging care by the family. At the same time, wide spread
   unemployment caused by the financial crisis has increased the number of
   male carers, although they are still a minority. We analyse the
   strategies used by organisations to recruit men and the extent to which
   this situation could be the result of social policies designed to change
   (or not) the gender balance in these types of job. Our methodology is
   based on the qualitative analysis of interviews with care managers and
   observations in different public and private services.},

Journal = {POLIS-POLITICHESKIYE ISSLEDOVANIYA},

Number = {5},
Pages = {85-95},
Abstract = {China moved to the forefront of world politics, which resulted in a
   rearrangement of the balance of forces between the five nuclear powers
   represented in the U.N. Security Council. Russia has taken a benevolent
   stance towards China's new status, France pronounced to remain neutral,
   whilst the United States and Britain have refrained from expressing any
   clear opinion. The rest of the states are watching with interest or
   anxiety. The United States under Trump maintains an offensive position
   in all conflictprone areas. Beijing, on the other hand, maintains a
   balanced point of view: not to join any `alliances' and not to back any
   of the great powers. Moscow opposes the U.S.A., trying to abstain from
   any military coalescing. The continental E.U. is concerned with
   resolving the conflict in Ukraine and, at the same time, seeking
   opportunities for new beneficial relations in the Middle East, Asia, and
   Latin America. The author, on the basis of a comparative analysis of
   these international relations dynamics, shows the inconsistencies of the
   policies of `nuclear countries' at the intersection of changes stemming
   from the greater `free hand' of the United States, Russia and Britain.
   The countries of the Nuclear Five in the U.N. adhere to the policy of
   `keeping a balanced position' in potentially explosive situations.},

   Approach},
Journal = {QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE},

Volume = {14},
Number = {4},
Pages = {439-474},
Abstract = {Despite the importance of every nomination to the Supreme Court, a
   unified theory that illuminates presidential selection of nominees
   across the modern political era remains elusive. We propose a new theory
   - the ``characteristics approach{''} - that envisions nominees as
   bundles of characteristics, such as ideology, policy reliability, and
   attributes of diversity. We formalize the theory, which emphasizes the
   political returns to presidents from a nominee's characteristics and the
   ``costs{''} of finding and confirming such individuals, and derive
   explicit presidential demand functions for these characteristics. Using
   newly collected data on both nominees and short list candidates, we
   estimate these demand functions. They reveal some striking and
   under-appreciated regularities in appointment politics. In particular,
   the substantial increase in presidential interest in the Supreme Court's
   policy output and the increased availability of potential justices with
   desired characteristics has led to significant changes in appointment
   politics and in the composition of the Court.},

Title = {Cyberspace Effects on Civil Society. The Ultimate Game-Changer or Not?},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CIVIL SOCIETY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {15},
Number = {4},
Pages = {392-411},
Abstract = {The article studies the effects of the emergence of cyberspace, or
   digitization, on civil society, and develops an analytical framework to
   that effect. It is distinguished between four types of civil societies:
   apolitical, political, transnational, and uncivic. Each type of civil
   society is considered separately vis-a-vis cyberspace developments in
   order to understand what kind of civil society is enhanced by these
   developments and, conversely, what kind of civil society is constrained.
   This understanding helps inform how cyberspace has changed the more
   generic society-state relations. While one can identify many
   instrumental changes and developments in civil society practices, the
   article concludes that the emergence of cyberspace has not profoundly
   changed society in terms of the relative power of one type of civil
   society over another. Thus, its transformative power is rather limited
   in a more fundamental sense. The empirical focus of the article is on
   Norwegian civil society, representing a Western developed democratic
   state, but it is argued that while the empirical results may vary, the
   analytical framework can arguably be applied and tailored to any
   society.},

Abstract = {This article analyzes the experiences of refugee claimants in Toronto's
   everyday healthcare places, like walk-in clinics, doctor's offices, and
   hospitals, in the aftermath of the 2012 Interim Federal Health Program
   (IFHP) revisions. By drawing upon critical migration scholarship that
   prioritizes (non)citizenship, as well as semi-structured interviews, I
   highlight how the social positioning of refugee claimants is modulated
   in ways that justify and extend the NIP revisions to effectively deny
   access to healthcare. demonstrating the indeterminacy of access. I
   understand this process through the concept of irregularity, a non
   juridical status that is contingently configured and enforced by state
   and non-state actors when one is (re)constructed as ``out of place,{''}
   hence limiting access to resources and rights. In accordance with
   citizenship, it indicates how we can think of the (re)fashioning of
   people and groups particularly within the everyday. I follow this with a
   critical analysis of the contestations that emerged to challenge the
   IFHP revisions and the irregularity of refugee claimants so as to
   capture the politics of irregularity.},

Abstract = {Party competition in advanced industrial democracies is generally
   characterized as a two-dimensional space consisting of an economic and
   non-economic dimension. This study examines (a) the extent to which
   parties strategically place more emphasis on one of these dimensions
   vis-a-vis the other, something we coin relative emphasis, and (b) the
   extent to which voters perceive such shifts in relative emphasis. Our
   specific focus here is on government parties. We expect government
   parties to shift emphasis away from the economic to the non-economic
   dimension when economic conditions deteriorate. In doing so, they aim to
   reduce the importance voters attach to the economy and the degree to
   which voters attribute responsibility for the economy to the government.
   By combining expert data for 232 parties with survey data for roughly
   30,000 individuals in 28 European countries in 2014, our analysis shows
   that while government parties generally pay more attention to the
   economic dimension, they shift attention to the non-economic dimension
   when economic conditions deteriorate. In contexts where government
   parties have shifted attention away from the economic to the
   non-economic dimension, voters overall attach less importance to the
   economy and attribute less responsibility to the government for the
   state of the economy.},

Abstract = {In Africa, food systems intersect with dynamics such as demographic
   growth, urbanisation, and climate change, as African food systems are
   key drivers of livelihood provision, development, and human-environment
   interactions. The governance of African food systems shapes how food
   systems are changing as a response to these dynamics, which will have
   important social, economic, and ecological impacts for generations of
   Africans. This article positions large land investments in food system
   changes in central Kenya and northern Mozambique based on a large-scale
   household survey and interviews, and uses these findings to debate the
   concept of food democracy. Large land investments contributed to more
   modern food systems, which impacted land availability, household's
   engagement in agriculture, and supply chains. These changes shifted
   power and control in local food systems. But even in the `extreme'
   example of land investments, local perspectives challenge what could,
   and could not, be included in a democratic food system.},

Abstract = {The advent of the post-Fordist accumulation regime, of a neo-liberal
   nature, relativizes West-phalian territorialities and puts the notion of
   the hard protective limits of nation-states in check. This has led to
   the emergence of specific forms of ``superimposed territorialities{''}
   -cross-border urban regions and complexes- that place the formation of
   border political regimes (BPR) in the foreground, understood as the
   assembly of institutions, norms, procedures and discursive practices
   that channel the conflicting interaction of public actors by resources
   and values in the territorialities of international borders. This
   article analyzes the situation of the BPR in Latin America based on the
   way in which the states perceive their borders -suspicious, hostile or
   invisible- based on the analysis of the available documentary and
   academic information, as well as the field research developed by the
   authors in several continental border regions. In particular, the
   national experiences of Colombia, Dominican Republic and Chile are
   analyzed and contrasted. The article concludes on the need for
   post-Westfalian looks that allow the use of cross-border synergies in
   pursuit of regional development.},

Abstract = {This article analyses the role of the security and defence firms in the
   European public policies regarding the external borders control. On one
   side, we highlight the industrial ``political work{''} realised by these
   firms. Such activities consist in a contextual framing and a
   representation of an ``artificial{''} industry sector (the security
   industry), to establish themselves as legitimate experts in the eyes of
   the governmental actors. On the other side, we study the institutional
   political work achieved by the European Commission, which uses this
   ``savoir-faire{''} from the private sector to pursue its own
   supranational entrepreneurship strategies while sharing a common vision
   of borders control with the help of technologies. In doing so, the
   Commission has reconfigured to its benefits the JHA institutional
   dynamics, at the expense of others, as the European Parliament. The
   latter is relatively marginalised from an emerging European field of
   power.},

Abstract = {This essay concerns the uneasy relationship between Althusser and Hegel
   that can be observed throughout Althusser's oeuvre. In the 1960s
   Althusser pursued a rigorous project and tried to develop a systematic
   account of philosophy, history, and science from within Marxism-an
   account that would constitute a theoretical weapon against Hegelian
   idealism. Althusser's arguments in For Marx and Reading ``Capital{''}
   established his presence in French philosophical corners as a Marxist
   and anti-Hegelian thinker. However, in posthumous publications,
   Althusser's relation to Hegel appears far more complicated than his
   simply being anti-Hegelian. By investigating this relationship from the
   lens of multiple encounters, this essay carves out two notions that
   emerged from these encounters, notions that we call ``Althusserian{''}:
   philosophy as class struggle in theory and history as a process without
   a subject.},

   System Practice Democracy beyond Consumption},
Journal = {POLITICS AND GOVERNANCE},

Abstract = {As the deleterious impacts of conventional food systems on areas
   including public health, environmental sustainability, and farmers'
   livelihoods are progressively unveiled, citizen-led initiatives have
   ubiquitously sprouted, collectively building what is now known as the
   alternative food system. Despite recent academic interest in the role of
   alternative food initiatives in countering a narrow view of democracy
   based on market-based purchasing power, little attention has been paid
   to a specific democratizing feature that allows for collective
   expression beyond consumption, that of collective agency. This article
   argues that it is precisely by focusing on collective agency as the
   driving force for food systems' change that we can recognize the diverse
   contributions of social innovations to the democratization of food
   systems. By engaging with the reasonings of consumer sovereignty
   proponents, building on academic literature on the concept of collective
   agency, and drawing from empirical work with over a hundred local social
   innovations of the global North, this article proposes an agency
   typology that allows for parsing out its different dimensions,
   highlighting social innovations' key role as agency enablers and agents
   of change in the democratization of food systems.},

Abstract = {The article is devoted to the problem of political authority that is
   viewed as a fact of a social reality. The author regards authority as a
   sociopolitical institution rooted in the biological nature of a human
   being and evolving throughout the history. The article suggests a
   framework for a holistic theory of political authority and highlights
   four stages of its development. The first stage is (political) authority
   in its pre-human version. These are the forms of leadership generated by
   the need to solve the functional problem of cooperation among social
   animals and imply a mobile structure that is based on trust in the
   leader and is responsive to changes, rather than a rigid hierarchy. The
   second stage is the emergence of a functional replication of the
   ``animal authority{''} within the first human communities, formation of
   the institution of authority and its mergence with religious ideas, the
   emergence of faith in supernatural agents and supernatural punishment.
   The third stage is the development of political authority as a religious
   authority, which led to the establishment of the institution of
   delegating power from someone who lacks physical properties - God, Gods
   or state as a ``mortal God{''}. The fourth stage is the demystified
   political authority, which is established in a secular modern society,
   but retains some elements of its predecessors. According to the author,
   such an empirical approach to understanding political authority opens up
   a possibility, among other things, to solve some problems of normative
   theories, allowing a clearer understanding of the role of authority in
   the political life of a society.},

Title = {Producing Ottomans: Internal Colonization and Social Engineering in
   Ottoman Immigrant Settlement},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF GENOCIDE RESEARCH},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {21},
Number = {1},
Pages = {1-24},
Abstract = {In the past decade, historians of the Armenian Genocide have
   productively explored broader trends in Ottoman population politics to
   situate the genocide within the totality of Ottoman social engineering
   techniques and to highlight continuities between the Second
   Constitutional Period (1908-1918) and the Kemalist era (1919-1950). This
   article contributes to the effort to understand state building, internal
   colonization, and state-enacted violence across regimes by examining
   Ottoman archival documents related to immigrant settlement. Rather than
   focusing exclusively on the Young Turk period, this article traces
   Ottoman conceptions of its territory and population from the 1850s
   forward. In 1857, concerns about population density and population
   productivity inspired the Tanzimat High Council to issue a new set of
   migration regulations, which encouraged immigration by promising free
   land, tax exemption, and religious freedom for colonists from Europe and
   the United States. The issuing of the 1857 regulations occurred almost
   simultaneously with the initiation of a decades-long mass Muslim
   migration from the Crimean Peninsula, Caucasus, and Balkans into the
   shrinking territory of the Ottoman state. In 1860, the Empire
   established a centralized Immigrant Commission (Muhacirin Komisyonu) for
   receiving, categorizing, and settling the Muslim immigrants. Most
   immigrants did not meet the selection criteria established in the 1857
   regulations. Nevertheless, immigrant settlement became a key component
   in nineteenth-century Ottoman internal colonization and social
   engineering. Ultimately, settlement policies and data generated about
   the population and territory allowed officials to enact assimilative and
   expulsive policies based not only on ethnic or religious characteristics
   but also on tropes of productivity and civilization. Examining immigrant
   settlement as internal colonization situates the Ottoman Empire within
   global patterns of state building and imperialism and reveals continuity
   in how officials conceived of population productivity and population
   removal, allowing historians to understand better political,
   infrastructural, and ideological precursors to the Armenian genocide.},

Abstract = {Within last few years we are witnessing the rise of populist politics
   which applies antiestablishment and anti-corrupt appeals. This
   phenomenon is widespread not only in the newer but also in advanced
   democracies. The present study identifies a theoretical framework for
   studying the politics of emotions in the context of the electoral
   success of populist parties. It pays detailed attention to anti-elitism,
   the affective political style, and anticorruption rhetoric, researching
   them as dimensions of emotion-based populist mobilisation. In the
   empirical section, it analyses the results of an expert survey of
   political parties with respect to the Czech and Slovak political
   parties. By comparing the results for the years 2014 and 2017 on the
   dimensions of anti-elitism and anti-corruption rhetoric, the study
   demonstrates the growing salience of the politics of emotions,
   especially in the case of new protest parties. The evidence presented
   clearly documents the reliance of these protest parties and movements on
   the politics of emotions, suggesting that they can be classified as
   populist. Analysis of the salience of anti-elitist and anti-corruption
   rhetoric shows that the rise of anti-establishment parties cannot be
   explained merely by growing voter discontent with the economic situation
   and the quality of governance. Any such explanation must also embrace
   evidence about the politics of emotions that characterizes those
   parties. In the concluding section, the paper documents a clear trend of
   increasing electoral popularity of parties found by the expert survey to
   exhibit above-average levels of anti-elitist and anticorruption
   rhetoric.},

   possible convergences},
Journal = {POLITIQUE EUROPEENNE},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {63},
Number = {1},
Pages = {62-95},
Abstract = {This article proposes to examine, through a comparative approach,
   territorial systems in Europe, focusing on the local and regional
   levels, while leaving aside the study of intermediate levels, given
   their greater rarity. In accordance with the ``logic of contrast{''}
   that innervates the comparative approach, it is possible to note the
   persistent diversity of the major systems of administrative organization
   of States, inscribed in national historical traditions, which resists
   any spirit of modeling. Although the variety of national situations
   observed pre-condemns the hypothesis of a European model of
   administration, it cannot obstruct any idea of concordance or
   convergence. These similarities may concern the reform processes,
   without necessarily bringing about a convergence of results. Although
   they are subject, if necessary, to a logic of enforcement, they are
   often of a similar but independent resolution logic.},

   in Catalonia, factors of the actualization of the problem of separatism
   at the beginning of the 21st century and the reasons for the transition

   Particular attention is paid to the analysis of the driving forces of
   the modern separatism in Catalonia. The Catalan initiative made
   important legal and political mistakes that were decisive for its
   failure and led to increased social tensions and political instability
   in Spain and Catalonia. The announcement of the verdict to the Catalan
   separatists will largely determine the relationship of the state with
   Catalonia and will serve as a firewall for future attempts to gain
   independence unilaterally.},

Abstract = {We explore the relationship between ballot measures on issues salient to
   Millennials and their turnout in presidential and midterm elections.
   Both scholars and observers in the media have worried about decreasing
   levels of citizen participation, particularly among young voters. We
   demonstrate that one way to engage Millennials into traditional forms of
   political participation is through ballot measures that focus on issues
   salient to their generation (marijuana liberalization and higher
   education reform). We show that not only do these measures increase
   Millennial voting, but they erase difference in turnout levels between
   Millennials and older generations. This effect is primarily concentrated
   in low-turnout contexts such as midterm elections, indicating that these
   measures may be playing a similar mobilization role in midterm elections
   as presidential campaigns do in turnout out low-propensity voters.},

   Battista Ramusio (1485-1557)},
Journal = {LABORATOIRE ITALIEN-POLITIQUE ET SOCIETE},
Year = {2019},
Number = {23},
Abstract = {Though the Venetian secretaries' anonymity does not make it easy to
   gauge their political influence, historiography suggests that they
   played a significant role in the decision-making process of the early
   modern Venetian Republic. It has been proven that institutional
   mechanisms gave them some autonomy; it appears difficult, however, to
   find examples in the archives of a Venetian secretary's undue
   appropriation of power. This article focuses on Giovanni Battista
   Ramusio - who worked for the Serenissima institutions from 1505 to 1557
   - and aims at following step by step the trajectory of one of these
   actors through a precise identification of his means of action and the
   room for manoeuvre available to him. Though no remarkable event
   characterizes his career, information from the state archives, his
   personal correspondence, as well as the paratexts of printed books that
   refer to him, shed light on the public visibility of a secretary such as
   Ramusio in the first half of the sixteenth century. His continuous
   activity - which took place in part beyond his strictly professional
   duties - allowed him to contribute to the political and cultural life of
   the Venetian Republic by way of his own skills and fields of expertise,
   in a period whose practices and prerogatives were not yet fixed by
   either experience or by the regulating institution of the Chancery, the
   Council of Ten.},

Abstract = {For most of the time since the establishment of the Chinese-Russian
   strategic partnership, diplomatic interaction was the main area of
   strategic cooperation between the two parties. Diplomatic interaction
   manifested generally in two aspects: maintaining a favorable environment
   and conditions of international security and a commitment to establish a
   new international political and economic order; supporting each other's
   efforts to protect national sovereignty and territorial integrity. With
   start of ``One Belt, One Union{''} project in 2015 and broadening of
   regional cooperation between China and Russia, the Chinese-Russian
   strategic partnership entered the stage of ``common development{''}.
   Based on high-level diplomatic support, China and Russia will cooperate
   with each other in their respective economic and social development
   strategies and regional integration strategies in order to explore fully
   their potential for cooperation in order to achieve common development

Title = {Parliaments as Human Rights Actors: The Potential for International
   Principles on Parliamentary Human Rights Committees},
Journal = {NORDIC JOURNAL OF HUMAN RIGHTS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {37},
Number = {3, SI},
Pages = {195-215},
Abstract = {Parliaments have long been overlooked as national human rights actors.
   Yet given their powers to oversee the executive, and functions that can
   ensure laws, policy and practice are in compliance with the state's
   international human rights commitments, they have significant potential
   in supporting the international human rights system and improving the
   implementation of international standards at the domestic level.
   Building on previous UN Human Rights Council and General Assembly
   resolutions encouraging human rights engagement by parliaments, in June
   2018 the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR)
   published a set of draft principles aimed at strengthening the
   interaction of parliaments with the national and international systems,
   and placing them as an active part of the national human rights system
   through the establishment of dedicated parliamentary human rights
   committees. In the context of these ongoing efforts, this article
   considers the potential for the new (soft) standards for parliamentary
   human rights mechanisms, critically assessing the UN initiative. It
   discusses the challenges inherent in formal parliamentary engagement on
   human rights through committees, particularly at the international
   level, argues for necessary safeguards, and makes proposals for further
   research and institutional initiatives to solidify parliaments' role as
   effective national human rights actors.},

   is on the end of a gradual approach to structural changes and

Abstract = {After Vice-President Temer supported the impeachment of President
   Rousseff in Brazil, the vice presidency has (again) received criticism
   in Latin America. The newly raised criticism echoes a long-standing
   critique of the vice presidency as a source of conflict and instability.
   This article, however, argues that the criticism suffers from a
   misconception and that it is confounded with three problems of
   presidential succession inherent to presidential systems: the problems
   of loyalty, legitimacy and presidential substitution. Through a
   comparative and historical analysis based on a new database on rules of
   succession in Latin America, the article discusses how these problems
   have been met and attempted resolved through reforming the rules of
   succession, and how the recent presidential interruptions in the region
   present a new problem of presidential substitution that challenges the
   extent to which the rules of presidential substitution are fit to
   resolve presidential crises.},

Pages = {191-223},
Abstract = {Does electoral competitiveness boost turnout in U.S. House elections?
   Using an individual panel of turnout records compiled from the voter
   files of all 50 states, we exploit variation in district competitiveness
   induced by the 2012 redistricting cycle to provide credible estimates of
   the effect of competitiveness on turnout. When tracking the same voters
   across time under differing levels of competitiveness, we precisely
   estimate the effect on turnout to be near zero. Although past
   cross-sectional research reports a link between competitiveness and
   turnout in House elections, we demonstrate that residents in competitive
   districts differ markedly from those in uncompetitive districts along a
   number of observable characteristics correlated with turnout, and we
   argue that this induces bias in most cross-sectional estimates.
   Secondary evidence tracking voter perceptions of competitiveness and
   campaign behavior provides support for our finding. Voters have scant
   awareness of competitiveness in House elections, and, while campaign
   spending is strongly related to competitiveness, it is directed into
   avenues that do not appreciably increase turnout. Our findings have
   important implications for the competitiveness-turnout relationship in
   other electoral settings with geographically compact, single-member
   districts.},

Abstract = {Which voters prefer having more choice between parties and candidates in
   an election? To provide an answer to this question, we analyse the case
   of a radical change from a closed-list PR system to a highly complex
   open-list PR system with cumulative voting in the German states of
   Bremen and Hamburg. We argue that the approval of a personalised
   electoral system is structured in similar ways as support for direct
   democracy. Using representative surveys conducted prior to all four
   state elections under cumulative voting in 2011 and 2015, we analyse
   which individual factors determine the approval, disapproval, or
   indifference towards the new electoral law. The results indicate that
   younger voters as well as supporters of left parties are much more
   likely to support a personalised electoral system. In contrast to
   previous studies, political interest only has an impact on the
   indifference towards the electoral system. More generally, our results
   show that a large proportion of voters does not appreciate personalised
   preferential electoral systems which seems to be a result of the
   complexity and magnitude of choice between parties and candidates.},

Abstract = {The revolutions in Latin America have been structured through an untold
   manifesto that takes the figures of the hero, victim and victimizer
   within common ideas that developed around the end of history. This
   article presents reality within a monopolized discourse, which plays
   with some Marxist vocabulary, while it evokes a political messiah, the
   savior, the revolutionist. The main objective of this writing is to
   understand the Latin America revolutions ` manifesto presented in a
   common discursive. At the end, we point out the little regional
   development of proposals that try to fill the concept of revolution with
   new thought. This writing is based on four historical events, namely:
   the Mexican Revolution, which begun in 1910; the Bolivian Revolution of
   April 1952; the Cuban Revolution, early 1959; and the Nicaraguan
   Revolution of the late 1970s.},

Abstract = {The First World War created no other principles for world formation than
   an abstract notion of national self-determination. Such an abstract
   notion could not solve the historical challenges the world faced, of
   which the outbreak of the Second World War provided evidence. Each
   state/nation must realize its world-historical mission to construct the
   world-historical world in which states/nations would be united to form
   `a global world (sekai-teki sekai)' while maintaining their own
   historical uniqueness. For such historically unique entities to be
   united into the whole without losing their uniqueness, it would be
   necessary an intermediate process of forming `a particular world
   (tokushu-teki sekai)'. In this process, each state/nation transcends
   itself, connects to neighboring states/nations, and follows its own
   regional (supra-national) tradition at the same time, leading to the
   establishment of non-Western worlds. East Asian nations must realize
   their world-historical mission and construct a particular world based on
   the idea of East Asian culture. There must be a central player to tackle
   such challenges and no country but Japan would be in the position to
   play such a role.},

Abstract = {The article analyzes some institucional and structural factors that
   progressively have contributed to a divorce between citizen and
   representatives in the Chilean case. This rupture has been called by a
   different authors as a ``institucional crisis{''}. The hyphotesis
   indicates that there is an amalgam of elements that have contributed
   strongly to this undermining of the cultural bases of democracy, among
   them, the ``democracia protegida{''} and its authoritarian enclaves,
   systematic corruption cases that have destroyed citizen confidence, but
   also, a historical inequality that has affected the country. All this
   elements have been important in fostering a growing political

   in the 21st Century},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF POLITICS AND LAW},

Abstract = {This paper considers the issue of interaction between two states, which
   are largely political antagonists: Israel and Saudi Arabia. The nature
   of the interaction between these states on the world political arena is
   of serious scientific and practical interest. Contrary to popular
   stereotypes, Israel maintains relations with many countries of the Arab
   world, and Saudi Arabia is no exception. It should be noted that a
   certain rapprochement of positions between these states occurred due to
   the activation on the geopolitical map of the Middle East of such an
   actor as Iran, which in the 21st century energetically implements its
   nuclear program, accelerates economic development programs, and is
   generally focused on strengthening its role and places in the
   international arena. The US position represented by the administrations
   of B. Obama and D. Trump influenced to a large extent the process of
   intensifying interaction between Israel and Saudi Arabia, which
   stimulated the rapprochement of the positions of these two states on the
   ``Syrian{''} and ``Iranian{''} problems. In addition, it is worth paying
   attention to the establishment of similar positions between Israel and
   Saudi Arabia on the ``Palestinian issue. ``},

Journal = {REVISTA DE ESTUDIOS POLITICOS},

Number = {183},

Month = {JAN-MAR},
Abstract = {The different definitions of populism do nothing if not reinforce the
   need to redefine democracy. Populism has returned to stay, so it is
   necessary to analyze ``populist reason{''}; and from the post-Marxist
   perspective this means the work of Mouffe and Laclau. A review of
   different ways to understand populist movements is also imperative to
   confront the fiction of one `People' versus the real and plural
   population. However, constitutionalism will be our answer to resolve the
   democratic paradox: on the one hand, popular power is absolute; on the
   other hand, government by and for the citizenry and, with it, legal
   limit to the exercise of power. Nowadays, it is not a good idea to seek
   a new definition of populism (soft ideology, discourse, political
   strategy, pathology), but we need to condemn its symbiosis with
   democracy as vox populi vox dei. Populism is not the redemption of
   democracy, but its worst enemy. So, we have two alternatives: either
   populism is redirected through its constitutional anchoring in
   individual human dignity and intangible rights, or the unlimited power
   of the people and its totalitarian embodiment will mean that the
   democracy's days are numbered.},

Abstract = {This article analyses anti-sex-work mobilization in Austria and Germany
   since 2014. An affective perspective on the websites of these groups
   shows how their framings run the risk of establishing a disciplinary
   regime of governing people, of a restrictive, heterosexist norm of
   sexuality, and of gender inequality. Abolitionist strategies in the two
   countries thus produce an affective governmentality excluding those who
   should not belong to the affective community, i.e. those who do not
   submit to limiting their sexuality to the private realm of monogamous
   relationships. Finally, the article suggests that the abolitionist
   affective mobilisation feeds into the self-affirmation of traditional
   branches of women's movements in the two countries.},

Abstract = {This article argues that decolonizing educational research begins in
   attention to inherited colonial thinking and ways of being. Working with
   over 250 Indigenous educators. staff students, faculty and
   administrators associated with 10 partner universities in Ontario,
   Canada, we co-designed a questionnaire assessing how Ontario
   post-secondary students are learning to think about colonialism and its
   relationship to Indigenous peoples and Canadian society. Situating
   ourselves as researchers and as participants. we theorize the
   questionnaire's and our own methodological transformation through the
   lens of recent literature on epistemologies of ignorance, discussing
   humour, the relationship between language and imagination, and
   assumptions we held that presented significant opportunities to shift
   how we relate. In doing so we argue the social importance of attending
   to the limits of knowledge and the entrenchment of those limits in
   historically conditioned and socially sanctioned axes of dominance. We
   attest both to the depths of colonial misrecognition and to the power of
   Indigenous knowledge and ways of being to shift social worlds.},

Journal = {POLITICKE VEDY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {22},
Number = {2},
Pages = {137-158},
Abstract = {After the collapse of the Soviet Union, the failure to break ``Russia's
   black box{''} led the EU to misinterpret Russia's weakness for a
   willingness to transform into a Western model of development. Therefore,
   EU's ability to predict political events in Russia has not been great of
   late, resulting into failing soft-power strategies that weight heavily
   on European security. The current paper seeks to provide a critique to
   EU's approach and attitude towards Russia over the past decades by
   analysing its specific agenda, policies, actions and discourse;
   subsequently, the paper aims at identifying the main inconsistencies in
   the European goals and actions, as well as at highlighting the major
   challenges that hinder the consolidation of a long-term strategy towards
   EU's most important neighbour. Hence, the conducted analysis finds that
   in order to enhance its security and especially that of its eastern
   members, the EU should redefine its strategy towards Russia by going
   beyond the personalistic ({''}leader fixation{''}) and missionary
   (change Russia to its own image) approach by perceiving Russia for what
   it is, not for what it should be. The findings suggest that a proper
   strategy towards Russia can only be based on a long-term vision coupled
   with a thorough understanding of the partner's motivations and
   interests.},

Abstract = {Lippert-Rasmussen has proposed a new version of luck egalitarianism:
   equality of concern. In this article, I argue that equality of concern
   is more generous than its two luck egalitarian rivals. That is, against
   equality of opportunity for welfare, it is more generous in that it
   recognises shortfalls in the satisfaction of one's impersonal concerns
   as potentially inegalitarian. Against equality of resources, it is more
   generous in that it advocates more extensive compensation. I suggest
   that equality of concern's generosity regarding impersonal concerns is
   justified but its generosity regarding compensation is not. Equality of
   resources, however, faces other problems, and so I argue that a hybrid
   of equality of concern and equality of resources would be the more
   attractive luck egalitarian view.},

Abstract = {The advanced economies are experiencing a set of shared challenges in
   the transition to a new ``knowledge economy{''} characterized by rapid
   technological innovation and associated with a heightened premium on
   higher education. Yet individual countries are charting rather different
   courses as they navigate this transition. This article examines
   divergent trajectories of change in three coordinated market economies
   Germany, Sweden, and the Netherlands. It argues that differences in the
   organization of business and labor, and in the institutions that
   structure their interactions with each other and with the state, have
   produced different coalitional alignments and led these countries onto
   divergent paths toward the knowledge economy today.},

Journal = {REGIONAL AND FEDERAL STUDIES},

Volume = {29},
Number = {1},
Pages = {67-90},
Abstract = {Constitutional and supreme courts frequently end up examining the
   political and legal questions at the heart of peace agreements and
   post-conflict constitutions. Where a peace agreement has included
   territorial self-government (TSG) provisions courts are often endowed
   with the capacity to adjudicate disputes between state and sub-state
   levels of government. The effectiveness of courts in fulfilling this
   role as not been comprehensively examined. This article fills this
   important gap examining whether the results of existing research on the
   role of constitutional and supreme courts in resolving disputes in
   traditional federalism also apply in these particular circumstances. It
   finds that where TSG is used as a conflict management mechanism judicial
   review can have centralizing tendencies if this occurs it can largely be
   attributed to the processes used to select though the devolutionary
   multinational nature of the states is also relevant.},

   Communication Behaviour},
Journal = {AUSTRIAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {48},
Number = {3},
Pages = {1-15},
Abstract = {This article investigates the political communication behaviour of
   interest groups. First, by proposing indices to capture the degree to
   which mass media have become central for political communication (media
   logic of communication), and the degree to which conventional strategies
   aimed at politicians directly govern groups' communication behaviour
   (political logic of communication). Based on these two indices, the
   article then proposes an overall index of mediatisation. Second, the
   article tests three hypotheses regarding the use of the media logic, the
   political logic, and the mediatisation of interest groups, and finds
   that group type, resources, and the level of competition all play a role
   for how strongly interest groups are mediatized. Thus, this article
   contributes to the scarce empirical research on mediatisation by a)
   proposing a way to operationalise this concept which can be adjusted
   using a different set of variables, but can also be applied for
   different political actors, and b) by showing the usefulness of the
   constructed indices in an empirical example for Swiss and German
   interest groups.},

Abstract = {A key feature of the contemporary global economy is the unevenness of
   food production and trade. The problem of food dependency and the
   system's lack of capacity to accommodate global demand continue to haunt
   the global food trade and capitalism in general. This paper shows that
   the global food trade emerged as a solution to the problem of food in
   capitalist development; however, this solution so far has been clearly
   limited in its scope and capacity. By exploring the three major global
   food crises since the mid-nineteenth century, I trace the historical
   forces behind the crises and the restructuring of the global food trade
   and production. Finally, I discuss the future of food in global
   capitalism and the ways of better feeding the world population,
   especially those in the third world.},

   classroom when we, and our students, confront difficult or depressing
   issues, situations, or materials. Working with topics such as human
   rights abuses, environmental degradation, racism and xenophobia, and
   poverty among many others, students and faculty can experience
   compassion fatigue, burnout, and vicarious trauma. Yet, rarely are these
   issues addressed in the classroom, or even, as professors, in our own
   research and practice. Seeking to start a conversation on this issue,
   this article explores compassion fatigue, burnout, and vicarious trauma
   and the effect these can have on student and faculty well-being, and
   then outlines a number of techniques and actions that can be taken in
   our classrooms to help us focus on the positive.},

Journal = {POLITICS AND GOVERNANCE},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {7},

Pages = {237-247},
Abstract = {When the Lisbon Treaty entered into effect, the European Parliament
   became a core player in the decision-making processes of the EU's Common
   Fisheries Policy (CFP) and its external dimensions. This new role
   suggested a shift towards stronger politicization in what had previously
   been a rather technocratic policy field. However, the CFP is not yet
   marked by a clear and consistent level of politicization. I use the
   concept of `layered politicization' to explain this pattern. Although it
   is not comparable to the degree of political controversy shaping fully
   politicized policy fields, some similar political dynamics can be
   observed. Among them is a transformation in the policy process due to
   higher ratification requirements; a higher likelihood of political
   deadlock resulting from an increasing number of veto-players; and a
   strengthening of the contested legitimacy of EU decision-making. An
   empirical test of these theoretical propositions is provided here in the
   form of two case studies; the negotiation of Fisheries Partnership
   Agreements with Morocco and Mauritania.},

Abstract = {The limited democratization in Hong Kong has been on-going for more than
   three decades. Unlike typical democratizations as the abrupt breakdown
   of authoritarian regimes, the case of Hong Kong is characterized by
   gradual and incremental changes under a constitutional framework. The
   process, involving actors such as the Chinese government, colonial
   government, and local democratic forces, provides a wide variety of
   forms of institutional changes. By utilizing concepts from the
   literature on institutional change, namely path dependence, layering,
   and conversion, important junctures of democratization in Hong Kong are
   analyzed. It is found that the case can be suitably explained by the
   framework of institutional change. This research carries implications
   for the study of central-regional interactions, democratization, and
   Hong Kong politics.},

Abstract = {Donald Trump's rhetoric, character, actions, and policy agenda have
   regularly posed strategic dilemmas for congressional Republicans. While
   Trump and much of his agenda are broadly unpopular, he has continued to
   enjoy strong support from the Republican voters who form their core
   electoral support. In this article, we analyze congressional
   Republicans' responses to several of Trump's most widely reported and
   controversial actions and comments as well as his legislative agenda. We
   find that congressional Republicans' personal and legislative positions
   on Trump reflected their electoral circumstances, their prior reactions
   to Trump during the campaign, and their ideological leanings. We also
   consider the positions adopted by congressional Democrats, who faced a
   more conventional problem of adapting to the president's level of local
   support.},

Abstract = {This article examines the institution of celebrity within academia.
   Academic celebrity has parallels with the celebrity seen in the wider
   world, though it is born of conditions unique to the fields of higher
   education and research and exhibits its own special characteristics.
   Whilst the scholarly prominence of academics can be based on more or
   less impersonal measures, especially citation statistics, academic
   celebrity, like popular celebrity, has emotional and subjective
   dimensions that call for non-subjective analysis. That challenge is met
   in this article by pointing to the cultural and institutional
   underpinnings of the phenomenon. In outlining some of academic
   celebrity's defining features, we explore the critical difference
   between scholarly prominence, which is based on the perception of an
   academic's excellence within their field, and celebrity, which
   incorporates adulation from colleagues and students. In reviewing the
   literature on the subject, we find models elaborating the ways in which
   modernity, in contrast to Elias's court society (Rojek), or the world of
   aristocratic artistic patronage (Bourdieu), creates the conditions for
   the adulation of celebrities and the emergence of celebrity as an
   institution. We also find views critical of both the vulgarising effect
   of celebrity on literary and artistic taste (Coser), and its
   self-perpetuating character (Boorstin, Merton). Finally, we examine
   aspects of academic celebrity's institutionalisation: the dynamic that
   drives the creation of new fields of specialisation within which
   academic celebrity is embedded, and the `managerial university', which
   is said to generate and sustain it (Moran).},

Abstract = {Is US president Donald Trump a threat to democracy? Alerting against his
   manifold transgressions of democratic norms, many comparative political
   scientists have thought so. Their practical worries, however, have been
   inconsistent with prevalent theories of democratic stability. As careful
   examination shows, his main democratic norm violations have been
   discursive, and they have revealed him to be, not an ideological enemy
   of democracy, but a self-centered actor without deep democratic
   commitments. None of this should ring democratic alarm bells. But it
   does. As I suggest, Donald Trump has been conducting a kind of
   sociological ``breaching experiment{''} on the political science
   community which has exposed a remarkable divergence between our main
   theories of democratic stability (which focus on structures, political
   behavior, and self-interest) and our tacit convictions (about the causal
   relevance of actors, political language, and normative commitments).},

Abstract = {As the Trump Administration's trade strategy unfolds, a coherent
   approach is beginning to surface. The methods the US resort to go well
   beyond conventional trade measures, bordering on antagonism. The US aims
   to find solutions to structural issues in its bilateral relations with
   China through a trade deal. This article asks if the weaponization of
   trade will prevail as a tool of coercion to achieve strategic influence
   among major stakeholders in the future. However, the intensity of the
   negotiations at the political level reveals the will of both parties in
   searching for a deal while refraining from taking reciprocal harsh
   measures.},

Abstract = {In the age of globalization, local memories of past violence are often
   dislocated from their material places as remembrance is transpiring in
   transnational memory spaces. Historical events and commemorative memory
   practices increasingly transcend national boundaries and change the way
   memories of historical violence, atrocity, and genocide are represented
   in the transnational memoryscape. This article explores how the
   professionalization and commercialization of museums and memorials of
   genocide and crimes against humanity are modes of ``making the past
   present{''} and ``the local global{''}. Furthermore, professionalization
   and commercialization are processes through which local memories are
   translated into global discourses that are comprehensible to and
   recognizable by a global audience. In this article, we disentangle local
   memory places (understood as material, physical sites) from
   transnational memory spaces (understood as immaterial, ideational
   spaces) in order to investigate the transformation of local places of
   memory into transnational spaces of memory. At the same time, we show
   that, while these processes are often understood interchangeably,
   professionalization and commercialization are separate mechanisms and
   tend to be used strategically to translate memory discourses to specific
   audiences. These two processes can be seen as producing a standardized
   memorial site and a homogenization of memory in the transnational memory
   space. The article illustrates this theoretical reasoning with empirical
   findings from fieldwork in South Africa, where we zoom in on Robben
   Island outside Cape Town, and Bosnia-Herzegovina, where we focus on the
   Galerija 11/07/95 in Sarajevo, which commemorates the atrocities
   committed in Srebrenica in 1995.},

Abstract = {The study features prospects for the implementation of European
   experience in the development of political parties in the post-Soviet
   states. The methodology of the study is based on a combination of
   descriptive analysis with case study. The article shed light on the fact
   that the experience of European populists can be successfully employed
   in the post-Soviet countries, but to a limited degree. First, a
   favorable environment for its application is present in states where
   there is no vertical power structure that help elites to integrate, and
   establishment groups have a substantial resource potential and can
   politically challenge respective opponents' control over key political
   institutions. Accordingly, it can be employed at the regional level, in
   depressed areas that are not essential to the stability of the political
   system and have long been governed ineffectively. Bearing in mind ways
   and means of the European populists, it can be concluded that in order
   to avoid sanctions their experience can be successfully applied by those
   groups within the non-mainstream opposition that are exploited by the
   factions of the ruling establishment to organize attacks on competitors.},

Abstract = {The question of the application and impact of the Charter of Fundamental
   Rights of the EU ('Charter') in quotidian practice of human rights
   protection and review is a strategic one. Given the predominantly
   decentralised effects of EU law and with the due account to the wide
   interpretation of the scope of the Charter's application (Art. 51(1))
   presented by the CJEU (C-617/10 Fransson), the national dimension of the
   application of the Charter forms the crucial issue for the functioning
   of the EU system of fundamental rights protection. The Charter itself
   has a big potential to influence the content, nature and mechanisms of
   the fundamental rights protection at the national level. The present
   paper focuses on this phenomena in connection to the case-law, opinions
   and workload of the Polish Constitutional Tribunal ('TK'). It analyses
   the approach of TK towards the Charter in abstract manner as well as the
   (non)appearance of the Charter in the reasoning of the court in concrete
   cases. The article reports on the main cases and analyses the reasons of
   the aloof approach of the TK towards the EU human rights catalogue.},

Abstract = {Fueled by the Iranian oil revenues, Tehran, under both the rule of Shah
   Mohammad Reza Pahlavi (1941-1979) and since 1979 the Islamic Republic of
   Iran, has intervened in the affairs of sub-Saharan Africa. The Shah's
   policy was motivated by a `defensive' anti-communist/anti-radicalism
   containment posture. Conversely, the Islamic Republic of Iran adopted an
   `offensive' or disruptive policy to alter a political status quo deemed
   hostile to the survival of the Islamic Republic of Iran. To understand
   Iran's scramble to secure its interests in sub-Saharan Africa, four
   periods will be examined in this analysis: i) the Shah and containment,
   1953-1979; ii) the Islamic Republic of Iran's diplomatic `offensive,'
   1980-2001; iii) the Islamic Republic of Iran seeking to `escape'
   international isolation, 2002-2010; and iv) the Saudi-Iranian Cold War,
   2011-2018.},

Abstract = {Considerable research shows that welfare policies are stricter in states
   with large African American caseloads. We challenge the universality of
   this claim by extending Soss, Fording, and Schram's Racial
   Classification Model to account for the multidimensionality of policy,
   the constraints imposed by federal funding, and state legislators'
   ideological goals and racial stereotypes. Examining the work
   requirements, sanctions, time limits, and exemptions in the Temporary
   Assistance for Needy Families program (TANF), we test our hypotheses
   using the most detailed measures of state welfare policy yet examined.
   Consistent with our theory, we show that policy is more generous on some
   dimensions and less generous on others as the size of the African
   American caseload increases. This pattern reveals a complexity in
   welfare policy previously overlooked by research showing only negative
   effects. The results have important implications for theories addressing
   race in the context of TANF and other complex policy regimes.},

Abstract = {This article seeks to explore democratic theory by focusing on the
   example of agonistic democracy, in which contest between citizens is
   valued for its potential to render politics more inclusive, more
   engaging, and more virtuous. Using Connolly and Tully's inclusivism,
   Chantal Mouffe's adversarialism, and David Owen's perfectionism, the
   article discusses democratic theory as a critique, a series of normative
   proposals, and a potential bridge between political theory and public
   policy. It is this bridge that enables democratic theory to pull
   together critical and normative discussions with those surrounding
   public policy and institutional design.},

Abstract = {Public relations agencies are on the rise, and studies have shown that
   also membership-based interest groups use their services. These agencies
   employ public affairs consultants who help their clients influence
   public policy, and their use may have important consequences for
   interest group systems. As we know little about why interest groups use
   public affairs consultants and what kind of groups use them the most, we
   surveyed nationwide interest groups in Finland. We argue that groups use
   consultants especially when they face challenges with their advocacy
   strategies. The results show that the more important media strategies
   are in their advocacy work, the more groups use public affairs
   consultants. Business groups are more likely to use public affairs
   consultants than other kinds of groups. When groups' resources are held
   constant, more recently established groups use more money on consultants
   than older groups. We conclude that consultant use may deepen existing
   biases in interest group politics by strengthening the business groups'
   position. The results also imply that media strategies have become
   especially challenging for groups in the current complex media
   environment.},

   non-subjects are invisibilized, a non-human ontology is imposed to them,

Abstract = {This study examines the trajectory of South Africa's post-apartheid
   foreign policy by establishing the extent of change or consistency in
   its implementation since 1994. Under the ruling African National
   Congress (ANC), South Africa has emerged as a promising international
   actor, particularly within the Southern African region and on the
   African continent in general. The authors provide a historical analysis
   of the major trajectories of foreign policy articulation under the
   administrations of Presidents Nelson Mandela, Thabo Mbeki and Jacob Zuma
   spanning the period 1994 to 2018. In investigating the conception and
   execution of foreign policy under these dispensations, the authors
   unravel a consistent but skewed pattern of national role conception that
   underscores Pretoria's vision to be a major actor in international
   affairs, both regionally and globally. We conclude that South Africa's
   foreign policy during this period was marked by Mandela's altruism,
   Mbeki's Afrocentrism and the antediluvian signature of Zuma.},

Abstract = {When do organizations broadly represent the interests of their economic
   sectors and when do they narrowly represent the interests of members?
   This article investigates how agricultural and small-business
   organizations in Mexico make demands for programmatic policies or
   patronage benefits. Contrary to explanations based on the class of
   members, I show that the source of organizational capacity shapes
   demand-making strategies. Organizations that generate selective benefits
   internally are able to engage in programmatic policies that shape
   sectoral competitiveness, whereas organizations that fail to solve
   membership challenges internally are vulnerable to the patronage trap, a
   self-reproducing cycle wherein they become specialized in demand making
   for discretionary private goods. I generate this argument through
   process tracing of two agricultural organizations in Mexico. Analysis of
   an original survey of economic interest organizations provides broader
   evidence that organizational capacity is a better predictor of policy
   demands than social class.},

Abstract = {Does mainstream party positioning contribute to marginalising or
   legitimising niche party positions? This article argues that voter
   perceptions of the legitimacy and credibility of niche party positions
   play a role in individuals' propensity to vote for niche parties. It
   finds that the adoption of more restrictive immigration positions by
   mainstream parties increases the likelihood that those people who do not
   recognise the issue competence of radical right parties on immigration
   will vote radical right. However, for individuals who already perceive
   the radical right to be competent on immigration, mainstream party
   adoption of more restrictive immigration positions has no effect on
   propensity to vote radical right. In addition, the increase in the
   propensity of individuals to vote radical right is predominantly a
   function of mainstream left parties adopting more restrictive
   immigration positions. These results imply that mainstream parties risk
   fuelling radical right party support by adopting more restrictive
   immigration positions.},

Abstract = {Power-sharing may be a leading model for the inclusion of ethnic
   minorities in post-conflict government, but it is also considered a
   gender-blind approach to conflict regulation. In this article, I
   identify recent openings and shifts in power-sharing theory that suggest
   a new receptivity to the adoption of a gender perspective. Specifically,
   I focus on two major developments that have emerged over the last three
   decades - the widening of the power-sharing universe and the refinement
   of its institutional prescriptions - which have opened up analytical and
   political space for the inclusion of women in power-sharing theory.
   Building on these developments, I identify extant gender gaps in
   power-sharing theory, discuss strategies for overcoming them through the
   adoption of what I call least-ascriptive-most-prescriptive rules, and
   outline areas for future research on integrating a gender perspective
   into power-sharing theory and practice. While power-sharing theory may
   initially appear resistant to a gender intervention, I demonstrate there
   is new analytical space in the theory for such a venture.},

Abstract = {Civic political parties in divided societies occupy an ambiguous place
   in the power-sharing literature. Scholarship tends to focus on ethnic
   parties and assumes civic actors to be marginal. The empirical reality
   tells a different story: civic parties have contributed to peace,
   stability and democracy in some of the world's most deeply divided
   places by playing a mediating role, acting as a moderating force and
   representing otherwise marginalised groups. Drawing from interviews with
   representatives from civic parties, ethnic parties and civil society in
   Northern Ireland and Bosnia and Herzegovina, and broader institutional
   analysis, I argue that civic parties' survival can be explained by the
   fact that they meet therein not only with barriers but also critical
   openings. They adapt to this opportunity structure, with different party
   types developing under different forms of power-sharing. In illustrating
   the relationship between governance models and civic parties, this
   article underlines the importance of post-settlement institutional
   design.},

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW},

Volume = {41},

Pages = {30-43},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {This article questions the notion of `consociational democracy'. It
   argues that it rests on shaky ground, empirically and conceptually. As
   an empirical matter, a consociation is inherently unstable because it
   tends either to collapse into ethnoicracy (where the power is shared by
   the main ethnic groups so that citizens who do not belong to them are
   politically marginalized) or to become a non-consociational, liberal
   democracy. At the conceptual level `consociational democracy' is an
   impossibility because a polity cannot be both consociational and
   democratic. This article argues that consociations can be at best
   demoicracies - that is, polities composed not of a single demos but of
   multiple demoi. Yet the problem of stability remains. The article
   concludes with the suggestion that the stability problem can be
   addressed by adopting a weak form of demoicracy - the
   `demoi-within-demos' constellation - where a thin demos coexists with
   multiple demoi.},

Abstract = {European Parliament (EP) elections have traditionally been described as
   `second-order national elections' in which campaigns are fought by
   national parties on national issues. We argue that the 2019 elections
   should instead be considered `first-order polity' elections. It is not
   EU-level party politics or policy issues that are debated, but rather
   the legitimacy of the EU itself. Firstly, the EP elections have
   transformed into an EU `blame game' in which national governments are
   punished or rewarded over their stance on European integration.
   Secondly, the 2019 election was about the EU's fundamental values, not
   only with respect to multiculturalism, but also gender equality and
   LGBTQ rights. Finally, these first-order polity elections are driven in
   large part by traditional news and social media platforms. While this is
   a long way from the patterns of the early EP elections, they still fail
   in fulfilling the function of holding MEPs and European party groupings
   adequately to account.},

Journal = {POLITICAL QUARTERLY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {90},
Number = {4},
Pages = {705-712},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {The ongoing and almost record-breaking hiatus in devolved government in
   Northern Ireland has brought the sustainability of the region's Assembly
   into sharp focus. As parties in Northern Ireland consider their options
   for restoring (and possibly reforming) the devolved institutions, this
   article takes stock of the Northern Ireland Assembly's merits and
   demerits. It is argued that, amidst the public's understandable
   exasperation with the current stalemate, it is easy to forget that the
   Assembly operated for a decade without suspension (2007-2017) and
   performed some functions reasonably well. This, of course, is not to
   detract from the institution's serious shortcomings, though it is argued
   that the worst of these could be mitigated via institutional reform.
   Crucially, institutional inertia is not an option. Should parties fail
   to address the need for institutional reform, commentators may well be
   right to question whether the Assembly is worth restoring.},

Abstract = {Lijphart's classical consociational theory, developed between the 1960s
   and 1975, was based largely on the experience of four western European
   cases. He argued that the success of consociations depended on the
   preparedness and ability of elites to cooperate, and that the prospects
   for success were facilitated by the presence of certain historical and
   structural factors, including a tradition of accommodation and a
   ``multiple balance of power{''}. In the past forty years or so,
   consociations have been implemented, or attempted, in a number of places
   quite unlike the classical cases. This article argues that a
   satisfactory explanation of the performance of the new consociations
   requires consideration of three dimensions additional to those described
   in Lijphart's classical account. These are, respectively, the i)
   external dimension; ii) the security dimension; and iii) the
   self-determination dimension.},

Volume = {27},

Abstract = {Recent decades have seen an upsurge of interest in populist radical
   right (PRR) parties. Yet despite a large body of research on PRR voters,
   there are few studies of the internal life of these parties. In
   particular, there is a dearth of research about why people are active in
   them. This article uses data from a unique large-scale survey of United
   Kingdom Independence Party (UKIP) members to investigate if drivers of
   voting support for these parties are also important for explaining party
   activism. Analyses show that traditional models of party activism are
   important for understanding engagement in UKIP, but macro-level forces
   captured in an expanded relative deprivation model also stimulate
   participation in the party. That said macro-level forces are not the
   dominant driver of activism.},

Abstract = {Recent studies provide conflicting accounts of whether indirect contact
   with the American carceral state mobilizes. We revisit this controversy,
   using a large national survey of Black Americans that includes a novel
   measure of social connections to people with felony convictions to
   examine spillover dynamics. We find that while ties to the carceral
   state are widespread, the impact of these connections on participation
   is moderated by the severity of state-level felony disenfranchisement
   laws. In states with the most severe disenfranchisement policies, close
   ties to people with felony convictions increase both voting and
   nonvoting participation, but there is no effect in states with more
   moderate laws. The findings suggest that surrogate participation may be
   at work, whereby formally removing the rights of one group in a way that
   seems extreme or unjust mobilizes those close to them, and highlight the
   importance of policy context on political behavior.},

Abstract = {This article examines the relationship between third-party actors and
   the intentional targeting of non-combatants in interstate war. It argues
   that war participants kill fewer civilians in war when their expectation
   of third-party punishment is high. Combatants will anticipate a high
   likelihood of third-party sanctions when their alliance and trade
   networks are dominated by third parties that have ratified international
   treaties prohibiting the intentional targeting of non-combatants. The
   study hypothesizes that war combatants kill fewer civilians in war as
   the strength of ratifiers within their alliance and trade networks
   increases. Quantitative tests on a dataset of all interstate wars from
   1900-2003 provide strong statistical and substantive support for this
   hypothesis.},

Abstract = {There are good reasons to think that fiscal austerity can have important
   costs, and among these is political instability. We suggest that these
   political costs may be harder to identify than one might assume. Using a
   broad sample of countries from 1870 to 2011, we ask whether expenditure
   cuts are associated with increased leader turnover through either
   regular or irregular means. Ordinary least squares estimates suggest
   that there is no effect, but this may be due to a bias whereby leaders
   adopt austerity only when they think they can survive it. As an
   alternative empirical strategy, we also report instrumental variables
   estimates in which expenditure cuts are instrumented by exogenous trade
   and financial shocks, and we continue to observe a null result. Finally,
   we consider which interpretations of voter behavior might be consistent
   with our results.},

Volume = {17},

Abstract = {President Trump won an Electoral College majority in 2016 bolstered by
   voters who supported him, but not the previous nominee, Mitt Romney.
   Evidence suggests that a campaign promising a more restrictive
   immigration policy was the key to this improved performance among
   cross-pressured voters. In the months since inauguration day 2017,
   however, voters did not remain unaware of the administration's
   programmatic steps on immigration and the opposition they encountered. I
   interpret evidence from a panel survey to suggest that voters gained
   knowledge about immigration policy after 2016, and began to align their
   policy views with the positions of their favored political parties.
   Inasmuch as voters' policy positions become identical with their party
   preference, the potential for immigration policy to again act as a wedge
   issue in 2020 is greatly reduced. President Trump's 2020 campaign may be
   able to mobilize more base voters given this increase in policy-party
   congruence but he may not be as successful as in 2016 in attracting
   crossover voters.},

Abstract = {With Brexit imminent, the debate on the need for differentiated
   integration (DI) by means of opting-out has gained new momentum. At the
   same time, non-member states decide to adopt European Union (EU) rules
   as exemplified by the European Neighbourhood Policy. In light of these
   opposing observations, we examine the EU's disposition to supply DI. We
   outline the strategic interactions of the EU member states or
   non-members in the context of two forms of DI: opting-out and
   inducing-in. In the case of opting-out, EU member states can refrain
   from adopting EU rules; inducing-in refers to providing non-member
   states with incentives to adopt EU rules. We show that the information
   asymmetries inherent to the strategic interactions result in a situation
   in which the EU is likely to supply opportunities to opt-out for member
   states to a much greater extent than necessary. Furthermore, the EU is
   likely to offer more compensation to non-member states in exchange for
   adopting EU rules than it would actually need to.},

Abstract = {Mutual optimism theory holds that mutually optimistic beliefs about
   outcomes cause international conflict. Because beliefs are unobservable,
   this theory is difficult to test systematically. Here, I present a clean
   test of theory that relies exclusively on observable variables by
   exploiting novel features of naval battles in the age of sail, most
   notably an admiral's ability to avoid battle by simply sailing away.
   Using a formal model, I show that the outcome of mutual naval battles,
   where either side could avoid battle by sailing away, should not be
   predictable from observable capability indicators. The outcome of
   unilateral battles, where only one side could sail away to avoid
   fighting, should be predictable from these same indicators. I test these
   predictions against all squadron-level British naval battles from 1650
   to 1833. I show that observable strength indicators are substantially
   less predictive in mutual battles, confirming the core key theoretical
   prediction.},

Abstract = {Immanuel Kant is recognised as one of the first philosophers who wrote
   systematically about global justice and world peace. In the current
   debate on global justice, he is mostly appealed to by critics of
   extensive duties of global justice. However, I show in this paper that
   an analysis of Kant's late work on rights and justice provides ample
   resources for disagreeing with those who take Kant to call for only
   modest changes in global politics. Kant's comments in the Doctrine of
   Right clarify that he thinks we need a coercively enforced global civil
   condition. But his work also contains ideas that imply that within such
   a global legal order there must be no extreme forms of poverty and
   inequality, and that the current holdings of states are by no means
   conclusive possessions without confirmation by the global legal order we
   have a duty to establish. Thus, this paper challenges the prevailing
   interpretation of Kant as a conservative thinker about global justice
   that is held, for instance, by the leading contemporary liberal thinkers
   such as John Rawls, Thomas Nagel, and Ronald Dworkin.},

Abstract = {Why is there no balancing behavior in Southeast Asia vis-a-vis what many
   observers see as a ``Chinese threat,{''} especially in the case of
   Indonesia? Despite all the concerns regarding the stability of the
   region, Indonesia is neither strengthening its power projection
   capability nor building a coalition to address China's growing power in
   the South China Sea. Indonesia's underbalancing behavior is the result
   of a strategic culture that influences its military and foreign policy
   thinking on threat perceptions and economic considerations, limiting the
   options that Indonesia can take vis-a-vis China. As a result, China as a
   state is not seen as a major, direct, and immediate threat that would
   warrant immediate action that may in turn jeopardize Indonesia's larger
   interest. Instead, domestic politics and security-especially public
   perceptions of how the government's friendship with China may benefit or
   hurt the government-remains the focus and the priority of the
   government.},

Abstract = {After decades in which party competition was fought in the centre
   ground, the 2017 UK General Election witnessed a return to more
   conflictual politics. This article assesses public support for the
   electoral strategies of the main parties and examines the extent to
   which the issues the parties campaigned on resonated with their own
   supporters, as well as with the wider public. Drawing on the issue-yield
   framework, the article shows that the Conservative campaign ? generally
   considered to be badly run ? did not focus on issues that would fully
   exploit the opportunities for expanding support that were open to the
   party. Labour, by contrast, played a much better hand. While taking a
   clear left-wing stance on many policies that were popular with its
   constituency, the party also skilfully emphasised valence issues that
   Labour is often seen as more credible on, such as healthcare and
   education.},

Volume = {31},

Abstract = {International organizations (IOs) play a vital role in enforcing
   international law. I argue that collective-action problems and the
   design of legal-standing rules drive decisions about whether to enforce
   international law. When cooperation generates concentrated benefits-such
   as compensation for the expropriation of foreign
   investment-transnational standing can work well because the cost and
   benefit of enforcement are both fully internalized by the litigant.
   However, when cooperation generates diffuse benefits-like a cleaner
   environment-individuals and even governments have the incentive to free
   ride on enforcement, avoiding the cost of litigation in the hopes that
   another actor will step up. In such circumstances, supranational
   standing is necessary to uphold international law. Finally, hybrid
   regimes, which contain multiple forms of enforcement, are most needed
   when an IO has members that vary in their ability to enforce, or
   regulates issue areas that vary in their diffuseness.},

Abstract = {Germany has experienced a fundamental shift in the architecture of the
   old-age pension system since the turn of the century. While research has
   focused on the reduction of benefit levels, scholars have paid less
   attention to the changing framework for the transition into retirement.
   Lawmakers abolished options for early or flexible retirement in the
   public system, shifting responsibility for this issue to collective and
   company agreements. This paper investigates how different actors
   addressed their new responsibilities for shaping workers' transition
   from employment to retirement. It relies on an empirical study with a
   mixed methods research design, including a representative quantitative
   company survey, a qualitative analysis of different industries, company
   case studies, and analyses of collective agreements. We observe
   significant variation between industries and companies that have
   developed life-course-oriented options for their employees and others
   that have hardly taken up the issue. Consequently, the new architecture
   of old age security has led to new inequalities between workers of
   different industries and even within companies. The article contributes
   to our understanding of the political dynamics accompanying demographic
   and economic change across Europe and beyond by demonstrating the role
   of institutions and coordination mechanisms in producing variegated
   forms of citizenship. Keywords: old-age pension system, transition from
   work to retirement, flexible retirement, collective agreements,
   occupational pensions, multi-level-governance, inequality.},

Abstract = {Junior partners in a coalition government are torn between an eagerness
   to profile themselves, and to show loyalty to the coalition. We
   investigate when, how and why junior coalition parties affect foreign
   policy and profile themselves despite demands for national unity. We
   study two Swedish centre-right governments in 2006-2010 and 2010-2014.
   The parties' foreign policy positions in election manifestos are
   compared to the foreign policy positions presented in the joint Alliance
   manifesto and yearly government declarations. An explorative analysis of
   possible explanations for junior parties' influence is based on elite
   interviews. The results indicate that junior coalition parties might
   influence the foreign policy in symbolic value related issues, but less
   so in issues with real policy implications. Our analysis reveals the
   importance of the leading member of the coalition and how junior parties
   converge over time towards the position of the senior coalition member.},

Abstract = {Is American democracy under threat? The question is more prominent in
   political debate now than at any time in recent memory. However, it is
   also too blunt; there is widespread recognition that democracy is
   multifaceted and that backsliding, when it occurs, tends to be
   piecemeal. To address these concerns, we provide original data from
   surveys of political science experts and the public measuring the
   perceived importance and performance of U.S. democracy on a number of
   dimensions during the first year-and-a-half of the Trump presidency. We
   draw on a theory of how politicians may transgress limits on their
   authority and the conditions under which constraints are self-enforcing.
   We connect this theory to our survey data in an effort to identify
   potential areas of agreement-bright lines-among experts and the public
   about the most important democratic principles and whether they have
   been violated. Public and expert perceptions often differ on the
   importance of specific democratic principles. In addition, though our
   experts perceive substantial democratic erosion, particularly in areas
   related to checks and balances, polarization between Trump supporters
   and opponents undermines any social consensus recognizing these
   violations.},

Abstract = {Party members are often depicted as loyal voters that supply the party
   with a small but steady electoral base. Research, however, suggests that
   party members occasionally vote for other parties in general elections.
   This might either be a strategic choice or an indication of their
   discontent, possibly preceding a choice to exit the party. Using
   original survey data on more than 9000 party members in Flanders
   (Belgium) and Britain, this article aims to extend our understanding of
   why party members defect. We test hypotheses that take into account both
   individual and party-level considerations (ideological concerns,
   leadership evaluations and strategic choices) and the conditioning
   effects of party and electoral systems. Our analysis shows that
   institutional settings are crucial for strategic voting, whereas
   ideological concerns and leadership evaluations matter equally in both
   countries. As such, our study provides important insights in the
   attitudes and behaviour of party members, contributing to current
   debates on the contemporary meaning of party membership.},

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW},

Abstract = {Previous studies have found that left-wing and libertarian individuals
   are more likely to engage in extra-institutional political activism.
   However, due to a lack of suitable data, studies to date have not
   analysed the relative influence of economic redistributive and social
   libertarian values for the intensity of protest participation. By
   analysing data from a unique cross-national dataset on participants in
   mass demonstrations in seven countries, this article addresses this gap
   in the literature and provides evidence of the relative impact of
   economic redistributive and social libertarian values in explaining
   different degrees of protest participation. We show that there are
   divergent logics underpinning the effect of the two value sets on
   extra-institutional participation. While both economically
   redistributive and libertarian social values support extra-institutional
   participation, economically redistributive protesters are mobilized to
   political action mainly through organizations, whereas the
   extra-institutional participation of social libertarian protesters is
   underpinned by their dissatisfaction with the workings of democracy.},

Abstract = {This paper is about electoral participation in national elections in
   Iceland, where we analyze whether there has been a generational change
   in participation where younger cohorts are less likely to vote
   throughout their lives compared to young people before. We distinguish
   between age, period and cohort effect on electoral participation, using
   data from the Icelandic National Election Study and we find that the
   youngest generation today is less likely to vote compared to earlier
   younger generations. We discuss and analyze whether those changes can be
   explained by a change in political interest and party identification of
   younger voters. Our findings point to that the youngest generation today
   is just as interested in politics as young people was before and as
   older voters are. Political interest among younger voters has not
   changed and it motivates young and old people to vote in a similar way
   as before. We do find that party identification is today a weaker
   motivator for young people to vote than it was before. This, together
   with that political interest has not changed, could indicate that the
   youngest generation is more inclined to participate in politics by other
   ways than voting. However, it cannot be excluded that the change in
   voting patterns of the youngest generation is due to a delay in their
   maturation, meaning that today they are older when they start to take an
   active part in the society.},

Abstract = {Since presidential term limits were (re)adopted by many states during
   the third wave of democratization, 221 presidents across Latin America,
   Africa, the Middle East, and Asia have reached the end of their term(s)
   in office. Of these, 30\% have attempted to contravene term limits,
   resulting in either full abolition, one-term extensions, or failure.
   What explains these divergent trajectories? I argue that trends in
   electoral competition over time best predict term limit outcomes, with
   noncompetitive elections permitting full abolition, less competitive
   elections allowing for one-term extensions, and competitive elections
   leading to failed bids. This is because electoral trends provide
   informational cues to the president's co-partisan legislators and
   constitutional court judges (the actors who ultimately rule on
   constitutional term limit amendments) about the cost/benefit analysis
   that voting to uphold or repeal term limits would have on their own
   political survival. These findings suggest a linkage between political
   uncertainty and constitutional stability more generally.},

Abstract = {How do sanctions affect incumbent electoral performance during
   elections? Although existing literature suggests that sanctions may
   shorten or prolong incumbent tenure, we are less informed about their
   role in incumbent electoral fortunes. This research argues that
   sanctions hurt incumbents' vote shares because citizens are more likely
   to hold their elected officials accountable for sanction-induced
   economic hardships and political instabilities. It also argues that the
   electoral punishment is pronounced in less democratic countries because
   sanctions, together with elections, significantly limit dictator's
   co-optation strategy and open a greater window of opportunity for once
   repressed opposition groups in a repressive regime. Using 381 multiparty
   elections in seventy-nine countries between 1972 and 2012, this research
   finds that sanctions deteriorate the incumbent electoral performance,
   and they do so for autocratic leaders more than the democratic leaders.
   This study has important implications about the potential accountability
   in autocracies, the timing of sanctions imposition, the role of
   oppositions' mobilization, and broadly speaking, the role of sanctions
   in democratization.},

Abstract = {How did the Eurozone bailouts affect national democracies? Recent
   research indicates strong citizen detachment due to the external
   constraints imposed by bailout programs on national autonomy. This paper
   re-examines the detachment thesis by broadening the view toward multiple
   dimensions of democracy and effect heterogeneity across time and space.
   Using the generalized synthetic control method, we find a negative
   effect of bailouts on satisfaction with democracy and turnout but show
   that effects vanish after several years and vary strongly across bailout
   cases. In addition, we find resilient attitudes and behaviors in spite
   of national democratic institutions that continue to deteriorate. These
   findings indicate that economic policy outcomes have a stronger
   influence on satisfaction with democracy and electoral turnout than the
   quality of the democratic process.},

Abstract = {In this article, I focus on the factor of age as a determinant of
   individual support for the use of force by the government. I argue that
   socialization theory, as a key conceptual frame, should be supplemented
   by rational choice explanations for understanding individual preferences
   more fully. Employing survey data on the Chechen conflict, I investigate
   generational gaps in Russia regarding the government's use of force, and
   the form those gaps take. Empirically, I substantiate a theoretical
   claim that several generations exist in Russia, each with its own
   attitudes and beliefs, including the so-called ``second edition of the
   Decembrists,{''} ``the people of the `60s,{''} ``the people of the
   `70s,{''} ``the generation of perestroika,{''} ``the disappointed
   generation,{''} and a ``lost generation/mega-consumers.{''} I find
   strong, albeit surprising, evidence of a generational gap in Russia,
   with respondents born in different time periods, especially ``the `60s
   people{''} and ``mega-consumers{''} expressing variable attitudes toward
   the Chechnya conflict. Related Articles Brader, Ted A., and Joshua A.

Abstract = {Most democracies are governed by coalitions, comprising multiple
   political parties with conflicting policy positions. The prevalence of
   these governments poses a significant question: Which parties' electoral
   commitments are ultimately reflected in government policy? Recent
   theories have challenged our understanding of multiparty government,
   arguing that the relative influence of coalition parties depends
   crucially on institutional context. Specifically, where institutions
   allow credible enforcement of bargains, policy should reflect a
   compromise among all governing parties; where such institutions are
   absent, the preferences of parties controlling the relevant ministries
   should prevail. Critically, empirical work has thus far failed to
   provide direct evidence for this conditional relationship. Analyzing
   changes in social protection policies in 15 parliamentary democracies,
   we provide the first systematic evidence that the strength of
   legislative institutions significantly shapes the relative policy
   influence of coalition parties. Our findings have implications for our
   understanding of coalition government, policymaking, and electoral
   responsiveness.},

Abstract = {This paper examines how the political opposition innovated strategies to
   overcome obstacles presented by Russia's uneven electoral playing field.
   Using evidence from two municipal elections in Moscow, I argue that
   members of the opposition have coordinated around local contests in
   response to political opportunities created by the Kremlin, including
   the anti-electoral fraud protests of the winter of 2011-2012 and the
   resurrection of gubernatorial elections in 2012. Following these
   openings, grassroots electoral initiatives recruited and trained
   opposition-minded individuals, first focusing on established activists
   and then on politicized individuals, to run for municipal council seats.
   The campaigns provided training using ad hoc educational seminars and
   later developed electronic tools that lowered barriers to political
   participation. As a result of these campaigns, electoral competition has
   boomed at the local level in Moscow even as regional and national
   contests have become less competitive. The campaigns demonstrate the
   continued vulnerability of authoritarian regimes that rely on elections
   for political legitimacy. Furthermore, the development of highly
   portable online tools for campaigning has potentially long-term
   democratizing consequences.},

Abstract = {Popular and academic discourses frame civil society as a key factor that
   prevented Tunisia from following the unfortunate path of other Arab
   Spring states. But while such discourses tend to portray it as a
   monolithic political force, Tunisian civil society comprises a diverse
   range of different types of actors with different backgrounds,
   interests, views and approaches towards activism. Drawing upon
   interviews with Tunisian activists, this article maps a range of
   tensions within Tunisian secular civil society along these lines and
   sets out to explain their origins. Notably, it identifies a generational
   division between those activists that started to engage in the late
   2000s or during and after the 2011 ouster of Ben Ali and those who were
   already active before. This division is based on a range of factors,
   including a sense of entitlement to the leadership of post-2011 Tunisian
   civil society on both sides, a lack of mutual respect for and trust in
   each other as well as differences regarding practices and priorities of
   civil society engagement.},

Abstract = {South European labour markets have gone through a substantial level of
   downward adjustment in wages (internal devaluation) and liberalisation
   in the aftermath of the Eurozone crisis. Yet, there have been
   differences in the extent of change between Greece, Portugal, Spain and
   Italy. These differences cannot be explained by the size of the economic
   crisis alone. While existing analyses focus on the extent of external
   pressure or party ideologies, this article focuses on the pre-existing
   level of regulation by the state as opposed to regulation by social
   partners. It shows that devaluation and liberalisation were the most
   extensive in countries where governments possessed more tools to force
   down wages (statutory job protection, state regulations of collective
   bargaining, minimum wages), sometimes even against the will of
   employers. In contrast, countries with a higher level of autonomy for
   social partners (and fewer policy instruments available to governments
   to influence wages) devalued less. In some cases, the crisis led to more
   power to the state, rather than less. The article shows that state
   intervention can be a facilitator rather than a barrier to wage
   adjustment.},

Abstract = {Can the media effectively hold politicians accountable for making false
   claims? Journalistic fact-checking assesses the accuracy of individual
   public statements by public officials, but less is known about whether
   this process effectively imposes reputational costs on
   misinformation-prone politicians who repeatedly make false claims. This
   study therefore explores the effects of exposure to summaries of
   fact-check ratings, a new format that presents a more comprehensive
   assessment of politician statement accuracy over time. Across three
   survey experiments, we compared the effects of negative individual
   statement ratings and summary fact-checking data on favorability and
   perceived statement accuracy of two prominent elected officials. As
   predicted, summary fact-checking had a greater effect on politician
   perceptions than individual fact-checking. Notably, we did not observe
   the expected pattern of motivated reasoning: co-partisans were not
   consistently more resistant than supporters of the opposition party. Our
   findings suggest that summary fact-checking is particularly effective at
   holding politicians accountable for misstatements.},

Volume = {44},

Abstract = {Can legislatures effectively check unilateral executive power? One
   prominent and counterintuitive finding in previous work is that
   executives pursue unilateralism less often under divided government.
   While executives see greater potential policy gains through unilateral
   action during divided government, we argue that their likelihood of
   acting unilaterally depends on an opposed legislature's ability to
   retaliate. When polarization is high and majorities are marginal,
   executives are freer to act unilaterally given the difficulties
   legislatures have in statutorily responding. Unilateralism is also more
   likely when facing opposition if legislatures lack nonstatutory means of
   punishment, such as regulatory review. In the largest analysis of
   gubernatorial executive unilateralism to date, we use a new data set of
   24,232 executive orders in the 50 American states between 1993 and 2013
   to evaluate this argument and find strong support for its predictions.
   These results provide insights into how legislative policymaking
   capacity can influence the functioning of separation of powers systems.},

Abstract = {Extensive scholarly attention is devoted to citizens' preferences for
   alternative models of political decision-making. However, few efforts
   were made to identify who these citizens are and why they display a
   certain preference. To address this void in the literature, our article
   analyzes the determinants of preferences for citizens as
   decision-makers. It uses individual-level data from a 2014 survey on a
   probability representative sample in Germany and tests the effects of
   political attitudes toward institutions of representative democracy,
   interest in politics, and civic involvement. It controls for consumption
   of political news, education, and age.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this study is to inquire about elaboration and
   presentation of labor legislation projects by Federacion Obrera de Chile
   (FOCh) to the National Congress, during year 1921. Presented projects:
   Labor Chambers, Conciliation Court and Industrial Socialization
   Contract. These sought to deliver a high decision-making power to
   workers in the regulation of labor relations and labor market. The
   projects combined corporatist and evolutionary socialist orientations,
   typical of the union and socialist thought of the Chilean labor movement
   of the time. The adoption of corporatist ideas constituted a pragmatic
   and defensive option on the part of the socialist FOCh, in view of the
   reactionary situation that weakened the workers' movement. However, the
   ambiguity of such ideas favored the visibility of sectors within the
   FOCh that proclaimed themselves defenders of an evolutionary socialism
   that on several occasions became indistinguishable from corporatism. The
   FOCh hoped that under a political climate favorable to social reform,
   Congress would approve the bills. On the contrary, these were rejected
   by the oligarchic parties.},

Abstract = {Questions of identity have returned to the centre of political debates
   in Europe. A key issue is that while the EU has greatly expanded its
   powers in key policy domains that traditionally have been the preserve
   of nation states, its political identity remains weak. The special issue
   examines the construction of the EU's political identity (or
   identities), variations in its strength and the nature of its content.
   Drawing on studies both on European nation-state formation and on the
   EU's identity, we take a top-down approach and analyse how EU
   institutions in different major policy domains have themselves sought to
   create political identity through policy making. We define the
   construction of EU political identity and set out empirically applicable
   indicators to assess political identity in policy making. We analyse the
   construction of identity through a process-oriented approach that
   explicitly includes contestation and the existence of rival political
   identities. Comparing across policy domains, we suggest that the ability
   of EU institutions to construct an EU political identity has been
   limited not only by existing national identities but also by the
   coexistence of rival EU political identities within policy domains.
   Hence, it has been difficult for EU institutions to establish a strong
   identity, with identity being strongest where there are clear external
   alternatives and limited rival identities within the EU.},

Abstract = {In this article, we formulate a theoretical framework that examines the
   ``internal{''} organizational characteristics of ethnic minority
   political parties, the characteristics of the ethnic minority group they
   purport to represent, and the external environment that these parties
   face, to explain the political success of these parties. As an empirical
   plausibility probe of this framework, we use data from 1991 to 2016 for
   41 ethnic minority parties across 12 countries and 89 national
   legislative elections. Using a logistic regression analysis, our
   findings suggest that party organizational capability is most associated
   with ethnic minority party success in postcommunist politics when
   compared to other ``supply{''} and ``structure of opportunity{''}
   variables.},

Abstract = {Under what conditions do the institutional features of courts affect the
   efficiency of judicial decision-making? Examining the Court of Justice
   of the European Union's mandate that all judgments be written in French,
   I argue that francophone judges-i.e. judges from France, French-speaking
   Belgium, and Luxembourg-write judgments more efficiently than their
   non-francophone counterparts. Leveraging the institutional feature of
   the judge-rapporteur and using matching methods, I show that comparable
   cases with a francophone judge-rapporteur are a month shorter on average
   than cases with a non-francophone judge-rapporteur. This estimate is
   robust to scaling the judgments by their word counts. Although I provide
   evidence francophones write judgments with lower lexical diversity on
   average than non-francophones, existing empirical measures are limited
   in examining differences in judgment quality. These findings have
   implications for the efficient processing of cases at the Court of
   Justice and the potential consequences of adopting a lingua franca in
   the European Union.},

Abstract = {Twenty-five years after its publication, Michael Dawson's Behind the
   Mule remains a monograph of great theoretical and empirical value. In
   the wake of the election of the first nonwhite president of the United
   States in 2008 and primed racial-ethnic threat throughout the 2016
   election and Trump presidency, however, Dawson's theory requires deeper
   reflection and reconsideration. In this paper, we investigate the
   political relevance of racial-ethnic group-consciousness among Latinos
   and Whites. We demonstrate the dynamic nature of solidaridad among
   Latinos and linked anxiety among Whites as well as the complex
   connections each has to both personal experiences of and perceptions of
   racial-ethnic group discrimination and to political participation. We
   find that solidaridad and linked anxiety are differently rooted in
   experiences and perceptions of discrimination, but that connections
   between solidaridad and linked anxiety and participation are weaker.},

Abstract = {This article analyses negotiations on democracy promotion by looking at
   the case of the Inter-American Democratic Charter. It argues that
   Venezuela contested the concept of representative democracy during the
   Charter negotiations, advancing the notion of participatory and
   protagonist democracy and that, even if it was unsuccessful in its
   demands, the country contributed to deepening the debate on the concept
   of democracy, on which there is far from worldwide consensus. The
   article suggests that the main drivers of the negotiation process and
   the final agreement were domestic political changes in Venezuela,
   specific features of the negotiations, and the structural position of
   Venezuela in the field of democracy promotion in the global and regional
   contexts, which were, at the time, favourable to a compromising attitude
   to conclusion of the Charter, even if not to the concept of democracy.},

Abstract = {This article examines liberal political theory's limits and
   possibilities in relation to indigenous self-determination. It shows
   that while the liberal tradition has provided theoretical rationale to
   the colonial project it is also equipped to rationalise a politics of
   substantive indigenous inclusion. The article introduces the recourses
   that exist within liberal theory for non-colonial interpretations of
   citizenship, democracy and sovereignty. It shows how these concepts may
   be interpreted to contribute to a liberal theory of indigeneity as a
   theory emphasising independent indigenous authority on the one hand and
   culturally contextualised and substantive participation in the politics
   of the state on the other.},

Abstract = {This article will study the new face of Conservative Euroscepticism in
   the House of Commons, with a special focus on the 2015 intake of MPs who
   were supposedly `less stale, male and pale' and their attitudes to the
   British referendum on the EU. In this respect, this article will also
   take a specific interest in new Conservative Black and Asian Minority
   Ethnic (BAME) MPs who turned out to be more active on the `leave' side
   of the referendum campaign, thus serving as a showcase for the party's
   strategy of `decontaminating' the Brexit brand and its hyperglobalist
   geopolitical perspective.},

Abstract = {Constitutional conventions are fundamental to the operation of
   Westminster democracies. However, despite their political significance,
   there have been few attempts to analyse and theorise their internal
   dynamics. This article aims to address this gap by identifying the
   triggers of constitutional `softening', when the opportunity for
   convention change emerges; and examining how such moments interact with
   the particular properties of a convention to determine its change
   trajectory. We argue that the change trajectories of constitutional
   conventions are not entirely unpredictable but can be traced to
   particular kinds of change events and the particular set of features
   inherent to that convention.},

Abstract = {The use of vote centers-specific locations in a county where all voters
   will vote-is on the rise nationwide, as more than a dozen states used
   this process by 2018. More states are moving toward using voting centers
   to remedy the problem of low voter turnout, with the assumption that the
   centralization of voting to several core county locations will increase
   voter accessibility. What we have less clear information about is the
   effect of vote centers on turnout in individual elections across several
   cycles. Using a natural experiment in Texas-a state that has three fixed
   election cycles-we find vote centers have a small positive impact on
   traditionally lower turnout elections but no effect on higher turnout
   elections. The cumulative impact of vote centers has a small effect on
   turnout over time. These results suggest a more cautious assessment is
   needed when considering the use and impact of vote centers.},

Abstract = {We investigated the link between party identification and several
   cognitive styles that are associated with open-minded thinking. We used
   a web-based survey which involved participants rating the strength of an
   argument they initially disagreed with. Results showed that Democrats
   tend to score higher and Republicans tend to score lower on open-minded
   cognitive style variables. However, mediation analyses showed that these
   partisan differences in cognitive style generally have negligible
   relationships with how individuals assess the strength of arguments they
   disagree with. In other words, partisan differences in cognitive style
   may often make little meaningful difference to information processing.},

Abstract = {In recent decades, fear of terrorism has increased among voters in
   liberal democracies. In response, governments have adopted
   counterterrorist measures that curtail civil liberties, at times
   prompting allegations that political expediency underlies such measures.
   I study politicians' strategic design of counterterrorist policies in a
   model of valence competition under threat of terrorism. The incumbent
   chooses a counterterrorist strategy that combines observable (state of
   emergency) and unobservable (effort) actions. In equilibrium,
   emergencies and terrorist attacks become endogenously informative about
   valence. The low-valence incumbent underprovides effort relative to the
   high-valence incumbent, and at times declares a state of emergency in
   the absence of a terrorist threat. Increasing voters' information about
   the incumbent's valence improves politician selection, but at the
   expense of a higher incidence of unwarranted emergencies and, under some
   conditions, terrorist attacks.},

Abstract = {In spite of the remarkable urban and real estate development reached
   throughout the decades in the City of Buenos Aires, there is still a
   persisting and deep housing problem, which can be seen in the
   difficulties in access to housing suffered by the most vulnerable
   socioeconomic groups. This situation is specially exacerbated in the
   southern area of the city, where informal settlements popularly known as
   ``villas de emergencia{''} have grown both spatially and demographically
   over the past five years. This article intends to explore the role of
   the Government in the City of Buenos Aires between the years 2007 and
   2015 as regards the formulation and implementation of housing policies
   that, on the one hand, ensure access to adequate housing to those
   excluded from the real estate market and, on the other hand, promote
   social and urban integration of this type of informal settlements into
   the formal city.},

Abstract = {Endorsement of the party's nominee by the vast majority of that party's
   top elected officials is a foregone conclusion in most presidential
   campaigns. But in 2016, Republican lawmakers were slow to endorse Donald
   Trump, lackluster in their enthusiasm, and a substantial number never
   endorsed or withdrew their endorsements by the campaign's end. What
   explains lawmakers' decisions to endorse, and the timing and strength of
   their endorsements? I find that primary endorsements were most likely to
   come from anti-immigration moderates, but as the campaign wore on,
   conservatives and members from more Republican districts became more
   supportive in their endorsements. Women were highly influenced by the
   release of the Access Hollywood tape, while Ted Cruz's endorsers were
   stingy in their support until Cruz himself issued a late September
   endorsement. To see if these endorsement decisions made a difference in
   the election, I compare the performance of endorsers and non-endorsers
   in the 2016 congressional elections, and I compare Trump's performance
   in districts in which he was endorsed to those in which he wasn't.
   Rather than the traditional presidential coattails, I find evidence of
   negative coattails and reverse coattails. Endorsers did about 1.7
   percentage points worse than non- endorsers, while Trump did 1.4
   percentage points better in districts where the incumbent Republican
   endorsed him.},

Abstract = {The Metropolitan Area of Mexico City has a system of slopes that host
   native vegetation and fauna. In addition, the slopes play an important
   role in the hydraulic balance of the zone. A big amount of these slopes
   has been lost due to different processes of urbanization. For example:
   the construction of highways, of residential areas, as well as of
   irregular settlements. However, there are organizations of neighbors
   interested in stopping future changes on the land use of the slopes. The
   goal of this article is to show the trajectory of the Tepecuache slope
   restoration in Santa Fe, Mexico City. This has certain characteristics
   that make its study relevant. Furthermore the ecological impact, the
   activities of the organization entails to talk of the slope of
   Tepecuache as one loaded with significance, where different actors have

Abstract = {This paper, following the methodology of conceptual history,
   demonstrates the uses of the concept ``political science{''} during the
   Sixteenth Century. A periodisation is proposed from the Late Medieval
   Aristotelian context to the translation into vernacular languages, at
   the end of the Sixteenth Century. Through this periodisation, it can be
   seen that the notion of ``political science{''} came to unseat the
   concepts of civil knowledge typical of the Roman tradition and ended up
   positing itself as an autonomous knowledge, within the framework of the
   flourishing State.},

Abstract = {Federal civil servants need policy expertise to formulate and implement
   public policy. Presidents and congresses do not confer such expertise
   when they delegate responsibility for policy making. Existing research
   suggests that elected officials' efforts to gain control of federal
   agencies can reduce agency expertise by inducing civil servants to exit
   the agency and reducing incentives for civil servants to exert effort,
   including acquiring policy expertise. I use data from an original survey
   of federal executives to examine whether politicization reduces agency
   expertise. I find that civil servants whose policy preferences diverge
   from those of political appointees are more likely to perceive that
   their agency is politicized and that civil servants who perceive their
   agency is politicized are more likely to exit the agency and less likely
   to engage in behaviors that build policy expertise. In total, these
   findings provide systematic, microlevel evidence demonstrating how
   politicization can reduce agency policy expertise.},

Abstract = {NATO brings about change in the traditional militaries through the
   Women, Peace and Security (WPS) agenda, transforming the understanding
   of security. The UNSCR 1325 frames how women's inclusion in conflict
   resolution increases women's, therefore everyone's well-being. This
   article lays out that despite the discussions around the Istanbul
   Convention, EU's dethronement as a moral norm-exporter, and the sour
   discourse against Syrians in Turkey, it is still possible to write a
   National Action Plan (NAP) for UNSCR 1325 with the support of the
   resilient and independent women's civil society. While there is no
   one-size-fits-all recipe for a NAP, women's civil societies' involvement
   in international security issues with organizations such as NATO could
   open new discussions within the civil sphere and contribute to the
   international discussion around the WPS to push for positive change for
   women in Turkey.},

Journal = {CAPITAL AND CLASS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {43},
Number = {2},
Pages = {251-270},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {The first decade of the new millennium saw the governments of Canada and
   the United Kingdom enact criminal legislation intended to hold
   corporations accountable for negligently killing workers and/or members
   of the public. Drawing empirically from document analyses and
   semistructured interviews, as well as theoretical insights concerning
   the crisis-prone tendencies of capital, this article demonstrates how
   both laws were conceived in ways that spatio-temporally delimited the
   problem' of corporate killing and re-secured the (neoliberal) capitalist
   status quo. In so doing, we argue that the inability of the state to
   hold powerful corporations and corporate actors to account for their
   serious offending presents strategic opportunities for demanding
   improved accountability measures and changes to a system responsible for
   so much bloodshed and killing.},

Abstract = {To date, most accounts of the UK's vote to leave the EU have focussed on
   explaining variation across individuals and constituencies within the
   UK. In this article, we attempt to answer a different question, namely
   `Why was it the UK that voted to leave, rather than any other member
   state?'. We show that the UK has long been one of the most Eurosceptic
   countries in the EU, which we argue can be partly explained by Britons'
   comparatively weak sense of European identity. We also show that
   existing explanations of the UK's vote to leave cannot account for
   Britons' long-standing Euroscepticism: the UK scores lower than many
   other member states on measures of inequality/austerity, the `losers of
   globalisation' and authoritarian values, and some of these measures are
   not even correlated with Euroscepticism across member states. In
   addition, we show that the positive association between national
   identity and Euroscepticism is stronger in the UK than in most other EU
   countries. Overall, we conclude that Britons' weak sense of European
   identity was a key contributor to the Brexit vote.},

Abstract = {We use original survey data from Malaysia to explore differences in how
   traditional and digital media shape the attitudes and behavior of
   citizens. In closed, and even semi-authoritarian, states such as
   Malaysia, the Internet, including social media, is often the only place
   for opposition-centered media to thrive. As a result, consumption of
   Internet media is related to dissident attitudes. We argue that this
   relationship, though, is mitigated by trust in the medium. Our results
   suggest: (1) trust in traditional and Internet media determines the
   frequency with which citizens use each corresponding medium to gather
   political information, (2) higher trust in traditional media is
   positively associated with attitudes about democratic conditions in
   Malaysia; the opposite is true for trust in Internet media, (3) trust in
   the traditional media is negatively related, and trust in Internet media
   is positively related to the inclination to protest, (4) the positive
   relationship between digital media consumption and this attitude is
   stronger for those who trust Internet media, and diminished among those
   who trust traditional media.},

Abstract = {This paper examines the financial impact of the 2011 reform of the local
   governments and jurisdictions in the canton of Glarus. After a popular
   vote 70 public entities were reorganized to form three large uniformed
   communes. Previous research showed that amalgamations do not
   automatically lead to savings in public expenditures and economies of
   scale. We empirically apply the synthetic control method and show that
   the territorial reform realized some savings in public expenditure.
   However, the effect of the reorganization of tasks and responsibilities
   between the canton and the communes was more influential. The reform
   must be understood as a horizontal and vertical venture that encompasses
   both the communes and the canton, much more far-reaching than a pure
   local territorial reform.},

Abstract = {2019 marks 100 years since the birth of Andreas Papandreou, Greece's
   first socialist prime minister and an extraordinary figure of twentieth
   century European politics. Looking back, the central purpose of this
   article is to answer pivotal questions about Papandreou and his career.
   What have been the major turning points in his life? What were his main
   beliefs? What motivated him and his politics? What were his political
   priorities and methods? What did he want to achieve as prime minister?
   Why did he become so involved in foreign policy issues? What were his
   assets as prime minister? Did they outweigh his shortcomings as a
   politician and leader? Did power change him and how? What will be
   Papandreou's place in history?},

Title = {The Political Consequences of Policing: Evidence from New York City},
Journal = {POLITICAL BEHAVIOR},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {41},
Number = {2},
Pages = {527-558},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {This paper explores the effect that municipal policing can exert on
   politics, and specifically investigates the effect that Stop, Question,
   and Frisk (SQF) policing has had on voter turnout and candidate choice
   in New York City. While extant studies of the American criminal justice
   system have found that mass incarceration and felon disenfranchisement
   negatively impact political participation and engagement, few have
   explicitly explored policing's relationship with politics and fewer
   still consider its mobilizing potential. Mobilizing data from over
   2.7million geo-coded police stops and data from a series of national and
   municipal elections this paper uncovers a pattern of voter
   demobilization, voter mobilization, and candidate choice that cannot be
   anticipated from extant studies in the literature. Specifically, it
   finds that while concentrated policing was associated with reductions in
   voter turnout in the 2006 and 2010 midterm elections, it was associated
   with higher rates of turnout in the 2008 presidential election and 2013
   Democratic primary and general mayor. Further analysis demonstrates that
   stopping intensity was strongly associated with candidate choice in the
   2013 Democratic mayoral primary, such that higher rates of policing were
   positively associated with support for the candidate (John Liu) who
   advocated for eliminating SQF and less support for the candidate
   (William Thompson) who supported SQF. Together, these findings highlight
   the impact that policing can exert on political behavior, characterize
   the impact that harmful policing policies can play in instigating
   policing participation and engagement, and foreground the importance of
   considering local criminal justice policy and political action.},

Abstract = {In order to limit climate change and enable sustainable growth, global
   energy transformation driven by renewable energy energy efficiency,
   electrification, and digitalization must be accelerated. In addition to
   mitigating climate change, reducing local air pollution, and improving
   energy security, socio-economic benefits are among the key drivers for
   this transformation. While system-wide innovation is necessary to
   continue the power system transformation with cost-effective renewable
   energy solutions, energy efficiency, renewable energy, and
   electrification solutions must jointly be pursued in the heating and
   transport sectors. Early action will be crucial to reap the economic
   benefits of this transformation and to limit its costs. Countries should
   start planning today to limit the potential risks that could arise from
   geopolitical shifts and the changing structure of economies due to
   global energy transformation.},

   more light on this process, the article analyses an original dataset
   comprising biographical and behavioural information on all 751 Members

   choice of committee chairs and vice-chairs is not determined by loyalty
   to party groups or national delegations. Instead, we demonstrate that
   Members of the European Parliament' career ambitions and their ability
   to demonstrate relevant experience play a key role. These findings have
   important implications for our understanding of the power of national

Journal = {GERMAN POLITICS},

Volume = {30},
Number = {1, SI},
Pages = {14-30},

Abstract = {This article introduces a `dividual actor' approach as a novel way of
   explaining German foreign policy. It presents its main tenets and
   demonstrates its relevance - both theoretically and in an illustrative
   sketch of German arms' exports policy. The article starts from the
   observation that mainstream approaches, exemplified here by civilian
   power and geo-economic power, struggle to explain the recurring
   inconsistencies and tensions in German foreign policy. I argue that this
   is rooted in problematic assumptions about actorness, which is seen as
   coherent and unfolding linearly over time. As an alternative, I
   construct the dividual actor framework and develop it via the concepts
   of social logics, which capture recurring patterns in foreign policy,
   and articulation, which grasps the contingent and political moment in
   decision making. The notion of a dividual actor with multiple identities
   provides a theoretical explanation for the recurring inconsistencies in
   Berlin's actions. It also opens space for novel insights, by bridging
   the analysis of social patterns with the analysis of how these patterns
   are reshaped through political decision-making. Lastly, it offers a way
   of embracing some empirical insights of civilian and geo-economic power
   by incorporating them into a more open-ended and context-specific
   framework.},

Abstract = {The idea that the citizen owes allegiance to his or her state has long
   historical roots, and has been repeatedly affirmed in theory and in law.
   Revocation of citizenship has a long history, too. The most recent
   Australian example is the 2015 amendment to the Australian Citizenship
   Act (2007) which provides for the citizenship revocation of terrorists
   who have demonstrably `repudiated their allegiance to Australia.'
   Further Australian examples include the constitutional disqualification
   from parliament of MPs who hold dual citizenship, and proposed
   tightening of the eligibility criteria for naturalisation to include
   enhanced affirmations of allegiance, and to associate allegiance with
   national `values'. The meaning of allegiance remains, nevertheless
   elusive, but such examples reveal that the core idea that allegiance to
   the state must be single and undivided has endured, despite the modern
   tolerance of dual citizenship. Similarly, the idea that conduct is
   relevant to citizenship is not new. It is, furthermore, encouraged by
   many normative theories of citizenship. This paper discusses Australian
   law as a case-study of allegiance in the conceptualisation of
   citizenship.},

Abstract = {Presidential persuasion is one of the most investigated soft-power
   interactions between the president and members of Congress. However,
   presidents are often as interested in long-term relationship building
   strategies that do not include an immediate favor request. This project
   analyzes those relationship building strategies between President
   Richard Nixon and members of Congress. One hundred sixty-three
   conversations between Nixon and members of Congress have been
   transcribed and analyzed. As part of an overall goal of building and
   maintaining interbranch relationships with members of Congress, Nixon
   utilized a mixture of three social goal approaches: social-support
   contacts, information gathering and exchange contacts, and offering
   material benefits.},

Abstract = {The aim of this article is to analyze in comparative and transnational
   perspective the movements for the homosexual liberation in
   Latin-America. Based on the researchers of the authors of the
   Argentinean and Colombian cases, and also, by the recognition of other
   studies, the text examines the development of these movements in
   Argentina, Brasil, Chile, Colombia, Peru, Mexico and Venezuela between
   1967 and 1989. The article argues that the politics of radical
   homosexual can be assumed as a question to the historiography that
   pointed them as emanations of the Anglo-Saxon activist. All in all, it
   studies the radical sexual politics in Latin-America and their links
   with national left-movements, feminists, and the States.},

Abstract = {The requirements for global security and international stability vary
   according to the perspective brought to bear on the subject. Indeed, the
   structural realist and neoliberal paradigms present markedly different
   views on the sources of war and prescriptions for peace. Structural
   realism focuses on system-level capability distributions, alliances, and
   dyadic power balances as factors associated with the onset of war.
   Neoliberalism emphasizes the importance of international institutions,
   democracy, and economic interdependence in maintaining global security.
   This study develops an integrated model of war and peace based on
   system-level factors drawn from both paradigms and utilizes a new
   database reflecting the level of major power policy coordination. The
   findings for the period of 1816-2007 indicate that interaction effects
   of these realist and neoliberal variables complement their relationships
   with global patterns of interstate conflict. The basic conclusion to be
   drawn is that both concentrated power and managerial cooperation at the
   apex of the international system are required to produce a more peaceful
   world.},

Abstract = {One of the most striking political developments occurring during the
   Great Recession has been the growth of the radical left in some European
   countries. Though the literature is far from conclusive, it has
   generally been argued that the economy is not a main reason driving
   people's support for non-mainstream parties (particularly the Greens and
   the radical right). In this article, we contend that this is not the
   case for radical left parties (RLPs), which despite pursuing other
   agendas do still compete very strongly on economic issues. Using
   individual-level data for 56 elections taking place between 1996 and
   2016 in 15 European countries, we find a positive effect of unemployment
   on support for RLPs, and only very weak evidence that this effect
   depends on voters' ideology or whether the mainstream (Social Democrats)
   left is in office. We conclude that unemployment enables the radical
   left to increase its support regardless of the political context but
   does not significantly change by itself the ideological makeup of its
   electorate.},

Title = {Explaining the end of Spanish exceptionalism and electoral support for
   Vox},
Journal = {RESEARCH \& POLITICS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {6},
Number = {2},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {The 2018 regional elections in Andalucia marked the end of Spain's
   exceptional status as a country with a party system free from the
   radical right. The electoral success of the radical right-wing
   challenger, Vox, who gained 11\% of the vote and 12 seats in the
   regional parliament, brought this exceptionalism to an end. This paper
   analyses the individual-level determinants that explain the electoral
   success of Vox and the emergence of the radical right within the Spanish
   party system. The results indicate that concerns over devolution, likely
   engendered by the Catalan separatist crisis, predominantly explain
   voters' preferences for the right-wing challenger. This is true both
   amongst the general electorate as well as amongst the former voters of
   other right-wing parties. Significantly, against popular assumptions and
   empirical observations explaining the rise of radical right-wing parties
   across much of Western Europe, the results display no empirical link
   between immigration and electoral support for Vox.},

Abstract = {While some scholars call for mechanisms to give citizens a greater voice
   in politics, others critically question the demand for more citizen
   participation. Rather, they find that the people do not want to be
   involved in politics and prefer independent experts to make political
   decisions. This perspective is captured by Hibbing and Theiss-Morse in
   their concept of stealth democracy. They describe stealth democrats as
   people who think that political debates are unnecessary or who naturally
   avoid all sorts of conflict. Especially the latter argument points to a
   potential psychological underpinning of stealth attitudes, which forms
   the starting point of the investigation here. This article evaluates the
   personality of stealth democrats and makes use of a well-known concept
   to capture personality traits, the `Big Five' model. Analysing unique
   survey data from Switzerland, the results reveal significant
   relationships between personality traits such as conscientiousness,
   agreeableness, and neuroticism and stealth attitudes.},

Abstract = {Does voters' ability to discern who is responsible for policy outcomes
   affect voter turnout? Although particular institutional arrangements
   which influence this ability - known as clarity of responsibility -
   appear to affect how voters form retrospective judgements, existing
   literature is less informed about its role on voter turnout. This
   article argues that voters tend to turn out less if they cannot discern
   who is responsible for policy outcomes. This lack of clarity hinders the
   process of retrospective evaluations, makes the electoral stakes less
   profound, and dampens the voters' political efficacy. Using 396
   elections in 34 established democracies between 1960 and 2015, it is
   found that lower clarity of responsibility is associated with lower
   voter turnout. This study highlights the importance of clarity of
   responsibility, as it enhances democratic accountability, not only by
   encouraging retrospective voting, but also by increasing political
   participation.},

Abstract = {Why do students enroll in political science courses? I conducted an
   experiment designed to test the appeal of three possible motivations:
   students might hope to develop valuable skills, look for a better grasp
   of current events, or expect a deeper understanding of how the world
   works and their place within it. The experiment involved visiting
   several sections of Introduction to American Government courses. In each
   section, I advertised a political science course offered in the
   following semester. However, I varied the way in which the course was
   described and subsequently tracked whether students enrolled in it. I
   find that highlighting opportunities to develop skills does not have a
   significant effect on enrollment. In contrast, emphasizing ``how the
   world works{''} is most effective at increasing enrollment. Qualitative
   evidence suggests that students are attracted to this type of course
   because it offers the opportunity for personal development and growth.},

Abstract = {The paper reviews existing literature on the role of the internet in
   addressing corruption by breaking it down into instrumental, important,
   and critical roles, across two types of political regimes - (semi)
   authoritarian and democracies. It analyzes the key resources and
   strategies utilized by governments and activists across these regimes,
   and looks into the common themes that emerge as a result of analyzing
   literature sources, i.e. the notion of crisis, lack of a single accepted
   definition of corruption across nations, factors found to positively
   correlate with reduced corruption, and the evolving nature of the
   internet. The paper finds that neither regime can be perfectly immune
   against mass-scale protests caused by dissatisfaction with worsening
   corruption. However, the regimes differ in the nature of protests, with
   semi-authoritarian regimes witnessing more violent and aggressive
   uprisings fueled by long-accumulated social disappointment with previous
   repressive regimes than across much of democracies.},

Journal = {AMERICAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE},

Abstract = {Popular psychological accounts argue that successful candidates address
   their appeals to citizens' ``hearts{''} rather than their ``heads.{''}
   Yet research on campaigns shows that candidates win elections by getting
   voters to think about particular issues-especially issues that create
   ambivalence in the minds of opposition supporters. This article helps to
   reconcile these ``heart-centered{''} and ``head-centered{''} accounts of
   preference formation during campaigns. An original experiment and ANES
   data analyses (1980-2004) show that a ``good gut feeling{''} toward a
   candidate helps citizens to overcome the paralyzing effect of
   ambivalence on attitude formation and turnout. And, since turnout is
   most tenuous among those with lower income, this is where the effect is
   most pronounced. Since Democratic candidates rely disproportionately on
   support from these lower-income voters, it is particularly important
   that they inspire positive affect among latent supporters.},

Abstract = {This article updates the Masuoka, Grofman, and Feld 2002 dataset that
   identified the then-3,719 faculty in political science PhD-granting
   departments in the United States. That dataset contained information
   about each faculty member, including date and PhD-granting department,
   lifetime citation counts, fields of interest, and school of employment.
   We similarly create a database with the 4,089 currently tenured or
   tenure-track faculty, along with emeritus faculty, at US PhD-granting
   departments ca. 2017-2018. Using Google Scholar Profiles, along with
   manual counts for those who do not have a profile, we sort the dataset
   by citation count, PhD cohort, field of interest, and gender. This
   article identifies the 100 currently most-cited scholars, the 25
   most-cited in each PhD cohort and subfield, the 40 most-cited women
   scholars, and the 25 most-cited emeriti. The full list of The Political
   Science 400 is available in an online appendix.},

Abstract = {We examine the distribution of economic productivity across subnational
   regions as a factor explaining the level and allocation of central
   government expenditure. As regional productivity becomes more dispersed,
   the preferences influencing national decision making should diverge,
   thus impeding agreement to expand the central state. However, if
   regional productivity becomes more right-skewed, an increasing number of
   less productive regions may be able to press for greater central
   outlays. Dispersion and skew of interregional inequality also shape the
   allocation of centralized spending. With growing economic dispersion
   across regions, decision makers are more likely to fund policy
   categories that aid citizens in all regions over those that are locally
   targeted. By contrast, with the distribution of regional productivity
   skewing farther to the right, central expenditure is likely to become
   more locally targeted. We find strong evidence for these propositions in
   error correction models using new measures of interregional inequality
   and government policy priorities for 24 OECD countries.},

Abstract = {This article argues that the UK is now facing an increasingly complex
   aid landscape and that this poses significant problems for parliamentary
   scrutiny. It explores one of the most important of the Official
   Development Assistance (ODA) innovations of recent years, the Global
   Challenges Research Fund (GCRF). The fund constitutes a significant
   investment of ODA money in research. The GCRF provides an important case
   study of changing aid spending. The article locates the GCRF in the
   wider context of UK aid over the past two decades and considers the
   wider parliamentary scrutiny and accountability issues to which
   aid-funded research gives rise.},

   dangerous platform at the same time. While users can stay secure and
   almost totally anonymously, they can also be exploited by other users,

   this article is to explore and discuss the tremendous benefits of
   anonymous networks while comparing them to the hazards and risks that
   are also found on those platforms. In order to open this dark portal and
   contribute to the discussion of cyber and politics, a comparative
   analysis of the dark and deep web to the commonly familiar surface web
   (World Wide Web) is made, aiming to find and describe both the
   advantages and disadvantages of the platforms.},

   the five permanent members have shown interest in adopting feminist
   foreign policy, a true enactment of which would be directly
   contradictory to the maintenance and development of nuclear weapons.
   Feminist foreign policy, then, offers an opportunity to approach

Abstract = {This paper aims to see whether there is a commercial and financial
   rivalry between Turkey and Germany in the Balkans by examining the
   export volumes, exported items, and foreign direct investments of these
   two countries to five Balkan countries. Our findings show that the
   commercial competition between Turkey and Germany in the Balkans is not
   serious. However, as the export growth of Turkey in the region continues
   to increase as it has done in the last two decades, Turkey has the
   potential to be a serious competitor to Germany in electrical goods and
   appliances, motor vehicles parts and components, power generating
   machinery and vehicles, metal articles, specific and general industrial
   machines, and plastics.},

Abstract = {In the wake of the Icelandic \#Metoo movement ways to eliminate sexual
   harassment, a manifestation of gender-based discrimination, have been
   called for. A fairly broad consensus seems to exist that policies,
   procedures and education is the key to success. However, research shows
   that gender equality projects often face resistance. This article is
   based on action research conducted at the Reykjavik Metropolitan Police,
   focusing on formal and informal resistance to analyze barriers and
   opportunities in equality work aimed at combating sexual harassment. The
   aim of the research was twofold; to map existing gender structures and
   to educate. In this article there is a special emphasis on the responses
   and experiences of the in-group forum designed to educate and raise
   awareness. The results reveal that there was a tendency to shift the
   responsibility elsewhere, that resources were limited and that there was
   a tendency to focus on `bad' individuals instead of seeing sexual
   harassment as part of the workplace culture. These are examples of both
   formal and informal resistance. In the in-group forum there was an
   opportunity to discuss these manifestations of resistance and to discuss
   different manifestations of sexual harassment. Other organizations can
   learn from the results when strategizing to combat sexual harassment.},

Abstract = {The relevance of the topic is due to the fact that at present the
   political system of Afghanistan requires fundamental changes: the
   political situation in the country continues to be complex and tense,
   and the tendency to aggravate the situation in the country is stable:
   terrorism, drug crime and corruption are common threats to both
   Afghanistan and the entire world community. Therefore, the search of the
   current perspective of the development of the political system of
   Afghanistan is the key factor to resolve this situation. Afghanistan
   continues to be a place of conflict between the interests of world and
   regional powers: the advantageous geopolitical and strategic location of
   Afghanistan makes it a key region in ensuring the stability of the
   military and political situation in the entire Central Asian region and
   gives it the opportunity to play an important role in economic,
   political and cultural interaction between the countries of the region.
   The purpose of the study is to consider the current perspective of the
   political system of Afghanistan. The article is devoted to the state of
   the modern political system of Afghanistan and the search for ways of
   its development and transformation. The current problems and ways of
   development of the political system of Afghanistan through the
   introduction of federalization and secularization are considered in
   detail. The author pays special attention to the fact that there are a
   lot of options for the development and transformation of the political
   system of Afghanistan, but on the way of their implementation in this
   country there are many problems.},

Abstract = {We attempt to integrate the literatures on authoritarian regime types
   and democratic forms of government. We propose a theoretical framework
   of five dimensions of executive appointment and dismissal that can be
   applied in both more democratic and more authoritarian regimes: the
   hereditary, military, ruling party, direct election, and confidence
   dimensions, respectively. Relying on the Varieties of Democracy data, we
   provide measures of these five dimensions for 3,937 individual heads of
   state and 2,874 heads of government from 192 countries across the globe
   from 1789 to the present. After presenting descriptive evidence of their
   prevalence, variation, and relationship to extant regime typologies, a
   set of exploratory probes gauge the extent to which the five dimensions
   can predict levels of repression, corruption, and executive survival,
   controlling for aspects of democracy. This leads to generation of a set
   of original hypotheses that we hope can serve as building blocks for
   explanatory theory. We conclude by discussing some limitations of these
   novel data.},

Abstract = {In Bernard Stiegler's Automatic Society Volume 1: The Future of Work,
   `the impossible' and `the improbable' appear as explicit parts of his
   political project. In his philosophy of technology, the impossible
   highlights the structural incompleteness that technics imparts to human
   existence. This article will trace how Stiegler draws on the work of
   Maurice Blanchot to produce this conjunction between technics and
   indetermination, and explore its political ramifications. This will show
   that rather than being a recent aspect of Stiegler's work, the political
   use of the impossible brings Blanchot's subterranean influence to the
   fore. After briefly reconstructing Blanchot's understanding of language,
   impersonality, and writing, it will be shown that Stiegler shifts
   Blanchot's emphasis from the impossible to technical practices of the
   improbable. Stiegler follows an anthropological line where the
   experience of the impossible becomes a more general understanding of the
   experience of improbability through technical structures. Stiegler's
   reading of Blanchot is central in his break with the place of the
   impossible in the politics of resistance advocated by
   post-structuralism, allowing him to support a politics of invention
   which makes space for the improbable within a large-scale politics of
   technicity, rather than privileging indeterminacy itself.},

Abstract = {How does the intensity of cooperating in lobbying coalitions affect the
   choice of lobbying strategies of interest groups? This question is
   analysed in this paper using data from 1117 Swiss and German interest
   organisations. We find, on the one hand, that the intensity of coalition
   building affects both directly targeting politicians (insider lobbying)
   but also indirect efforts of exerting influence via the media and
   citizens (outsider lobbying). In other words, the more intensely lobby
   groups cooperate, the more they make use of both insider and outsider
   lobbying tactics. However, we also find that the increase in these two
   types of lobbying efforts is not equal when cooperation intensifies. Due
   to the specific advantages of pooling expertise, insider lobbying
   benefits disproportionately when groups work more closely together.},

Abstract = {This article compares the role of brokers in mediating access to public
   services in India and Indonesia. Brokered state-citizen interaction is
   generally considered to be detrimental to democratic accountability and
   governance. Yet recent studies are emphasizing that brokers can also be
   empowering. Reconciling these contrasting assessments, I argue in this
   paper that the character of brokerage networks shapes the capacity of
   citizens to hold their politicians and bureaucrats to account. Employing
   over two years of ethnographic fieldwork in both India and Indonesia, I
   develop a comparative framework that compares brokerage networks in
   terms of their degree of fragmentation, institutionalization and
   levelling. In Indonesia the versatile and more state-centered nature of
   brokers networks plays into the hands of incumbents, while the
   fragmented and more levelled nature of India's brokerage networks
   strengthens democratic accountability. I use this comparison to advance
   the argument that the evolution of brokerage networks constitutes an
   important, yet little-noticed dimension of democratization processes.
   When citizens gain access to public services through networks that are
   fragmented, institutionalized and less marked by social hierarchies,
   politicians and bureaucrats face stronger pressures to perform.},

Abstract = {This study investigates whether protest movements consisting of students
   and educated protesters are more likely to (a) use nonviolent rather
   than violent resistance and (b) successfully reach their goals. Extant
   literature suggests that education is negatively linked to violent
   conflict, and the commonly assumed mechanism is that educated groups are
   less likely to resort to violence. Moreover, many argue that education
   is a force for regime change and democratization, by inducing successful
   protest movements. This article is the first to systematically test
   implications of these mechanisms at the protest level. The empirical
   analysis builds on original data on the educational background of
   participants in all protest campaigns aiming for regime change from 1900
   to 2006 identified in the Nonviolent and Violent Campaigns and Outcomes
   Dataset 1.0. I find robust evidence that protest movements with a high
   degree of involvement by students and graduates are more likely to turn
   nonviolent. Moreover, there is some (although weaker) evidence that
   these movements are more likely to achieve their goals, but only due to
   their nonviolent dispositions. This adds to the literature explaining
   why some movements resort to nonviolence (and succeed), by establishing
   that the identity and socioeconomic background of protesters matter.},

   years later, the Union of Textile Home Workers and Related Jobs emerged

Abstract = {Comparative scholars of legislative politics continue to face the
   challenge of measuring a key theoretical concept: conflict at the level
   of legislative bills. We address this challenge with a multilingual
   sentiment-based approach and show that such a measure can effectively
   capture different types of parliamentary conflict. We also demonstrate
   that an automated translation of the dictionary yields valid results and
   therefore greatly facilitates comparative work on legislatures. Our
   applications show that a sentiment approach recovers
   government-opposition dynamics in various settings. The use of a simple,
   translatable sentiment dictionary opens up the possibility of studying
   legislative conflict in bill debates across languages and countries.},

Abstract = {This article studies the actual situation of urban passenger transport
   in passenger cars taking into account the fact that within it the
   administrative regulation and the eruption of digital platforms and
   their apps converge in the general frame of collaborative economy. We
   defend the necessity of a comprehensive reform of taxis and VTC
   (chauffeur-driven tourist vehicle) activities. This reform should take
   into consideration the needs of passenger transport in passenger cars in
   cities and should allow the compatibility and coexistence of both modes
   of transport. Recent normative changes do not seem to be the most
   appropriate to reach this; on the contrary, they seem to lead to future
   judicial conflicts.},

Title = {On far right parties, master frames and trans-national diffusion:
   understanding far right party development in Western Europe},
Journal = {COMPARATIVE EUROPEAN POLITICS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {17},
Number = {1},
Pages = {132-154},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {A common assumption throughout the far right party (FRP) literature is
   that of developmental independence between FRPs, meaning explanatory
   accounts typically (i) look at FRPs as structurally independent
   political agents and (ii) examine their development as context-unique
   processes, in the absence of cross-sectional implications. Three initial
   observations can refute the plausibility and larger validity of such a
   claim. First, the dissemination of a relatively stable and comparable
   master frame between FRPs increases their similarities. Second, it is
   possible to distinguish the FN as the primary source (or innovator) of
   those similarities. Third, the adoption rate of the master frame
   illustrates spatial and temporal heterogeneity. Together, these
   observations support this study's claim that we should think of FRP
   development in terms of interdependence. More specifically, this study
   theorises and illustrates developmental interdependence between FRPs
   using trans-national diffusion dynamics. Drawing from unique interview
   evidence and using master frame adoption as the primary process under
   analysis, this study also describes learning and emulation as the core
   mechanisms that underlie trans-national diffusion between FRPs. In the
   end, this theorisation is not intended to replace existing, more
   variable-oriented and structural explanations of FRP development, but
   rather to complement them and add to what we already know about FRPs.},

Abstract = {The process of coalition formation following the 2017 Bundestag election
   was the most difficult in German post-war history. For the first time,
   Germany saw negotiations fail, a minority government being discussed as
   a real possibility, and the federal president involved as formateur in
   coalition politics. The aim of this contribution is to explain why
   government formation was so intricate after the 2017 election. To this
   end, we trace patterns of party politics and the development of the
   German party system since 2013. We then study general patterns of
   government formation at the regional and national levels since the 1990s
   and evaluate whether these have changed with the advent of the
   right-wing populist party, Alternative for Germany. Our analysis of the
   2017-2018 government formation is based on a novel expert survey of the
   policy profiles of German parties on various issue dimensions, conducted
   in 2017. The results show that the continuation of the incumbent
   coalition government of Christian and Social Democrats was the most
   likely outcome, and that the Social Democrats were indeed able to
   enforce a surpassing share of their policy positions in the final
   negotiation rounds.},

Abstract = {This research seeks to explore the extent of women representation on
   county governing boards and tests several hypotheses to explain
   variation in representation. This study evaluates a random sample of 394
   of the more than 3000 counties in the United States. Half of the
   counties did not have any women serving on their county governing
   boards. A two-stage analysis using first a logit model sought to explain
   when counties have women commissioners and then a truncated regression
   analysis evaluated the percentage of women serving on county boards.
   Size of governing boards, size of government, religious adherence, and
   two election formats had significant effects in explaining when a county
   had women commissioners. Three variables (religious adherence, level of
   support for President Obama, and size of governing boards) were
   significant in explaining the percentage of women serving on county
   governing boards with size of the boards operating opposite of the
   hypothesized direction.},

Abstract = {The Northern Irish identity is said to be a common ingroup identity due
   to its inclusivity and relationship to more positive attitudes towards
   religious outgroups. However, research looking at this identity's
   political significance has produced inconsistent results. The present
   research uses a new, large-scale dataset to test hypotheses relating to
   moderation in political attitudes. An original measure of attitudes
   towards outgroups leaders is also investigated. The results indicate
   that Northern Irish identifiers are more inclined to prefer moderate
   political parties and are more satisfied with the leader of parties
   associated with the outgroup. The differences in attitudes are
   significant, but small. Less popular binary identity combinations of
   Irish-Northern Irish and British-Northern Irish show some evidence of
   attitudes falling midway between those of Northern Irish identifiers and
   those with the traditional subgroup identity. The extremely small
   numbers of these respondents suggest that the Northern Irish identity
   indicates a rejection of Irish and British identities rather than a
   synthesis of them. These findings support the claim that the Northern
   Irish identity can be a common ingroup. This paper fills a gap in the
   literature in that it utilises the common ingroup identity model as a
   way of predicting voting behaviour.},

Abstract = {Studies on mediatization have pointed to the ``collateralism{''} of
   media and politics, a model that emphasizes reciprocal media-politics
   interactions. This article discusses how various political parties, and
   in particular right-wing populist parties in the post-socialist
   Slovenian context, use communication tools on the Internet; to what
   extent they enable participatory communication; and how they open up to
   forms of ``media populism.{''} In what ways do right-wing populist
   parties make use of social media as a megaphone for their positions, to
   promote their charismatic leaders, to disseminate their ``othering{''}
   ideologies, and to spread the ``politics of fear{''}? The analysis
   enables us to detect media populism across the political spectrum, and
   in particular to theorize contemporary features of right-wing media
   populism.},

Abstract = {A large body of scholarship places considerable weight on the role that
   national constitutions play in promoting order and development. To what
   degree are these institutions fixed ``rules of the game{''} or fluid
   outcomes, responsive to changes in underlying primitives? In this paper,
   we develop a dynamic measure of constitutional similarity to show that
   the typical national constitution is hardly fixed. We find, in contrast,
   evidence of a large degree of fluidity and change: over one-third of all
   variation in constitution writing is driven by within-country changes.
   We then investigate broad trends in constitution writing and find that
   across the twentieth century there has been a convergence in
   constitutional forms of government. Finally, we provide evidence that
   this trend has been toward documents that contain diffuse centers of
   power and numerous well-defined, positive, rights.},

Abstract = {The concept of security dilemma has been widely applied to ethnic
   conflicts in former Yugoslavia and the post-Soviet space. This paper
   argues that for both methodological clarity and policy formation, we
   should distinguish between ethnic conflicts caused by security dilemma
   and ones triggered by ethnic identity. It is argued that identity plays
   a different role in security dilemmas, but a major one in identity-based
   ethnic conflicts. Although ethnic identity may be at stake in the
   operation and dynamics of security dilemma, it is not the causal
   variable in the outbreak of ethnic conflict. Identity-based conflicts
   may reproduce many of the features of the security dilemma but have
   other causal factors. Distinguishing between the differing role of
   identity in security dilemma and identity based-ethnic conflicts may
   further our understanding of why certain conflicts have become so
   intractable, while others are relatively easier to resolve. For testing
   the hypothesis, empirical evidence is presented from two conflicts in
   the post-Soviet space with variations in the causal variable.},

Abstract = {Based on the theoretical and methodological foundations of state
   capacity proposed and substantiated in the previous article of this
   journal (No. 2-2019) and the corresponding set of indicators for
   studying the multidimensional nature of this concept (level of military
   expenditures and aggregated indicator of control over violence,
   government and tax revenues, as well as the institutional quality and
   the level of the legal economy), in this article the authors focus on
   empirical perspectives of measuring state capacity. They rely on the use
   of multidimensional statistical methods (hierarchical clustering) and
   critically analyze the shortcomings of other approaches (dimensionality
   reduction, aggregation, rating) in relation to the array of collected
   data. The researchers' contribution to the scientific discussion is one
   of the first attempts at alternative empirical testing of the state
   capacity index and the selection of eight stable structures typical for
   certain groups of countries, obtained as a result of the repeated
   application of the clustering procedure with the corresponding
   parameters (clusters ``Successful development{''}, ``Second echelon{''},
   ``Individual trajectories{''}, ``The oil and gas needle{''},
   ``Outsiders{''}, ``On the verge of failure{''}, ``Rising Asian
   giants{''} and ``Variations of the post -Soviet trajectories{''}). In
   conclusion, the authors emphasize that, despite the conventionality of
   the resulting clusters (due to the specificity of the method used, which
   allows the scales of such structures to be ``tuned{''}), in general,
   they reveal typologically similar variants of state development, taking
   into account the specificity of historical circumstances, internal and
   external conditions, and strategic decisions made by national elites.},

   as a consequence of the end of the Cold War has given way to a
   multiplication of conflicts that are not understandable through the

   tradition, from Hobbes to Schmitt, is actually based on centrality of
   political unity. Even modern populisms preserve this tension for the
   production of political unity as their distinctive features. Instead,
   the contemporary antagonisms become instead understandable through the
   reference to a relational conception of power like that of Foucault, not
   by chance elaborated close to the emergence of new subjects and new
   types of social conflict occurred in `68. Deleuze's references to a
   theory of creative and expressive institutions can help us to read the
   specific social productivity of these new forms of conflict.},

Abstract = {China entered the modern epoch in the nineteenth century with a
   production system incapable of achieving its modernization. Only the
   Communist Revolution made it possible to emancipate the country from its
   previous structures. Since then the Chinese economy has followed new
   trajectories in the area of actual practice and in the ideological and
   theoretical fields. The first part of the book describes China's
   present-day trajectories- demographic, agricultural, industrial and
   commercial. These trajectories reflect the transformation of the
   country's structural heritage, along with the rise of the forms that
   succeeded it and opened the way for China's subsequent achievements. The
   second part deals principally with the new theoretical trajectories that
   have appeared in China. The focus is on the evolution undergone by the

Abstract = {Threat perceptions and prejudice underlie a large number of intergroup
   conflicts. In this article we explore prejudicial attitudes in Turkey
   regarding ethnic Kurdish and devout Muslim religious identities as
   opposed to Turkish and less observant, secular identities. Utilizing a
   population-based survey experiment, we use vignettes about a
   hypothetical family as a neighbour, with randomized ethnicity and
   religiosity-related cues. We find evidence for prejudice against Kurdish
   ethnicity, especially among older, lowly-educated and economically
   dissatisfied individuals. The level of prejudice against Kurds does not
   seem to be related to the relative size of the Kurdish population in the
   local population. We do not observe prejudice against devout Muslim or
   less observant, secular identities. Our findings indicate that prejudice
   against Kurds in Turkey does not have a sui generis nature. The lack of
   prejudice across the religiosity dimension suggests that major
   socio-political cleavages do not necessarily affect intergroup
   attitudes.},

   achieved and profound about the situation of childhood in the Colombian

Abstract = {The essay is aimed at highlighting the presence of Hobbes, in sometimes
   explicit, sometimes implicit terms, within the Marxian path. Reference
   will be made to the early Marxian texts, in which the reference to the
   bellum omnium contra omnes frequently refers to the representation of
   bourgeois society with its conflict between individuals and classes. But
   the analysis will focus mainly on the first book of Capital, with the
   deconstruction of the person as a mask of certain class interests, in
   the double face, economic and legal, of the question. It will be shown
   how the Marxian position is configured not sic et simpliciter in the
   name of an unbridgeable distance compared to Hobbes, but as an immanent
   critique that, with an anti-theological charge, assumes the radical
   demystification of any idealized anthropology to delineate an

Abstract = {In recent years, revelations regarding reports of torture by the U.S.
   Central Intelligence Agency and the quiet growth of the National
   Security Agency's pervasive cyber-surveillance system have brought into
   doubt the level of trust afforded to the intelligence community. The
   question of its trustworthiness requires determining how much secrecy it
   should enjoy and what mechanisms should be employed to detect and
   prevent future abuse. My argument is not a call for complete
   transparency, however, as secret intelligence does play an important and
   ethical role in society. Rather, I argue that existing systems built on
   a prioritization of democratic assumptions are fundamentally
   ill-equipped for dealing with the particular challenge of intelligence
   secrecy. As the necessary circle of secrecy is extended, political
   actors are insulated from the very public gaze that ensures they are
   working in line with the political community's best interests.
   Therefore, a new framework needs to be developed, one that this article
   argues should be based on the just war tradition, where the principles
   of just cause, legitimate authority, last resort, proportionality, and
   discrimination are able to balance the secrecy that the intelligence
   community needs in order to detect and prevent threats with the harm
   that too much or incorrect secrecy can cause to people.},

Abstract = {Universal basic income (UBI) is a radical policy proposal of a monthly
   cash grant given to all members of a community without means test,
   regardless of personal desert, with no strings attached, and, under most
   proposals, at a sufficiently high level to enable a life free from
   economic insecurity. Once a utopian proposal, the policy is now widely
   discussed and piloted throughout the world. Among the various objections
   to the proposal, one concerns its moral adequacy: Isn't it fundamentally
   unjust to give cash to all indiscriminately rather than to those who
   need it and deserve it? This article reviews the variety of strategies
   deployed by political theorists to posit that the proposal is in fact
   justified, or even required, by social justice. The review focuses
   mainly on the contemporary normative debate on UBI-roughly dating back
   to Philippe Van Parijs's influential work in the 1990s- and is centered
   on the ideals of freedom and equality.},

Abstract = {In addition to repression and co-optation, authoritarian regimes also
   rely on redistributive-economic and legitimatory-ideological strategies
   to ensure their survival. In this article, we first discuss conceptually
   different possibilities of legitimation through policy-making that
   (also) come into question in autocracies. We illustrate this
   conceptualization by presenting examples of autocratic legitimation
   strategies in distributive, redistributive and regulatory policy fields.
   We show that legitimation through policy-making is a double-edged sword,
   as it harbors legitimation potentials as well as risks. The comparison
   of innovation, environmental and family policies shows that distributive
   policies are more likely to have a legitimizing effect, while regulatory
   and redistributive policies are at best ambivalent due to their
   conflictive character.},

   2012 LABOUR MARKET REFORM},
Series = {Contributions to Political Science},
Year = {2019},
Pages = {207-285},
Abstract = {A key research interest of this book is to investigate the role played
   by the conflict over the 2012 reform of the Italian labour market in the
   overall balance of forces of Italy's political economy (see Sects. 1.2
   and 3.2). To this end, this second step of the actor-process analysis is
   intended to continue the empirical study initiated in Chap. 8 by
   broadening its scope, i.e. by shifting the focus of attention from the
   constellation of political projects emerged in the debate over the 2012
   labour market reform to the constellation of more overarching hegemony
   projects in which these conflict-related strategies should be located.
   Following the pattern developed in Chap. 8, also the present chapter is
   structured into three main blocks concerned respectively with: first,
   the reconstruction of the government's strategy of crisis management
   (Sect. 9.1); second, the evaluation of this strategy through the
   progressive introduction of all other positions observed in the corpus
   (Sect. 9.2); and, third, the systematic analysis of this variety of
   positions through their aggregation into a series of hegemony projects
   (Sect. 9.3). As usual, it follows a final brief overview of the main
   findings (Sect. 9.4).},

Abstract = {When new graduates begin employment in industries such as government,
   consultancies, or the nongovernmental sector they are expected to have
   the skills needed to write politically-informed reports accurately.
   Teaching how to write briefing notes provides students with an important
   skill, but also provides an effective instrument for examining
   integrated comprehension of course content. In this article, we explain
   why briefing notes are a useful pedagogical device, some guidelines on
   when to use them and how to structure the assignments, and an indication
   of where we have found them to be successful instruments for enhancing
   student learning. We suggest briefing notes are a flexible assessment
   technique that aligns well with traditional teaching approaches as well
   as newer techniques such as active and problem-based learning.},

Abstract = {This paper tackles the existing problems in the region y of Catalonia
   through the empirical analysis of a specific electorate: the one that
   considers that the best relationship between the Spanish state and
   Catalonia is the federal type. This electorate is important because of
   the malleability of its behaviour by opting in favour of secession or,
   on the contrary, wishing to remain within the State depending on what it
   is offered. Thus, what is evident in this analysis is the
   non-homogenisation of the independence bloc, with part of it having an
   identityally versatile electorate that accepts or rejects independence
   according to the mode of relationship between Catalonia and the State.},

Title = {The career of ``security{''} in the socialist milieu (1993-2012).
   Sociology of a partisan conversion},
Journal = {POLITIX},

Volume = {32},

Abstract = {This article analyzes socialists' conversion to ``security{''} since the
   mid-1990s, which has long remained a typical issue of the right and the
   far right-wings. Using the concept of career applied to political ideas,
   the study has two main aims. First, by exploring the discursive,
   textual, and organizational forms of this conversion's objectification,
   it analyzes the conditions that make this poaching in opposing lands
   possible. Second, by following a process-based approach of socialist
   appropriations of ``security,{''} it measures their very erratic aspect.
   Shaped by contradictory logics, party conversion is thus far from
   existing in the form of a linear sequence (doctrinal appropriation,
   programmatic elaboration, electoral mobilization, and jurisdictional
   implementation). The institutionalization of ``security{''} depends on
   whether the value of this issue can or cannot be monetized on
   differentiated political markets. The study draws upon public and
   private archives, a corpus of articles, and a number of field interviews
   with the actors most directly involved in this conversion's dynamic.},

Title = {Encouraging bystander intervention in street harassment situations. A
   sociological study of the politicization of gender relations in the
   public space},
Journal = {POLITIX},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {32},
Number = {125},
Pages = {87-108},
Abstract = {In recent awareness campaigns against street harassment, criticism of
   bystanders, who are described as passive, has played a central role. We
   are often presented with the image of an apathetic passer-by who is
   indifferent to the attack, and the non-intervention of bystanders is
   frequently exposed as a form of selfishness, or as a fear that they will
   then become a victim of violence. In France, street harassment as a
   public problem has been defined principally from the personal experience
   of the victim and as a form of violence perpetrated against women,
   leading actors to explain the non-intervention of bystanders as an
   indifference to sexism. By focusing on the invasive and violent manner
   in which these behaviors are experienced by victims, the difficulties
   bystanders experience in identifying a situation as street harassment
   are overlooked. In this article, I analyze interventions in schools
   organized by associations seeking to raise awareness about street
   harassment among high school pupils and to encourage them to intervene
   if they are a bystander to such a situation. While the speakers
   initially explain non-intervention as an indifference to sexism and a
   resistance against defending the autonomy of women and LGBTQI+ people,
   the reactions of the pupils show that their hesitations are often an
   expression of their fear that their intervention will be perceived as an
   illegitimate intrusion into the other's personal space. This article
   thus questions the reduction of all resistance to progressive and
   anti-sexist politics to the expression of conservative and misogynistic
   beliefs, showing that they can be the result of tensions internal to the
   politics of protecting individuals' autonomy. The reflexivity of the
   activists and the way in which they adapt their approach in reaction to
   the pupils' resistance show the difficulties but also the possibilities
   of promoting solidarity in a society that values individual liberties.},

Journal = {POLITICS AND GOVERNANCE},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {7},
Number = {3},
Pages = {19-29},
Abstract = {This article focuses on the European single market, which has been one
   of the central issues in terms of the impact of Britain's withdrawal
   from the EU. As the aim of the single market project is to open the
   internal borders of the EU to the free movement of goods, services,
   capital, and labor to create cross-jurisdictional markets, the economic
   and political effects of Brexit will be widespread, if not yet fully
   understood, outside the British polity. The article looks at the current
   state of the single market, then highlights the impact of British
   withdrawal on economic governance, focusing on different market
   freedoms, given the degree of trade interdependence and integrated
   supply chains that have evolved in response to changes in goods and
   services. One of the lessons from Brexit negotiations is the importance
   of distinguishing between different single market(s) when assessing the
   impact of British `exit' on member states. The concluding section
   focuses on the political safeguards of market integration to manage the
   relationship between the UK and EU, to illustrate how judicial, market,
   and institutional safeguards create options and constraints in
   mitigating the effects of `exit'.},

Abstract = {This article discusses the different efforts in political theory to
   utilize the Marxist concept of ideology for an analysis of racism. This
   is accomplished by contrasting the most influential elaborations of Karl
   Marx's notion of ideology: the ideology-theory following Louis Althusser
   and the ideology-critique following the Frankfurt School. At first, the
   different concepts of ideology in the works of Karl Marx are addressed,
   to show afterwards how these concepts are adopted and further developed
   in ideology-theoretical and ideology-critical theories of racism.
   Furthermore, it will be shown, by a contraposition of both theoretical
   schools, on which epistemological and socio-theoretical premises both of
   them are built upon and how it is still possible to combine them,
   despite their differences in detail.},

Journal = {QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {14},
Number = {1},
Pages = {1-39},
Abstract = {Ethnic politics scholars are increasingly convinced that (a) the
   political salience of ethnicity and (b) the correlation between
   ethno-linguistic fractionalization (ELF) and poor development are driven
   by the dense social networks shared by co-ethnics. By this argument,
   social networks allow ethnic parties to leverage inbuilt networks to
   share information and support collective action, while ethnically
   fragmented communities struggle to hold politicians accountable. This
   paper provides the first comprehensive empirical test of the assumption
   underlying this argument. Using seven months of telecommunications data
   from 9 million mobile subscribers in Zambia - which includes records of
   almost 2 billion calls and SMS messages - to measure social networks
   across an entire country, this paper finds that electoral constituencies
   with high ELF also have more fragmented social networks, especially in
   rural areas. It also finds other potential cleavages that have not
   achieved political salience (namely, religious identity and employment
   sector) are not correlated with network fragmentation, consistent with
   the idea that ethnicity achieves salience because it offers an
   organizational advantage not offered by other cleavages. Finally, it
   also finds that both voter knowledge and public goods are negatively
   correlated with network fragmentation, consistent with the network-proxy
   hypothesis.},

Title = {FACTORS AND JUSTIFICATION OF RECONSTRUCTING MEANING OF POLITICAL TEXTS
   UNDER CONDITIONS OF COGNITIVE AND INTERPRETATIVE UNCERTAINTY},
Journal = {POLIS-POLITICHESKIYE ISSLEDOVANIYA},
Year = {2019},
Number = {4},
Pages = {40-56},
Abstract = {In this article, political text is treated as a construct for expressing
   one's viewpoint on the events of political landscape; creating a certain
   effect on different groups of society with an aim to encourage
   collective will and actions; as well as representing a collective
   interest. Types of structural and situational factors (including
   structural balance of social and political groups, cultural and symbolic
   space, participants of a communication, and their resources recognized
   by a society) and the way they influence the recipient's interpretation
   of a text's message are shown. Stuart Hall's Model of Communication,
   possible ways of coding and decoding both text content and ideological
   principles of an author and audience are described and discussed. It is
   noted that, due to the fundamental features of social communication,
   both authors and recipients find themselves in a situation of constant
   cognitive and interpretative uncertainty. Whereas situational factors do
   not distort the meaning but contribute to its construction and further
   interpretation, the structure of participants, their resources, and the
   context of communication is accomplished. This article explores the
   process of text construction and its meaning's further reconstruction as
   an active process, in which an agreement is reached between
   communicative participants on the meaning of their own piece of text and
   its cultural, social, structural, pragmatic and political contexts,
   produced by the subjects under the condition of uncertainty. The model
   reflects the process and factors of text production and perception of
   its meaning. It is revealed that the interpretation of the meaning of
   political texts, and the position of participants of communication,
   depends primarily on claims that they possess social and political
   capital as resources that ensure the encouragement of collective will
   and representation of interests. The role of dispositives (as a context
   of communication) that allows the regulation of cognitive uncertainty
   and which define appropriate ways of qualification is shown. The article
   also describes the model of the process of text construction and meaning
   reconstruction with cultural, social, structural, pragmatic and
   political context being taken into account as well as the role of
   political texts in communicative strategies of political actors.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF GENOCIDE RESEARCH},

Volume = {21},
Number = {3, SI},
Pages = {359-377},
Abstract = {This work reconstructs episodes from the microcosm of Florentine Jews
   during the period from Fascism to the Holocaust. It analyses the
   decisions and fate of Elio Salmon and his family. While Salmon's
   sister-in-law and her husband, Maria and Gualtiero Cividalli, chose
   exile for themselves and their family and emigrated to Palestine, Elio
   and his family remained in Florence. They passed the years of Nazi
   occupation and the RSI in hiding, through dramatic events which led to
   their survival thanks to his resourcefulness and to the community of
   friends and acquaintances who offered aid. It was a microcosm in which
   social networks and friendships intertwined, transcending the duality of
   fascism and resistance and the distinction between Jewish and gentile.
   This analysis contributes to a deconstruction of the idea of Italian
   society's innate goodness or morality during the Holocaust, and
   highlights the social and political relationships that led to Jews'
   survival, in the context of a social fabric in which the ``victims of
   the war{''} cultivated networks and forms of reciprocal solidarity.},

Abstract = {The present work addresses an innovative legal analysis on the treatment
   and protection of personal data about asylum and subsidiary protection
   seekers in the comprehensive reform of the Common European Asylum System
   (CEAS). This reform, among other countless aspects, has increased the
   effective EU Information Management as the key to protect external
   borders, improve the management of migration flows and contribute to the
   enhancement of internal security. The applicable data protection
   legislation is significantly fragmented, complex and diffuse since,
   despite the GDPR excludes from its scope asylum-related activities,
   border control, and immigration is directly defined in the proposed
   Dublin IV, Procedures and Eurodac regulations. At the same time, the
   persistent linkages to the security of Member States can reflect the
   potential application of the Data Protection Directive on Police
   Matters. In addition, the interoperability of different information
   systems, the deployment of specific bodies (such as Frontex or EASO) as
   well as law enforcement authorities are bound directly by their own
   regulations. Consequently, this fragmented and particularly complex
   legal framework constitutes the subject of the study.},

Title = {It Depends...Different Direct Democratic Instruments and Equality in
   Europe from 1990 to 2015},
Journal = {POLITICS AND GOVERNANCE},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {7},
Number = {2},
Pages = {365-379},
Abstract = {Despite the popularity of direct democracy in recent decades, research
   on the actual output effects of popular decision-making is rare. This is
   especially true with regard to equality, where there are at least three
   major research gaps: 1) a lack of cross-national analyses; 2)
   insufficient investigation of the differential effects of different
   direct democratic instruments on equality; and 3) a failure to
   distinguish between different aspects of equality, i.e., socioeconomic,
   legal and political equality. This article takes a first step to tackle
   these shortcomings by looking at all national referenda in European
   democracies between 1990 and 2015, differentiating between mandatory,
   bottom-up and top-down referenda. We find that a large majority of
   successful direct democratic bills-regardless of which instrument is
   employed-are not related to equality issues. Of the remaining ones,
   there are generally more successful pro-equality bills than
   contra-equality ones, but the differences are rather marginal. Mandatory
   referenda tend to produce pro-equality outputs, but no clear patterns
   emerge for bottom-up and top-down referenda. Our results offer
   interesting, preliminary insights to the current debate on direct
   democracy, pointing to the conclusion that popular decision-making via
   any type of direct democratic instrument is neither curse nor blessing
   with regard to equality. Instead, it is necessary to look at other
   factors such as context conditions or possible indirect effects in order
   to get a clearer picture of the impacts of direct democracy on equality.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF ELECTIONS PUBLIC OPINION AND PARTIES},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {29},
Number = {2},
Pages = {162-178},
Abstract = {Pollsters have been recently accused of delivering poor electoral
   predictions. We argue that one of the reasons for their failures lies in
   the difficulty of including an updated deep understanding of electoral
   behaviour. Even if pollsters' predictions are not forecasts produced by
   models, the set of choices needed to produce their estimates is not
   indifferent to a theoretical comprehension of electoral dynamics. We
   exemplify this lack of theory by using an original dataset consisting of
   1057 party{*}poll observations in the case of the last European
   election. Pollsters failed to account for what we know about
   second-order elections, thus overestimating government and big parties,
   which normally obtain poor results in European elections, and
   underestimating new and Eurosceptic ones, which usually perform well.},

Title = {Bringing Gender In? EU Foreign and Security Policy after Brexit},
Journal = {POLITICS AND GOVERNANCE},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {7},
Number = {3},
Pages = {62-71},
Abstract = {In this article, we identify Brexit as a critical process, wherein the
   EU has had the opportunity to reflect on and reinforce its identity, as
   a promoter of gender issues within the security domain. It draws on this
   identity from a foundational myth of the EU as gender equality polity,
   resulting in the creation of a socio-legal order and sustained discourse
   on gender inclusivity in all policy areas. Existing scholarship has
   drawn attention to the EU's particular success in gender equality
   promotion in the areas of social inclusion at member state level,
   including in the UK. But, is the EU's reach comprehensive beyond this
   policy sphere? We examine the ways in which gender is manifested in the
   area of foreign policy, an area where the UK has consistently shown some
   leadership on the integration of gender perspectives in its foreign
   policy through its international development programmes and the
   implementation of the Women, Peace and Security agenda. It is therefore
   timely to consider what impact Brexit has on EU policies, practices and

Abstract = {This article presents the contributions of Urban Agriculture
   practitioners in establishing the local food movement and the
   foundations of an active food democracy in London. It argues that food
   democracy is emerging from a set of contestations within institutional
   channels, but also through the historical struggle of formulating the
   dominating political discourses, both of which are co-constituted
   through specific social and political practices. Webster and
   Engberg-Pedersen's political space framework (2002) breaks up this
   article in order to describe: 1) How specific institutional channels
   form different strategies of collaboration and contestation; 2) how
   these are reflected in political discourses evolution; and 3) what
   dilemmas and opportunities this evolution in practice entails in
   relation to responsibilisation and its influence on the possibility of
   establishing true active food democracy in London.},

Abstract = {Should hate speech be banned? This article contends that the debate on
   this question must be disaggregated into discrete analytical stages,
   lest its participants continue to talk past one another. The first
   concerns the scope of the moral right to freedom of expression, and
   whether hate speech falls within the right's protective ambit. If it
   does, hate speech bans are necessarily unjust. If not, we turn to the
   second stage, which assesses whether speakers have moral duties to
   refrain from hate speech. The article canvasses several possible duties
   from which such a duty could be derived, including duties not to
   threaten, harass, offend, defame, or incite. If there is a duty to
   refrain from hate speech, it is yet a further question whether the duty
   should actually be enforced. This third stage depends on pragmatic
   concerns involving epistemic fallibility, the abuse of state power, and
   the benefits of counter-speech over coercion.},

Abstract = {Shared social disadvantage relative to Whites is assumed to motivate
   inter-minority political behavior but we lack causal evidence. Using a
   survey experiment of 1,200 African Americans, we prompt respondents to
   consider group social position when evaluating political commonality
   with Latinos. The experiment describes racial disparities in a
   randomized domain (education or housing), varies the description of
   inequality (either Black versus White, Latino versus White, or Black and
   Latino versus White), and offers half of the respondents a political cue
   to test whether shared social disadvantage causes Blacks' perceptions of
   political commonality with Latinos. We find little evidence of a causal
   relationship. We conclude that cross-racial minority political
   coalitions may be more difficult to activate than previously thought.},

Title = {`Perceived social citizenship': a comparative study between two

Journal = {CITIZENSHIP STUDIES},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {23},
Number = {2},
Pages = {172-188},
Abstract = {In China, there are immense barriers to inclusive social citizenship
   because of the failure to overcome the institutional fragmentation of
   social security across the hukou division. The hukou system continues to
   be important in determining how social citizenship is granted in China;
   not only does it facilitate dual social citizenship, it imposes
   perceptions of deservingness that bolster these divisions. The aim of
   this paper is to build a social-citizenship-based framework, drawing
   upon the strengths of the capability approach, which is applicable to
   the complexity of the rural-urban divide in China. Referring to several
   data sources, the paper examines social citizenship as a subjective
   phenomenon. The paper highlights the social exclusion mechanisms
   embedded in the hukou system that might have an effect on social
   citizenship as a state of self-awareness.},

Abstract = {In this chapter, the recent changes in governance are -considered from
   rights- and legitimacy-based perspectives. While not aiming at an
   exhaustive treatment of the matter, this chapter teases out some
   emergent issues that merit further consideration. Although, if a
   post-humanist framework is accepted, it is no longer reasonable to rely
   on a human rights-based assessment, it is important to show how some
   otherwise taken-for-granted assumptions are rendered questionable today.
   For that reason, some provisions from the Universal Declaration of Human
   Rights (UDHR) and the International Covenant on Civil and Political
   Rights (ICCPR) are compared against the current trends in algorithmic
   governance. Meanwhile, a consideration of legitimacy, particularly in
   its political sense, helps uncover the emergent fault lines within the
   three-way interplay between the electorates, the public authorities, and
   code.},

Title = {NEITHER A FRIEND. NOT A FOE: DONALD TRUMP IN THE RUSSIAN MEDIA},
Journal = {POLIS-POLITICHESKIYE ISSLEDOVANIYA},
Year = {2019},
Number = {1},
Pages = {90-104},
Abstract = {This article provides the first systematic analysis of the Russian media
   coverage of Trump's activities during the electoral campaign and within
   first seven months of his presidential term. We conduct a quantitative
   analysis of the publications about Donald Trump in 500 Russian magazines
   and 250 largest federal newspapers. The database ``Medialogy{''} served
   as a source of data for sentiment analysis of news reports about the
   American president. On its basis, the conclusion is drawn that the image
   of Trump was not unambiguously positive, as some foreign studies have
   claimed. Based on the theory of the network agenda setting we analyzed
   the context in which Donald Trump was mentioned one month before the
   election, a month after the elections and in June 2017, just before his
   meeting with Vladimir Putin. Based on the analysis of network agendas in
   the Russian federal press, it can be concluded that Trump was portrayed
   by the Russian media not as Russia's favorite candidate for president,
   but as Hillary Clinton's opponent and a critic of U.S. recent policies.
   In this context, its likely loss would allow the Russian media to
   strengthen the negative impression of Russians from U.S. elections.
   However, after the election results were announced, the Russian media
   changed tactics and began to write about Trump as a friend of Russia,
   since there was hope that the new president would lift political and
   economic sanctions. Trump's policy has not lived up to the expectations
   of Russians and since the beginning of 2017 publications about him were
   mostly negative. Finally, Trump's positive image collapsed after the
   start of U.S. military operations in Syria and the imposition of new
   sanctions against Russia.},

Abstract = {Between 1967 and 1991, there were no diplomatic relations between the
   Soviet Union and Israel. Today, Russia and Israel take a pragmatic
   approach. Both sides are aware of the limits of cooperation. Some
   political interests are compatible, although the level of economic
   exchange is low. Moscow and Jerusalem share no common values. Yet
   strategist dialogue has gained a new level of importance since Russia
   intervened in the Syrian war in 2015 and supported the Assad regime
   together with Iran. Today, Russia plays a decisive role in deciding on
   the post-war order in Syria. Its policies have consequences for the
   position of Iran, developments in the Middle East and thus also for the
   security of Israel.},

Abstract = {The US has announced its withdrawal from the treaty on the prohibition
   of medium-range rockets. Washington is only willing to revoke this
   decision if Moscow refutes accusations of violating the agreement.
   However, Russia also accuses the US of being in infringement of the
   treaty. The European NATO states are most directly affected by this new
   situation, but have almost no political clout. Also, while states such
   as Germany want the INF Treaty to be upheld, or a new treaty to be
   brought into being, others such as Poland see a threat that can only be
   averted through counter-armament. The post-Soviet member states are
   similarly powerless and divided. Belarus and Kazakhstan are incapable of
   persuading their major ally Russia to fall in line with the demands of
   the US, while Ukraine is an adversary of Moscow anyway.},

Title = {Being and Belonging: Benno Premsela, Joop Voet, Sandor Baracs and the
   Holocaust in Nazi-Occupied Amsterdam},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF GENOCIDE RESEARCH},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {21},
Number = {3, SI},
Pages = {418-435},
Abstract = {Benno Premsela, Joop Voet and Sandor Baracs were Jewish men, citizens of
   Amsterdam, who came to age in prewar Amsterdam, survived the Holocaust
   by going into hiding and became important and well-known spokesmen, for
   different public causes, in the immediate postwar years. Following their
   individual trajectories from the late 1930s until the late 1940s, this
   essay investigates the social habitat and social interactions of these
   three men in the Dutch capital just before, during and directly after
   the Holocaust. The focus is on their emotional reactions to the
   accumulative restrictive orders in the course of the Holocaust and, more
   specifically, on the impact of the dramatic events on their feelings of
   belonging and on their perceptions of their community. Exploring the
   little-studied domain of emotions, this essay sheds light on their
   tactics to survive, their networks of rescue, their circles of
   identification and disidentification and their postwar response to the
   Holocaust. The three microhistories present significant differentiations
   and complications of our knowledge. They illuminate the strength of the
   ties with their prewar circles of identification, only to loosen in the
   phase of the deportations, and only in the case of Joop Voet. They also
   produce important counternarratives of the dominant narrative in
   literature of ``double victimhood{''} of Dutch Jews in the after war
   period. Their dissociation from the postwar Jewish community of
   Amsterdam, a community of victims, should be related to their choice for
   political activism and public engagement.},

   2018. First, the general elections confirmed the hegemony of the
   Colorado Party, even in the unusual situation of internal conflict.
   Second, a woman was elected vice-president for the first time in the
   country's recent history. That is a significative political outcome even
   when it can be interpreted as the outcome of President Cartes' political
   maneuvering to remain as an active Senator. Third, in 2018, the
   Paraguayan economy registered controlled inflation, moderate debt
   growth, and sustained economic growth, which provide macroeconomic
   stability in the country. Finally, extreme and general poverty remained
   within the same levels than the previous year. Economic development has
   not improved the quality of life of the most vulnerable members of
   Paraguayan's society.},

Abstract = {At the end of November 2018, Russia's coastguard seized three Ukrainian
   ships in the Kerch Strait that were sailing towards Mariupol. The ships
   were rammed, fired at and boarded. The crew were arrested and accused of
   illegally crossing the state border with Russia. Russia's behaviour is a
   violation of international law. The purpose of this act of violence was
   to assert Russia's dominance over Ukraine with regard to the Kerch
   Strait, in defiance of international law, and to intimidate the
   Ukrainian navy. With such actions, Russia is continuing its occupation
   and annexation of Crimea, which is illegal according to international
   law.},

   an unheroic kind history is getting more and more important for the

Abstract = {This article explores sub-national variation in jihadist Salafist
   mobilization through a comparative analysis of two Tunisian interior
   towns: Sidi Bouzid and Metlaoui. After the Arab Spring, while Sidi
   Bouzid emerged as a bastion of jihadist Salafism and Islamic State
   foreign fighter recruitment, the movement failed to gain broad-based
   legitimacy in Metlaoui. On the basis of the comparison, this study
   introduces a new explanation for the variation in jihadist mobilization:
   state-building legacies and collective memory. During the 20th century,
   Sidi Bouzid and Metlaoui were subjected to divergent processes of forced
   political incorporation that this study argues have had implications for
   how contemporary citizens respond to jihadist rhetoric. The final part
   of the article discusses how this insight informs the study of jihadist
   Salafism in other contexts.},

Volume = {29},

Abstract = {Despite being part of the original concept in ``The American Voter{''},
   multiple party identifications (MPID) have rarely been analyzed. Based
   on a 2016 survey that is representative of the German electorate, we
   investigate the determinants of multiple party attachments in Germany.
   With the help of a new measurement instrument for MPID, we can show that
   multiple attachments are a common phenomenon in Germany: Nearly 30\% of
   the respondents and more than half of all party adherents identify
   themselves with more than one party. Political interest and education as
   facets of political involvement have a significant effect on the
   likelihood of holding multiple attachments within ideological camps.
   Cross-pressures lead to a higher probability of having multiple
   identifications between political camps.},

Abstract = {Students within higher education increasingly expect a teaching and

   learning and respond particularly well to information delivered using a
   visual medium. One way in which colleagues have responded is through the
   increased use of new, free presentation software. This review evaluates
   one of the most popular and dynamic options - Prezi. It finds that
   Prezi's functionality enables us to explore complex spacial
   relationships and connections visually and, more broadly, can feed into
   deeper learning. As such, it has considerable potential as a teaching
   and learning tool within political science.},

Abstract = {The political aspects of the formation of the civil society and the rule

   The nature of the civil society formation in Azerbaijan is inseparably
   linked with the regional political processes. In particular, the
   analysis of internal political and regional processes, conducted on the
   basis of consideration of the legal framework and political structures
   of the country, the main stages of post-Soviet development, and
   tendencies in the development of civil society, which arc mainly
   manifested through such forms of social life as the activities of
   non-governmental organizations, civic engagement, corruption and
   bureaucracy, authoritarianism in various echelons of power, showed that
   the civil society in Azerbaijan had not yet met the advanced standards
   of open society and democratic development. The formation of the rule of
   law is hampered by the regional contradictions, in particular, the
   Nagorno-Karabakh conflict, as well as high legal illiteracy of the
   population, the traditions-bound nature of the social structure,
   elements of corruption and authoritarianism in management at certain
   levels.},

Booktitle = {CHINA IN WORLD AND REGIONAL POLITICS: HISTORY AND MODERNITY},
Series = {Kitaj v Mirovoj i Regional noj Politike Istoria i Sovremennost},
Year = {2019},

Pages = {314-329},
Abstract = {The article examines some topical issues of international significance
   of the phenomenon of ``Chinese model{''} of socio-economic reforms (the
   so-called Beijing consensus) terms of its probable feasibil-its' in the
   economic reforms in the Russian Federation. The issue of the
   ``model{''}'s role in the general civilizational development is also
   touched upon. It is emphasized that features, phenomena and concepts of
   the old ``Washington consensus{''}, the old ``Moscow consensus{''}, the
   former ``Beijing consensus{''} and ``Delhi (Mumbai) consensus{''}, etc.
   compose important scientific and methodological experience which may he
   useful in relevant decision-making.
   The study is conducted in the style of prognostic and analytical
   assessment.
   The question of theoretical and practical demand in categories
   ``socialist society{''} and ``communist society{''}, which now clearly
   need qualitative clarification, is also raised. To accomplish this task,
   the analysis of the applicability of various theories and practices of
   ``meritocracy{''} appears to be even more useful. `the analysis can also
   play a positive role in the future promotion of a new universal and
   optimal model of social and environmental development which is to take
   into account interests of joint progress of Russia and China and other
   advanced world ``centers{''} as well. It is significant that ``early{''}
   Marx himself believed that ``communism is not the limit of human
   history...{''}.
   It should be borne in mind that, like the ``globalization{''}
   phenomenon, the current processes of ``post-globalization{''} including
   ``repatriation{''}, ``re-sovereignization{''}, etc. are not the ``end of
   history{''}, as it was interpreted by F. Fukuyama and other Western
   ideologists. Western political science sees the ``end of the history{''}
   as the ``eternal triumph{''} of liberal-market democracy of the
   neo-capitalist type. The specific directions, ways, forms and methods of
   a new global society formation will be determined by the life itself,
   but the duty of the scientific community is to contribute to the timely
   identification and prediction of the features of this process. In view
   of this, it would be advisable to establish under the auspices of the
   Institute of Far Eastern Studies of the RAS an ad hoc working group on
   the study of the optimization of models-paradigms of global
   socio-economic development.},

Abstract = {How has the field of comparative politics in the US evolved since the
   turn of the millennium? What might a scholar based in Latin America, a
   different working environment than the United States, do to contribute
   to comparative politics? Researchers in the US currently give
   disproportionate attention to matters of methods, tend to address narrow
   substantive questions, and pay inadequate attention to matters of
   theory. However, the research community in the US is diverse, and no
   trend dominates for long. In turn, few researchers in Latin America work
   in the kinds of circumstances conducive to careers focused fully on
   research that their peers in the US enjoy. Still, there are advantages
   to working in the periphery, including greater knowledge of the
   languages and cultures, a stronger ability to produce ``thick
   knowledge{''} that sets research in context, and closer proximity to
   empirical phenomena of interest that can make the stakes of research
   more obvious. Moreover, Latin American scholars can benefit from
   selectively engaging with ideas and colleagues from the North. We thus
   see not only problems and obstacles but also opportunities for
   comparative politics in both the North and South.},

Abstract = {In this article, I argue that the fact of reasonable pluralism (FRP) - a
   famous Rawlsian assumption about the intellectual demographics of
   liberal democracies - is not as self-evident as is sometimes thought.
   The problem with the FRP is that in Political Liberalism Rawls is
   treating the freedoms and burdens story as being sufficient - in itself
   - to explain the demographics of reasonable pluralism. The inadequacy of
   the freedoms and burdens story is an indication that the FRP is
   empirically underdetermined as a way of glossing the belief demographics
   of liberal democracies. And it is a reason to wonder whether pluralism
   is as permanent as Rawls thinks. But worldview disagreements are not
   necessarily so incorrigible. In response to the FRP, it can be asserted
   that there is nothing that is inherent in the idea of a liberal
   democracy to preclude the choice by the citizens of a common worldview.},

Abstract = {A vivid political discourse is a crucial component of a functioning
   democracy. Since user numbers of social networks are increasing, the
   political debate via these channels becomes more important. Therefore,
   the present study analyses the consumers of political information
   through social networks, using the case of Austria as an example. The
   models are based upon a secondary data analysis of the Digitalmonitor
   (N=1.200). Our results show that social media consumers of political
   information are, among other things, highly interested in politics, hold
   rather extreme values on a political left-right scale and have little
   trust in traditional media channels. We conclude that social media do
   not guarantee equal access to information. However, for people
   dissatisfied with the traditional media, it provides an alternative.},

Abstract = {Historically, the mechanisms of economic integration in Latin America
   and the Caribbean, such as: CARICOM, the Andean Community of Nations,
   ALADI and Mercosur are defined as supranational entities whose purpose
   is to strengthen commercial relations between states at the regional
   level In part, through mechanisms such as the reduction of tariff
   barriers and the elimination of legal obstacles that hinder integration.
   The objective of the article is to analyze the main causes and factors
   that have generated the crisis of the systems of economic integration in
   Latin America from the critical approach of the cases of MERCOSUR and
   the Andean Community of Nations in the 21st century. Methodologically it
   is a documentary investigation developed within the framework of the
   realistic paradigm for the approach of international relations. It is
   concluded that despite their economic and commercial origin, the
   integration mechanisms depend mainly on the political and ideological
   interests of the governments of the day, which is why, as long as there
   is harmony in the political discourses and conceptions of the elites of
   These mechanisms can be strengthened and, when there is no tuning, such
   mechanisms tend to weaken.},

Abstract = {This paper applies a model of the relationship between armed group
   authority/legitimacy and popular support for armed groups, to explain
   how the EZLN gained support among a diverse array of constituencies in
   the period from 1983-2005. Moreover, it shows that the need to maximise
   support explains the EZLN's strategy in the different phases of its
   existence. The EZLN is an interesting case, due to the organization's
   high degree of reliance on international and national civil society
   support, which illustrates the importance of ideology and political
   messaging in understanding support for armed groups.},

Abstract = {This article highlights the gap between the quantitative importance
   gained by nations and nationalism studies in the literature and the
   relative lack of empirical research within it, and illustrates this
   proposition through the question of state-led nation-building in Europe.
   It then assesses the pros and cons of the original contribution made by
   historian Eugen Weber in his Peasants into Frenchmen. It concludes by
   suggesting what use researchers interested in nation-building might make
   of Weber's work.},

Abstract = {The article intends to determine the scope of the action for breach in
   the Ecuadorian legal system, through a descriptive documentary
   investigation, from the perspective of the analytical method. The action
   for noncompliance is a constitutional guarantee of a jurisdictional
   nature whose purpose is the application and compliance with the norms
   that make up the legal system as well as the judgments and reports of
   the international organizations destined to the protection of human
   rights, recognized in article 93 of the Constitution of the Republic of
   Ecuador. The characteristic elements necessary for the origin of the
   action for non-compliance are: Guarantee of the application of norms or
   administrative acts of a general nature, whatever their nature and
   hierarchy, which make up the legal system; guarantee of compliance with
   sentences or reports of international human rights organizations; rule
   or decision must contain an obligation to make or not make clear,
   express and enforceable; Verification that the norm, general
   administrative act, judgment or report of international human rights
   organizations, is not enforceable by ordinary judicial means.},

Abstract = {The aim of this article is to analyze the experiences, the imaginaries
   and the strategies for balance domestic and care work, employment and
   political participation. For that, the pertinence of ``threefold
   presence{''} is presented, which is a theoretical and analytical tool to
   delve into the participation from a feminist perspective. This study is
   situated in the Basque Country and is based on the analysis of fourteen
   biography-interviews carried out during the 2016 year whit people of
   different generations who are engaged in these three areas of life
   analyzed in the investigation. The study demonstrates that people who
   assumed the domestic and care work arc still suffering important
   barriers to engage in the public sphere generally and in the political
   arena, particularly. As conclusion, the importance of introduce temporal
   dimension in participation debates is confirmed. In that sense, the
   study shows that feminization of poverty is linked to time, moreover,
   the claim of own time become crucial in the context of the threefold
   presence.},

Abstract = {The article presents the results of the study based on the data of the
   2012 European Social Survey. The author analyzed the correlation between
   the population's attitude towards democracy and the assessment of the
   importance of its individual aspects ({''}understanding{''} of
   democracy). The analysis was carried out on data from Russia and groups
   of European countries (Northern Europe, Western Europe, Southern Europe,
   and the post-socialist countries of Central and Eastern Europe). The
   average resident of all European countries would like to live in a
   democracy; Nordic countries most strongly wanted to live in a democracy,
   whilst those who least strongly wished to came from postsocialist
   countries, especially Russia. Despite a number of similarities between
   groups of European countries, one can see significant differences
   between groups of countries in Western and Northern Europe and the group
   of post-socialist countries and Russia. Russians and the population of
   the group of post-socialist countries have a lesser attitude towards
   democracy in their understanding of the importance of its individual
   characteristics (correlation coefficients with each of the signs of
   democracy are lower than in other groups of countries). Most signs of
   democracy are equally important components in the perceptions of the
   population of Russia and post-socialist countries, while in other groups
   of countries these views are more differentiated. The study draws
   attention to the lack of validity of questions about the general
   attitude towards democracy, used in many international and national
   polls. It is associated with differences in the understanding of this
   concept by supporters of democracy in different groups of countries.},

Abstract = {What does it exactly mean to say there are ``some good reasons{''} for
   the reaction of the spectator to an artwork? In the first place, no
   concept-using explanation for the art agency or artistic comprehension
   in general should be call into question. Art involves reasoning, thus
   requires conceptual means, even though this fact may require a
   redefinition of the conceptual process. In second place, we examine
   representation, expression and inference as useful notions for the
   understanding of what a conceptual content is. A working hypothesis is
   that art pieces and non-artistic objects make meaning through concept
   use; however, there is a critical difference between them: art
   experience essentially modifies the kind of inferentially articulated
   entitlements and commitments we may undertake.},

Abstract = {This work proposes some elements of reflection on the nature, object and
   epistemological presuppositions of the notion of ``critique{''} in
   Jacques Ranciere's philosophy. To this end, the objections directed by
   Ranciere to the paradigm of the ``critique of representation{''}, of
   which Guy Debord's thought constitute an exemplary case, are taken as a
   point of reference and polemical horizon. The paper concludes by
   establishing some parallels between Ranciere's definition of critique as
   a manifestation of dissensus and that carried out by theorists of
   hegemony, specifically Chantal Mouffe.},

Abstract = {As a child, Gyorgy Konrad only just managed to escape the Holocaust.
   After the war, he experienced the establishment of communist rule in

   During the 1980s, he began to travel extensively in the West, where he
   gave lectures. However, he consistently refused to emigrate from
   Hungary. Twice, his literary achievements were honoured with his
   election as President of the German Academy of Arts. In his books and
   essays, Konrad was able to draw on his own experience of the brown and
   red dictatorships. Here, his own biography served as a heuristic tool
   for alternative ways of living, with which he experimented through the
   medium of his novels.},

Abstract = {The hip-hop musical style, which developed in the ghettos of the major

   Afro-American youth against discrimination and marginalisation. Its
   general thrust was critical and emancipatory. In Poland, however, the
   hip-hop scene has not used counter-cultural codes and practices to
   spread emancipatory ideas. Instead they are used to disseminate
   authoritarian attitudes and nationalist-Catholic values. This
   combination of nationalism and counter-culture is not just a Polish
   phenomenon, it is a characteristic of the identity-defining scene in
   different countries.},

Title = {HORIZONS OF RESPONSIBLE DEVELOPMENT: FROM DISCOURSE TO GOVERNANCE},
Journal = {POLIS-POLITICHESKIYE ISSLEDOVANIYA},
Year = {2019},
Number = {3},
Pages = {7-26},
Abstract = {An overview of the narratives on social development that have appeared
   in the social sciences at the turn of the millennium demonstrates that
   the vision of the future that emerges is blurred, and uncertainty,
   anxiety and insecurity are perceptions shared by the political class and
   the public opinion. This said, the research agenda and governance
   priorities are tom apart to the detriment of security, equality and
   social cohesion. The gap which exists in our perception of the future
   calls for a new approach to development issues. The author proposes a
   conceptual framework for promoting social change at different levels of
   commrmity life based on responsible development. 23 This framework has
   several dimensions: a moral value oriented motivation for choosing
   development. priorities and stimulating individual capabilities,
   recourse to non-material, intellectual and (where possible) renewable
   resources to promote this agenda, and an institutional basis for
   stimulating agency, engaging and empowering individuals and communities,
   and fostering civic political identity. Responsible development is not a
   universal model, nor a set of fixed goals, but a reference frame to
   pursue development priorities based on a strategic vision of the future
   and on innovative approaches to governance. These approaches may vmy to
   accommodate the exigencies of different societies and communities, and
   there can be no one option due to differences in political culture,
   economic development and social frameworks, but they do share common
   basic principles. Social dialogue on the community level and the
   capabilities approach which has been adopted within the framework of the
   Nordic model are an example of effective governance practices which fit
   into this framework. Responsible development is a strategic vision of
   the principles that can direct communities and individuals to pursue
   development issues and to hold responsibility for the choices they make,
   for the policies they promote and for their long-term effects. As such,
   it requires a permanent tuning of social and political institutions,
   consideration of changing priorities, values and identities, and
   feedback between the research and the education agendas, between the
   state, local governments, business and civil society. The social
   sciences are a crucial actor in this process; promoting this discourse
   in the public space and engaging the political class is a key priority
   of a responsible intellectual community.},

Abstract = {European integration, as complicated process that involves comprehensive
   reforms, inevitably changes a society in a variety of dimensions. It is
   therefore necessary to involve all segments of society from an early
   stage. The full involvement of the national legislative authorities can
   facilitate the EU integration of a country. Recent literature proves
   that national parliaments play a crucial role in this process (Strelkov
   2016; Finke and Dannwolf 2015; Stratulat 2014). However, the potential
   of national parliaments is largely unused in some candidate and
   potential candidate countries to join the EU. The aim of this article is
   to analyse the role of national parliaments in candidate and potential
   candidate countries by focusing on the case of the Kosovo parliament in
   comparative way. A comparison in some aspects is made with role national
   parliaments of Croatia and Slovenia as EU and ex-Yugoslavia countries,
   during their European integration process. The findings indicate that
   the potential of the Kosovo parliament is unused due to the limited
   capacity available for the verification of the alignment of Kosovo
   legislation with acquis.},

Journal = {AMERICAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE},

Volume = {63},
Number = {1},
Pages = {37-52},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {I advance a theory about how compulsory voting affects the behavior of
   political parties. The theory suggests that parties will pivot toward
   programmatic vote-seeking strategies and away from clientelistic
   tactics, such as vote buying, where voting is compulsory. I test my
   expectations in three separate studies, using several data sources and
   empirical approaches. In Study 1, cross-national analyses show that
   parties behave more programmatically under compulsory voting and that
   vote buying is less common where voting is mandatory. In Study 2,
   synthetic control and difference-in-differences analyses show that a
   switch to compulsory voting in Thailand produced an increase in
   programmatic vote seeking. In Study 3, a list experiment conducted in
   tandem with a natural experiment shows that compulsory voting leads
   parties to rely less on vote-buying tactics in Argentina. I conclude by
   discussing the implications of these findings, which together are
   broadly supportive of my theoretical expectations.},

Abstract = {Invalid ballots are relatively common in countries with compulsory
   voting, yet there is no cross-national evidence as to who is more likely
   to cast a blank or spoiled ballot where voting is forced. I argue that
   increased rates of blank and spoiled balloting where voting is
   obligatory result from the behavior of the politically unknowledgeable,
   uninterested, untrusting, and disaffected, who are incentivized to turn
   out to the polls where they can be sanctioned for abstention. To test
   this, I conduct an individual-level examination of the influence of
   compulsory voting on invalid balloting across countries. I find support
   for my expectations with analyses of survey data from several American
   democracies, many of which compel electoral participation.},

Title = {TRANSFORMATION OF METAPHOR OF POWER IN THE 20TH - EARLY 21ST CENTURIES
   ON THE EXAMPLE OF WORKS BY J.R.R. TOLKIEN AND G.R.R. MARTIN},
Journal = {POLITEIA-JOURNAL OF POLITICAL THEORY POLITICAL PHILOSOPHY AND SOCIOLOGY
   OF POLITICS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {93},
Number = {2},
Pages = {28-47},
Abstract = {The metaphor of power is so broad that, without claiming to fully
   consider all its aspects, M.Steinman focuses on its relatively narrow
   aspect, related to the narrative field of the fantasy genre in the
   context of the political changes of the 20th - early 21st centuries. The
   purpose of her research is to trace the transformation of the
   understanding of the political metaphor in terms of characteristics that
   allow it to become one of the key tools of political reflection. At the
   same time, Steinman draws attention to another important property of
   political metaphor - its ability to model one or another version of
   political reality.
   The connection between metaphor, political myth and fantasy genre is
   both obvious and debatable. The matrix of fantasy genre was originally
   created as a field of deep reflections on the topic of modernity rather
   than as a way to entertain the reader. It is this consideration that
   encouraged Steinman to combine in the framework of one study Lord of the
   Rings by J.R.R. Tolkien and Song of Ice and Fire by G.R.R. Martin - each
   of these authors tried to identify and comprehend the political problems
   of his time.
   These problems have received the clearest expression in two images
   Tolkien's Ring of Power and Martin's Iron Throne. At the same time,
   according to Steinman, the metaphor of the political game, phrased as
   ``the game of thrones{''}, possesses a dominant meaning. The analysis of
   modern media, in particular, provides a compelling evidence of its
   dominant role. Every time the political agenda implies a debate or
   elections, memes are activated that refer to the characters of Martin's
   novels and a TV-show based on his book. At the same time, one can often
   see the simplified use of a meme at the level of exploitation of a
   recognizable formulation.},

Abstract = {Due to the spread of the third wave of global democratization from
   southern Europe to more distant countries and cultures, many authors
   have begun to address the paradoxical trend that reflects the fact that
   although democracy has become the norm in the world, i.e. the most
   common and generally legitimate form of government, it often works in a
   way that reduces real freedom. The main goal of this study is defining a
   space between functioning democracy and the failing one, identifying the
   most important highlights based on results of empirical researches
   published during 2016-2019 to identify the most current trends in
   liberal democracy that we originally call ``a state of democratic
   emergency{''} occurring due to the untouched ``near misses{''}.},

Abstract = {This contribution investigates the House of European History in
   Brussels. Taking a postcolonial perspective, I focus on what is made
   central and what is made peripheral to the narrative the House
   constructs. The museum reflects what Shore describes as the
   contradictory use of culture in official European discourses, conceiving
   of Europe as a unified cultural entity on the one hand, and as a space
   of diversity on the other hand (2006). Ultimately, I argue, this
   contradiction compromises the House's ambition to present a history that
   allows room for the different experiences and stories that are lived and
   remembered within Europe.},

Title = {Against international criminal tribunals: reconciling the global justice
   norm with local agency},
Journal = {CRITICAL REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL SOCIAL AND POLITICAL PHILOSOPHY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {22},
Number = {6},
Pages = {703-724},
Abstract = {Understood as the need to address official crimes committed under the
   previous regime, a global norm of transitional justice has emerged since
   the end of the cold war. Combined with the postwar resurgence of
   international law and institutions, this has resulted in the increased
   use of international criminal tribunals to prosecute state-sponsored
   human rights violations. While I acknowledge the positive aspects of
   these developments, I argue that such tribunals are inadequate vehicles
   for justice for two reasons: (1) they are divorced from the affected
   communities; and (2) they conceive of historical justice too narrowly.
   Building on the discursive cosmopolitanism of Jurgen Habermas and Seyla
   Benhabib, I contend that respecting local traditions and desires is
   crucial to achieving justice. I lay the groundwork for a contextual
   universalism that respects international legal norms while stimulating
   discourse in the community where they occurred, so that victims and
   perpetrators can live together as members of the same polity once more.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF ELECTIONS PUBLIC OPINION AND PARTIES},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {29},
Number = {3},
Pages = {402-419},
Abstract = {A change in electoral laws is expected to substantially alter political
   outcomes as voters and elites adjust their behavior to new rules.
   However, testing the causal implications of this theory using electoral
   reforms has been difficult because election results before a reform are
   not the appropriate counterfactual for election results after a reform.
   This article leverages electoral reform in New Zealand and Norway and
   the synthetic control method to approximate the appropriate
   counterfactuals: election results in the period after reform, had the
   reform not occurred. In both the countries, I find evidence that
   electoral reform had a short-term effect on the size of the electoral
   party system, but no evidence of a lasting effect on the electoral party
   system.},

Abstract = {The global war on terror has raised debates between liberals and
   realists on the position of ethics in intelligence operations. On the
   one hand, liberal ethicists insist that the conduct of intelligence
   gathering to counter terrorism must not violate the security rights of
   citizens. On the other hand, proponents of realism consider national
   security to be of greater importance than ethical principles governing
   individual freedom. This article tries to present an alternative point
   of view by examining the consequence of ethical criticisms of
   intelligence activities on the Indonesian government's counterterrorism
   measures. It proposes two approaches to understanding the connection
   between ethics and intelligence: examining the nature of the terror
   threat, and looking at the sociopolitical situations which affect the
   role of the state's security agencies. Arguably, securitizing
   intelligence by enforcing an ethical reconceptualization of intelligence
   roles increases the challenges facing Indonesia's intelligence
   operatives and damages the effectiveness of the government's
   counterterrorism policy.},

Abstract = {The process of carrying out (serving) a criminal punishment in the form
   of imprisonment according to the Russian criminal and penal law provides
   for isolation of the convicted person, limitations of rights and certain
   freedoms, as well as using corrective measures to change the criminal
   orientation of that person towards positive law-abiding behavior.
   According to penal law, the corrective process is being implemented by
   carrying out the main measures of corrective action, which the law lists
   as: regulated conditions, socially useful labor, educational work,
   general and professional education, and social influence.
   Currently the penal system sees a general trend of reducing the total
   number of imprisoned persons. According to the statistics by the Federal
   Penitentiary Service of Russia, 880 thousand people were serving a
   prison sentence in 2010, 550 thousand people in 2016, as of 1 June 2018
   that number was 520.5 thousand people, and as of 1 May 2019 it was
   552,188 persons. In the recent years, the number of prisoners tends to
   stay on the same level. These numbers testify to the continued
   humanization of the criminal and penal policy of the Russian Federation,
   as well as to the results of applying corrective actions to those
   sentenced to imprisonment.},

Abstract = {The Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA) of Pakistan came under
   the international spotlight following the US-led invasion of Afghanistan
   in 2001. Mainly due to being a semi-autonomous region where
   British-colonial-era laws were practised until May 2018, FATA remains
   one of the most marginalised and insecure areas of Pakistan. Based on
   Galtung's structural violence theory, this paper examines the nexus
   between the region's socio-economic and political realities and
   terrorism. Through primary and secondary data, this paper argues that
   economic marginalisation and the lack of political and individual
   freedom of the tribal people are root causes of the instability in FATA.},

Abstract = {A simulation-based counterfactual is one way to solve the observational
   equivalence challenge that seemingly ``partisan{''} majority-party roll
   rates can be observed in the absence of any actual party influence. We
   simulate no-partisan-agenda-control counterfactual roll rates and apply
   them across sessions of the US House of Representatives and 86 state
   legislative chambers to evaluate the extent to which observed roll rates
   provide evidence for party influence on the legislative agenda. After
   assessing and controlling for the baseline risk of majority-party rolls,
   there is significant evidence of party influence on roll rates in some
   state legislatures, particularly those with rules that grant parties
   more agenda power, and in the post-Reed's-rules House of
   Representatives. Institutional rules interact with the (simulated) risk
   of a majority roll to shape observed roll rates across chambers and
   across time.},

Journal = {LEGISLATIVE STUDIES QUARTERLY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {45},
Number = {3},
Pages = {433-468},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {How large a benefit is partisan control of the redistricting process? Do
   legal constraints on redistricting-such as the preclearance requirement
   of the Voting Rights Act-alter this benefit? Are institutions designed
   to reduce the benefit to partisan control-such as redistricting
   commissions-effective? To measure the effects of partisan districting on
   the electoral fortunes of the parties, we collect data on the partisan
   composition of state government, House election outcomes, and moderating
   institutions over an 80-year period. Our results suggest that over time,
   both parties have benefited from unified control, with the effects
   largest in states where voters were evenly divided among the parties and
   smallest in states where the controlling party had a large advantage in
   the electorate. The effects have changed over time, with both parties
   having equally benefited from control during the middle of the 20th
   century, the benefit largely disappearing in the late part of the
   century, and the Republican Party seeing a moderate advantage from
   control in the current century. The benefits of partisan control were
   not diminished in states with redistricting commissions. The
   preclearance requirement appears to have hurt the Democratic Party
   except when its vote share was very low. The aggregate effects of
   partisan redistricting are moderate in magnitude-in the modern period,
   this effect has typically been less than 10 House seats, with the last
   election where control of the House would have flipped in expectation
   occurring in 1954.},

   political imaginaries, but also in terms of its entanglements with
   survivors' memories of nature. I analyse the presence of the post-camp
   space of Auschwitz-Birkenau in Helena Birenbaum's poetic testimonies.
   This is a space that has often been described as tainted and
   contaminated while being treated as a lifeless ``landscape of death{''}
   and cemetery. Readings of Birenbaum's testimonial poetry alongside
   archival and field research conducted at the Auschwitz-Birkenau Memorial
   and Museum have enabled me to talk about grey and green camp's
   landscape. I have sought to demonstrate that such spaces function in
   Auschwitz testimonies under the cover of metaphorical constructions and
   poetic images that I call ``the green matzevah,{''} that contain
   significant analytical and empirical potential. I explore how the camp's
   dead grey zones have over the years turned into green matzevahs, i.e.
   terrain that has experienced post-traumatic curating by invasion of
   plants. I argue that drawing attention to the world of nature as
   represented in testimonies can expand knowledge of the camp, challenging
   the martyrological framing that prevailed under communism and help to
   imagine how to preserve a memory of this place when there are no human
   witnesses.},

Abstract = {This study examines policy tools in the fight against terrorism when
   existing levels of terrorism matter in 53 African countries for the
   period 1998-2012. The empirical evidence is based on contemporary,
   non-contemporary and Instrumental Variable Quantile regressions (QR)
   which enable the investigation throughout the conditional distributions
   of domestic, transnational and total terrorism dynamics. The following
   findings are established. First, counterterrorism policy instruments of
   inclusive human development and military expenditure further fuel
   terrorim. Second, political stability negatively affects terrorism with
   a negative threshold effect. Political stability estimates are
   consistently significant with increasing negative magnitudes throughout
   the conditional distributions of domestic and total terrorism. Policy
   implications are discussed.},

Abstract = {In this paper we analyse the effect of multilateral defence alliances in
   arms trade among allies. We postulate that the access to the frontier
   technology weaponry enabled only to military allies will intensify arms
   trade. The benefits of such trade are claimed to be in security and
   technology diffusion. We execute an empirical analysis for the North
   Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). Results show that being a member or
   partner of NATO significantly increases arm imports coming from the
   alliance, and that this increase cannot be attributed to economic and
   additional country characteristics.},

Abstract = {Does how Congress makes a law affect public approval of that law? This
   question has been little studied, but the rising use of unorthodox
   processes in Congress raises concerns about the perceived legitimacy of
   congressional action among the public. Utilizing two unique survey
   experiments, I present evidence that when people are aware of the use of
   unorthodox legislative processes they express lower levels of approval
   for new laws. This effect is especially pronounced among partisans
   already inclined to be in opposition to the law, further solidifying
   their opposition. These findings have important implications for a
   Congress that in recent years has increasingly turned to unorthodox
   legislative processes to pass legislation.},

Abstract = {This article presents the conclusions of the project Why Centralization
   and Decentralization in Federations?, which analyzed dynamic
   de/centralization in Australia, Canada, Germany, India, Switzerland, and
   the United States over their entire life span. It highlights six main
   conclusions. First, dynamic de/centralization is complex and
   multidimensional; it cannot be captured by fiscal data alone. Second,
   while centralization was the dominant trend, Canada is an exception.
   Third, contrary to some expectations, centralization occurred mainly in
   the legislative, rather than fiscal, sphere. Fourth, centralization is
   not only a mid-twentieth century phenomenon; considerable change
   occurred both before and after. Fifth, variation in centralization
   across federations appears to be driven by conjunctural causation rather
   than the net effect of any individual factor. Sixth, institutional
   properties influence the instruments of dynamic de/centralization but do
   not significantly affect its direction or magnitude. These findings have
   important conceptual, theoretical, methodological, and empirical
   implications for the study of federalism.},

Abstract = {Does the public's approval of their state legislature reflect their
   satisfaction with the outputs of state government? Using survey
   responses from the 2014 Cooperative Congressional Election Study, we
   consider the roots of public approval of state legislatures. We find
   that people are more likely to voice approval of their state legislature
   when it produces policy outcomes that correspond with their interests.
   Liberals view their state legislature more positively when policy
   outputs are liberal, while conservatives evaluate their state
   legislature more favorably when policy outcomes are conservative. These
   effects are the most pronounced among those who are the most
   knowledgeable about state politics. Using panel data from 2012 to 2014,
   we also show that changes in state policy liberalism are associated with
   changes in state legislative approval. Even though we have reasons to be
   pessimistic about the quality of citizens' assessments of state
   government, our results demonstrate that citizens evaluate their state
   legislatures based on the policy outcomes they provide.},

Abstract = {The 1990s witnessed the spread of anti-corruption scandals in Latin
   American countries as well as a decade in which international
   transparency standards were developed. These two processes were closely
   related but they followed different local and global political dynamics.
   Transparency policies were perceived everywhere as a good response to
   the growing of corruption scandals. But, at the end of the day, the
   effectiveness of these policies was far from optimal. This article
   discusses the link between these two main aspects of the corruption as a
   public problem in Argentina. It reconstructs the dynamics of corruption
   scandals and state responses in Argentina during the 1990s, and asks how
   effective and efficient those responses were given the type of
   accusations and corruption cases exposed to the public through scandals.
   The hypothesis is that scandals, on the one hand, and public policy
   responses, on the other, refer to different aspects of the same problem
   and that the latter have failed to deal effectively with the demands and
   claims expressed through the scandals.},

Abstract = {Cross-border mobility has long been seen as a mechanism to promote a
   collective political identity; however, the results of empirical studies
   on young people have been inconsistent. The present work extends
   previous research on the effect of cross-border mobility by considering
   the effect of cross-border friendships drawing on the intergroup contact
   theory of Allport as well as the common ingroup identity model of
   Gaertner and Dovidio. This longitudinal study examines the role of
   cross-border friendships in the development of a sense of transnational
   political community that transcends national boundaries, i.e. the
   European Union. The results rely on a two-wave sample of 1294 Italian
   adolescents and young adults. Cross-border friendships significantly
   predicted identification as European, attitudes toward the European
   Union, political beliefs about the European Union, trust in the European
   Union, (negatively) political alienation, and political participation at
   the European level and intention to vote at the next European Parliament
   elections, even after including baseline levels of outcomes as well as
   relevant socio-demographic factors (i.e. gender, age, majority/minority
   status, educational qualification, parents' education level, family
   income, and socioeconomic status) in the model.},

Abstract = {Shifts in the balance of India's economy towards private production have
   re-opened a debate over the role of the business in its polity. Business
   interests have found new ways to influence the state at different levels
   and through multiple institutions. This article concentrates on the
   composition of the 17th Lok Sabha and its porosity towards business
   (around 28.4\% of these MPs have self-reported business careers). A
   growing of number of `industrialists' and entrepreneurs have branched
   out into a legislative career; they complement a fast-emerging group of
   entrepreneurial politicians, who already use their legislative and
   institutional location to develop business interests for themselves and
   their families. We find that the influence and power of business has
   become diffuse and central at the same time; it seeped into every aspect
   of the election campaign and voting process: political recruitment,
   finance, issues, and policies-in tangible and intangible ways. This
   spectral presence of business is shaping Indian elections, parties, and
   democracy and in turn consolidating India's economic reforms and
   pro-business polity.},

Abstract = {The article focuses on the question of how each of us should deliberate
   internally when forming judgements. That is a matter of political
   consequence, insofar as those judgements stand behind our votes. I argue
   that some violations of epistemic independence like message repetition
   can, if the receivers are not aware of the repetition, lead them to
   double-count information they have already taken into account, thus
   distorting their judgments. One upshot is that each of us should ignore
   or heavily discount certain sorts of inputs (e.g., bot messages or
   retweets) that are likely just to be repetition of what we have already
   taken into account in our internal deliberations. I propose various
   deliberative norms that may protect our internal deliberations from
   epistemic double-counting, and argue that opinion leaders have special
   epistemic duties of care to shield their audiences from clone claims.},

Abstract = {Scholars are accustomed to viewing Ronald Reagan the politician through
   the prism of his career as a Hollywood actor. The presidency, Lou Cannon
   wrote, was Reagan's ``role of a lifetime.{''} Less often appreciated is
   that Richard Nixon, too, was the quintessential actor, transforming time
   and again to reinvent himself as the ``new{''} Nixon and the new
   ``new{''} Nixon. He was the eager ``boy wonder.{''} He was the fierce
   Red-baiter. He was the revered elder statesman. For more than half a
   century, scholars have sought to locate which was the ``real Nixon.{''}
   The exercise has proven elusive, for Nixon became a secretive president
   not simply for security or trickery but because he hid himself. In this
   essay, I look to leave Nixon both more and less legible. I have found
   that by shifting over and over, in hiding, in acting, in playing each
   role, Nixon became unknowable.},

Abstract = {The proportion of the American electorate that is ``constrained{''} by
   ideology has risen dramatically since Philip E. Converse suggested, in
   the early 1960s, that ideology is the province of only a small fraction
   of the mass public. In part, the rise of ideological voters has been
   obscured by the tendency of scholars after Converse to equate them with
   those who use terms referring to ideological concepts, such as liberal
   and conservative, in open-ended interviews. These ``concept
   ideologues,{''} however, are not the only members of the public whose
   political opinions show evidence of ideological constraint. There is
   also a growing segment of the public, the ``policy ideologues,{''} who
   take positions on three or more policy issues but do not happen to
   mention ideological concepts. Policy ideologues prove to be as
   politically knowledgeable as concept ideologues; their attitudes are
   nearly as constrained across issues and over time; and their policy
   stances usually ``make sense{''} as liberal or conservative-not
   surprisingly, as they are almost as willing as concept ideologues to
   label themselves ideologically, when asked. By 2012, the portion of the
   public consisting of concept and policy ideologues had reached 42
   percent. It declined to 38 percent in 2016, but was still a far cry from
   the 12 percent of the electorate whom Converse identified as ideologues
   or near ideologues as of 1956.},

Title = {Dual candidacy as a source of legislator behaviour. The re-election and
   the mandate incentive under mixed-member electoral rules},
Journal = {ACTA POLITICA},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {56},
Number = {1},
Pages = {26-48},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Legislators are often viewed as `single-minded seekers of re-election',
   and hence their actions are attributed to their ultimate goal of staying
   in office. However, an alternative approach `liberates' legislators from
   the ever continuing struggle for re-election and argues that MPs carry
   out certain tasks simply because it is part of their jobs. This study is
   an attempt to empirically separate re-election and mandate incentives in
   the MPs' behaviour. Hungary's mixed-member electoral system with dual
   candidacy creates a situation in which the two types of incentives can
   be separately observed. If mandate incentives prevail there should be a
   difference between SMD and list MPs, while re-election motivations offer
   the dominant explanation to MP behaviour if the difference is between
   MPs nominated in SMDs and those who are not. Analysing legislators'
   attitudes and behaviour between 2010 and 2014 it is found that although
   re-election incentives indeed prevail in the MPs' behaviour, the effect
   of the mandate strongly characterizes attitudes creating a tension
   between what MPs do and what they think they should be doing.},

Abstract = {A number of studies show the prevalence of fears among natives that
   migrants could undermine support for the welfare state. In this article,
   we turn the focus to migrants' views of other migrants. Employing data
   from the Migrants' Welfare State Attitudes survey, administered among
   ten migrant groups in the Netherlands, Denmark, and Germany, we find
   that migrants, like natives, perceive other migrant groups as
   benefitting more from the welfare state than they contribute. These
   attitudes follow a relatively consistent ranking. Migrants from western
   EU countries were viewed as being least likely to benefit
   disproportionately, followed by migrants from rich countries outside
   Europe, those from eastern EU countries and those from poor countries
   outside Europe. Furthermore, according to our analyses, this order of
   ranking is explained largely by a combination of socio-economic factors
   and a sense of belonging to the country of residence and the group of
   migrants in general.},

Abstract = {Syriza lost the July 2019 election in Greece to the right-wing New
   Democracy Party, though it was not a crushing defeat. This article
   explains that although Syriza is chiefly responsible for the return of
   New Democracy to power, its remarkable electoral performance is because
   its party elites, being in power for over four years, succeeded in
   appropriating the state machine, establishing caucuses of power,
   influence and clientelism. Thus, the demise of the Panhellenic Socialist
   Movement (PASOK), upon which Syriza capitalised in full, led to the
   establishment of a new two (state) party system dominated by New
   Democracy and Syriza. The extreme left and the extreme right ceased to
   play a major role in this new political scene.},

Abstract = {This paper focuses on an under-researched and under-developed typology
   of political branding and conceptualizes politicians as personal
   political brands. Further, this study answers explicit calls for more
   research devoted to exploring the development of intended brand identity
   particularly from a brand creator perspective. Members of Parliament
   from the Republic of Iceland contextualizes this study. This qualitative
   case-study approach reveals how personal political brands create,
   construct and communicate their identity. Personal political brand
   identities were established and managed via a clear brand mantra and
   offline-online communication tools, which in turn revealed a degree of
   alignment with their party-political brand. However, this paper also
   demonstrates the challenges of managing the identities of personal
   political brands in terms of authenticity and integration particularly
   with coalition partners. Our paper builds on the six-staged analytical
   process of personal branding and proposes the Personal Political Brand
   Identity Appraisal Framework as an operational tool to introspectively
   evaluate personal political brand identity. This framework can be used
   by political actors across different settings and contexts to assess
   personal political brands from multiple perspectives.},

Title = {The politics of blame avoidance in complex delegation structures: the
   public transport crisis in Berlin},

Abstract = {The article analyses the public attribution of blame and the use of
   presentational strategies of blame avoidance in complex delegation
   structures. We theorize and empirically demonstrate that complex
   delegation structures result in the diffusion of blame to multiple
   actors so that a clear allocation of responsibility becomes more
   difficult. The article shows that public attribution of blame follows a
   distinct temporal pattern in which politicians only gradually move into
   the centre of the blame storm. We also find that blame-takers deploy
   sequential patterns of presentational management and use blame shifting
   to other actors as a dominant strategy. However, the analysis suggests
   that complex delegation structures impose limitations on blame-takers'
   use of blame avoidance strategies, and that sequential presentational
   management becomes less useful over time. The article uses media content
   analysis to study blame games during a major crisis of the public
   transport system in Berlin, Germany.},

Abstract = {A growing literature suggests social democratic policies, as exemplified
   by the welfare state and active labour market policies, promote higher
   levels of life satisfaction compared to the neoliberal agenda of
   austerity, smaller government and more `flexible' labour markets. In
   this article, this inquiry is extended to low-income countries. A
   theoretical argument is developed for why labour market regulation (LMR)
   (rather than social welfare spending or the general size of government)
   is a more appropriate locus of attention outside of the industrial
   democracies. The relationship between LMR and several measures of
   well-being is then empirically evaluated, finding robust evidence that
   people live more satisfying lives in countries that more stringently
   regulate their labour market. Moreover, it is found that positive
   benefits of LMR on well-being are the largest among individuals with
   lower incomes. The implications for public policy and the study of human
   well-being are discussed.},

Abstract = {This paper introduces a dynamic perspective on how (personal) political
   ideology shapes reactions to immigration policies at the mass level.
   Greater ethnic diversity and growing calls for multiculturalism
   represent a disproportionately greater challenge to rightists because
   they value conformity, tradition, and stability more than leftists.
   Consequently, we hypothesize that the impact of political ideology on
   opposition to immigration has become stronger over time. Analyses show
   that: (a) leftists were less opposed to immigration than rightists in
   both 2002 and 2014, and (b) rightists have become more opposed to
   immigration in the time between 2002 and 2014, whereas leftists'
   reactions remained stable across this period. We tested our motivated
   reasoning hypothesis in a repeated cross-sectional (fixed effects
   regression) analysis of individual-level data from 18 countries (N=
   55,367). The individual-level data on political ideology and immigration
   policy preferences is from the European Social Survey data sets fielded
   in 2002 and 2014.},

Abstract = {Consociationalism starts with the assumption that in divided societies
   there are multiple groups with reasonable claims which leads to the
   development of group sensitive mechanisms for political representation.
   While consociations are put in place to ensure the participation of
   groups whose past disenfranchisement from (equal) political
   representation resulted in violence, their disregard for individuals and
   identities of other, non-dominant groups is comparable to the impact of
   liberal democratic governments on minority groups. Both the approach
   observed in consociational practice and the liberal democratic approach
   of accommodating members of minority groups result from a preference for
   the political accommodation of majority group identities. Both
   approaches, I argue, result in the neglect of the input of minority and
   non-dominant groups. This effect is, principally, a result of the lack
   of guaranteed representation afforded to their group identities and is
   exacerbated by the representation of majority interests which is
   aggregated from individual-level participation.},

Abstract = {Individuals in Ireland are among the most enthusiastic supporters of
   European integration since European Union (EU) accession in 1973, and
   are often labelled `good Europeans with a pro-integrationist attitude'.
   The 2008 financial crisis is regarded as a turning point in Ireland's
   relationship with the EU as a result of the economic downturn and the
   widening of economic disparities experienced by individuals. Meanwhile,
   Brexit poses significant and specific challenges to Ireland and has the
   capacity to impact Irish attitudes towards the EU. Using a combination
   of Standard Eurobarometer data from 2007 to 2018 and a variety of
   opinion polling data, this paper examines how the economic crisis and
   Brexit have shaped Irish attitudes towards the EU.},

Abstract = {We argue that support for parties of the radical right and left can
   usefully be understood as a problem of social integration-an approach
   that brings together economic and cultural explanations for populism.
   With comparative survey data, we assess whether support for parties of
   the radical right and left is associated with feelings of social
   marginalization. We find that people who feel more socially
   marginal-because they lack strong attachment to the normative order,
   social engagement, or a sense of social respect-are more likely to be
   alienated from mainstream politics and to support radical parties. We
   also find an association between indicators for recent economic and
   cultural developments often said to affect social status and feelings of
   social marginalization, especially among people with low incomes or
   educational attainment. We conclude that problems of social integration
   and subjective social status deserve more attention from scholars of
   comparative political behavior.},

Abstract = {Policy feedbacks take place when public policies change mass
   participation and mobilize key constituencies. This can influence future
   rounds of policymaking and solidify government programs. We explore
   policy feedback in the context of a particularistic policy targeted to a
   specific electoral constituency: agricultural producers receiving
   payments from the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA). We exploit a
   novel dataset of: (1) payments distributed to producers by the USDA; and
   (2) participation in elections for the Farm Service Agency county
   committees that help administer these payments. The data are novel in
   that we rely on individual-level administrative histories of actual
   payments made by the USDA as well as documented forms of participation
   such as voting in elections and running for office. We find that
   receiving agricultural payments is associated with a 20\% increase in
   the probability of voting in county elections, a 34\% increase in the
   probability of running for office, and a 25\% increase in the
   probability of winning office.},

Abstract = {This article examines the adverse impact of clientelist relations
   between political parties and campaign donors on parties' relations with
   voters. Clientelism is generally conceptualized as a vertical, pyramid
   structure, whereby resources are distributed from politicians to voters
   at the base through brokers or programmatic politics. As Gherghina and
   Volintiru(1)contend, what is often overlooked is that in tandem with
   this vertical relationship with voters there is a complementary
   horizontal relationship with party donors. Parties with a weak
   organizational base focus on relations with party donors, such as
   private contractors, at the expense of their relationship with voters.
   Drawing on fieldwork conducted during East Timor's 2017 parliamentary
   elections, I engage with Gherghina and Volintiru's framework to argue
   that a bi-dimensional approach is integral to both understanding
   electoral outcomes and economic trajectories in developing country
   contexts. In East Timor, despite a decade of rampant patronage politics,
   the incumbent CNRT party's prioritization of their relationship with
   party donors cost them the election. In turn, this focus on party donors
   has distorted policy and public spending priorities, with severe
   implications for future development.},

Abstract = {Mass atrocity case studies routinely refer to networks of perpetrators
   (and of victims and bystanders) but little formal work is available to
   pinpoint characteristics of atrocity committing networks and how they
   operate. For example, how do atrocity ideas spread throughout a
   population, and how may such diffusion be thwarted? How does one explain
   the scaling up from few perpetrators to mass participation by thousands
   of perpetrators? Why do some communities in a given society appear
   nearly immune to participation whereas others participate en masse? We
   introduce three formal illustrative models to derive insights into these
   questions and other issues related to the onset, spread, and possible
   prevention of mass atrocities. The models demonstrate that formal
   networking theory can provide compelling insights into a number of
   puzzles that the genocide literature grapples with.},

Abstract = {This article considers the impact of the 2008-10 financial crisis and
   the UK's 2016 Brexit decision as a `dual crisis' which impacted
   significantly on Irish foreign policy over the past decade. It argues
   that though Ireland's foreign policy has remained remarkably consistent
   over time, the `dual crisis' placed considerable pressure on state
   capacity and institutional resources. Ireland's financial implosion
   carried with it potentially catastrophic consequences for the Eurozone
   and thus successive governments placed a particular priority on
   restoring Ireland's tarnished reputation within the European Union. At
   the same time, Irish foreign policy was `rebooted' to take on a more
   muscular promotion of Irish economic interests across the globe. Brexit
   constituted an existential threat to the island of Ireland, and, in
   particular the peace process marked by the 1998 Good Friday Agreement.
   The Brexit crisis set in train a determined effort by Irish
   policy-makers to both confirm the EU as Ireland's `geopolitical centre
   of gravity' and re-position the country within the Union, as the need
   for new allies and coalition partners became evident following the
   United Kingdom's planned departure.},

Abstract = {This article reconstructs a set of widely disseminated
   nineteenth-century ideas about the relationship between diversity and
   democracy and details how these informed state-building and political
   action. An emerging argument in nineteenth-century discourse held that
   representative governments in diverse societies would degenerate into
   anarchy without ``amalgamation,{''} extermination, expulsion, or
   enslavement: Only in societies where there was sympathy across the
   entire community, constantly renewed through intercourse among social
   equals, could free institutions be sustained. This argument gave support
   for state-builders to regulate diversity either through an imperial
   politics of ``moving people{''} or by interposing the state in intimate
   encounters of sexual and social intercourse. The intimate and imperial
   dimensions of state-building were thereby conceptually linked. This
   account helps explain important features of nineteenth-century politics,
   including the frequent criticism of abolitionists that by supporting
   racial civic or political equality they were encouraging ``racial
   amalgamation.{''} In responding to this charge, American antislavery
   discourse contributed to a distinction between political and social
   equality that would fundamentally shape state-building after the Civil
   War. The article shows scholars of American political development how
   our accounts might be revised by situating debates and developments
   within a transnational perspective.},

Abstract = {CFSP has traditionally been studied as a policy-making domain that is
   reserved to negotiations among formal representatives from the EU and
   its member states. In this article, we draw attention to the way in
   which the CFSP bureaucracy interacts with transnational actors from
   civil society. We conceptualize this relationship on the basis of three
   mechanisms: access to European policy-making in return for information,
   coalition building dynamics, and socialization processes. We illustrate
   the importance of these mechanisms for the EU's policy on the
   International Criminal Court (ICC). Specifically, we argue that NGOs
   have gained routine access to the COJUR-ICC working group, where they
   have obtained a prominent status as experts, participating in
   information exchange coalition building dynamics. This has also
   translated into NGO influence on important aspects of the EU's foreign
   policy towards the ICC.},

Abstract = {Experts code latent quantities for many influential political science
   datasets. Although scholars are aware of the importance of accounting
   for variation in expert reliability when aggregating such data, they
   have not systematically explored either the factors affecting expert
   reliability or the degree to which these factors influence estimates of
   latent concepts. Here we provide a template for examining potential
   correlates of expert reliability, using coder-level data for six
   randomly selected variables from a cross-national panel dataset. We
   aggregate these data with an ordinal item response theory model that
   parameterizes expert reliability, and regress the resulting reliability
   estimates on both expert demographic characteristics and measures of
   their coding behavior. We find little evidence of a consistent
   substantial relationship between most expert characteristics and
   reliability, and these null results extend to potentially problematic
   sources of bias in estimates, such as gender. The exceptions to these
   results are intuitive, and provide baseline guidance for expert
   recruitment and retention in future expert coding projects: attentive
   and confident experts who have contextual knowledge tend to be more
   reliable. Taken as a whole, these findings reinforce arguments that item
   response theory models are a relatively safe method for aggregating
   expert-coded data.},

Title = {LIBERIA: Civil War and the Complications SALWs Proliferation},
Journal = {CONFLICT STUDIES QUARTERLY},
Year = {2019},
Number = {29},
Pages = {43-61},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {This paper examines the complications of SALWs in the context of armed
   conflict with particular reference to the Liberian civil war. Using an
   exploratory analysis that relied on documentary data, as complemented by
   insights from Key Informant Interview (KII), the paper observed that the
   incidence of SALWs proliferation was one of the factors that complicated
   the Liberian crisis. The paper posits that the complications of SALWs
   proliferation in Liberia during and after the National crisis
   (1989-2003) posed a threat to the country's national security. The
   threat is evident in the collateral impact of armed violence that
   characterized the Liberian crisis as well as the wave of armed
   criminality that has punctuated the country's history in the aftermath
   of the crisis. In the light of its dire effects vis-a-vis sustainable
   peace, security and stability, this paper submit that SALWs
   proliferation has posed a threat to Liberian national security both in
   the conflict and post-conflict eras.},

Title = {Life in the nuclear age: Classical realism, critical theory and the
   technopolitics of the nuclear condition},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL THEORY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {15},
Number = {3, SI},
Pages = {279-296},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Classical realist thought provides a diagnosis of the significance
   nuclear weapons that calls into question the very possibility of
   politics in the nuclear age. While sharing similarities with this
   outlook, critical theoretic reflections suggest a more expansive
   consideration of the nuclear condition as underpinned by combinations of
   dystopian fears of nuclear destruction and utopian visions of nuclear
   futures. Most prominently Herbert Marcuse's critical theory intimates an
   understanding of the nuclear condition as one that is rendered tolerable
   so long as nuclear technologies are associated with and related to
   innovation, progress and modernity. The study of the technopolitics of
   the nuclear condition might thus look not only to classical realists'
   concern with `Death in the Nuclear Age' but also incorporate
   corresponding critical awareness of claims to the life-sustaining
   applications of nuclear technologies in areas such as energy production,
   industry and medicine. Applying an `aporetic' form of immanent critique,
   and to exemplify how the international politics of the nuclear age has
   often been predicated on efforts to distinguish and relate different
   kinds of nuclear technologies, the article revisits the United
   States-led post-war vision of `Atoms for Peace' and compares it to the
   International Atomic Energy Agency's contemporary `How the Atom Benefits
   Life' campaign.},

Abstract = {This article evaluates the psychological pathways between war exposure
   and the formation of political tolerance in Sri Lanka after the civil
   war between 1983 and 2009. To date, little is known in the political
   science literature about the interplay between war experiences, their
   psychological footprints, and the formation of political tolerance.
   Using survey data from 2016, we are able to evaluate the psychological
   consequences of war experiences, differentiating between the issues of
   both war-related distress and posttraumatic growth. Our results based on
   path models reveal that war exposure does not uniformly damage political
   tolerance: experiences of posttraumatic growth, a highly discussed
   phenomenon, are able to increase an individual's probability of granting
   basic civil liberties to an opposing group.},

Abstract = {This study examines new open-ended and closed-ended survey responses
   among white liberals and conservatives in the US to assess the role they
   think their racial group membership plays in how they think about
   politics. It then uses insights from those responses to develop and test
   a new measure designed to capture how white identity operates
   politically. To date, much political science research on white racial
   identity documents the links between white identity and right-leaning
   candidate and policy preferences. Much less is known about the role of
   whiteness on the left. The analysis here shows that even though white
   liberals talk about anti-racism, privilege, and institutional racism
   when asked about race and politics and say that they have become more
   aware of their race in recent years, they generally do not view their
   own whiteness as a politically salient identity. The results indicate
   that it is important for scholars to use measures that distinguish
   between whites who appear ``woke{''} but do not act on their
   ``wokeness{''} from whites for whom an awareness of privilege motivates
   them toward an anti-racist agenda.},

Abstract = {It is well recognized how the modern social sciences, particularly in
   the United States, fed off and contributed to a nuclear state associated
   with the military-industrial complex. But it is less known that the
   thermonuclear revolution also constituted a productive moment for
   critical theories of (nuclear) techno-politics. In this article, we
   recover a strand of the latter by focusing on Gunther Anders
   (1902-1992), a German philosopher of technology for whom thermonuclear
   weapons symbolized the self-destructive capacity embedded in a
   disenchanted modernity. We stress the techno-political dimensions of
   Anders' philosophy by approaching it through his concept and metaphor of
   metabolism. Anders sought to update Marxist thinking to the age of
   technology to reawaken his readers to the realities and power dynamics
   of the nuclear condition and the ways in which these were consistently
   obscured. He pondered the grotesque human ability to live with a
   monstrous and suicidal weapon, while highlighting the dynamics of
   extraction and consumption that characterized both modern `mass' society
   and nuclear techno-politics. Anders' quest for emancipation focused on a
   nurturing of the imagination of modern human beings. We stress the
   critical, global and activist orientation of his analysis and discuss
   its merits and contemporary relevance.},

Abstract = {This paper seeks to identify factors that may lie behind the tendency
   for parliamentary governments to form primarily from one side of the
   left-right spectrum and to adopt non-centrist policy positions. Because
   of measurement limitations as well as the inherent complexity of the
   processes involved, this exploration is undertaken through simulation
   experiments. The new software created for these experiments allows the
   potential impact of a wide variety of factors, including voter and party
   motivations and distributions, policy space dimensionality, and
   constraints on government formation, to be assessed. Although the
   results cannot tell us what fosters non-centrism in the real world, they
   do reveal some factors that appear to be conducive to that end and thus
   serve as a guide to further research on this neglected topic.},

Abstract = {To what extent can you engage in political activity in the modern age
   without Internet access? The growing dependence on Internet access to
   fulfill basic civil functions is threatened by increasing personal and
   societal cyber vulnerability. In this article, we explore the extent to
   which citizens are able, or unable, to engage in specific political
   activities in the absence of Internet connectivity. To concretize the
   subject, we test how Internet deprivation affects the ability to realize
   three basic elements of political participation: political expression,
   civic association, and access to information. To measure this, we
   develop a new experimental methodology that tests people's ability to
   complete tasks related to each function under simulated treatments of
   Internet access or deprivation. This empirical methodology offers a new
   framework through which to quantify the realization of social tasks
   under experimental conditions. Early results suggest that the absence of
   Internet access significantly reduces task completion for activities
   related to political expression and political association and
   conditionally reduces task completion for practices associated with
   freedom of information. Having substantiated this empirical framework,
   we encourage its application to additional forms of political activity.},

Abstract = {No matter whether they adhere to a left-wing or right-wing political
   ideology, the evolution of a radical activist group shares a common
   trajectory. As such, it is possible to explore the rise and fall of a
   far-left organisation like the Weathermen in order to better understand
   the development of the alt-right, and to devise strategies to combat
   extremism in a contemporary context. By examining the role of identity
   politics in fermenting a radical socio-political agenda, as well as the
   tactics that contribute to the formation of a groupthink mentality, it
   is made clear that the very strategies of indoctrination and direct
   action that solidify a radical base are the very same as those that work
   to divide such groups and isolate them from mainstream socio-political
   discourse.},

Abstract = {In this article I analyze, on the basis of my personal experience, the
   discontents of contemporary Turkish politics; more specifically,
   neoliberal conservative hegemony, and its three manifestations:
   stability of instability; a religio-conservative gender regime; and
   anti-intellectualism. I illustrate how these manifestations are
   intertwined in the process of identity construction: how an individual's
   identity as a citizen, as a woman, as an academic is being constantly
   constructed/de-constructed/reconstructed in a manner integral to the
   social and political context. The contribution of this article is
   threefold: it shows how personal experiences are a legitimate source of
   knowledge; it enables an understanding of how political identities are
   in a constant state of making; it challenges dominant conceptions of
   politics and the political through challenging binaries such as
   individual/social, personal/political, and emotional/rational.},

Title = {Think Twice before Jumping on the Bandwagon: Clarifying Concepts in
   Research on the Bandwagon Effect},
Journal = {POLITICAL STUDIES REVIEW},

Abstract = {The potential influence of perceived popularity of political parties or
   candidates on individual vote choice is most commonly studied in terms
   of a `bandwagon effect'. However, there is confusion over exactly what
   the bandwagon effect is. In this article, I seek to remedy this
   confusion by providing a clear definition and typology of bandwagon
   effects, grounded in a review which reappraises existing scholarship. I
   argue that the bandwagon effect is a distinct social phenomenon
   involving an individual-level change in vote choice or turnout decision
   towards a more or increasingly popular candidate or party, motivated
   initially by this popularity. I then break this down employing a
   typology which draws on distinctions made in the literature between
   static and dynamic, and conversion and mobilisation effects. This
   conception of the bandwagon effect leaves it open to the operation of a
   variety of possible underlying processes. Scholars should apply such
   clear concepts as are proposed here in bandwagon research, to situate
   and clarify their contributions theoretically and offer a more nuanced
   understanding of whether, how and why bandwagon effects occur across
   different political contexts.},

Abstract = {Despite the European Union?s prior success promoting marketization and
   democracy in post-communist countries, Bosnia and Herzegovina may prove
   a unique challenge due to the incentives embedded in its governance
   structure. This article examines how the EU shifted strategy in response
   to these challenges through the example of BiH?s dairy industry. By
   de-emphasizing explicit leverage and instead promoting increased
   institutional capacity in discrete sectors, the EU sought to inculcate
   norms of professionalism and create more coherent top-to-bottom state
   service provision, which over time could help reduce resistance to the
   more fundamental constitutional changes that likely will be necessary
   for EU membership.},

Abstract = {Why are some advocacy group populations biased towards business interest
   representatives? In this paper, we assess an underexplored source of
   variation in advocacy populations, namely the governance level at which
   advocacy populations are located. More precisely, we analyse whether
   national advocacy group populations are more likely to contain
   relatively large proportions of business interest associations compared
   to transnational advocacy group populations. We examine three competing
   hypotheses: (1) biases are stronger at the national level than the
   global level, (2) biases are more pronounced at the global level than
   the national level and (3) no differences emerge in business
   mobilization across the national and transnational levels. We test our
   hypotheses based on a novel dataset of national, European Union (EU) and
   global advocacy group populations. Our results indicate that the global
   level is different from the EU and national levels, in that it contains
   relatively low proportions of business interest representatives.},

Abstract = {The Eastern Mediterranean region has recently emerged as one of the
   pivotal foci of international affairs due to its considerable natural
   gas reserves. The region has become a point of intersection for
   surrounding countries and external actors, as well as major energy
   market players. The main challenge associated with Eastern Mediterranean
   natural gas is the position of the reserves in the Mediterranean Sea and
   the resulting ownership problem among its littoral states, while the de
   facto division of and disputes over, the island of Cyprus is closely
   connected to the issue. Hence, the debates involve two key questions:
   (1) which countries have ownership rights, and (2) which countries will
   be the natural gas transit countries. This article examines the
   standpoints of Turkey and the other actors involved in the game in the
   Eastern Mediterranean. The positions are presented with a focus on how
   different actors interpret current developments, perceive threats, and
   formulate their reactions.},

Title = {Cities \& International Policy Diffusion: The Case of Tokyo},
Journal = {BALTIC JOURNAL OF EUROPEAN STUDIES},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {9},
Number = {2},
Pages = {61-74},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {In an increasingly globalised world, today's international challenges
   such as climate change transcend national boundaries and require
   multi-level governance responses. Cities, in particular, stand out as an
   essential governing unit with huge potentials in resolving some of the
   21st century's most pressing concerns. The recent explosion of the
   phenomenon of city-networks reflects intensifying city-to-city
   interactions in addressing global environmental issues. This article
   examines the case of Tokyo in addressing challenges posed by climate
   change. Examining the origin, development, and diffision of Tokyos
   climate change policy, the cap-and-trade scheme was found to have first
   diffused from Europe to Tokyo, adjusted to adapt to the local context,
   then further diffused to other Asian cities. Study of Tokyos experience
   demonstrates that policy formation does not always follow a centralized,
   top-down, command-and-control approach. This findings challenge
   conventional realist conception which emphasises the dominance of
   central authorities and sovereign states in global policy formation.
   Under the framework of global governance, this article argues that
   cities are important sites of policy experimentation and innovation, and
   that the case of Tokyo demonstrates the potential of cross-country
   policy diffusion.},

Journal = {AMERICAN POLITICS RESEARCH},

Volume = {47},
Number = {5},

Abstract = {We model attitudes about Congress as structured by perceptions of
   campaign finance. Attitudes about unlimited corporate and union spending
   are modeled as structured by knowledge about Congress. We find people
   with more factual knowledge of Congress were more likely to view
   unlimited independent corporate and union spending as having improper
   influence. We also found that people made some distinctions about
   sources of campaign finance. Knowledgeable people viewed unlimited
   independent expenditures as improper influence, but were less likely to
   perceive direct contributions from individuals to candidates as corrupt.
   When attitudes about Congress are estimated as a function of perceptions
   about financier influence, we find that perceptions about unlimited
   independent spending predicted negative views of representation and
   Congress, whereas perceptions of limited individual donations did not.
   People who knew the most about Congress were substantially more likely
   to find unlimited independent spending-the sort allowed by Citizens
   United-to be troubling.},

Abstract = {According to the thesis of the Eurosceptics, the so-called ``democratic
   deficit{''} that rests on the European Union does not depend on any
   construction errors, but on the absence of a European demos, that is of
   a culturally integrated homogeneous political community. To the present
   perspective, an alternative can be opposed. The hypothesis to be
   advanced on this matter is that, on the one hand, supranational forms of
   solidarity can find their roots in a context that presents features
   different from the one of the State space. On the other, they can derive
   from socio-cultural resources that are born and feed on both shared
   practices over time and future expectations.},

Abstract = {This paper identifies conditions of violent escalation related to
   conflicts about large infrastructure projects. It combines different
   explanations of protest and social movement research. A
   macro-qualitative comparative analysis with fuzzy-set qualitative
   comparative analysis of 27 conflict constellations of large
   infrastructure projects in Germany provides empirical evidence. Violent
   escalation results from a combination of the potential for escalation
   and the existence of a trigger. Fundamental technology conflicts or
   ideologized groups represent potentials for escalation. Triggers are
   police violence and the construction start. Beside of avoiding police
   violence, the potential for escalation and the timing of the
   construction start should be taken into account by organizing political
   processes for minimizing escalation.},

Title = {Poststructuralist discourse theory as an independent paradigm for
   studying institutions: Towards a new definition of `discursive
   construction' in institutional analysis},

Abstract = {Poststructuralist discourse theory (DT) is enjoying increasing
   recognition for its potential to contribute to the study of
   institutional change and continuity. Yet the most fruitful approach to
   realizing this potential has hitherto not been found. The main
   proposition so far has been to operationalize DT's insights and concepts
   by adopting them into the framework of discursive institutionalism (DI).
   However, an ongoing debate about the compatibility of the ontologies
   underlying DT and DI has cast doubts over whether such a combination is
   theoretically feasible. The critical literature review in the first part
   of this article indeed finds insurmountable ontological differences
   between the discourse-theoretical and the discursive-institutionalist
   traditions, as their clashing notions of what is understood as a
   `discourse' result in diverging views on power, agency, and
   subjectivity. Instead of merging DT into DI, I suggest to empower the
   former as a self-sufficient paradigm for institutional analysis. To
   achieve this, the second part of this article re-articulates the `logics
   framework' proposed by Jason Glynos and David Howarth (2007) into a
   middle-range theory for the study of institutionalization and
   politicization in a discourse-theoretical fashion. The purpose of this
   re-articulation is to dispel various arguments against the viability of
   an autonomous poststructuralist approach to institutions.},

Abstract = {In this paper, I introduce a new dataset of individual-level
   professional background data for state legislators in 98 chambers from
   1993 to 2012. Using this data, I examine trends in the professional
   backgrounds of state legislators over the period of the study, with
   attention to institutional factors such as professionalism and
   legislative turnover and individual-level factors such as political
   party and gender. In addition, I briefly illustrate three applications
   of the data. First, I analyze the extent to which district-level
   demographic and political factors affect the probability that a district
   will elect a legislator from certain backgrounds. Second, I examine the
   relationship between occupational background and ideology, identifying
   the backgrounds that identify moderate and extreme members in each
   party. Third, I contrast the occupational backgrounds of legislators who
   hold leadership positions with the membership at large. Taken together,
   these examples speak to some of the ways in which the composition of
   state legislatures can reveal interesting and relevant information
   underlying legislative behavior and institutions.},

Abstract = {Despite extensive research on Eurosceptic challenger parties, our
   knowledge of their influence on political opposition has so far been
   sparse. In this article we make an in-depth assessment of parliamentary
   EU opposition, based on 4,264 statements made by national
   parliamentarians in the European Affairs Committees (EACs) of Denmark
   and Sweden. Our analysis shows that the presence of Eurosceptic
   challenger parties in the national parliamentary arena impacts patterns
   and practices of EU opposition significantly. A greater presence of
   `hard' Eurosceptic parties in parliament is associated with more
   opposition in EU politics. These parties deliver a vast majority of the
   polity-oriented opposition towards the EU and present more policy
   alternatives than mainstream parties. The findings presented have
   implications for our understanding of national parliamentary EU
   opposition as well as for the assessment of the impact of Eurosceptic
   challenger parties on the process of European integration.},

Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Presidents of the Republic are crucial actors in both presidential and
   semi-presidential regimes. Despite the fact that these two systems
   represent the majority of all the world's political systems, the focus
   on the head of state has only relatively recently been covered
   comparatively and systematically. Although big gaps still persist in
   relation to many aspects of `presidential power', advances have been
   made, and the `presidential' world has been analysed with more
   sophisticated tools and concepts. However, the `presidential party'
   remains relatively understudied at both the theoretical and the
   empirical levels. The `party of the president' is the key political
   actor that affects presidential activity during his or her mandate. The
   article aims to present a theoretical framework and a potential
   guideline for comparative studies. Starting from a critical review of
   Shugart and Carey's seminal book, I propose a conceptualisation of the
   presidential party and the theoretical possible effects of it on the
   legislature, which might be useful for further empirical analysis.},

Abstract = {This article traces some of the rhetoric flowing from Jeremy Corbyn's
   leadership of the Labour Party to the New Left, a political and
   intellectual movement in the UK which rose up to challenge the
   Stalinisation of socialism. These New Left lineages appear most clearly
   in the value denoted by both movements toward extra-parliamentary
   politics. Indeed, the work of the New Left intellectual Ralph Miliband
   considers this factor to be a criterion by which we can assess the
   extent to which Corbyn's party has surpassed the traditional `Labourist'
   mould. By going beyond the movement's early rhetoric, I show that it
   hasn't. Instead, I present evidence that Corbyn's Labour is a deeply
   social democratic one. The article offers an explanation for this
   assessment based on comparison of the contexts from which both the New
   Left and Corbynism emerged, and outlines an analytical path for future
   scholarship that emphasises continuity as well as change, and wards
   against ideological bias.},

Title = {Women's Authority in Patriarchal Social Movements: The Case of Female
   Salafi Preachers},

Abstract = {How do women gain authority in the public sphere, especially in contexts
   where patriarchal norms are prevalent? I argue that the leaders of
   patriarchal social movements face pragmatic incentives to expand women's
   authority roles when seeking new movement members. Women authorities
   help patriarchal movements by making persuasive, identity-based
   arguments in favor of patriarchy that men cannot, and by reaching new
   audiences that men cannot. I support this argument by examining the rise
   of online female preachers in the Islamist Salafi movement, using
   interviews, Twitter analysis, and automated text analysis of 21,000
   texts by 172 men and 43 women on the Salafi-oriented website saaid.net.
   To show the theory's generality, I also apply it to the contemporary
   white nationalist movement in the United States. The findings illustrate
   how movements that aggressively enforce traditional gender roles for
   participants can nevertheless increase female authority for pragmatic
   political reasons.},

Abstract = {Researchers need to select high-quality research designs and communicate
   those designs clearly to readers. Both tasks are difficult. We provide a
   framework for formally ``declaring{''} the analytically relevant
   features of a research design in a demonstrably complete manner, with
   applications to qualitative, quantitative, and mixed methods research.
   The approach to design declaration we describe requires defining a model
   of the world (M), an inquiry (I), a data strategy (D), and an answer
   strategy (A). Declaration of these features in code provides sufficient
   information for researchers and readers to use Monte Carlo techniques to
   diagnose properties such as power, bias, accuracy of qualitative causal
   inferences, and other ``diagnosands.{''} Ex ante declarations can be
   used to improve designs and facilitate preregistration, analysis, and
   reconciliation of intended and actual analyses. Ex post declarations are
   useful for describing, sharing, reanalyzing, and critiquing existing
   designs. We provide open-source software, DeclareDesign, to implement
   the proposed approach.},

Abstract = {How did Edinburgh become `festival city'? Despite appearances, it was
   not always so, and it acquired the accolade by happenstance; in the view
   of one observer, a `strange amalgam of cultural banditry, civic
   enterprise and idealism'. The official Festival's survival was down to
   the City Council, and it was funded almost entirely by public bodies.
   This was the central structure around which The Fringe developed, and
   The Traverse prospered, along with smaller festivals and events to
   become Festival City. The story sheds considerable light on how
   Edinburgh `works', its strengths and weaknesses combined.},

Title = {Evaluating the President on Your Priorities: Issue Priorities, Policy
   Performance, and Presidential Approval, 1981-2016},
Journal = {PRESIDENTIAL STUDIES QUARTERLY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {49},
Number = {4},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {This article builds on the satisficing and attribution theories to
   propose a model of presidential approval where issue priorities moderate
   the association between presidents' policy performance evaluations and
   overall approval. The data include aggregate time-series and
   cross-sectional individual-level data of presidential approval,
   presidential performance evaluations, and issue priorities from Reagan
   to Obama. The results demonstrate that people give more weight to the
   issues they prioritize, and therefore their evaluation of the
   president's performance on those issues matters more in their overall
   assessment of the president. The impact of issue priorities on approval
   varies by topic but is not further moderated by party affiliation. The
   results advance our understanding of the individual determinants of
   presidential approval and the role that issue priorities play in public
   opinion.},

Abstract = {Using data on the content of debate associated with votes in the UK
   House of Commons from 1992-2015, this article examines how government
   party MPs employ language in legislative speech when they vote against
   the party line. We find a robust statistical association between dissent
   on votes and the use of first-person pronouns, simpler language, and
   giving longer speeches. Using a random forest algorithm for
   classification, we find that these language covariates are predictive of
   rebellion. The use of simpler, first-person language has implications
   for political representation and offers new insight into how MPs use
   votes to distinguish themselves from their party, perhaps reflecting
   attempts to connect with constituents.},

Abstract = {Over the last decade, Community Policing (CP) secured a central place in
   Brazilian public security policy, challenging traditional policing
   modalities known more for their lethal violence than their efficacy. But
   as the CP model moved from wealthy societies to the Brazilian favela
   (urban slum), it faced far greater challenges. Tasked with displacing
   the deeply rooted authority of drug gangs, it sought to extend state
   authority territorially, as well as to curb criminal violence.
   Paradoxically, it succeeded at the latter without achieving the former.
   Drawing on evidence from the Rio de Janeiro's Pacifying Police Units and
   Bahia's Community Security Bases, this study asks how Brazil's CP
   programs achieved their goals of reducing violence without displacing
   criminal authority. I argue that a common interest among police and
   locally embedded drug gangs in limiting violence led to tacit
   arrangements between them to share authority as a condition of peace.

Abstract = {In an attempt to pay attention to the growing trend of terrorism and
   insurgent conflicts in Africa, this article examines the involvement of
   women as agents of terror. The prevailing narration of armed conflicts
   including terrorism and insurgency in Africa and across the world are
   largely masculine. In this framework, women are only recognised as
   victims in a series of campaigns of terror engineered by men. However,
   the enduring involvement of women and young girls as combatants,
   (suicide) bombers, spies and bates, recruiters, mobilisers, motivators,
   strategists, camerawomen and media crew in operations, procurers and
   suppliers (including transporters and porters) of arms, ammunitions,
   foods and messages to insurgents among other domestic services like sex,
   cooking, cleaning and property maintenance in camps comes to mind.
   Drawing from the pull of experience in Africa and elsewhere, this study
   interrogates the motivations and patterns of women involvement in
   terrorism and insurgency, and associated organisational dynamics.},

Abstract = {This article takes stock of German foreign policy during Angela Merkel's
   third term in office (2013-17). It argues that the longer-term
   significance of Germany's foreign policy during this period is twofold.
   First, the Merkel government was confronted with multiple European and
   international crises which worked as a magnifying glass for the growing
   international expectations on Germany to become more actively engaged on
   the international stage. Second, the tenure of the Grand Coalition saw a
   significant shift in the German domestic foreign policy discourse that
   was marked by a concerted effort of leading decision-makers to make the
   case for Germany to accept greater international responsibilities. This
   emerging consensus among foreign policy elites expresses a changed
   self-conception of German foreign policy which, however, continues to be
   viewed with scepticism in the broader public. Informed by such a broad
   two-level perspective that focuses on the interplay between
   international and domestic expectations on German foreign policy, the
   article explores the record of the Grand Coalition in the main
   international crises it had to engage with. It suggests that the Merkel
   government was better able to live up to its own aspirations in
   two-level contexts which left it with greater domestic room for
   manoeuvre.},

Abstract = {Does a Constitution impose obligations on those generations that follow
   the one that approved it? Should each generation pass its own
   Constitution? These questions were discussed by the French National
   Assembly during the elaboration of both the Declaration des Droits de
   l'Homme et du Citoyen and the 1791 Constitution. Some precedents can be
   found in both English political thought and in the American Revolution.
   In fact, the core of the debate was the same in those countries: the
   opposition between an historical Constitution (which was inherited by
   each generation, unable to create a new one) and a formal Constitution
   (which could be created as the will of the people). But among French
   revolutionaries the debate was more intense, due to the theory of
   ``constituent power{''}. The dilemma was whether current constituent
   power could force future generations to periodically renew the
   Constitution? In other words, could that power prevent the current
   generation (that is, the ``living sovereign{''}) from changing the
   Constitution until a certain future deadline?},

   Reflection on the Colombian Case},
Journal = {DESAFIOS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {31},
Number = {2},
Pages = {133-167},
Month = {JUL-DEC},
Abstract = {The article proposes a reflection regarding two main concepts,
   `high-risk activism' and `emotions', in order to study the relevance of
   the latter in social mobilization and particularly in high risk
   activism. With the Colombian case as a starting point, it provides a new
   definition of the notion of risk, comparing it to its traditional uses
   in the literature. Subsequently, it focuses on case studies on the
   relation between high risk and emotions, in order to understand which
   ones emerge or are expressed in a risky environment. The Colombian case
   serves as evidence for the difficulty of defining risk, which is not
   always the result of radical action, thus deviating from the traditional
   concept.},

Abstract = {El Salvador's FMLN is an oft-cited example of a rebel movement which
   successfully embraced electoral democracy. This article examines the
   ideological dimensions of this transformation. In the course of the
   Salvadoran peace process, the FMLN substantially overhauled its
   ideological orientation and associated modes of engagement with the
   state and the broader political system. Moderation unfolded in four
   subsequent stages: the resignification of revolution as a process of
   reform, the FMLN's rebel-to-party adaptation, the electoral
   consolidation of the FMLN, and the FMLN as the party in government. Over
   the years, while electoral politics invited public moderation, Leninist
   dogma continued to dominate internal party politics. This article finds
   that the post-war FMLN has employed seemingly contradictory ideological
   repertoires in parallel. This ambivalence, strongly rooted in the war,
   has facilitated the FMLN's electoral ascendency. It has also strained
   democratic consolidation in El Salvador.},

Abstract = {The Turnbull government presented Australia's fifth national
   multicultural policy statement in March 2017. This article analyses the
   policy statement and argues that it represents the most significant
   change to Australian multicultural policy in four decades. Among other
   things, it abandons the language of government responsiveness to
   cultural diversity that previously defined Australian multiculturalism.
   The 2017 policy amounts to a new form of post-multiculturalism-different
   from earlier conservative, neoliberal and centre-left versions-in that
   it seeks to `mainstream' multicultural policy on the grounds that
   Australian multiculturalism has succeeded in its intended task. While a
   mainstreaming strategy of this sort is, I argue, theoretically
   consistent with Australia's liberal nationalist approach to cultural
   diversity, the institutional and attitudinal conditions that it
   presupposes are yet to be fully realised in Australia. More
   multicultural work needs to be done before this kind of
   post-multiculturalist approach is practicable.},

Abstract = {The separation-of-powers literature has entertained the possibility of
   differentiating governmental functions at a conceptual,
   pre-institutional level, as a way of defining the separation of powers.
   However, it can be objected that attempts at differentiating functions
   at this level cannot escape a problem of arbitrariness. In this article,
   I develop an account of the separation of powers which addresses this
   problem. On my account, the legislative function is defined by the
   creation of validity claims, understood as claims making it a matter of
   normative common-knowledge that such and such normative attitudes hold
   for the interaction between agents. The executive-judicial function is
   defined by the specification of rights and other jural positions out of
   the validity claims. This account of the separation of powers has the
   double advantage that it works at a conceptual, pre-institutional level,
   and that it is able to distinguish between the functions in a
   non-arbitrary manner. In developing this account, I also consider its
   practical implications. I argue that the conceptual distinction between
   the legislative and the executive-judicial functions is expressive of
   rule-of-law values, and that this might render it a sufficient but not
   necessary condition for the institutional separation of powers.},

Abstract = {Education has consistently been found to be positively related to
   political participation, electoral turnout, civic engagement, political
   knowledge, and democratic attitudes and opinions. Previous research has,
   however, not sufficiently acknowledged the large existing between- and
   within-country variations in institutional quality when studying this
   relationship. This study asks the question: how do highly educated,
   well-informed, and critical citizens react to a political system with
   low-quality institutions; a system with high levels of corruption?
   Researchers have in recent years started to acknowledge corruption as a
   relevant factor in explaining democratic attitudes and behavior.
   However, how corruption interacts with individual characteristics in
   shaping political behavior is largely unexplored in the literature. This
   paper focuses on the interaction between corruption and education with
   regard to different political attitudes and democratic behavior. Using
   both individual- and country-level data from 31 democracies the results
   show that corruption thwarts many of the positive effects of education
   with regard to politics: The results indicate that when corruption is
   high, educated and politically sophisticated citizens are as likely as
   low-educated citizens to feel resignation with regard to formal
   political institutions. This, in turn, is likely to affect patterns of
   political participation among these citizens.},

Abstract = {The European Union has established the free movement of goods, which
   covers the parallel import of goods in the EU. However, the free
   movement of goods should not infringe on the rights of trade mark
   owners. In some cases, parallel importer needs not only to repackage but
   also to rebrand pharmaceutical products. ECJ has stated that rebranding
   is permissible if objective necessity to rebrand exists. But it is the
   national court that has to determine what objective necessity is. This
   paper analyses the decisions of EU Member States. In some cases,
   objective necessity has been determined on similar grounds. However, in
   other cases, a necessity to enter some part of the market has been
   evaluated differently in different Member States. The different
   evaluation of the necessity criterion could be treated as the
   infringement of uniform application of the free movement of goods in the
   EU.},

Journal = {POLITICAL BEHAVIOR},

Abstract = {The introduction and popularity of politically biased news sources
   represents a significant historical shift in the media environment, with
   important unexplored consequences. Evidence points to partisan
   segmentation in the contemporary news market, but while assumptions
   abound, the mechanism driving consumers to sort along party lines is
   unclear. I develop a framework for news choice based on perceptions of
   objectivity and credibility and report a test of its central mechanism
   using a nationally representative survey experiment. I find support for
   a congenial media effect, where news content from an unfamiliar source
   is seen as more credible and less biased when it is consistent with
   existing beliefs, while balanced news content may be dismissed as less
   credible and biased. Previous studies have examined how perceptions of
   bias in identical news content can change when it is attributed to
   different sources. In today's media world however, access to more news
   sources generally and the ease with which content from those sources can
   be shared makes it increasingly likely people will be exposed to news
   content from either unknown or potentially fake news sources. This study
   contributes to the literature by identifying the unique effect of
   message content on perceptions of news bias and source credibility,
   while holding source constant. Paradoxically, my findings indicate that
   political selective exposure may arise out of individuals' genuine
   desire for unbiased news.},

Abstract = {This article investigates empirically the net fiscal position of the
   working class in nine European countries for the 1995-2015 period. This
   is done through the estimation of the net social wage for wage and
   salary earners in those countries, characterized by different types of
   welfare states. The negative net social wage ratio in eight out of nine
   countries indicates that in advanced capitalism, the state budget
   redistributes income in such a way that the post-fiscal or true rate of
   exploitation is higher than the pre-fiscal or apparent one. Adverse
   economic conditions and ageing of the population have made the net
   social wage ratio less negative recently, while the accumulation of
   public debt and the increased obligations for interest payments on this
   public debt have acted in the opposite direction.},

Abstract = {Decades of research have established the direct influence of
   partisanship on voter perception of a host of real-world conditions.
   Even so, numerous factors have been found to moderate this ``partisan
   bias.{''} We examine one plausible moderator: the volume of perceptually
   relevant information that is available in the mass media. Both
   dissonance-theoretic and motivated-reasoning formulations of partisan
   bias in political perception suggest that the availability of
   perceptually relevant information may constrain perceptual bias. Yet
   this proposition has rarely been investigated systematically. This
   article investigates the moderation of partisan bias by informational
   conditions, focusing on the impact of economic news on economic
   perceptions during five Canadian general elections (1993-2006). Although
   the overall pattern is mixed, evidence suggests that bias reduction in
   response to information depends on the broader economic and political
   context.},

Abstract = {The article studies the administration of post-war memory in observing
   international negotiation processes devoted to the legacy of the past.
   The purpose of the article is to compare the failed Treaty of Friendship
   between France and Algeria with the Elysee Treaty between France and
   Germany. Why does closure seem impossible in one case and not in the
   other? The comparative analysis is based on two main kinds of data.
   First, a systematic corpus of official speeches allows for a description
   of the evolution of the leaders since the end of the hostilities.
   Second, a comprehensive gathering of narratives depicts the reactions of
   individuals directly affected by the violent past. Theaimof the article
   is not to draw causal relations in the strictest sense of the term. It
   is rather to illuminate the discrepancies, inconsistencies, and tensions
   that exist not only between national strategic narratives but alsoand
   above allwithin each national group. Rather than focusing exclusively on
   thepolitical uses of the past, the article underlines the long-term
   impact of emotions such as humiliation, anger, hatred, or sorrow on
   victims' descendants. Rather than reducing the notion of public
   administration to the mere implementation of a government policy, the
   article suggests to broaden the perspective and to consider a mix of
   policy areas, from foreign affairs and defense to youth and culture.},

Abstract = {Liberal, representative democracies are being dissed. Their citizens are
   increasingly discontent, disillusioned, and disgruntled with it and
   distrustful, despairing, and deprecating of it. Why this situation
   exists (and is likely to persist) and what might be its consequences
   provide the twin foci of this essay. It is argued that this widespread
   crisis of real-existing democracy' (RED) is the compound product of two
   converging trendsone endogenous to its practice and the other coming
   from its exogenous environment. The first is responsible for the growing
   discontent of its citizens with their representatives; the second is the
   result of the increasing anomie of its social structures. RED has gone
   through many crises in the past and there is no reason to despair about
   its futurealthough the present context has some especially menacing
   features. The article concludes with a brief discussion of the sort of
   reforms that might lead to a post-liberal' form of democracy.},

Abstract = {The Trump administration has waged a technological war against China due
   to the differences between China and the United States in political
   values and geopolitical pursuits, as well as their rivalry on regional
   and global arenas. The United States regards itself as being on the
   moral high ground in the existing international order and intends to
   force China to abandon its policies in high-tech industries and
   technology transfer from foreign enterprises, in order to maintain its
   global supremacy. With a zero-sum mentality, the Trump administration is
   trying to use the leverage of advanced science and technology to
   maximize benefits for the United States in trade with China. Its tech
   war attempts against China mainly include trade sanctions, investment
   control, export control, and restrictions on the exchange of
   technological personnel. These moves will further harm China-U.S.
   security relations as well as their science and technology cooperation
   and undermine the regional situation and global science and technology
   governance. In order to promote sustainable global development and
   strategic stability, both sides need to undertake more effective efforts
   to manage their strategic competition, build a more balanced and
   mutually beneficial relationship in high-tech industries, and expand the
   space for cooperation in the field of global science and technology
   governance.},

Pages = {1235-1255},

Abstract = {The article mainly seeks to explain the legislature's preferences in
   social welfare before and after democratization using South Korea as a
   case study. Based on an original dataset that consists of all executive
   and of legislative branch-submitted bills between 1948 and 2016 -
   roughly 60,000- legislative priority on social welfare is compared over
   time, and tested using logistic regressions. The key focus of analysis
   is whether and how the level of democracy affected the degree and
   universality of social welfare priority. The findings show that the
   promotion of social welfare is positively related to higher levels of
   democracy in a continuous fashion, which clearly points to the need to
   avoid applying a simple regime dichotomy - authoritarian or democratic -
   when seeking to understand social welfare development. Going further,
   the article examines the legislature's priority in welfare issues within
   a presidential structure and under majoritarian electoral rule, at
   different levels of democracy. The result shows that the higher levels
   of democracy are, the more the legislative branch contributes to the
   overall salience of social welfare legislative initiatives as compared
   to the executive branch. Moreover, the legislative branch itself
   prioritizes a social welfare agenda - alongside democratic deepening -
   over other issues.},

Abstract = {China's engagement within the South Pacific has increased dramatically
   in recent years mainly through significant increases in development
   assistance. Development assistance is provided to address humanitarian
   needs but to also secure national interests of the donor. This paper
   examines the extent and nature of Australia's and China's influence in
   Vanuatu from the perspectives of the Ni-Vanuatu people using new data.
   China is perceived as having the most influence in the country despite
   Australia's development assistance being viewed far more positively.
   Support for infrastructure is the most important factor contributing to
   a positive image for both countries. Perceptions of land grabbing are
   the main factor contributing to negative images. Regional differences in
   perceptions of Australia and China across Vanuatu also exist.},

Abstract = {A well-functioning democracy requires citizens' support for its
   political institutions and procedures. While scholars have previously
   studied the role of contextual factors for explaining satisfaction with
   democracy, a rigorous focus on how the party choice set affects how
   satisfied citizens are with democracy is largely absent from the
   literature. This neglect of the impact of parties is surprising, given
   their central position within modern, representative democracies. In
   this article, a comprehensive and comparative analysis of the impact of
   party systems on citizens' satisfaction with democracy is presented. Use
   is made of the combined data of the first four modules of the
   Comparative Study of Electoral Systems project and various measures of
   the party system are used to capture different aspects of the party
   choice set: the number of parties, their polarisation, and the
   congruence between public opinion and the party offer. In contrast to
   expectations, only scant evidence is found that having a wider choice
   increases citizens' satisfaction with democracy.},

Abstract = {To understand why quality of government (QoG) varies, scholars have
   drawn on two theoretical approaches: principal-agent and collective
   action theories. The literature tends to bifurcate these two theories,
   and focuses on the national scale and the structural conditions under
   which collective action and principal-agent problems arise. This article
   highlights how principal-agent relationships and collective action
   problems shape the implementation of decentralisation policy in two
   subnational governments in Papua New Guinea. It is argued that pathways
   to QoG are contextual, and determined by both principal-agent and
   collective action relationships. In the case of PNG, these relations are
   shaped by history, culture and the agency of elites and citizens.},

Abstract = {This paper analyses the current political crisis in Venezuela after the

   main argument here is that current crisis is the most recent chapter a
   long political crisis that began with rise to power of Hugo Chavez in
   1999. A brief historical analysis of the previous chapters of the crisis
   is done as well an evaluation about the extent to which those previous
   events influence on current ones. The paper ends with an evalution of
   the possible scenarios of solution of the crisis and the role that
   Venezuelan domestic actors and international actors will play.},

   decision, starting from a conceptual perspective that is based on the

Abstract = {This paper argues that pre-adolescent peer-group socialization in
   Georgia still refers to criminal subculture known as the thieves' world.
   Through ethnographic observation of children playing games borrowed from
   the prison context, the paper asks what function these games now have.
   The paper argues that children no longer see the subcultural capital of
   the thieves' world as a viable currency to gain status, or the games as
   modeling important functions for adult life. Instead, the paper finds
   that now, perhaps due to government policies, game players approach the
   subculture ironically as a way of developing belonging and demonstrating
   broader socio-cultural knowledge.},

Abstract = {Scholars have emphasized the decline of party membership and a decrease
   in party activism. Yet these general patterns hide a diversity of party
   members with distinct profiles, attitudes and behavior. Using Portugal
   as a case study, this article examines the heterogeneity of party
   members based on the different motivations for joining the party and
   distinct levels of involvement. The findings support previous typologies
   that distinguished between more activist versus more passive party
   members. The results also suggest that different party types present a
   distinct proportion of the two types of affiliates. In addition, these
   two types of members display distinct levels of ideological congruence
   with the party.},

Abstract = {In this paper we analyze attitudes of members of the legal professions
   in Croatia and Serbia with regards to the judicial systems - the trust
   in judicial institutions and satisfaction with their performance. In the
   first part of the paper we present arguments of the cultural and
   institutional approach to explaining the foundations of trust in
   institutions, then define the characteristics of a ``good{''} judiciary
   in the context of the democratic rule of law, and present the
   socio-political context of judicial reform in both countries over the
   last twenty years. In the second, empirical part of the paper we analyze
   the data collected through the online survey conducted among members of
   the legal professions in 2018 in Croatia and Serbia. The results from
   both countries show a low level of trust in judiciary and deep
   dissatisfaction with the functioning of judiciary on a list of
   dimensions. Our analysis confirms the link between (dis)trust in
   institutions and (dis)satisfaction with their work and thus also the
   assumptions of the institutional perspective on trust. We conclude that
   the obtained results point to an ``internal{''} crisis of trust in
   judiciary in both countries, which accompanies the evident
   ``external{''} crisis of the Serbian judiciary and the latent tensions
   in and around the Croatian judiciary.},

Abstract = {We provide a systematic assessment of various methods to position
   political parties on immigration, a policy domain that does not
   necessarily overlap with left-right and is characterized by varying
   salience and issue complexity. Manual and automated coding methods
   drawing on 283 party manifestos are compared - manual
   sentence-by-sentence coding using a conventional codebook, manual coding
   using checklists, automated coding using Wordscores, Wordfish and
   keywords. We also use expert surveys and the Comparative Manifesto
   Project (CMP), covering the main parties in Austria, Belgium, France,
   Ireland, the Netherlands, Spain, Switzerland and the United Kingdom,
   between 1993 and 2013. We find high levels of consistency between expert
   positioning, manual sentence-by-sentence coding and manual checklist
   coding and poor or inconsistent results with the CMP, Wordscores,
   Wordfish and the dictionary approach. An often-neglected method - manual
   coding using checklists - offers resource efficiency with no loss in
   validity or reliability.},

Abstract = {The U.S. Courts of Appeals must ordinarily convene en banc to overturn
   circuit law. However, roughly half of the circuit courts have adopted an
   alternative, less costly procedure, the informal en banc, where
   three-judge panels may overturn precedent with approval of the full
   circuit. This article leverages variation in adoption and implementation
   of this institution to analyze the implications of ex post oversight
   mechanisms for ex ante panel decision making. The evidence suggests that
   the informal en banc substantially reduces the impact of ideology on
   panel decision making, providing new evidence that lower court judges
   strategically alter their behavior in anticipation of potential override
   by circuit colleagues.},

Abstract = {Croatian Government has launched a series of reforms of the scientific
   system in 2013 aiming to increase its excellence and international
   competitiveness. In order to examine the achievements of these reforms,
   our research tried to explore how scientists perceived changes in the
   structure of the scientific research system four years after the new
   system was introduced. The research was conducted in two phases, using
   qualitative and quantitative methods, on a purposive quota sample
   according to scientific disciplines, institutions and scientific grades.
   The results suggest that the reforms have resulted in certain
   organizational advancements, and with a shift towards greater
   competitiveness in the research community, but at the same time they
   produced a number of unintended consequences, like endangering financial
   sustainability of research, transparency and openness of the scientific
   system. It is therefore reasonable to ask whether another change of
   direction of the Croatian science policy is needed.},

Abstract = {According to conventional wisdom, the traditional gender gap in voting
   has disappeared or even reversed in most established democracies.
   Drawing on the existing literature on differences between the sexes in
   political engagement and on pioneering voter turnout theories, this
   article questions the conventional assumption and hypothesises that
   women still participate at a lower rate in less important elections. It
   systematically tests this hypothesis by exploring the impact of gender
   on voter turnout in different electoral arenas. The empirical analyses
   of two cross-national datasets (Making Electoral Democracy Work and the
   European Election Study) demonstrate that although there is generally no
   gender gap in first-order elections, women tend to vote less than men in
   second-order contests. This reflects lower levels of interest in
   politics among women and their lower levels of knowledge about politics
   when it comes to second-order elections.},

Abstract = {In local elections, outcomes can turn on just hundreds of voters.
   Small-scale political entrepreneurs find it increasingly difficult to
   wage effective turnout campaigns relying on traditional, costly methods
   of outreach. Yet a growing literature on social pressure indicates that
   recasting voting as a socially motivated act increases the likelihood
   that voters participate. In this article, I present matching analyses of
   the impact of a new platform that relies on peer-to-peer voter outreach.
   I find that the intervention is responsible for significant increases in
   the likelihood that a voter casts a ballot in low-information elections
   across different sorts of voters.},

Journal = {BRITISH JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {49},
Number = {2},

Abstract = {This article presents results from survey experiments investigating
   conditions under which Britons are willing to pay taxes on polluting
   activities. People are no more willing if revenues are hypothecated for
   spending on environmental protection, while making such taxes more
   relevant to people - by naming petrol and electricity as products to
   which they will apply - has a modestly negative effect. Public
   willingness increases sharply if people are told that new environmental
   taxes would be offset by cuts to other taxes, but political distrust
   appears to undermine much of this effect. Previous studies have argued
   that political trust shapes public opinion with respect to environmental
   and many other policies. But this article provides the first
   experimental evidence suggesting that the relationship is causal, at
   least for one specific facet: cynicism about public officials' honesty
   and integrity. The results suggest a need to make confidence in the
   trustworthiness of public officials and their promises more central to
   conceptualizations of political trust.},

Abstract = {This essay serves as an introduction to the US Foreign Policy in the Age
   of Trump Symposium. Two years into his first term as president of the
   United States, Donald Trump has made his presence known on the
   international stage. In articulating his administration's position on a
   range of foreign policy issues, he has been called many things,
   including ``antiglobalist,{''} ``nativist,{''} and ``isolationist,{''}
   which suggests a break from American foreign policy of the recent past.
   Is this perceived break indeed real? While many pundits and political
   watchers believe that President Trump's foreign policy is fundamentally
   different from that of his predecessors, political scientists are only
   now beginning to examine these important questions in detail. This
   symposium brings together a set of scholars to provide some initial
   answers and to offer some educated speculations on the short-term future
   of American foreign policy.},

Abstract = {To compete in political contests, politicians need their supporters to
   contribute resources. We investigate how politicians can best allocate
   group-based prizes on a contingent basis to incentivize individual
   members of a group to exert effort on their behalf. We contrast
   contingent contracts with tournament style contests (Lazear and Rosen
   (Rank-order tournaments as optimum labor contracts. J Political Econ
   1981; 89(5): 841-864)) and characterize when tournaments that create
   intergroup contests for prizes elicit more contributions than contingent
   contracts. By tying the allocation of prizes to the observed level of
   effort made by each group, politicians ameliorate the collective action
   problem that is created by the fact that each individual's effort has
   only a minimal impact on the overall political contest. We examine the
   relative performance and stability of intergroup tournaments as a
   function of the number of groups and asymmetric group size.},

Abstract = {China's rapid rise on the global economic stage has substantial and
   unequal employment effects in advanced industrialized democracies given
   China's large volume of low-wage labor. Thus far, these effects have not
   been analyzed in the comparative political economy literature. Building
   on pooled time-series data, we analyze the effects of Chinese trade
   competition across 17 sectors in 18 countries. We devote attention to a
   new channel, increased competition from China in foreign export markets.
   Our empirical findings reveal overall employment declines in sectors
   more exposed to Chinese imports. Furthermore, our results suggest that
   employment effects are not equally shared across skill levels, as the
   share of hours worked worsens for low-skilled workers.},

Abstract = {This paper studies the association between the risk of automation and
   vote choice in 11 West European countries. We extend upon labour
   economics literature on the effects of automation on the labour market
   by focusing on the political consequences of automation. We also build
   on existing work relating labour market risks to support for radical
   right parties. We argue that automation threat is most likely to
   increase support for radical right parties. We demonstrate that those
   more inclined to vote for the radical right rather than the average
   voters are those who are both threatened by automation and are still
   ``just about managing{''} economically. They are more receptive to the
   narrative of the radical right, which simultaneously highlights the
   risk, and proposes protection. Using cross-sectional individual level
   data drawn from the European Social Survey (rounds 6, 7 and 8), we find
   that individuals who perceive themselves as ``coping on present
   income{''} are significantly more likely to vote for radical right
   parties as risk of automation increases. They are also less likely to
   vote for major right parties.},

Title = {Phenotypic Preference in Mexican Migrants: Evidence from a Random
   Household Survey},
Journal = {POLITICAL BEHAVIOR},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {41},

Abstract = {Does pre-existing preference based on skin tone, facial features, and
   other observable characteristics, i.e., phenotypic preference, affect
   immigrant voters' support for political candidates competing in their
   countries of origin? Do these preferences change as migrants' tenure in
   their host society increases? These questions are important for ethnic
   and racial politics in general, and particularly for the sizable
   foreign-born population in the United States, which includes 11 million
   Mexicans. Using a unique, random sample of foreign-born Mexicans in San
   Diego County, we employ a voting experiment to test the impact of skin
   tone and phenotype on vote choice among first generation immigrants. Our
   design allows us to distinguish responses to different phenotypic cues
   by exposing respondents to European, mestizo, and indigenous looking
   candidates competing in a hypothetical Mexican election. Migrants showed
   higher support for the Indigenous candidate, and evaluated the European
   and Mestizo candidates as more ideologically conservative. As migrants'
   time in the United States increases, the preference for indigenous
   features gives way to a preference for whiteness, which we interpret as
   evidence of first generation migrants adopting the dominant racial
   ideology of the United States. While ethnic distinctions have long been
   viewed as a key component of voting behavior, our research demonstrates
   that, even within a single ethnicity, racial differences may have
   profound impacts on the evaluation of and support for electoral
   candidates. This study contributes to the research on race and political
   behavior in comparative perspective, as well as the political
   consequences of migration.},

Abstract = {In this article, we provide new evidence that contributes to our
   understanding of the conditions which influence the existence and degree
   of economic voting in subnational elections in a multiparty context in a
   developing democracy. Based on data from Brazilian gubernatorial
   elections held between 1994 and 2014, we find confirmation, in the case
   of a developing democracy, of conclusions reached in other studies of
   developed democracies: that subnational economic voting is moderated by
   the structure of the state economy and federalism. We show that voters
   are more likely to reward incumbent governors for their management of
   the local economy in labor-intense jurisdictions dominated by industry
   and services. Economic performance in the year of the election also
   matters to the degree that a state has more autonomy from the federal
   government.},

Title = {Parties between thresholds: State subsidies and party behaviour in
   post-communist democracies},
Journal = {PARTY POLITICS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {25},
Number = {2},
Pages = {233-244},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Much has been written about what makes political parties form, persist,
   change and die. One factor often brought into this discussion is the
   availability of resources in general and of state financing of political
   parties in particular. However, an empirical link at the aggregate level
   is difficult to establish because of various issues of
   conceptualization, operationalization and measurement. Working at the
   party level and taking into consideration that state funding provides
   important resources that make running in elections and achieving a
   party's electoral target more likely, this article provides empirical
   support for the claim that parties who (anticipate to be or) are being
   funded by the state have a higher chance of forming and surviving in an
   independent format in the party system. Based on a comparison of 14
   post-communist party systems, the main conclusion of the article is that
   the survival rate for such parties exceeds the survival rate for the
   non-publicly funded ones in almost all cases. A second, novel and more
   particular, finding is that parties who find themselves outside
   parliament, but above the payout threshold, display higher survival
   rates than parties who are below it.},

Abstract = {This article analyzes recent research on the impact of non-party
   organizations on policy, describing its theoretical coherence,
   operationalization of key concepts, views of different types of
   organizations, hypothesis testing, efforts to generalize from its
   findings, and proposals for improving future research. The analysis
   shows that few relevant articles in major journals in political science
   and sociology test theory; researchers seldom explicitly define key
   concepts; though researchers regularly study interest groups and social
   movement organizations, much of their work focuses on other types of
   organizations; researchers regularly make no predictions about
   organizations' impact on policy, and when they do, a majority of their
   predictions are wrong. Researchers rarely generalize; they seldom claim
   that their conclusions have implications for theory; and their
   suggestions for future work are mostly generic. The analysis points to
   weaknesses in current research and proposes ways to overcome them.},

Abstract = {Majority leaders of the contemporary Congress preside over parties that
   are more cohesive than at any point in the modern era, and power has
   been centralized in party leadership offices. Do today's majority
   parties succeed in enacting their legislative agendas to a greater
   extent than the less-cohesive parties of earlier eras? To address this
   question, we examine votes on all laws enacted from 1973-2016, as well
   as on the subset of landmark laws identified by Mayhew. In addition, we
   analyze the efforts of congressional majority parties to pass their
   agendas from 1985 to 2016. We find that enacting coalitions in recent
   congresses are nearly as bipartisan as they were in the 1970s. Most
   laws, including landmark enactments, continue to garner substantial
   bipartisan support. Furthermore, majority parties have not gotten better
   at passing their legislative programs. Contemporary congressional
   majorities actually fail on their agenda items at somewhat higher rates
   than the less-cohesive majority parties of the 1980s and 1990s. When
   majority parties succeed on their agenda priorities, they usually do so
   with support from a majority of the minority party in at least one
   chamber and with the endorsement of one or more of the minority party's
   top leaders.},

Abstract = {This article analyzes the effect of Franco-German cooperation on
   Economic and Monetary Union reforms, negotiated between 2010 and 2015.
   We identify three causal mechanisms theorizing how Franco-German
   cooperation affected the outcomes of EMU negotiations, namely through
   (a) the elimination of issues from the negotiation agenda; (b) the
   identification of compromise solutions or the provision of
   compensations; and (c) the power-based imposition of joint agreements on
   other member states. We use process tracing to analyze almost the full
   sample of contested issues included in the `EMU Positions' dataset. Our
   findings underline that France and Germany indeed eliminated issues to
   which they were jointly opposed, but they also positively shaped the
   agenda by proposing compromises and offering compensation. No evidence
   supports the power-focused perspective of a Franco-German directoire.},

Abstract = {One potential consequence of increasing women's numeric representation
   is that women elected officials will behave differently than their men
   counterparts and improve women's substantive representation. This study
   examines whether electing women to local offices changes how local
   government expenditures are allocated in ways that benefit women. Using
   compositional expenditure data from more than 5,400 Brazilian
   municipalities over eight years, we find significant differences in the
   ways men and women mayors allocate government expenditures. Our findings
   indicate that women mayors spend more on traditionally feminine issues,
   and less on traditionally masculine issues, relative to men mayors. In
   regard to specific policy areas, we find that women spend more on
   women's issues, including education, health care, and social assistance,
   and less on masculine issues, including transportation and urban
   development, relative to men mayors. We further find that women's
   legislative representation significantly influences the allocation of
   expenditures as a larger percentage of women councilors increases
   spending on traditionally feminine issues, as well as education, health
   care, and social assistance, relative to other policy issues. These
   findings indicate that women local elected officials improve women's
   substantive representation by allocating a larger percentage of
   expenditures to issues that have historically and continue to concern
   women in Brazil.},

Abstract = {The Good Friday Agreement negotiations gave a unique opportunity for the
   insertion of women's rights and equal formal representation in the new
   post-conflict Northern Ireland. Notwithstanding the robust and
   unambiguous commitments in the text of the agreement, the primary
   architects of the peace process, however, situated gender and women's
   position as peripheral to the main priorities of `guns and government'.
   While conventional forms of peacebuilding claim to be beneficial for
   all, evidence from the so-called `post-conflict' period around the world
   demonstrates a continuity of violence for many women, as well as new
   forms of violence. This article explores the position of women in
   Northern Ireland today across a number of issues, including formal
   politics, community activism, domestic violence and reproductive rights.
   By doing so, it continues feminist endeavours seeking to problematise
   the `post-conflict' narrative by gendering peace and security. While the
   Good Friday Agreement did undoubtedly provide the potential for a new
   era of gender relations, 20 years on Northern Irish society exhibits all
   the trademarks and insidious characteristics of a patriarchal society
   that has yet to undergo a genuine transformation in gender relations.
   The article argues that the consistent privileging of masculinity and
   the dominance of male power is a commonality that remains uninterrupted
   by the peace process.},

Journal = {CAPITAL AND CLASS},

Volume = {43},
Number = {1, SI},
Pages = {73-87},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {The 1998 Good Friday/Belfast Peace Agreement was almost universally
   supported by nationalists in Northern Ireland, and Sinn Fein's
   high-profile role in the discussions was the foundation upon which it
   would transform itself from the political wing of the Provisional Irish
   Republican Army to second biggest party at Stormont. However, dissidents
   pointed out that the compromises made by Sinn Fein during the Peace
   Process were a sell-out of the political and ideological aspirations
   held by republicans for at least a century. New dissident groups emerged
   in opposition to the course taken by Sinn Fein, and the period since
   1998 has been one of the most dynamic in republican history since the
   Irish Civil War. New political parties and organisations like the 32
   County Sovereignty Movement, eirigi, Republican Network for Unity and
   Saoradh emerged reflecting this state of flux and the existential fears
   felt by those for whom the Good Friday Agreement fell far short of
   delivering the republican aspiration of a united Ireland. Although
   Brexit provided a curious and fortunate opportunity for momentary public
   attention, these groups have remained peripheral actors in the Irish and
   British political public spheres.},

Abstract = {This paper aims to test two types of legislative shirking in a new
   democracy, South Korea. Using the lame-duck sessions of the Korean
   National Assembly, we test whether a legislator shirks in voting
   participation and in voting decisions. We weave two competing
   motivations of legislative shirking in voting participation - that to
   secure more leisure time and that to utilize the last, valuable voting
   opportunity - into a synthetic hypothesis and test it with two-part
   hurdle models. To test a shirking in voting participation hypothesis, we
   analyze legislators' choices on bills that are supposedly related to the
   interests of constituents or political parties. Empirical results
   strongly support our shirking in voting participation claims, while only
   partial evidence is found on shirking in voting decisions. The findings
   suggest that, besides the trade-off between labor and leisure, some
   legislators deem the lame-duck sessions an opportunity to express their
   own preferences unconstrained.},

Abstract = {Coalition theory is one of the fields that has extensively benefited
   from formal modelling in political science. Since the publication of
   William Riker's (1962) seminal book, a variety of coalition models has
   been developed to explain government formation and breakdown.
   Nevertheless, despite the diversity of models, the literature seems to
   judge their predictability solely in terms of empirical tests, usually
   deriving hypotheses from their propositions and testing via statistics.
   In this work, I survey classical and more recent formal models in
   coalition theory, demonstrating how they serve different purposes. I
   build a taxonomy of models that acknowledges these purposes, and, more
   importantly, the roles they play in building explanations about
   coalitions. I identify three types of models: conceptual models, whose
   conceptual and theoretical value relies on the mathematical deductions
   entailed in the model; quasi-conceptual models, which formalise
   explanations of regularities in the real world; and extrapolative
   models, which allow for an empirical test of formal models via a variety
   of statistical methods. All of these types of models coexist, generating
   explanations and setting research agendas.},

Abstract = {This paper examines the British Conservative Party's leadership election
   of 2016, held in the aftermath of the UK's referendum vote to leave the
   European Union. The paper analyses the contest using Stark's theoretical
   framework, which assumes that leaders are chosen according to a
   hierarchy of criteria: acceptability, electability and competence, in
   that order. The eventual victor, Theresa May, was indeed the strongest
   candidate on all three criteria. However, electability appeared
   subordinate to competence during the contest. Electability is usually
   regarded as more basic than competence because parties must first win
   elections before they can start governing. However, governing parties
   are already in office and new leaders chosen mid-term must begin
   governing immediately. Current competence in office may be a
   prerequisite for future electability. The paper reviews other post-war
   leadership elections in Britain and finds that competence normally
   superseded electability as a selection criterion in governing parties.
   This finding implies a modification of Stark's framework.},

Abstract = {The article develops the concept chain of liquidity' in order to explore
   the monetary politics by the central banks which allow non-banks to
   create money for the first time in history. The concept describes
   acomplex institutional arrangement which enables specific credit claims
   to become money or to come closer to taking on the form of money The
   contribution contends that while different forms of credit with varying
   degrees of liquidity are created through internal financial market
   processes, the creation of money and quasi-money is only possible as
   aresult of political processes which generate ageneral standard of value
   from an asset through (state) institutionalized liquidity chains. As the
   global financial crisis escalated in 2008, the liquidity chains existing
   between banks and central banks at the time did not suffice to contain
   its impact. This was because the shadow banking system was not entitled
   to access those chains. Anew liquidity chain had to be created in order
   to provide the shadow banking system with liquidity. The historically
   unique step that was taken in response to the critical developments now
   allows financial players in the shadow banking system to create money.
   The article aims to analyze this unconventional monetary policies and to
   develop amore explicitly political understanding of money and its
   creation.},

Abstract = {This article examines dilemmas of the multistakeholder mechanism of
   participation in Mexico-situated in the context of the post-2015 Agenda
   for Sustainable Development-to rethink the interplay between
   contemporary diplomacy, global politics, and nongovernmental actors. The
   central argument is that diplomacy has to open up and function as a
   collaborative space that includes nongovernmental actors who, in turn,
   influence the design of contemporary institutions. This, I contend,
   ultimately leads to a redefinition of relations between governments and
   societies under a more democratic, inclusive design and code of conduct.
   The case of the nongovernmental organization campaign ``Beyond2015{''}
   in Mexico is used in the above context. I evidence, through a
   qualitative analysis, that the particular multistakeholder mechanism
   encouraged both at the United Nations level and the Mexican Secretariat
   of Foreign Affairs, held important limitations for developing an
   effective inclusive mechanism for certain nongovernmental actors.},

Title = {Information and direct democracy: What voters learn about ballot
   measures and how it affects their votes},
Journal = {ELECTORAL STUDIES},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {57},
Pages = {223-244},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Limited research has evaluated what voters know about the initiatives
   and referendums that regularly appear on their ballots. Analyzing survey
   data covering nine ballot measures in three U.S. states, I explore what
   voters know about measures that would implement policies ranging from
   approving same-sex marriage to requiring identification to vote. My
   results show a great deal of variation across both ballot measures and
   type of knowledge. Specifically, I find that knowledge of endorsements
   and status quo policies is similar to their knowledge of civics. Policy
   specific facts, however, lag far behind. My results also show that
   voters tend to know more about moral issues. Increased campaign spending
   also helps voters learn about relevant endorsements, though not facts.
   When comparing the efficacy of facts versus endorsements, knowledge of
   an endorsement has a measurable decision-improving impact on voters'
   choices while knowing a fact only rarely does.},

Abstract = {We provide an instrumental theory of extreme campaign platforms. By
   adopting an extreme platform, a previously mainstream party with a
   relatively small probability of winning further reduces its chances. On
   the other hand, the party builds credibility as the one most capable of
   delivering an alternative to mainstream policies. The party gambles that
   if down the road voters become dissatisfied with the status quo and seek
   something different, the party will be there ready with a credible
   alternative. In essence, the party sacrifices the most immediate
   election to invest in greater future success. We call this phenomenon
   tactical extremism. We show under which conditions we expect tactical
   extremism to arise and we discuss its welfare implications.},

Title = {Enhancing Electoral Equality: Can Education Compensate for Family
   Background Differences in Voting Participation?},
Journal = {AMERICAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW},

Volume = {113},
Number = {1},
Pages = {108-122},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {It is well documented that voter turnout is lower among persons who grow
   up in families from a low socioeconomic status compared with persons
   from high-status families. This paper examines whether reforms in
   education can help reduce this gap. We establish causality by exploiting
   a pilot scheme preceding a large reform of Swedish upper secondary
   education in the early 1990s, which gave rise to exogenous variation in
   educational attainment between individuals living in different
   municipalities or born in different years. Similar to recent studies
   employing credible identification strategies, we fail to find a
   statistically significant average effect of education on political
   participation. We move past previous studies, however, and show that the
   reform nevertheless contributed to narrowing the voting gap between
   individuals of different social backgrounds by raising turnout among
   those from low socioeconomic status households. The results thus square
   well with other recent studies arguing that education is particularly
   important for uplifting politically marginalized groups.},

Abstract = {While intersectionality is a recurrent theme in the literature on
   women's political representation, few studies empirically disentangle
   who are the women who get elected to parliaments. An argument on biases
   in recruitment practices suggests that those who are members of more
   than one outgroup, such as young women, benefit from an `outgroup
   advantage'. In elections, a candidate with two outgroup features might
   attract more voter support than a candidate with just one outgroup
   feature. Hence, nominating a candidate that is both young and female
   could be a rational move by (male) elites in political parties that
   allows them to open fewer seats to newcomers. These expectations are
   tested on data for all members of the European Parliament since 1979.
   Not only is it found that women's presence increased steadily throughout
   the parliament's history, but also that women's representation is
   consistently highest among the group of young representatives, lower
   among middle-aged Members of the European Parliament and lowest among
   older representatives.},

Title = {RETRACTED: The heterogeneous effect of diversity: Ascriptive identities,
   class and redistribution in developed democracies (Retracted Article)},
Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL RESEARCH},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {58},
Number = {1},

Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {The current consensus among comparative political scientists postulates
   that diverse democracies redistribute less than homogeneous ones.
   However, whereas homogeneous democracies redistribute more on average,
   diverse democracies exhibit high variation in redistributive outcomes.
   Why does ascriptive heterogeneity stifle redistribution in some cases
   but not in others? In this article, it is argued that diversity
   undermines redistributive outcomes when identity groups differ more
   starkly in their income levels. More importantly, under these
   conditions, the policy outcomes are not uniform: rather than general
   cutbacks, richer groups selectively under-prioritise benefits and access
   for poorer, minority-heavy groups while keeping their own redistributive
   interests protected. The result is not simply less redistribution
   aggregately, but a more exclusionary and regressive welfare state that
   prioritises the social needs of better-off identity groups. Empirical
   support is found for these hypotheses using macrocomparative panel data
   on multiple redistributive aspects in 22 developed democracies in the
   years 1980-2011. The article thus outlines a conditional and more
   nuanced relationship between diversity and redistributive outcomes than
   commonly assumed, as well as several broader lessons for research of
   identity politics and social policy.},

   Analysis},
Journal = {PEACE ECONOMICS PEACE SCIENCE AND PUBLIC POLICY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {25},
Number = {1},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {In this paper, we empirically examine the effect of polity stability on
   economic growth and investment by using the dynamic panel estimation
   techniques for more than 100 countries over the period 1960-2009. Our
   initial results imply that democracy reduces growth in both developed
   and developing countries. However, there is no evidence for the
   existence of a significant effect of the democracy level on the overall,
   public and private investment. Our results also suggest that the growth
   and investment effects of polity stability proxied by regime durability
   and polity fragility measures greatly differ in developing and developed
   countries. Our empirical results indicate that polity stability promotes
   growth only in developing countries. It seems that regime durability and
   polity fragility affect economic growth mainly through investment. We
   also make a distinction between public and private investment when
   examining the effects of polity stability. It seems that the durability

Abstract = {One of the core questions facing political scientists is how politicians
   are able to implement cutbacks without suffering electoral backlash. A
   possible explanation might be that the mass media refrain from reporting
   on welfare state reforms in a consistent way. In order to explore this,
   two unique datasets have been collected: one contains information on all
   policy reforms of British old age pensions and unemployment protection
   from 1996 to 2014, and the other contains hand-coded media articles that
   allow the tracking on a monthly basis of what reforms are picked up. It
   is found that the mass media report on cutbacks, but not on expansions,
   and that they prioritise easy-to-understand cutbacks over cutbacks that
   are more technical in nature.},

Abstract = {By employing the concepts of opportunity structure and discursive
   opportunities as a theoretical background, this paper aims to identify
   and analyze the factors that may have led to the breakthroughs of two
   right-wing political actors in Poland in 2014-2015: Pawel Kukiz and his
   Kukiz'15 movement and Janusz Korwin-Mikke and his political initiatives.
   In our study we focused on several issues: the political, economic, and
   social context; the visibility provided by traditional media; widespread
   usage of social media; correspondence of the content of messages to
   expectations and political preferences; and radicalization of the agenda
   of the Law and Justice party (PiS), which contributed to the resonance
   and legitimacy of populist claims.},

Abstract = {The concept of integration plays an increasingly important role in
   Western societies, which is accompanied by a similar increase in
   statistical indicators designed to measure the policies that shape
   integration. In this paper, we critically examine one such system of
   measurement: the Swiss Federal Office of Statistics' Indicators of
   Integration. We use an interpretative methodology to analyse the
   political and conceptual construction of a quantitative policy-tool. As
   such, we provide an innovative and theory-based approach to analysing
   statistical policy-tools more widely.},

Abstract = {As Arab monarchies increasingly adopt and empower consultative
   assemblies, women's representation varies markedly across countries.
   What leads citizens in these new electoral systems to vote for women?
   This study investigates the determinants of support for women's
   representation using the first electoral survey ever conducted in Oman,
   prior to the October 2015 Majlis al Shura elections. It considers
   cross-nationally recognized factors - gender ideology and religion - and
   tribalism, a factor heretofore largely unexplored. Confirming prior
   studies, citizens with traditional gender ideology are much less
   supportive of women's representation. Developing a simultaneous
   equations model, we show that religiosity and tribalism shape gender
   ideology. Unlike in Western countries, education is unassociated with
   attitudes, and there is no generational shift towards equality; younger
   men are less supportive of women's representation than are older men.
   Increasing women's representation requires not only increasing citizen
   demand for female leaders, but also changing informal tribal and formal
   electoral institutions.},

Abstract = {The Sahel region is a crossroads of interrelated challenges that
   accumulate a broad typology of weaknesses: underdevelopment, poverty,
   insecurity, corruption, ethnic conflicts, fragile states and dependent
   economies. All these factors make it a friction zone that can lead to
   diverse conflicts. The objective of this article is to identify the
   geopolitical factors that characterize the development and human
   security of this frontier region, which are preventing the Sahel
   countries to avoid the consideration of fragile states. The result of
   this study indicates that the region will not be able to transform the
   vulnerabilities that characterize it into positive dynamics if one does
   not act on three levels: population participation, institution building
   and cooperation promotion.},

Abstract = {What do ratings of political science journals show? What can they
   provide for us to understand problems of political science? How do the
   distinguishing features and common specifics of science development in
   Russia influence the ratings of political science journals? The authors
   answer the questions on the basis of analysing the Russian Science
   Citation Index ratings and some other bibliometric indicators of Russian
   journals which publish articles on politics. The article highlights
   difficulties of using the Science Index for integral assessment of
   publication activity and influence of scientific journals. Amongst them
   is the fuzzy thematic identification of journals in the system and the
   ``discrepancy{''} of citation accounting in ``latitude{''} and
   ``quality{''}. The authors analyses problems of impact-factors
   application for evaluations of scientific journals, science development,
   shaping and activity of scientific communities. The question of citation
   functions and meanings are examined. The authors compare political
   science journals ratings made on the basis of Science Index, expert
   evaluations and some bibliometric indicators calculated in RSCI system
   (for example half-life of articles) and reveal the importance of
   application of various indicators. The article discusses the necessity
   for amending the Science Index by including indicators which reflect
   ``quality{''} in published articles and citation. The authors conclude
   that it is important to take into consideration the peculiarities of
   political science development in Russia when using journals ratings for
   their evaluation and assessment of situation in political science.},

Abstract = {The actively forming system of Eurasian international relations is a
   non-linear synergetic process of free choice of political ideals,
   meaning-determining attitudes of development, models of future behavior
   of interested states. The most important prerequisite for preventing any
   unexpected crisis seems to be the consistent formation of the most
   effective mechanisms of mutual rational control over the instinctive
   impulses of unilateral ``expansion{''} of the two countries in the
   geostrategic inter-civiliza (Tonal area of Eurasia. International
   experts recommend that Russia and China should be extremely careful and
   attentive in the formation of a common Eurasian space in order to avoid
   suspicion of neighbors in the desire of China and Russia to political
   domination. The core problem of the Russian-Chinese partnership in the
   foreseeable future is likely to be a tough agreement on continental
   Eurasian self-organization, designed to balance the ambitions of Moscow
   and Beijing in order to protect the integration process from slipping
   into the abyss of mutual reproaches. If this succeeds, then it will be
   possible to allow a greater probability of the formation of a
   Russian-Chinese multi-vector Alliance. In long-term geopolitical plans
   of two great. powers Eurasia take an important place in the context of
   building stable security area in remote perspective. It seems that great
   civilizations like Russia and China, so as India, Iran and Turkey, in
   visible future will inevitably set to the joint elaboration of values
   system which most probably in many aspects may not coincide with the
   postmodern paradigm of ``collective West{''} development.
   The international experts recommend the RE and China to be extremely
   careful and attentive in forniation of the united Eurasian space in
   order to not arise any suspicion about alleged aspiration of the PRC and
   Russia to dominate politically. Evidently, real pivotal problem for
   China-Russia partnership in visible perspective will consist in the
   achievement of tough agreement on their self-organization in continental
   Eurasia aimed to balance ambitions of Moscow and Beijing and preserve
   integration process from slipping down to the abyss of mutual
   reproaches. If that succeeds, there will appear probability of
   formatting Russia-China multifaceted alliance. Complexity in functioning
   of Russia-China partnership is that will be able to arise the
   occurrences when both sides relations can pour periods of crises and
   Eurasia as a geopolitical space in virtue of its civilization variety
   show itself incapable to find common acceptable decision of regional
   importance questions and that impel Russia and China to doubt in
   rightness of jointly chosen political course.
   Unlike Russia and China, the USA absolutely do not understand the
   enormous importance of traditional values that help shape new realities
   on the Eurasian continent, when all countries in the region consistently
   seek ways to neutralize existing ideological differences. In that
   connection it is very important to give a meaning of question about
   Eurasia continent civilization's frontiers which remain greatly
   conventional and interpreted absolutely in different way on East and
   West that can politically look like tough competition of conceptions
   concerning multi-polarity and globalization. On that background there
   are two different in principal models of future universe, namely: one
   polar world and many poles world every of which inherent characteristics
   of inimitability and humiliation.
   Nowadays there is accumulated process when many Eurasian states refuse
   from political patronage of Washington and that lead them toward a
   search of other possibilities for realization own national interests on
   international arena. The main doubts in constmctivism of political
   changes on Eurasia continent have been tied with the apprehensions of
   sonic countries toward real stability of developed after the World War
   II system especially concerning financial regulation and trade-economic
   interac- Lion in frames of WTO pouring serious crises. Formation of
   financial existence new picture on Eurasian continent is accompanied by
   the growth of political instability not only in regional but in global
   scale. Moreover it's turned out absolute demands to human activity Which
   can he called a certain ecological imperative. This imperative has
   objectively to limit a freedom of human-being's economic actions so that
   to secure new conditions for further co-evolution of human-being and
   biosphere, in which financial factor already will not play main role.},

Abstract = {The suburban areas that were initially stereotyped in the late
   nineteenth century as `Villa Tory' strongholds and exemplified by
   Hackney and Islington had, by the 1980s, become `bedsitter' areas
   dominated by the political left. An examination of the evolution of
   electoral behaviour in these areas shows that conservatism did indeed
   dominate the villa suburbs, and that although there were previous
   intimations of decline, it was not until 1945 that Labour broke the
   Conservatives' grip. The causes of this are identified as an outward
   movement of the population to interwar suburbia, the breaking up of
   villas into flats, and Labour's increasing appeal to middle class
   electors. In this category of seats, Labour has outperformed the party's
   national achievement consistently since 1955; the party's exceptional
   results here in the 2017 election are, therefore, a new peak on a
   long-term trend rather than a breakthrough.},

Journal = {CRITICAL REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL SOCIAL AND POLITICAL PHILOSOPHY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {22},
Number = {4},
Pages = {412-431},
Abstract = {The prevailing view is that democratic procedures are unable to confer
   democratic legitimacy to decisions about democratic procedures. This
   paper examines this claim in detail and uses referendums on the
   inclusion of previously disenfranchised groups in the demos as a running
   example.The paper distinguishes between pure, imperfect and quasi-pure
   models of procedural democratic legitimacy and sub-versions of them.To
   various extents, each model does have the capacity to confer legitimacy
   to demos decisions under well-defined circumstances. The paper argues
   that quasi-pure procedural legitimacy represents the most promising
   account of democratic legitimacy in cases where democratic procedures
   are the subject of collective decision-making. According to this model,
   the decision to revise the rules for membership in the demos is
   permissible by democratic standards if and only if the revision is not
   forbidden by democratic principles for inclusion. The point is that the
   range of alternatives that are not forbidden by democratic principles of
   inclusion are likely to be considerable due to vagueness of the
   principles themselves and/or them being subject to reasonable
   disagreement. The paper concludes with a discussion about the
   possibility of democratic legitimacy for democratic institutions not
   introduced as a result of democratic decision-making.},

Abstract = {Formed as a result of the introduction of the Obscene Publications Act
   1959, the Obscene Publications Squad - known colloquially as the ``Dirty
   Squad{''} - controlled a web of corruption and managed the proliferation
   of pornography in the Central London district of Soho. Although its
   reputation for corruption was the primary reason for the vice unit's
   notoriety, their role in applying social control also had a profound
   impact on London society during the 1960s and 1970s. During this period,
   the Dirty Squad mounted a campaign against the underground press and
   their influence on the counterculture. It is suggested that these
   investigations were designed to provide a cover for the vice squad's
   inaction against pornographers; by focusing attention on more radical
   elements of the city's counterculture, the Dirty Squad gave the
   impression that they were taking action whilst simultaneously allowing
   their corrupt partners in the vice industry to continue in their
   business unabated.},

Abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI) is a transformative technology that offers
   both great benefits and poses a number of challenges. Effective
   governance is important to ensure that the ethical concerns are met.
   James Butcher and Irakli Beridze provide an overview of current AI

   sector, public sector, research and multi-stakeholder organisations, and
   the UN. They take a deeper look at regulation, then reflect on the
   future of AI governance, touching on some frameworks that may offer
   guidance for the beneficial development of AI technologies while

Journal = {JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE EDUCATION},

Volume = {15},
Number = {3},
Pages = {299-317},
Abstract = {Previous research has discussed the difficulty of teaching topics
   related to the Middle East. In our experience, one reason for this
   difficulty is that students are strongly biased with respect to these
   topics. This research attempts to systematically identify these biases
   through surveys and then test the effectiveness of targeted lectures
   that are specifically tailored to challenge the biases. We collected our
   data over 2 years through surveys conducted in three sections of
   Introduction to Comparative Politics. We measured the difference of bias
   in the prelecture and postlecture surveys by using the statistical
   method of randomized block design. Our findings demonstrate that
   students hold a significant degree of bias in four major categories and
   also have negative images about the region. We find that targeted
   lectures are effective in lowering both explicit and implicit bias,
   although a high degree of bias remains for some topics. Our findings are
   applicable to all courses that cover issues related to the Middle East.},

Journal = {CRITICAL REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL SOCIAL AND POLITICAL PHILOSOPHY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {22},
Number = {4},
Pages = {454-458},
Abstract = {This piece provides an illustration of the main traits of the
   interactive dimension of justice; this is the idea that the terms of
   some human forms of interactions may be inherently valuable as they
   instantiate the just treatment owed to persons in virtue of their moral
   status as claim-makers. Interactive justice is presented as the guiding
   idea for developing just institutional responses to the presence of
   value conflict in politics because it grounds the transformation of
   antagonistic conflict dynamics into cooperative terms. This idea thus
   offers the normative foundation for a normative theory of conflict
   management as an integration to the existing (and seemingly
   irreconcilable) theories of conflict resolution (grounded in the idea of
   end-state justice) and conflict containment (animated by a commitment to
   peace).},

Volume = {15},

Abstract = {Having been presented the opportunity to teach a special section of
   American and Texas Government for new freshman majors, my first goal was
   to find ways to enhance and enrich the academic and intellectual
   experience of my students. My thoughts turned right away to
   undergraduate research and the many benefits it provides, as pointed out
   by the Association of American Colleges and Universities, the Council on
   Undergraduate Research, the American Political Science Association, and
   the National Collegiate Honors Council, among others. Thinking that my
   students deserved these opportunities, and that research was important
   to students majoring in political science, I wrote assignments that
   seemed right for the course. Now, with two years of experience with such
   sections, I am sharing lessons I have learned, from the need to be
   mindful of the time demands one places on new freshmen to recognition
   that the term research is unfamiliar and lacking in meaning to most
   students. Teaching the class for majors has been a rewarding experience
   for many reasons, among them the opportunities it provided for the
   instructor to gain new insights and understanding.},

Number = {4},
Pages = {545-561},
Abstract = {This paper discusses the imperative for Marxist Theory <--> Praxis to
   develop and respond to/counter ongoing even urgent imperial efforts to
   develop scientific approaches to the study of the nature and evolution
   of human consciousness, cognition, learning, perception, susceptibility
   to soft and hard forms of power, propaganda and imperial social systems
   engineering. Specifically how do shifting
   socio-historical-economic-political definitions, constructs and
   realities of culture, tribe, nation, ethnicity, race, nationality,
   interpenetrate with and shape human cognition, perception, prejudices,
   and class consciousness as central to but not all of overall
   consciousness? How are these constructs used in concrete ways to foster
   imperial penetrations, co-optations, control and subversion? What are
   some emerging issues and areas in need of research as well as concrete
   ways that constructs like culture can be and are being used to promote
   false consciousness, reactionary tribalism and forms of
   ``patriotism,{''} exceptionalism, triumphalism and neo-Cold War
   posturing. What are the implications of sub-cultures within alleged
   broader homogenous national cultures, imperial promotion of forms of
   supposed exceptionalism and triumphalism trumping class-based cultures
   and their inherent antagonisms vs. socialist social formations intent on
   reducing class-based cultures and their antagonisms with no imperatives
   or intent for domination and hegemony?},

Abstract = {This article examines Ralph Ellison's understanding of democratic
   leadership and its relationship to freedom in Invisible Man. The theory
   of democratic leadership that emerges from the novel consists of three
   elements. First, because they recognize that ordinary people are capable
   of political action, democratic leaders seek to ensure that their fellow
   citizens can gain political freedom by becoming visible political actors
   with an equal voice. Democratic leaders do not manipulate or dominate,
   but rather try to ensure that the political capacities of their
   followers are cultivated, so that they, too, can be seen and heard.
   Second, instead of seeking to advance their own predetermined goals,
   democratic leaders seek to advance goals that they have in common with
   their fellow citizens. Third, democratic leaders strive to reaffirm and
   reapply what Ellison called ``the principle on which the country was
   built{''} in order to move the citizenry further toward ``the democratic
   ideal.{''}},

Abstract = {Some have argued that the ballot initiative process prevalent in many
   American states might lower inequality. We contend this is improbable
   based on what is known about whether expansion of democracy leads to
   redistribution, the attitudes of citizens, and the characteristics of
   the initiative process. Nevertheless, the proposition needs testing. We
   examine three types of evidence. First, we analyze the content and
   passage of all post-World War II initiatives going to voters in
   California, a state that makes heavy use of ballot propositions. Second,
   we model institutional factors influencing differences in inequality at
   the state-level from 1976-2014 to test the aggregate-level effect of
   ballot initiatives on income inequality. Third, we use individual level
   data to evaluate the claim that frequent initiative use makes lower
   income people happier because it helps to reduce inequality. Our
   analyses consistently indicate that the ballot initiative process fails
   to reduce income inequality.},
