Abstract = {A central question in the debate between ``centripetalists{''} and
   ``consociationalists{''} concerns whether power-sharing arrangements
   provide incentives for moderation. This article helps to formulate an
   empirical answer through an examination of the electoral decline of the
   Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) following the Good Friday
   Agreement (GFA) in the North of Ireland. Drawing on primary qualitative
   interviews with key players, this article argues that the SDLP were
   electoral losers under a system of ethnic out-flanking. Sinn Fein has
   successfully presented itself as the ``greener{''} and more robust
   representative of nationalist interests, whilst simultaneously
   moderating its message and operating the institutions of Northern
   Ireland. Sinn Fein has taken ownership of the GFA and has positioned
   itself as the party best able to ensure its delivery. Sinn Fein's
   rights-based agenda, and vibrant electoral machine, has resonated with
   the nationalist electorate who are less sure of what the contemporary
   SDLP stands for.},

Abstract = {This study introduces a new event dataset on the human rights violations
   in the Kurdish conflict in Turkey perpetrated by both the State and the
   armed rebel group, the PKK (the Kurdistan Workers Party), from 1990 to
   2018. The dataset codes human rights violation events that victimize
   civilians, including women and children, identifying the perpetrator,
   type of victim, type of human right violation, and the place of the
   violation. The categories of human rights violations include the
   physical and political rights drawn from the laws and treaties adopted
   by the U.N., such as killings or deaths of civilians, illegal detention
   and arrests, and freedom of peaceful assembly. The dataset is useful in
   examining the trends and motives of perpetrators in committing these
   violations and for seeking to understand the extent to which state and
   non-state rebel groups abide by international norms in armed conflicts.
   The framework of this dataset, although developed for the Kurdish
   conflict, is applicable and can be extended to other armed conflict
   cases, facilitating cross-conflict research on a more comparative basis.},

Title = {Ambitious or Ambiguous? The Implications of Smart Specialisation for
   Core-Periphery Relations in Estonia and Slovakia},
Journal = {BALTIC JOURNAL OF EUROPEAN STUDIES},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {9},
Number = {4},

Abstract = {The article explores the implications of the smart specialisation
   approach on core-periphery relations in Estonia and Slovakia. Despite
   accounting for one-third of the entire EU budget, Cohesion Policy has
   produced only modest results in achieving its goal of territorial
   cohesion between centres and peripheries. This raises the question of
   the role of Cohesion Policy's current approach-smart specialisation. By
   applying the analytical concept of peripheralisation, the article
   examines how the formulation and implementation of smart specialisation
   is governed in Estonia and Slovakia, both of which are characterised by
   large territorial disparities between the capital region and the rest of
   the country in terms of socio-economic development and participation in
   decision-making. Specifically, the article explores how the smart
   specialisation approach is interpreted domestically in terms of strategy
   formulation, priority-setting and spatial targeting of measures, and
   whether the particular domestic interpretation of smart specialisation
   acknowledges the unequal economic and research and innovation potential
   as well as different institutional capacities of central and peripheral
   regions. Drawing on extensive document analysis and 20 expert interviews
   with policy-makers and stakeholders in Estonia and Slovakia, it is
   argued that while ambitiously promoting an approach of `inclusive
   growth' for the benefit of all regions, the influence of smart
   specialisation on core-periphery relations shows to be ambiguous. Fuzzy
   priority-setting, a lack of strategic and administrative capacities at
   the regional level and inhibiting policy-making routines discourage and,
   at times, prevent such a demanding approach. The article concludes that
   smart specialisation in its current form does not benefit central and
   peripheral regions equally. Rather, its demands in terms of formulation
   and implementation are likely to reinforce the disparities between those
   regions with capacities to handle such an ambitious approach and those
   regions without such capacities.},

Abstract = {Artificial intelligence, neural networks, speech and behavior
   recognition systems, drones, autonomous robotic systems - all of these
   and many other technologies are widely used by the military to create a
   new type of lethal weapon programmed to independently decide to use
   military force. According to experts, production of such weapons will be
   a revolution in military affairs, the same kind of revolution that the
   creation of nuclear weapons made back in the days.
   Adoption of fully autonomous combat systems raises a number of ethical
   and legal issues, the major of which is a destruction of a supposed
   enemy's manpower by a robot without a human command This article focuses
   on the legal aspects of creating autonomous combat systems, their legal
   status and the prospects of creating an international document
   prohibiting lethal robotic technologies.
   As the result of the study, the authors came to a conclusion that there
   is no direct legal restriction on the use of fully autonomous combat
   systems, however, the use of such weapons contradicts the doctrinal
   norms of international law. The authors also believe that a
   comprehensive ban on the development, use and distribution of robotic
   technologies is hardly possible in the foreseeable future. The most
   possible scenario for solving the problem at an international level is
   only a ban on the use of this type of military equipment directly during
   an operational activity of an armed conflict. At the same time, the
   authors consider it necessary to outline the acceptable areas of
   application of robotic technologies: medical and logistical support of
   military operations, military construction, the use of mine clearing
   robots and similar humanistically justified measures.},

Abstract = {To what extent do personality traits and media exposure explain
   political ideology? How important is authoritarian information control
   in structuring political attitudes relative to individual-level factors?
   This article evaluates the sources of political ideology using survey
   data from over 10,000 in internet users in China. Consistent with the
   literature, we find that both personality traits and media exposure are
   significantly associated with one's expressed ideological orientation.
   However prior individual-level personality traits appear to have a
   larger impact than information exposure and may cause citizens to
   self-select media information. This means that media effects have a
   differential impact on individuals, with authoritarian personalities
   being more prone to reinforce their views with propaganda. This research
   highlights important ways that personality mediates information
   exposure, helps to explain the micro-foundations that shape
   authoritarian control at an individual level, explains the efficacy of
   propaganda techniques, as well as the mechanisms of political pluralism

Abstract = {Under open-list proportional representation (OLPR), individual
   candidates compete for personal votes and representation has a
   distinctly individualistic dimension. This article provides a unique
   analysis of this individualistic representational dimension, by
   comparing the effects of policy positions with personal vote-earning
   attributes on individual electoral success within the context of the
   Finnish OLPR. The study confirms that personal attributes related to
   experience, locality and celebrity status have a strong positive effect
   on candidates' ability to attract personal votes. On a more novel
   account, it also demonstrates that even under decidedly complex
   electoral settings, policy positions matter for candidates' electoral
   fortunes, and that candidates who take on moderate positions within the
   context of their respective party are more successful than candidates
   who deviate from the party-median.},

Abstract = {Progressive actors are losing the battle to protect LGBT and
   reproductive rights from conservative claims of a right to religious
   discrimination. Increasingly, we are witnessing legal challenges
   premised on the ground that religious actors' First Amendment rights and
   women's and LGBT rights to equal protection and public accommodation are
   in conflict. This article contextualizes so-called ``competing
   rights{''} claims within a longer political and legal history. We
   utilize a discursive institutionalist framework to assess the strategies
   used both by conservative political actors promoting a ``competing
   rights{''} agenda and by LGBT activists focused on narrative change and
   marriage equality. Finding the limited strategy adopted by marriage
   equality activists cannot effectively withstand the legal challenge
   mounted by those claiming ``competing rights,{''} we propose a new
   strategy for resistance premised on a strict interpretation of
   church/state separation and suggest a strategy for preserving and
   expanding public accommodation law through the creation of
   intersectional coalitions.},

Journal = {CONTEMPORARY POLITICAL THEORY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {19},
Number = {4},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Recent theories of community (Nancy, Agamben, Esposito) aim to think the
   term beyond its definition as the ownership of shared identity,
   language, culture or territory. For Esposito, to reduce community to a
   property whose possession distinguishes members from non-members
   undermines the commonality the term implies. The common opposes what is
   proper or one's own; it belongs to everyone and anyone. Rather than
   securing identity and belonging, community, defined by its impropriety,
   disrupts them so that we are in common. While his work successfully
   illustrates the incompatibility of the common and the proper, it leaves
   unanswered the question of how communities come to experience their
   impropriety. Through a comparison with Ranciere's improper community, we
   can identify and gesture beyond this limit. Its members intervene in
   proper communities by exercising the right to decide on common matters
   despite officially having no right to do so. Their actions, by
   demonstrating the openness of the common to anyone and everyone, turn
   its privatisation into a shared wrong that connects community with
   non-community. By supplementing Esposito's work with Ranciere's, we see
   how communities relate to what they have deemed improper in a way that
   both challenges and revitalises their sense of commonality.},

Abstract = {This paper illustrates how concepts of mental disorder have been
   deployed to medicalize negative emotions and, thereby, weaken the
   political agency of some individuals. First, I theorise the link between
   political agency and emotions, arguing that effective political action
   entails the transformation of emotions into public issues. Using the
   British referendum on membership in the EU as a case study, I then
   examine how medically loaded terms and rhetoric were used to describe
   suffering after the vote. Finally, I argue that this generated
   conditions that interrupted or even reversed the transformation of
   subjective experiences into politically meaningful issues.},

Abstract = {Conventional wisdom holds that interest group access to the European
   Commission is biased in favor of specific interests and against diffuse
   interests. Yet, patterns of access vary between policy areas. In this
   article, I map and explain the relative access of specific and diffuse
   interests to the European Commission's expert groups. I find that
   specific interests gain more access in general, but there are
   considerable variations across issues. I argue that variations in access
   across expert groups are explained by the relative ability of specific
   and diffuse interests to contest policies in different policy areas.
   This argument gains support by statistical analyses using a novel
   dataset comprising all expert groups with interest group participants.
   The findings suggest that a political logic helps explain variations in
   specific and diffuse interest access to the Commission.},

Abstract = {When does self-interest influence public opinion on contentious public
   policies? The bulk of theory in political science suggests that
   self-interest is only a minor force in public opinion. Using nationally
   representative survey data, we show how financial and spatial
   self-interest and partisanship all shape public opinion on opioid
   treatment policy. We find that a majority of respondents support a
   redistributive funding model for treatment programs, while treatment
   funded by taxation based on a community's overdose rate is less popular.
   Moreover, financial self-interest cross-pressures lower-income
   Republicans, closing the partisan gap in support by more than half.
   Wealso experimentally test how the spatial burden of siting treatment
   clinics alters policy preferences. People across the political spectrum
   are less supportive when construction of a clinic is proposed closer to
   their home. These results highlight how partisanship and self-interest
   interact in shaping preferences on public policy with concentrated
   burdens.},

Journal = {POLITICAL STUDIES REVIEW},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {17},
Number = {4},

Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Realists in normative political theory aim to defend the importance of
   `distinctively political thought' as opposed to the applied ethics they
   believe characterizes much contemporary political theory and causes it
   to misunderstand and make mistakes about its subject matter. More
   conventional political theorists have attempted to respond to realism,
   including Jonathan Leader Maynard and Alex Worsnip, who have recently
   criticized five supposedly realist arguments for a distinctive political
   normativity. However, while Leader Maynard and Worsnip's arguments are
   themselves less decisive than they suppose, the problem with their
   response may lay elsewhere. Their response supposes that more
   conventional political theory could, in principle, be defended at an
   abstract general level. This may not be possible though, given the
   difficulty of arriving at agreed interpretations of the concepts
   involved and the desiderata for a successful normative political theory.
   It also risks missing the point of realism, which is to use different
   forms of normative inquiry to explore questions which have not always
   been central to conventional normative political theory. Judith Shklar's
   excellent work on vices and the liberalism of fear nicely illustrates
   this problem.},

Abstract = {Should political theorists engage in ethnography? In this letter, we
   assess a recent wave of interest in ethnographyamongpolitical
   theoristsand explainwhyit is a goodthing. Wefocus, in particular, on how
   ethnographic research generates what Ian Shapiro calls ``problematizing
   redescriptions{''}-accounts of political phenomena that destabilize the
   lens through which we traditionally study them, engendering novel
   questions and exposing new avenues of moral concern. We argue that (1)
   by revealing new levels of variation and contingency within familiar
   political phenomena, ethnography can uncover topics ripe for normative
   inquiry; (2) by shedding light on what meanings people associate with
   political values, it can advance our reflection on concepts; and (3) by
   capturing the experience of individuals at grips with the social world,
   it can attune us to forms of harm that would otherwise remain hidden.
   The purchase for political theory is considerable. By thickening our
   understanding of institutions, ethnography serves as an antidote to
   analytic specialization and broadens the range of questions political
   theorists can ask, reinvigorating debates in the subfield and forging
   connections with the discipline writ large.},

   within the wide bibliography that we find regarding of rage, I
   temporarily bring two discussions; the first one of Seneca in On Anger;
   the second, by Brian Massumi in his interview book The Politics of
   Affect. Thirdly, I immerse myself in some of the discussions that we
   find throughout Sloterdijk's book and try to draw the paths that

Volume = {41},

Pages = {22-34},

Abstract = {In light of recent developments such as the African Continental African
   Free Trade Area agreement (AfCFTA), incrementalist approaches to
   regional integration that focus on sub-regions seem to have been pushed
   to the backburner as more focus puts the entire African continent at the
   centre of integration processes. With all its potential, gradual
   macro-economic convergence has accordingly been neglected. Discussions
   on macro-economic convergence have on the other hand been cast over the
   broader sub-region such as the Southern African Development Community
   (SADC) where a number of indicators and targets have been identified and
   pursued closely. Whilst looking at Botswana as a point of departure,
   this paper argues that incremental macro-economic convergence is pivotal
   to broader regional integration and the Southern African Customs Union
   (SACU) provides an ideal stepping-stone. An incrementalist approach to
   macro-economic convergence as well as broader regional integration
   should begin with identifying key formal institutions that serve as
   custodians of macro-economic policy such as the central banks and
   departments of finance or treasuries. Using secondary data sources, with
   Botswana as a case study, this paper foregrounds macro-economic
   convergence, macro-economic policy making institutions, and SACU as
   critical building blocks for broader regional integration.},

Abstract = {There is now an awakening to and recognition of the emotionally complex
   lives of some non-human animals. While their forms of consciousness may
   vary, some are indeed conscious and deserve political consideration.
   What that political consideration ought to be is the central topic of
   this article. First, I argue that interspecies justice must be
   understood in terms of the relationships that foster individual
   flourishing of all concerned. The obstacles to such flourishing are the
   five faces of oppression famously identified by Iris Marion Young:
   exploitation, marginalization, powerlessness, cultural imperialism, and
   violence. By extending Young's concept of the social group to intra- and
   interspecies groups, we become more attuned to differences between and
   among species. Theorizing the existence of interspecies groups brings
   forward new avenues to explore oppression and simultaneously theorize
   its opposite - interspecies justice. Second, I argue that a positive
   theory of interspecies flourishing (for human and non-human alike) can
   be developed on the basis of Marx's materialist philosophy and
   reclamation of species-being. Though Marx uses humanist language
   throughout the Economic and Philosophic Manuscripts of 1844, attention
   to his methodological commitments reveals that some non-human animals
   can no longer be excluded from the capability of flourishing and
   species-being. Some non-human animals are conscious, act purposefully,
   and labor creatively and must be included in our circle of moral and
   political concern.},

Abstract = {What are the effects of party defections on the attitudes of politicians
   who remain loyal to the party? We answer by combining multiple sources
   of data into a comprehensive novel data set on parliamentary party
   switching, to estimate how this affects the perceived distance between a
   politician and his party. Focusing on the theory of cognitive dissonance
   and the black sheep effect, we hypothesize that politicians perceive
   themselves closer to their parties when those parties recently suffered
   defections. The effect should be greater among incumbent politicians as
   they directly experience divisions, but also among officials
   dissatisfied with the leadership as their dissonance should be stronger.
   Statistical analyses of data from two elite surveys, on a sample of
   13,256 politicians belonging to 92 parties that ran in 28 elections held
   between 2005 and 2015 in 14 countries, provide support for our
   hypotheses and shed light on the consequences of intra-party defections.},

Abstract = {Theoretical and empirical evidence suggest that how elites talk about
   race may shape mass racial attitudes. But current work limits
   understanding this possibility by not systematically characterizing
   elite rhetoric on race. To shed light on the nature of racially liberal
   and conservative elite rhetoric, and therefore the potential for elites
   to shape mass racial attitudes, I analyze transcripts from two partisan
   news shows: The Rachel Maddow Show and The O'Reilly Factor. Pairing a
   case study with text-as-data methods, I provide insight into themes
   constituting racially liberal and conservative elite discourse. Racial
   liberals like Maddow emphasize that race matters-racial bias and
   discrimination still shape nonwhites' life chances. In contrast, racial
   conservatives like O'Reilly contend that race does not shape life
   chances and serves only as an attention-seeking device. Identifying
   these divides helps shed light on the origins and dynamics of mass
   racial attitudes.},

Abstract = {The pattern of intergovernmental relations (IGR) on immigrant
   integration in Canada runs counter to core arguments in the extant
   literature. In particular, Canada's federal structures have not produced
   multilateral, institutionalized, and conflictual IGR; IGR in Canada has
   been predominantly bilateral and only moderately institutionalized.
   Moreover, IGR has been conflictual at times, while collaborative at
   others. Several factors explain this unexpected pattern. In an attempt
   to ward off separatism, the central government devolved authority over
   immigrant selection and settlement programmes to Quebec, creating a deep
   asymmetry between Quebec and the Anglophone provinces (and territories)
   in these areas. Interprovincial competition drove other provinces to
   seek powers over immigration and integration. The central government -
   driven by fiscal pressures and a philosophical commitment to symmetry -
   struck bilateral agreements with Anglophone provinces to fund and
   devolve settlement programming and some control over the selection of
   economic immigrants.},

Abstract = {Research suggests that the ability of the president to influence public
   attention to issues and shape public opinion is limited. Recently,
   presidential efforts at persuasion have expanded to social media, but
   presidential persuasion has yet to be explored in this medium. We
   address two relevant questions. First, what effects does a presidential
   tweet have on public interest in the issue discussed in the tweet?
   Second, what effect does a presidential tweet have on public attitudes
   about that issue? To answer these questions, we utilize a natural
   experiment that occurred while we were fielding a nationally
   representative survey of American adults. Our analysis provides
   considerable evidence that presidential tweets can have the unintended
   consequence of driving the public away from the president's position on
   an issue.},

Abstract = {Election campaigns in democratic South Africa have been eventful
   affairs. Despite the electoral dominance of the African National
   Congress (ANC) since 1994, political parties in South Africa have
   campaigned fiercely. At face value then, it would appear that election
   campaigns constitute an integral and valuable part of South Africa's
   democratic system. Yet, at the same time, following the 1994 elections
   and given the racialized dynamics of South Africa's electoral landscape,
   a view has emerged that does not regard South African voters as active
   agents consuming relevant political information. This view, which sees
   voters as guided primarily by symbolic or identity concerns, was
   strongly challenged by several analysts. However, the question as to
   whether election campaigns are relevant in the South African context
   still remains. In this article, I examine the relevance of campaigning
   in the South African context. I focus on the African National Congress
   (ANC), the Democratic Party (DP)/Democratic Alliance (DA), Inkatha
   Freedom Party (IFP) and the National Party (NP) /New National Party
   (NNP). I argue that campaign messaging and party credibility are
   important contributors of performance at the polls. Inconsistent and
   contradictory campaign messages, poor decisions and destructive
   behaviour had substantial repercussions for parties at the polls.},

Abstract = {The commonly shared sentiment that human rights have reached a crisis in
   the form of a populist backlash has produced a vibrant discussion on the
   causes of and solutions to the crisis. This article seeks to contribute
   to that discussion by engaging with Philip Alston's important and
   influential essay on the topic, and in particular with his project of
   tackling material inequality. While agreeing with Alston that a key
   reason for the populist backlash is material inequality, the article
   challenges his view that the solution to the problem is to double down
   on `familiar strategies' by simply providing social and economic rights
   a more prominent position within the human rights project. By contrast,
   the article suggests that a radical renewal of the human rights movement
   is called for - one accompanied by a more elaborate diagnosis of how
   human rights have been linked to inequalities and how they can engage
   with the structures and actors producing those inequalities. Trying to
   understand why human rights have lost ground to nationalism, the article
   suggests that a first step towards such more radical and dynamic human
   rights might be to unearth the now largely forgotten concept of
   solidarity.},

Abstract = {Political Science research on the President?s role in South African
   politics has been limited and therefore poses a research challenge. In
   this article, the President?s election by the National Assembly is
   linked to a number of factors. The legislative electoral system has a
   direct impact on it; also, South Africa?s government is a hybrid,
   presidential/parliamentary system; and political party electoral
   procedures are followed to elect party leaders. The presidential
   electoral system has several implications for legislative-executive
   relations, including presidential accountability, approval of the
   Presidency?s budget by Parliament, and Parliament?s power to remove the
   President from office. Special attention is paid to the 2019 party
   campaigns, to the extent of their co-existence with presidential
   campaigns, and to the parliamentary electoral procedure. Conclusions
   identify the implications of the fact that the President?s election is
   primarily determined by the power balance between the main political
   parties. Especially since 2007, it is also determined by internal party
   dynamics.},

Abstract = {The conventional wisdom suggests that women have less political ambition
   than men. The notion that women can solve the problem of their political
   underrepresentation by just ?leaning in? also informs candidate training
   programs. This article links scholarship on women's candidate emergence
   to new research on women's candidate training programs, reaching three
   conclusions about the gender ambition gap. First, institutional,
   organizational, and structural barriers limit women's access to elected
   office more than their psychological predispositions. Second, most
   candidate training programs cannot address these systemic barriers.
   Third, the ?lean in? frame reinforces notions that men are inherently
   capable, while women must overcome deficiencies in confidence or skills
   or both.},

Abstract = {How do international institutions affect political liberalization in
   member states? Motivated by an examination of the World Bank loans
   program, this article shows that institutions can incentivize
   liberalization by offering opportunities for countries to become
   associated with advanced, wealthy members. In the World Bank, when a
   loan recipient reaches a specified level of economic development, it
   becomes eligible to graduate from borrower status to lender status.
   Using a regression discontinuity design, the study demonstrates that
   this incentive motivates states to improve their domestic behavior with
   respect to human rights and democracy. Combining qualitative and
   quantitative evidence, the results suggest that the desire to become a
   member of this elite group is responsible for motivating member states
   to reform due to the belief that such membership brings diffuse
   international and domestic benefits.},

Abstract = {Is the possession of taste relevant to the practice of moral and
   political judgement? For Mary Wollstonecraft and many of her
   contemporaries, the formation of taste was increasingly significant for
   both ethics and politics. In fact, some of the key contributors to the
   debate, which I have termed the `politics of taste', believed that
   fostering existing standards of taste promised a palliative to modern
   democratic ills that they diagnosed. Wollstonecraft is an immanent
   critic of such positions. Although she shares some of Edmund Burke's and
   David Hume's assumptions, she proposes dramatic revision of the extant
   model of refined taste driven by the spread of rational education. In
   this way, she attempts to rescue `true taste' from its sentimental
   context - one permeated by false assumptions about femininity and class.
   For Wollstonecraft, `true taste' must be the product of refined
   understanding. Only then can it be deemed a support rather than a
   hindrance to the practice of moral and political judgement. Although
   recent Wollstonecraft scholarship has emphasised the depth of her
   engagement with Scottish Enlightenment thought, using Hume as a primary
   interlocutor with Wollstonecraft, especially on the question of taste,
   is yet unprecedented. This approach, Wollstonecraft's immanent critique
   of taste, yields arguments about taste that are especially complex and
   philosophically interesting, both in her time and ours.},

Abstract = {If self is related to being in a place, it is a fact that narratives
   special to the self, have also occurred in a place. Therefore,
   understanding youth will be possible by analyzing the place experienced
   by them. Within the framework of this approach, this study focuses on
   how young people living in Trabzon transform the city into a place of
   social belonging. In Trabzon, young people build a sense of belonging to
   the city mostly through mythicalized narratives, past memories and
   places they have experienced on the basis of being Trabzonspor
   supporters. Trabzon provides an intense feeling of inner belonging for
   young people who experience it. This feeling causes them to feel safe in
   this place, which they consider as home.
   This study is derived from the author's doctoral thesis and is based on
   its field data. This study attempts to explain the meaning attributed to
   the city by Trabzonlu young people from a sociological perspective. For
   this purpose, multiple scientific research techniques such as
   questionnaires, interviews and documentation were used. Basically, the
   approach of hermeneutics which uses qualitative research methods has
   been adopted and the data, obtained through the examination of in-depth
   interviews and visual, audio and written documents' analysis, has been
   supported by a questionnaire consisting of closed-ended questions.},

Abstract = {Historically, vouchers, which provide a sum of money to parents for
   private education, were tools of racist oppression; but in recent
   decades some advocates claim them as ``the civil rights issue of our
   time.{''} This article brings an analytic-historical perspective rooted
   in racial orders to understand how education vouchers have been
   reincarnated and reinvented since the Jim Crow era. Combining original
   primary research with statistical analysis, we identify multiple
   concurrent and consecutive transformations in voucher politics in three
   arenas of racial policy alliance contestation: expansion of color-blind
   policy designs, growing legal and political support from a conservative
   alliance, and a smorgasbord of voucher rationales rooted in color-blind
   framing. This approach demonstrates that education vouchers have never
   been racially neutral but served key roles with respect to prevailing
   racial hierarchies and contests.},

   in Indonesia and how the quality of local governance may affect it.
   While research on asymmetric decentralization has developed very
   significantly, only limited attention has been paid to the determinants
   of success, especially the role governance plays. This aims to fill the
   gap by using the case of Indonesia. It qualitatively assesses the
   outcomes of asymmetric decentralization in four provinces: Papua, Papua
   Barat, Aceh, and Yogyakarta. It finds that there is strong variation
   among these provinces in achieving asymmetric goals. This variation is
   explained by the quality of governance, especially the degree of
   accountability and transparency of the local governments. This article
   concludes that the quality of local governance has a very significant
   effect on the achievement of asymmetric decentralization. This is also a
   practical message for advocates to further improve the quality of
   governance for asymmetric decentralization to be successful.},

Abstract = {Territorial disputes are prone to conflict because of the value of
   territory to publics, whether due to its strategic and material worth,
   or to its intangible, symbolic value. Yet despite the implications of
   the distinction for both theory and policy, empirically disentangling
   the material from the symbolic has posed formidable methodological
   challenges. We propose a set of tools for assessing the nature of
   individual territorial attachment, drawing on a series of survey
   experiments in Israel. Using these tools, we find that a substantial
   segment of the Jewish population is attached to the disputed West Bank
   territory for intangible reasons, consisting not only of far-right
   voters but also of voters of moderate-right and centrist parties. This
   distribution considerably narrows the bargaining space of leaders
   regardless of coalitional configurations. Our empirical analysis thus
   illustrates how the distribution of territorial preferences in the
   domestic population can have powerful implications for conflict and its
   resolution.},

Title = {A new ``nuclear normalcy{''}?},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL THEORY},
Year = {2019},

Abstract = {This article focuses on a part of the ``nuclear condition{''} that is
   often overlooked in philosophical discussions: that of materiality.
   Connecting the spheres of nuclear weapons (and associated security
   threats), and of nuclear power generation (and associated safety
   concerns), are the materials that bombs and electricity can be made of,
   and the machines that produce either enriched uranium or plutonium. We
   now have evidence of just how fragile the machines and devices were (and
   are) that sustained the nuclear age, but also how tenuous and artificial
   the boundary is that we assume between ``peaceful{''} and ``military{''}
   purposes. And yet, each new ``nuclear deal{''} affirms this boundary,
   and the possibility of its existence. While the community of scholars
   and policymakers who prioritize nuclear security strive to label as many
   steps of the process as ``special,{''} and therefore subject to
   inspection, accounting, and international control, multinational power
   companies and national nuclear industries promote ``technical fixes{''}
   for lingering safety concerns, and advance the opposite strategy: to
   ``normalize{''} many processes to the point of including severe accident
   response into the industry's business-as-usual. The article argues that
   different kinds of ``nuclearities{''} have increasingly become accepted
   as ``normal{''}: on one hand, international diplomacy that foregrounds
   legal and regulatory strategies to nip potential nuclear weapons
   programs in the bud, and on the other, national nuclear power programs
   growing their fleets and attempting to expand their market reach. By
   accepting the divide between the ``security community{''} and the
   ``safety community{''} as the new ``nuclear normalcy,{''} the shared
   nuclear materiality threatens to slip out of view, or at the very least,
   out of focus.},

Abstract = {Policy preferences have been shown to differ by sex within the
   electorate and among public officials. We explore whether-in a context
   of budgetary restraints-sex differences in budgetary preferences prevail
   among council members in Flemish municipalities. We find convincing
   evidence of sex-related differences. To fight a budget deficit, female
   politicians express a relative preference for increasing public
   revenues. Male politicians prefer to lower expenditures. Crucially,
   preferences also differ with respect to the nature of revenue increases
   and expenditure decreases. Once the option to increase revenues is
   chosen, women prefer the ability-to-pay principle, whereas men express a
   preference for the benefit principle. If, on the other hand, a decrease
   in expenditures is chosen, women prefer to narrow the scope of
   government intervention more than men, while men prefer a reduction in
   operating costs.},

Title = {Pathways to trump: Republican voters in 2016},
Journal = {ELECTORAL STUDIES},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {61},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {The 2016 candidacy of Donald Trump has drawn considerable interest among
   social scientists and it invites a broader investigation into analyzing
   the dynamics of primary elections. We identify four key popular accounts
   that supposedly explained Trump's support: authoritarianism, populism,
   ethnic prejudice, and trade and immigration attitudes, most of which are
   associated with an argument about support for Trump in the white working
   class. With a unique survey panel to explore changing support for
   Republican presidential candidates over the primary season, we test
   these competing theories and examine their fit to the pattern of support
   and opposition to Trump before and after the primaries. We find that
   populist attitudes and anti -Muslim bias were considerably more
   important than authoritarian dispositions, and immigration and trade
   policy attitudes in explaining support for Trump among Republicans
   during the 2016 primary season. We demonstrate how Trump's supporters
   became more diverse as they increased in numbers over the primary
   season, but new supporters were not a representative sample of
   Republicans who initially supported other candidates.},

Abstract = {Do citizens view state and traditional authorities as substitutes or
   complements? Past work has been divided on this question. Some scholars
   point to competition between attitudes toward these entities, suggesting
   substitution, whereas others highlight positive correlations, suggesting
   complementarity. Addressing this question, however, is difficult, as it
   requires assessing the effects of exogenous changes in the latent
   valuation of one authority on an individual's support for another. We
   show that this quantity-a type of elasticity-cannot be inferred from
   correlations between support for the two forms of authority. We employ a
   structural model to estimate this elasticity of substitution using data
   from 816 villages in the Democratic Republic of Congo and plausibly
   exogenous rainfall and conflict shocks. Despite prima facie evidence for
   substitution logics, our model's outcomes are consistent with
   complementarity; positive changes in citizen valuation of the chief
   appear to translate into positive changes in support for the government.},

Abstract = {The 2018 Italian election produced striking results, with both a
   historic success for the two challenger parties (League and M5S) and
   massive defeats for the two mainstream parties (PD and FI). This article
   analyses party campaign strategies and their consistency with the
   opportunity structures provided by the configuration of Italian public
   opinion. Relying on issue-yield theory, original survey data were
   collected for both issue support and priority among Italian voters, and
   party emphases on issues in the electoral campaign ? through Twitter
   data. The findings indicate a generalised ideological inconsistency of
   the constituencies of the main parties, while campaign strategies appear
   much more ideologically consistent. Moreover, it is found that parties
   focused mostly on conflict-mobilisation strategies, rather than on
   problem solving. Finally, the article shows that, in general, parties
   acted strategically, by aligning their campaign to the available
   opportunities, although with relevant variations across parties.},

Abstract = {One explanation for why voters sometimes fail to hold elected officials
   accountable for corruption is failure to correctly attribute blame. Yet
   existing theories of how voters attribute responsibility do not consider
   how voters assessments may be shaped by the possibility that politicians
   can strategically delegate corrupt activity. This paper develops a
   formal model of an electoral accountability environment where
   politicians can pursue malfeasance directly or indirectly, but where
   `rogue agents' occasionally pursue malfeasance independently. Corruption
   can arise via multiple pathways, and politicians sometimes possess
   plausible deniability. In one equilibrium, voters rationally reelect
   after plausibly deniable corruption due to a non-obvious and novel
   mechanism. Politicians are also more likely to delegate malfeasance to
   agents when they anticipate lenience. Voter lenience is
   non-monotonically related to many parameters, including politician
   competence, the agent's malfeasance preferences, and transparency.},

Abstract = {In an apparently post-truth era, the social science scholar, by
   disposition and training committed to rational argumentation and the
   pursuit of truth, appeals as the ideal bulwark against excessive
   politicization of facts and expertise. In this article, we look to the
   experience of four prominent social scientists who have recently left
   the academy to enter politics with the aim of using their academic
   expertise to reshape policy. We use these cases to explore fundamental
   dilemmas derived from a close reading of Max Weber's seminal vocation
   essays of a century ago. Weber observed that politicians were driven by
   a will to power, whereas academics were driven by a will to truth. We
   argue that these two competing dispositions create four tensions for the
   academic turned politician: (1) between calling and commitment, (2)
   between means and ends, (3) between rationalization and
   professionalization and (4) between facts and values. Analysing memoirs
   written by four of the most prominent academics-turned-politicians in
   recent times, we explore how Weber's tensions manifest in contemporary
   practice. Our account reveals that these actors face a daunting, but not
   impossible, task. Their success depends on wedding the relentless
   pursuit of ends with the prudent application of political means.},

Abstract = {The introduction of legislative television as a transparency initiative
   has been welcomed in an increasing number of democracies. The impact of
   television cameras on parliamentary behavior, however, has received
   scant attention in systems where personal vote-earning attributes are
   thought to be of little importance (e.g., closed-list proportional
   representation). Additionally, studies examining this relationship
   relied exclusively on over-time variation in legislative behavior (i.e.,
   before and after the introduction of television into parliament), which
   arguably has important deficiencies in demonstrating the true effect of
   legislative television. Capitalizing on a unique quasi-experimental
   setting, the present study aims to close these gaps in the literature by
   analyzing parliamentary activities in Turkey, where the legislative
   television was restricted to 3 days per week (Tuesday, Wednesday, and
   Thursday) in 2011 after almost two decades of continuous 7-day
   operation. Results based on original data sets of parliamentary
   activities from the pre- and postreform periods (2009-11 and 2011-13)
   indicate that the varying presence of television cameras exacerbated the
   effect of electoral and reputation-building motivations on parliamentary
   behavior, encouraging electorally unsafe and junior MPs to shift their
   constituency focus to the televised proceedings. The results offer
   important implications for the study of legislative transparency and
   constituency representation in party-list proportional representation
   systems.},

Abstract = {This paper explores the role of public engagement in the budgetary
   process in Bangladesh. It particularly focuses on the role of the
   Parliamentary Caucus on National Planning and Budget ( PCNPB) and its
   relations with different Civil Society Organisations (CSOs) which
   provide different kinds of support to MPs. Evidence shows that the
   strategic partnership that the PCNPB has established with different
   outside organisations have turned out to be beneficial in various ways.
   There is now better scope for `informed' scrutiny of the budget than
   before, although it is difficult to measure its effects. The paper
   delineates problems that may discourage the institutionalisation of the
   PCNPB. It also identifies factors that may help it overcome the
   problems.},

   how cyber-attacks have been used to undermine electoral process, to

   media can constitute a `virtual infiltration' and `virtual occupation'
   of the information domain. The article then explores how cyber-attacks
   conducted during the conflict in Ukraine have limited or otherwise
   affected freedom of expression. We argue that the wider effects of cyber
   operations on political, civil and human rights have been underexplored
   in the cyber security literature; that cyber-attacks have adversely
   affected freedom of expression in the conflict in Ukraine and in other
   political disputes; and that the coercion concept is ill-suited to
   accounting for the socio-psychological impact of modern cyber
   operations.},

Volume = {18},

Abstract = {In January 2018, two different large-scale simulation games on the
   European Union's decision-making process took place in Brussels. This
   study aims to bring systematic empirical evidence from both EuroSim and
   SUNY Model EU, two active learning experiences that gather around 300
   international participants. The intention is to scrutinize whether
   specific student attributes generate differential effects on the
   learning outcomes. These involve cognitive outcomes and affective
   outcomes. The first type refers to participant's level of knowledge and
   understanding about the EU policy-making dynamics. The second type
   reflects on participants' overall interest and motivation upon the EU.
   The data were obtained through a post-game survey method based on
   stratified sampling. The results point at affective outcomes as the most
   salient learning outcomes of the simulations. In relation to
   participants' features, the data reveal country of origin and gender as
   good performance-enhancers for students of non-EU origin and for the
   female cohort. All in all, in order to increase the usefulness of
   large-scale simulations, more attention needs to be given to participant
   selection and role attribution, as well as post-simulation debriefing or
   focus groups.},

Abstract = {The literatures on INGOs and on interest groups have generally worked in
   parallel, but rarely overlapped. This is unfortunate, as many insights
   from these literatures are highly applicable to one another. Just as
   sociologists studying social movement organisations and political
   scientists studying interest groups have come to appreciate, there is
   value in cooperation to advance understanding. Yet there are costs in so
   doing. This essay will reflect on the contents of this special issue on
   global governance and in so doing will review the points of overlap that
   are prime candidates for cooperation, while noting areas where work
   might be more difficult.},

Abstract = {This article examines the recent backlash against Israeli human rights
   and advocacy NGOs led jointly by right-wing organizations, by mainstream
   media, and by the government. Contrarily to what was theorized in the
   literature dedicated to movement/countermovement dynamics, it suggests
   that the birth and rise of ultra-nationalist movements created in
   reaction to domestic NGOs dealing with the consequences of the
   occupation cannot be explained by the achievements of the latter or by
   the threats they pose locally to segments of the Israeli population.
   Rather, this article shows they are an indirect consequence of recent
   global developments mainly stemming from the Palestinian
   internationalization strategy. Yet, these developments have strong
   effects not only at the international level but also at the local level.
   One of them lies in the fact that NGOs are now presented as ``foreign
   agents{''} for obliquely nurturing voices that speak up worldwide
   against Israeli policy.},

Abstract = {The surprising election of Donald Trump to the presidency calls for a
   comprehensive assessment of what motivated voters to opt for a
   controversial political novice rather than a provocative but experienced
   political veteran. Our study provides a novel exploration of the Trump
   victory through the prism of the defeated candidate-Hillary Rodham
   Clinton (HRC). Losing candidates' perceptions are usually not subject to
   academic analyses. Nevertheless, these people often hold substantial
   sway in their parties and thus understanding their views on the loss is
   essential, especially as a party regroups after defeat. Using HRC's
   memoir What Happened, we devise the Hillary Hypotheses, her rationale
   for her electoral defeat. Using the 2016 American National Election
   Study (ANES), we provide the first systematic test of a losing
   candidate's rationale for their defeat. We show that more often than
   not, HRC's assumptions are supported. However, we find little evidence
   to support HRC's most crucial assertion, namely that the e-mail scandal
   and specifically James Comey's intervention ten days before Election Day
   cost her the presidency. Our findings have implications for
   understanding why Donald Trump won, but more broadly the contribution
   explores an understudied aspect of elections-a defeated candidate's
   impression of their loss.},

Abstract = {The key idea of the study is the question of the relationship between
   such categories as ``national sovereignty{''} and ``cyberspace{''}. The
   authors consider that the current theory of law and positive legal
   regulation at the present stage do not offer reasonable options for
   interaction and coexistence of these concepts.
   In the conditions of the dramatic changes in the existing realities over
   the past 30 years, the question arises of the differentiation of legal
   regulation, which is still more intended to the social relations that
   existed in the 20th century. Today technical progress is significantly
   ahead of social, in particular, legal regulation, which, in turn, is
   seriously tied to the state or, as any law student confirms,
   ``territorial organization of power in a society with
   sovereignty...{''}. And here the main question arises about the
   reasonableness of the above formulation. Is it suitable for existing
   realities? Or is it itself an obstacle to legalization? The article
   analyzes various approaches to the legal settlement of relations in
   cyberspace, as well as offers two options for supranational regulation
   of these legal relations - through the development and establishment of
   an extraterritorial international body that will have not only the
   ability to control public relations within cyberspace, but also special
   instruments of coercion to influence the citizens of any state, either
   through the creation of a global system of international acts that will
   regulate most of the existing questions about the interaction of persons
   in cyberspace and included a clear mechanism to respond quickly to the
   emergence of new relations in this sphere.
   The authors also consider that the inability at theoretical level to
   conceptualize the relationship between these categories could lead to
   the discrediting of such notions as ``national state{''} and ``national
   sovereignty{''} in the future.},

Title = {Discovering the Senate's Fundamental Nature: Moving beyond the Supreme
   Court's 2014 Opinion},

Abstract = {In the 2014 reference, the Supreme Court sought to discover the Senate's
   ``essential nature{''} in order to determine what reforms parliament
   could legislate unilaterally. Making use of a classification model found
   in comparative and historical studies, the Court concluded that the
   Senate was a ``complementary legislative body of sober second
   thought.{''} This article re-examines the Court's narrow definition of
   the Senate's perceived role and presents evidence that its essential
   characteristics are direct continuations of various pre-Confederation
   design principles. Limiting a description of its architecture to a
   single model that eclipses all other roles the Senate may play shifts
   the debate on Senate reform, which in the recent past has laid emphasis

Abstract = {Religion shapes people's identity and behaviour, and thus influences
   their foreign-policy views. Yet, existing research has thus far not
   explored this issue in depth or cross-nationally. This article
   contributes to filling this gap by examining the effects of religious
   belief, belonging, and behaviour on people's foreign-policy views across
   a large sample of countries. Further, it investigates how these effects
   are influenced by religions' social standing and countries' income
   level. The study finds that religion significantly heightens followers'
   militant internationalist views. Its effect on cooperative
   internationalist views is more ambiguous. Frequent religious attendance,
   self-identification as a religious person, and adherence to Islam tend
   to make people more altruistic in their foreign-policy views, while
   affiliation with Christianity and other religious faiths (Hinduism,
   Buddhism, etc.) may have the opposite effect. Overall, religion has a
   stronger effect on foreign-policy views among adherents to majority
   religions and in poorer countries.},

Abstract = {Since Tocqueville linked the quality of democracy in America to its
   vibrant civic culture, studies have explored the relationship between
   social capital and the quality of governance. Yet, few have examined the
   mechanisms between individual components of social capital and democracy
   in depth. This study focuses on the link between one component of social
   capital, civil society engagement, and the linkage between public
   opinion and policy. It argues that engagement in associations with an
   interest in the policy issue may stimulate correspondence between public
   opinion and policy through their ability to collect and disseminate
   information to policy makers and the public. The analysis of 20 specific
   policy issues from 30 European countries confirms these expectations:
   Issues that experience a high level of associational engagement display
   a stronger relationship between public opinion and policy. The findings
   underline the role civil society organizations can play in policy
   representation beyond engaging in interest advocacy.},

Abstract = {This article attempts to test the ethnic ties theory and provides an
   alternative explanation for why Indonesia as the largest Muslim country
   in the world has been inconsistent in its support for Muslim
   separatists. In this article, I use a Mill's method of most similar
   system design and examine variation in Indonesia's foreign policy
   towards Muslim secessionism taking place in non-Muslim countries over
   time. Since Indonesia's independence in 1945, it has frequently
   supported the non-Muslim host states, has supported the Muslim
   separatists on some occasions, and has either adopted an ambivalent
   foreign policy/supported both the host states and separatist groups or
   adopted a neutral stance/neither supported the host states nor the
   separatist groups on other occasions. I suggest a neoclassical realist
   explanation and argue that specific foreign policy outcomes in the
   context of Muslim separatists versus non-Muslim host states are shaped
   by the perception of leading policy makers on the extent to which
   support for the conflicting parties in the secessionist conflicts can
   hinder or facilitate the achievement of vital national interests and
   ultimately the state's international as well as the level of domestic
   political constraints specifically the public demand to assist the
   separatist movements.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF POLITICS AND LAW},

Abstract = {The relevance of the study due to the need to consider the composition
   of a criminal offense in the form of fraud under the laws of the
   Republic of Kazakhstan. New market relations and insufficient legal
   regulation of certain aspects have expanded the offenders' ability to
   use the imperfections of legal norms for their own mercenary purposes.
   The difficulties arising in practical activities necessitate the
   clarification of controversial issues and the development of sound
   recommendations for the correct qualification and delimitation of fraud
   from other legal relations. Based on the study of practical examples of
   individual forms of fraud, the need for a differentiated approach to
   qualifications and the establishment of responsibility for fraud is
   indicated. The main content of the article is aimed at identifying and
   disclosing the basic concepts that determine the content of the
   considered offense and highlighting the main forms of deception that
   ensure the offender to achieve a criminal result. The objective and
   subjective characteristics of the composition of fraud are investigated,
   the features of establishing individual qualifying characteristics are
   considered. The main method of research used a comparative legal
   analysis of domestic legislation, used statistical data and the results
   of a survey of law enforcement officers.
   The article touches upon the problem of non-fulfillment of contractual
   obligations as a sign of fraud in the business sphere. Identified and
   investigated some signs of the objective side of fraudulent activity, in
   which as a cover for illegal actions, the use of civil law contracts
   that facilitate the commission of fraud is used. It justifies the
   conclusion that, taking into account the signs of the objective side,
   the moment of the end of fraud, coupled with non-fulfillment of
   contractual obligations, is different from the moment of the end of the
   usual fraud. Article materials may be valuable for practitioners of
   pre-trial investigations in terms of scientifically based proposals and
   recommendations on the qualification of typical fraudulent acts veiled
   under a civil law transaction.},

Abstract = {The article examines the impact of an unsettled electoral market and
   evolving political predispositions on the rise and fall of populism in
   Iran. The article argues that the absence of a polarized electoral
   contest between reformists and conservatives paved the way for the
   victory of the populist candidate in the 2005 presidential election in
   Iran, while the deep economic recession resulting from conservative
   administration policies created a long-term political experience which
   influenced voters and led to the victory of the pragmatist candidate in
   the 2013 and 2017 elections. Quantitative analysis indicates that in the
   2005 election, the struggle between conservatives and reformists did not
   impact the competition between candidates, and consequently
   depoliticized attitudes, for example distributive demands, ideology, and
   anti-ruling elite sentiment gained significance, whereas polarization
   between conservatives and a coalition of reformists and pragmatists
   enhanced the role of partisanship and triggered the fall of populism in
   the 2013 election.},

Abstract = {``Education,{''} notes Philip Converse, ``is everywhere the universal
   solvent.{''} Whatever the ill of the body politic, many believe that
   greater education improves the condition. Much scholarship explores the
   impact of education on political attitudes and behaviors, but scholars
   have not examined the relationship of education to support for political
   compromise. This is especially topical, as compromise between parties
   seems harder than ever to achieve, yet compromise is necessary for
   democratic governance. We examine whether higher levels of education
   lead to support for compromise and find that education does matter, but
   the relationship is conditional. For liberals and moderates, more
   education promotes greater support for compromise. For conservatives,
   those with more education are not more likely to support compromise than
   those with less education. We argue that for conservatives, education
   matters for compromise support, but it also leads to better
   understanding of bedrock ideological principles that inhibit approval of
   compromise.},

Journal = {IRISH POLITICAL STUDIES},

Abstract = {Otherwise routine local elections in Northern Ireland on 2 May 2019 were
   bestowed unusual significance by exceptional circumstance. A prolonged
   stalemate between the two largest political parties had left Northern
   Ireland without a devolved government for over two years; meanwhile,
   arrangements for the border between Ireland and Northern Ireland had
   been central in the turbulent `Brexit' process engulfing the UK
   government. Meaning, that the local elections in 2019 would be a litmus
   test of public opinion in Northern Ireland at a time when the place more
   often spoken about than spoken for. In the event, results were mixed;
   there were signs of electoral continuity and others of political flux.
   Two trends will likely be significant in the long term. First, the
   consolidation of ethno-nationally defined electorates on the part of the
   DUP and Sinn Fein following the continued decline in support for the
   moderate unionist UUP and moderate nationalist SDLP. Second, a surge in
   support for the cross-community Alliance Party and a notable increase in
   support for the non-aligned Green Party and People Before Profit
   Alliance, alongside Independent candidates, suggests diversification in
   the issues directing Northern Irish voters' allegiance, and at least a
   partial decline in the electoral salience of the constitutional
   question.},

Abstract = {The mapping of bi-regional scientific collaboration requires multiple
   approaches to obtain the most complete picture possible. The first
   indicator of this collaboration is the number and type of scientific
   co-publications between authors from both regions. This artide analyzes
   the scientific publications that appear in the Web of Science database,
   which includes co-authors from EULAC countries between 2005 and 2016,
   paying special attention to the most important research areas and the
   role of national research agencies in the promotion of international
   cooperation. In addition, a specific indicator, the strength of the
   link, is introduced to account for the outstanding alliances between
   countries, as well as the connection of a particular country within the
   network drawn by the set of co-publications analyzed. Our study
   highlights the ability of EULAC countries to generate scientific
   networks and their relevant role in a growing worldwide network of
   researchers from various countries that makes it increasingly difficult
   to isolate a specific interregional scientific collaboration.},

   societies has decreased, inducing the public to widely remove the issue
   from public post-modern debate. Yet as, among many other examples, the
   attacks on a church in Sri Lanka's capital Colombo in April 2019 with
   more than 250 dead and 500 wounded have shown, the age of suicide
   terrorism is far from over. On the contrary, the archetype remains one
   of the most present influences in the unconscious imaginary of
   globalisation, including that of open societies. We shouldn't forget
   that we still have a lot of work to do in order to better understand and
   solve the problem, writes Roland Benedikter.},

Abstract = {How has the Great Recession changed what we know about dependent market
   economies (DME) in Eastern Europe? To answer that question this paper
   looks at the case of Romania's version of the DME and captures both
   understudied forms of dependence and emerging interdependence dynamics
   that the existing literature on dependence has hitherto neglected.
   Specifically, the literature does not analyse the role of transnational
   banks in forging a politicised public-private form of sovereign debt
   crisis governance. Second, the inattention of the literature to the
   supply side of the labour market leads to the neglect of migration as a
   critical factor shaping state, multinational corporation and corporate
   strategies. Third, the analysis highlights the centrality of industrial
   policy in a Janus-faced process in which neoliberal competition state
   has to cohabit with an incipient, wobbly but nevertheless real
   neo-developmentalist entrepreneurial state.},

Abstract = {The aim of this special issue is to take a nuanced look at the political
   economy of development across the European Union since the financial
   crisis. In contrast to much of the literature on the EU since the
   financial crisis, which is largely concerned with macro-issues, and
   engages in normative critiques of EU policies, this issue focuses on
   multiple levels (including the micro-level of firms and banks), and the
   institutional make-up of member states, to restore the balance between
   EU, national and sub-national analysis. It also eschews normative
   critique. It focuses on the following two themes: the need for a more
   nuanced understanding of centreperiphery relations in the EU; and the
   need for a closer analysis of the interaction effects between European
   and national/sub-national levels in explaining the crisis and
   understanding its impact.},

Abstract = {The governing Centre and Conservative parties played the `economy' card
   - we've got Finland `back into shape'; the green parties, the Greens and
   Left Alliance, played the `climate change' card, demanding action to go
   with the talk; the Social Democrats played the `caring' card and the
   need for a Finland that cares for the elderly, the low-paid and young
   persons; the Finns Party in contrast played the `no one likes us, we
   don't care' card, seeking to exploit its pariah status for electoral
   gain. The adoption of a siege mentality strategy, designed to capitalise
   on its ostracised position, served to mobilise protest support and the
   Finns Party came within a whisker of beating the Social Democrats into
   second place. The Social Democrats then turned the clock back and put
   together the type of left-centre ('red mud') coalition that had
   characterised Finnish governments for half a century from the mid-1930s
   onwards.},

Abstract = {This article addresses how two globally critical regions - Europe and
   East Asia (especially Northeast Asia) - are transforming their
   relationship as an international system defined by multipolarity emerges
   from the unraveling of the liberal international order. This
   transformation includes increased trade, developing strategic
   partnerships between the EU and selected East Asian states, nascent
   EU-ASEAN inter-regional cooperation, and more diplomatic through-put
   among East Asian states and their EU and member state counterparts. This
   article examines the question of how Europe is performing its own
   `pivot/rebalance' to East Asia (specifically Northeast Asia) in terms of
   trade, diplomacy, and security. In turn, the question arises as to how
   receptive East Asian states have been to this European overture. First
   we cover the path of how we have arrived at the historical juncture in
   which the EU is `pivoting/rebalancing' to East Asia (specifically
   Northeast Asia).},

Title = {Why Low Levels of Democracy Promote Corruption and High Levels Diminish
   It},

Abstract = {Theory predicts democracy should reduce corruption. Yet, scholars have
   found that while corruption is low at high levels of democracy, it is
   high at modest levels, as well as low when democracy is absent. A
   weakness of studies that aim to explain this inverted curvilinear
   relationship is that they do not disaggregate the complex concepts of
   democracy and corruption. By contrast, this paper disaggregates both. We
   demonstrate that the curvilinear relationship results from the
   collective impact of different components of democracy on different
   types of corruption. Using Varieties of Democracy data, we examine 173
   countries from 1900 to 2015, and we find freedom of expression and
   freedom of association each exhibit an inverted curvilinear relationship
   with corruption-both overall corruption and four different types. The
   introduction of elections and the quality of elections each act in a
   linear fashion-positively and negatively with corruption,
   respectively-but jointly form a curvilinear relationship with both
   overall corruption and many of its types. Judicial and legislative
   constraints exhibit a negative linear relationship with executive
   corruption. We offer a framework that suggests how these components
   affect costs and benefits of engaging in different types of corruption
   and, therefore, the level of corruption overall.},

   democracy is the panacea that will solve all political and economic
   problems faced by developing countries. Using the concept of good
   society as analytical prism, the analysis shows that while there is a
   rhetorical agreement as to what the good society entails, democracy
   promotion practices fail to allow for recipients' inclusion in the
   negotiation and delivery of the good society. Contrasting US and
   Tunisian discourses on the good society, the article argues that
   democracy promotion practices are underpinned by neoliberal parameters
   borne out from a reliance on the transition paradigm, which in turn
   leave little room to democracy promotion recipients to formulate
   knowledge claims supporting the emergence of alternative conceptions of
   the good society. In contrast, the article opens up a reflective pathway
   to a negotiated democratic knowledge, which would reside in a
   paradigmatic change that consists in the abandonment of the transition
   paradigm in favour of a democratic emergence paradigm.},

Abstract = {Politweeting is becoming increasingly popular globally. It offers
   benefits to politicians and to citizens, especially during election
   periods. Twitter users in Africa are five times more likely to use the
   platform to voice their political views than those in the US and UK.
   Yet, few studies from African countries provide insight into such use.
   This paper attempts to provide insight into the use of the African
   National Congress (ANC) Twitter account by citizens and politicians in
   the run-up to the 2014 general elections. The Adaptive Structuration
   Theory is relevant to the study and netnography was applied to the
   study. Findings show that the platform was mostly used by citizens
   rather than the political party and its politicians. Citizens mostly
   engaged in political commentary amongst each other about party
   activities and officials. The political organisation mostly used it for
   image management for the party and its officials. If harnessed through
   planned design and implementation of digital communication strategies,
   social media has the potential to be used as effectively for mass
   communication, yet simultaneously enable interpersonal persuasion
   between participants, especially during times of elections.},

Volume = {28},
Number = {3, SI},

Abstract = {The article investigates the cohesion of public discourse by members of
   the Merkel III government on three challenges of European governance:
   the negotiations on UK withdrawal from the EU, the management of the
   Greek debt crisis, and political responses to the entry of migrants into
   the EU and the refugee pact with Turkey. The rationale is to assess how
   unfolding controversy on German leadership in the EU prompted by these
   challenges is reflected in claims-making in relation to three frameworks
   of reference: namely, the supranational institutions and policies of the
   EU, the definition of German EU policy at the level of intergovernmental
   negotiation, and domestic policy in the context of European
   developments. Based on a mixed-method review of debates in the
   Bundestag, the main findings highlight the tension between two different
   forms of parliamentary debate: on the one hand, a mostly normative
   discourse making the case for the stability and continuity of EU
   policies by the Chancellor and other members of the Grand Coalition
   government; on the other, the projection of party political claims to
   call for policy modification at the EU and intergovernmental level,
   exposing fissures and even direct contestation between coalition
   partners, particularly in the controversy on the migrant crisis.},

Abstract = {The current weak economic situation of the municipalities in Mexico
   obliges them to modify their public policies when it comes to tax
   collection methods. For this government entity it is imperative to
   implement new strategies that incentive taxpayers to comply with their
   tax obligations. This research article is a case study of Zapopan in
   Mexico between years 2015-2018. Zapopan is one of the municipalities
   with highest tax collection rate nationwide. This article uses a
   longitudinal descriptive scope because it examines the actions promoted
   by Zapopan during a period of four years. The objective of this work is
   to analyze the implementation and the effect of innovative programs to
   encourage the payment of property tax among the population, promoting
   municipal management and financing. The results achieved through a
   lineal propability model reveal a positive effect related to the
   incorporation of innovative programs for the taxpayers in Zapopan.
   Programs have clearly lead to strengthening the management and the
   co-responsibility of tax collection, and to an increase of the resources
   of the municipality.},

Abstract = {Do voters prefer dominant looking candidates in times of war? By
   replicating previous survey experiments, we find that respondents do
   prefer candidates with dominant facial features when war is salient. We
   then investigate whether these survey results generalize to the real
   world. Examining US Senate elections from 1990 to 2006, we test whether
   voters prefer candidates with dominant facial features in wartime
   elections more than in peacetime elections. In contrast with the survey
   studies, we find that dominant-looking candidates appear to gain a
   slight advantage in all elections but have no special advantage in
   wartime contexts. We discuss possible explanations for the discrepancy
   between the findings and conduct additional experiments to investigate
   one possible explanation: additional information about candidates may
   rapidly erode the wartime preference for dominant looking candidates.
   Overall, our findings suggest that the dominance-war findings may not
   generalize to the real world.},

Abstract = {The concept and reality of intergenerational social mobility have not
   been copiously studied by History to examine the phenomenon of
   contemporary international migration. Social mobility can be analyzed
   from various historical abstraction edges: horizontal or vertical social
   mobility; ascending and descending; intragenerational and
   intergenerational; and individual and group mobility. Epistemologically
   on the subject of migration, these concepts open theoretical analytical
   paths, individually or comparatively. The objective of this work is to
   explore from the historiographical perspective of the history of the
   present the ascending and intergenerational social mobility in the
   phenomenon of international migration in the specific case of students
   children of Huandacarense migrants who finished university studies in
   the United States. The theoretical and methodological substrate of this
   work is close to the focus of the history of the present and oral
   history. We advance some theoretical debates and results on this
   specific line of research that is part of a research agenda that deals
   with social mobility and social change in contemporary international
   migration.},

Abstract = {Does parliamentary negotiation help facilitate legislation? This article
   applies propensity score matching to empirically investigate the effect
   of a unique formal negotiation mechanism in Taiwan's parliament. The
   analysis of legislative initiatives between 2012 and 2015 shows that the
   so-called Party Negotiation Mechanism, while being invented to revive
   legislation amid stalemates, substantially reduces the chance of
   successful legislation. By extension, the undercut probability of
   legislative success under Taiwan's majoritarian system implies that the
   conventional majoritarian-consensus framework has overlooked a crucial
   parameter that directly shapes the patterns of policy-making-the
   internal organisation of a parliament.},

Abstract = {What are the conditions that promote gender equality in political
   participation? In this article, I propose that the presence of direct
   democracy expands gender equality in political participation by
   signaling the system's openness to women's voice, confirming their
   political competency, and highlighting their stake in political
   decisions. To test this argument, I leverage a quasi-experiment in
   Sweden in the aftermath of the introduction of universal suffrage, where
   the type of municipal political institutions was determined by a
   population threshold. My findings lend strong support to the effect of
   direct democracy on the political inclusion of women. I find that the
   gender gap in electoral participation was smaller in municipalities
   using direct democracy than in similarly sized municipalities that only
   had representative institutions.},

Abstract = {This article aims to provide an overview of how the Italian legislation
   deals with corruption. This starts with an analysis of the crimes
   provided for in the Criminal Code. In this regard, the three major
   offences are described that concern the phenomenon which is usually
   referred to as corruption (alias bribery) in comparative law:
   concussione, corruzione, and induzione indebita a dare o promettere
   utilita. The comparative analysis demonstrates that their distinction is
   not common.
   Secondly, these crimes are grounds for establishing the (substantially
   criminal) liability of the legal persons, whose regulation is provided
   for in the Decreto Legislativo n. 231/2001.
   Thirdly, the mission and the activity of the National Anti-Corruption
   Authority is described.
   Finally, given that the Italian Republic is a Member State of the
   European Union, the Directive (EU) 2017/1371 on the fight against fraud
   to the Union's financial interests by means of criminal law is depicted.
   Indeed, among the crimes within the scope of the Directive, there are
   the figures of active and passive corruption.},

Abstract = {While scholars have identified ways that racial conservatives exerted
   outsized influence on criminal justice policies, little attention has
   been paid to whether police departments have incentives to learn about
   and adopt reforms that reduce racial disparity. I present a game of
   imperfect information between residents and a municipal police chief to
   show that a chief's inability to prevent officer behavior that residents
   perceive to be abusive, coupled with resident unwillingness to assist
   police in the aftermath of this behavior, creates an incentive for the
   chief to choose and learn about new policing strategies that rely less
   on resident assistance. This induces a bias in favor of aggressive over
   collaborative tactics in the police chief's policy selection and
   learning decisions. Segregation and discrimination ensured that many
   black Americans lived in conditions that produced this result in the
   later twentieth century; thus, the model shows structural racism in
   local police policy making.},

Abstract = {To the degree that voters care about competence, expertise, and other
   valence characteristics of their representatives and political parties
   care about winning elections, parties have an incentive to signal that
   their legislators have such characteristics. We construct a model of
   parties, motivated by both reelection and by policy, that attempt to
   signal individual incumbents' valences to voters through the assignment
   of these members to positions of authority. The model illustrates how
   electorally motivated party leaders will have an incentive to promote
   less competent incumbents than they would if voters did not make
   inferences from promotion decisions. We derive the model's empirical
   implications and test them with original data on the careers of Chilean
   senators serving between 1998 and 2013. In support of the model's
   insights, we find that promotion to a leadership position is an
   effective signal to voters only if the promoted incumbent has extreme
   views relative to the party.},

Abstract = {Starting from the imperfect nature of Myanmar's democracy, this paper
   aims to answer two questions. First, can Myanmar's transition be defined
   as a case of democratization, or is it, rather, a case of authoritarian
   resilience? To state this differently: is the progress enjoyed by
   Myanmar's polity the outcome of an ongoing process that is supposed to
   lead to a fully fledged democracy, or, rather, an attempt to enshrine
   elements of authoritarian governance under a democratic guise? Second,
   if the balance leans towards the latter instead of the former, how did
   authoritarian resilience work in Myanmar? The transition is analysed
   from a long-term perspective, moving from the 1988 pro-democracy
   uprising up to the most recent events. Data were collected from
   available published sources and from three fieldworks conducted by the
   authors in Myanmar. The paper concludes that Myanmar's transition is
   better understood as a case of authoritarian resilience than as
   democratization and highlights three core traits of Myanmar's
   authoritarian resilience: first, the very top-down nature of the
   political transformation; second, the incumbents' ability to set the
   pace of political reform through the use of repression and political
   engineering; and third, the divide-and-rule strategy used as a means to
   keep contestations separated and local.},

Abstract = {While there is considerable research on elected legislators in a variety
   of contexts, the academic knowledge about their advisors is very
   limited. This is surprising, given a considerable portion of work
   attributed to legislators is performed by political staff. Further,
   political advising increasingly serves as a training ground for future
   politicians in many professionalised legislatures. We use a
   mixed-methods approach to understand how the influence of men and women
   differs in political advising positions in the case of Canada's House of
   Commons, and how this may affect women's political ambition. We
   demonstrate while close to an equal number of men and women work for MPs
   in a political capacity on Parliament Hill, men continue to dominate
   legislative roles while women continue to dominate administrative roles.
   Further, legislative work increases political ambition, which means more
   men benefit from the socialising effects of legislative work than women.},

Abstract = {This article explores the nature of private intelligence activity in
   Colombia, and the government's responsibility for public administration
   of intelligence. It asks what problems exist as a by-product of private
   intelligence activities, and additionally explores whether there exists
   a framework of societal norms that a state agency might co-opt to
   oversee and regulate those activities undertaken by private individuals,
   many of whom have received government training in intelligence research.
   This study offers three case studies of private intelligence activity,
   evaluates the resulting risk or threat to citizen security and privacy,
   and presents a novel, normative framework to identify and strengthen the
   State's ability to control private intelligence activities. The present
   author's application of Spearin's analysis of four forms of private
   sector responsibility toward the public; namely, political, judicial,
   marketing and administrative accountability, results in the finding that
   the ethos of government intelligence underlies a feasible approach to
   the Colombian government's management of private intelligence.},

Abstract = {Previous research on welfare state development in federal states has
   claimed that interstate competition induces a race to the bottom with
   regard to social expenditure. While existing research has focused on the
   impact of migration inflows of poor households on states with high
   provision of social expenditure, it has remained silent with regard to
   migration outflows. In this article, I argue that migration outflows are
   associated with increased social expenditure if eligibility restrictions
   for social benefits between states are relaxed. Facing outflows of
   workers and the unemployed, low-spending states respond with increases
   in social expenditure to retain a sufficient workforce and counteract
   rising wage levels. As a result, states with higher levels of outward
   migration are catching up with more generous states instead of engaging
   in a race to the bottom. To support my claim, I use a time-series
   cross-sectional data set of Swiss cantons covering the period 1930-75.},

Abstract = {Despite the increasing number of countries that have implemented
   deliberative processes during constitutional changes, the discussion
   remains open about the criteria for these processes to be deemed fair
   and democratic. Thus, this article first proposes some conditions
   related to the features of the mechanism of deliberative participation
   and the method of processing the resulting contents. Next an empirical
   analysis is carried out, focused on deliberative processes of
   constitutional change that were regulated and/or promoted by governments
   or public institutions; were opened to citizenship, excluding the ones
   oriented only to experts or political parties; and promoted the
   generation of contents compared to the merely informative or educative
   ones. Between 1970 and 2018, 29 processes were identified in 27
   countries. The analysis identified five models of deliberative
   processes: symbolic, controlled, participatory overflow, constituent
   opening and constituent participation. The conclusions invite to go
   beyond the sui generis commitment to implement participatory mechanisms
   and replace it with the definition of minimal criteria the deliberative
   processes should fulfil to be considered democratic.},

Abstract = {Despite reports of physical violence and psychological abuse against US
   officeholders, the subject has not been addressed in research at any
   level of government. This study reports results from survey research of
   mayors with three aims: examination of the frequency, types, and
   correlates of experiences of physical violence and psychological abuse
   among mayors; exploration of gender differences; and estimates of the
   effects of violence and abuse on mayors' desire to stay in office. Our
   findings suggest that US mayors face meaningful levels of physical
   violence and psychological abuse - and these events are widespread
   across types of cities. Our data also show that female mayors are more
   likely than men to experience most types of violence and abuse. And,
   although having these experiences did not reduce the majority of
   officeholders' political ambition, those who suffered physical violence
   were more likely than those who faced psychological abuse to have
   considered curtailing their political careers. Finally, we consider the
   implications for these results on the quality and diversity of future
   representation.},

Abstract = {Since the early 2000s, the Flemish nationalist party New Flemish
   Alliance (N-VA) has experienced a burgeoning growth. Paradoxically, for
   a stateless nationalist and regionalist party (SNRP), this performance
   has occurred without major changes in mass support for independence and
   only ambiguous ones for more regional autonomy, which suggests that the
   party appeals to different electoral subgroups through a
   vote-maximisation strategy of issue diversification. Providing an
   in-depth analysis of the multi-dimensional ideology of N-VA, this
   article contributes to the literature on SNRPs by arguing that N-VA has
   gone beyond issue diversification through a strategy of `issue
   communitarisation' that consists not only in expanding its agenda beyond
   the centre-periphery cleavage, but rather in framing all other policy
   issues explicitly in (sub-state) nationalist terms. According to this
   strategy, all major conflicts on political power, social redistribution
   and cultural identity are systematically represented as being based on
   an unresolvable and overarching centre-periphery antagonism between
   Flanders and francophone Belgium.},

Abstract = {Several themes characterize the state of American federalism. Increasing
   political polarization shapes preferences with respect to locating the
   vertical balance of power. To implement these preferences, the federal
   government is primarily relying on regulatory rollback and unilateral
   action. With Congress largely unable or unwilling to check the executive
   branch, states have pushed back on use of the tools of the
   administrative presidency through litigation. We address these themes
   through an analysis of voting and elections along with important policy
   developments from the previous year in the areas of immigration, health
   care, environmental policy, education, gun control, and criminal
   justice. We also review important federalism developments from the
   Supreme Court's 2017 term.},

Abstract = {Annual tripartite social conferences were introduced in France in 2012,
   pre-empting EU ambitions to reinvigorate the social dialogue at EU and
   national levels. Despite some successes, they did not live up to their
   ambitions to elicit consensus and give trade unions a voice in
   policymaking due to: opposition to, and protest against, government
   policy from some unions; the avoidance of discussion on contentious
   legislation; and the constraints of the Country Specific Recommendations
   arising out of the European Semester. The French experience of social
   dialogue suggests that the chances of the EU achieving its ambition of
   building consensus over economic and social reform through
   reinvigorating the social dialogue appear slim.},

Abstract = {Amidst a global turn towards authoritarianism and populism, there are
   few contemporary examples of state-led democratization. This article
   discusses how Uruguay's Frente Amplio (FA) party has drawn on a unique
   national democratic cultural heritage to encourage a coupling of
   participatory and representative institutions in ``a politics of
   closeness.{''} The FA has reinvigorated Batllismo, a discourse
   associated with social justice, civic republicanism, and the rise of
   Uruguayan social democracy in the early twentieth century. At the same
   time, the FA's emphasis on egalitarian participation is inspired by the
   thought of Uruguay's independence hero Jose Artigas. I argue that the
   cross-weave of party and movement, and of democratic citizenship and
   national heritage, encourages the emergence of new figures of the
   citizen and new permutations for connecting citizens with representative
   institutions. The FA's ``politics of closeness{''} is an example of how
   state-driven democratization remains possible in an age described by
   some as ``post-democratic.{''}},

Abstract = {This essay considers self-ownership as a rhetorical and political
   practice. Scholarly attention to the rhetoric of self-ownership, notably
   in feminist theory, often rejects the term for its capacity to distort
   and fragment notions of the self, the body, social relations, and labor.
   The ambiguous character of self-ownership, in this view, carries the
   risk of subversion of more inclusive and relational uses. Adopting a
   broader notion of rhetoric as creative and effective speech, I recast
   self-ownership from this critical depiction through a revised
   understanding of C. B. Macpherson's possessive individualism and then to
   the texts of John Locke, the Levellers, and the Putney Debates. These
   early-modern exemplars offer insights into the political promises and
   risks of the rhetoric of self-ownership that contemporary critics
   obscure. The ambiguity and plurality too often rendered as a liability
   for self-ownership instead offer conditions for its agonistic invocation
   for novel claims and emerging audiences.},

Journal = {POLITICAL RESEARCH QUARTERLY},

Abstract = {Political scientists have long disagreed about the nature of
   individual-level change in party identification. While some scholars
   conclude that party identification is a stable identityattributing
   changes in individual responses to measurement errorothers show that
   aggregate party identification responds systematically to short-term
   forces such as presidential approval. In this article, we use a unique
   long-term panel measuring party identification twenty times in the
   2011-2016 period to support a subtle compromise between these competing
   claims. We show that individual-level party identification changes
   systematically over time even after accounting for measurement error and
   that this change is related to short-term evaluations of the parties and
   the president. However, although such change exists, it is modest in the
   medium term and more common among specific subsets of respondents.
   Finally, we show that that these findings are robust to numerous
   alternative modeling strategies. We believe that our analysis provides
   the most systematic examination to date of individual-level changes in
   party identification.},

Abstract = {Different modes of economic coordination constitute a key aspect of the
   Comparative Capitalisms research framework. With regard to emerging
   economies, the close relationship between the state and business has
   been perceived negatively as an instance of corruption and
   patrimonialism that are considered to be economically harmful. This
   paper addresses the puzzle why some large emerging economies - China,
   India, and Brazil in particular - have seen considerable economic growth
   since the 2000s despite such `failures' or `institutional deficits'. We
   find strong evidence for a public-private mode of coordination based on
   reciprocity. This inter-personal mode of coordination helps to explain
   an unexpected degree of institutional coherence of capitalism, albeit to
   different degrees, in the large emerging economies under scrutiny. We
   argue that while there is evidence of economically productive
   public-private coordination in China and India, economic coordination in
   Brazil by comparison is much more contested, and thus less beneficial
   economically.},

Abstract = {On 8 October 2014, the Northern Ireland Department of Justice (DoJ) set
   up a public consultation on amending the law on abortion in cases of
   fatal foetal abnormality and sexual crimes. Several organisations
   mobilised to respond to the consultation, but pro-choice activists in
   Alliance for Choice-Derry (AfC-Derry) preferred to invest their time in
   popular education tactics aimed at the greater public. Why did these
   activists refuse to lobby politicians, as they have done in the past,
   and instead mobilise for awareness-raising actions? In this article, I
   argue that the gender-blindness of the post-conflict consociational
   settlement in Northern Ireland restricted activists' opportunity to
   lobby governments both at Stormont and Westminster. Activists thus
   shifted their approach to mobilisation: from lobbying to educational
   tactics; from extending UK's 1967 Abortion Act(1) to decriminalisation;
   and from targeting politicians to targeting culture. This analysis of
   pro-choice activism under the gender-blind, consociational political
   system in Northern Ireland will shed light on theoretical questions of
   gendered political structure constraints on feminist actions as well as
   the development of cultural tactics by a ``critical community{''} during
   a period of abeyance.},

Abstract = {In 2008, Georgia militarily engaged its breakaway region of South
   Ossetia, a fact that aggravated bilateral tensions and culminated in
   Russia's military presence in both South Ossetia and Abkhazia, Georgia's
   second breakaway region. This development rekindled conflicts that had
   been smoldering since the early 1990s and revitalized interest in
   understanding the causal mechanism. The present historical
   institutionalist account examines the role of lasting regional political
   preferences in the context of an ethnicized (Georgian) national
   identity, comparatively weak economic growth, and unemployment. Russia
   serves as a contextual factor allowing for the primacy of state-level
   analysis. The conclusions corroborate the irreversible impact of
   structural deficiencies},

Abstract = {This article, and the special issue it introduces, joins an emerging
   conversation about the role of civil society in transitional justice
   (TJ). Although civil society organisations play an integral role in the
   pursuit of TJ in conflict-affected societies, the literature lacks a
   comprehensive conceptualisation of the diversity and complexity of these
   roles. Building on an interdisciplinary workshop at the Australian
   National University in September 2016, the contributions to this special
   issue explore the forms of civil society that are enabled and disabled
   by TJ processes and the forms of TJ activity that are enabled and
   disabled by different kinds of civil society actors.},

Abstract = {Transitional justice (TJ) scholarship and practice often pins much hope
   on civil society. It generally assumes that civil society organisations
   demonstrate civility', have broad-based memberships, support liberal
   democratic values and promote TJ approaches based on liberal-legal
   justice strategies. Yet there is nothing inherently virtuous about civil
   society and in conflict-affected societies it often lacks these desired
   properties; it can be underdeveloped, unruly and disruptive. So, what
   role do, and should, uncivil' society groups play in TJ processes? To
   answer this question this article uses comparative case studies of the
   role of uncivil society groups in Bougainville and Timor-Leste. These
   cases exhibit similar broad cultural, socio-political and socio-economic
   characteristics. In both cases uncivil society groups are organised
   around societal divisions, attempt to operate as alternatives to the
   state, oppose liberal democracy and liberal-legal TJ processes and
   engage in unruly behaviour, including violence and criminality. These
   uncivil society groups are not regarded as internationally legitimate,
   but they nevertheless have strong local legitimacy, particularly when
   the state is absent or weak. Consequently, this article concludes that
   in conflict-affected societies it is necessary to engage with groups
   regarded as both civil and uncivil to promote locally legitimate and
   effective TJ, and peace more broadly.},

   Court: The Case of Male and Female Justices},
Journal = {AMERICAN POLITICS RESEARCH},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {47},
Number = {3},

Abstract = {Although still a minority, the growing number of women on both the Bench
   and at the Bar of the U.S. Supreme Court has important implications for
   judicial decision-making and successful advocacy at the Court. Research
   in judicial behavior generally focuses on vote direction and the
   presence of female attorneys in a case. We offer a more nuanced account
   of how gender impacts both attorney success and judicial decision-making
   by drawing on work in social and political psychology and utilizing
   quantitative textual analysis to explore the tension between masculine
   norms of behavior that are valued in the legal profession and feminine
   norms of behavior that are expected of women, but devalued in the legal
   profession. Based on the Court's long-standing disdain for emotional
   arguments, we examine how the emotional content in 601 party briefs
   shapes the Court's majority opinions. Our results indicate that male
   justices evaluate counsel based on their compliance with traditional
   gender norms-rewarding male counsel for cool, unemotional arguments and
   rewarding female counsel for emotionally compelling arguments. However,
   we find no evidence that gender norms shape the opinions of female
   justices. Given that the justice system is supposed to be ``blind,{''}
   our results highlight the durability of gendered expectations and raise
   questions about the objectivity of judicial decision-making.},

Abstract = {Populism puts the nation first and defends nationalism on the basis of a
   moral obligation that has its origin in national identity. The moral
   framework of populism is similar to that of communitarianism, even
   though the latter denounces the xenophobia, chauvinism and
   aggressiveness of the populists. Meanwhile, also many liberals believe
   that the current political crisis can only be explained by the neglect
   of the idea ofthe nation in recent decades. Therefore they are in favor
   of nationalism. They emphasize, however, that liberal nationalism should
   not be confused with populist nationalism. Where populism has formed in
   opposition to liberalism, liberal nationalism is based on individual
   freedom. This essay deals with the question of whether nationalism can
   be justified from a liberal point of view. It argues that liberalism is
   incompatible with nationalism. Nationalism cannot justify either
   positive or negative freedom. First, every form of nationalism is
   morally relativistic, in the sense that it cannot be said whether the
   nation realizes moral values or not. Second, only personal identity and
   not individual freedom can be the source of nationalism. The resulting
   obligation of national solidarity, however, is in contrast to
   fundamental freedoms. The essay concludes with the suggestion that
   nationalism must be governed and shaped in order to counter populism.},

Abstract = {Though widely regarded as ill-defined and lacking conceptual clarity,
   social innovation has been heralded as a desirable response to social
   economic and environmental challenges arising from market and policy
   failures. Based on a definition of social innovation as involving the
   reconfiguration of social practices through civil society engagement,
   this paper offers an inductive classification of the diverse types of
   social innovation found in Scotland, based primarily on rural examples.
   It is argued that not only does social innovation occur in a diverse
   range of fields and in many different forms, but also that the Scottish
   Government policy has explicitly connected to social innovation as a
   means of delivering a communitarian policy agenda. However, without
   affirmative action, the community empowerment agenda is likely to widen
   the gap between communities with strong social capital and those with
   weaker social capital, thus undermining another strong strand of
   Scottish policy which supports greater equality and social inclusion.},

Abstract = {The article analyzes two lectures given by Claude Levi-Strauss on
   Montaigne. In a first conference in 1937, Levi-Strauss refers to
   Montaigne as a forerunner of ethnology as a revolutionary science and of
   its indissoluble link with criticism. In the second conference of 1992,
   Levi-Strauss shows how the ethnographic data relating to the so-called
   primitive peoples, the cold or stationary societies, appear as an index
   of discontinuity in the discursive formations of the Modern Age.
   According to Levi-Strauss, it is a question of grasping, following
   Montaigne's teaching, a discontinuity in the ways of life of different
   societies in space and time, which the ethnographic gaze makes visible.
   It is a certain capacity of a certain society to make use of life, which
   manifests itself in the different habits of a society, in its forms of
   life and in the discrepancies that are concentrated in the heart of
   culture and which confer them, in this way, its singularity. The
   peculiarity of the ``police{''} of wild societies. Here is the great
   ethnological lesson of the Essais of Montaigne.},

Abstract = {This paper presents new causal estimates of incarceration's effect on
   voting, using administrative data on criminal sentencing and voter
   turnout. I use the random case assignment process of a major county
   court system as a source of exogenous variation in the sentencing of
   misdemeanor cases. Focusing on misdemeanor defendants allows for
   generalization to a large population, as such cases are very common.
   Among first-time misdemeanor defendants, I find evidence that receiving
   a short jail sentence decreases voting in the next election by several
   percentage points. Results differ starkly by race. White defendants show
   no demobilization, while Black defendants show substantial turnout
   decreases due to jail time. Evidence from pre-arrest voter histories
   suggest that this difference could be due to racial differences in
   exposure to arrest. These results paint a picture of large-scale,
   racially-disparate voter demobilization in the wake of incarceration.},

Title = {The verdict in the polls: how government stability is affected by

Abstract = {The idea that the stability of governments is affected by how they are
   performing in the polls is both intuitive and popular in the literature.
   When support is low the government might be inclined to replace parties
   or the prime minister in order to regain support, thus forming a
   replacement government. Alternatively, a government doing well in the
   polls might opportunistically try to schedule an early election to
   capitalise on its favourable prospects. But despite the popularity of
   the idea, it has thus far not been tested empirically whether government
   stability is in fact influenced by popular support. This article aims to
   address this lacuna. Using a relatively new dataset with more than
   12,000 unique polls, and recently developed Bayesian models for pooling
   the polls, it is here shown that government stability is in fact
   impacted by popular support. Governments display clear signs of
   electoral opportunism when they are polling well and, conversely,
   dissolve the government, without calling an election, when polling is
   bad. The results are strongest when there are few parties in the
   government, since agreement on the timing for a discretionary
   termination is easier when fewer players need to agree.},

Abstract = {Scholars report that areas with higher concentrations of religious
   voters elect relatively few women to executive office. These studies,
   however, cannot explain whether the observed patterns are a direct
   result of religious individuals' vote choices. Our study explores this
   question using Cooperative Congressional Election Studies data from all
   mixed-gender gubernatorial elections in the 2008 through 2016 general
   election cycles. We conclude that religious voters, regardless of
   religious tradition or gender, are not significant barriers to electing
   women to state executive office. More specifically, religious
   individuals are disproportionately supportive of Republican women and
   opposed to Democratic women, even when controlling for the ideological
   distance between the individual's partisanship and that of the
   candidate.},

Abstract = {Scholars conclude that increasing the number of elected women of color
   is vital to achieving gender and racial parity in U.S. politics. Many
   challenges remain, however, in order for women candidates of color to
   reach office in proportion to their share of the population. In this
   dialogue, we focus on the patterns of opportunities that women of color
   have used to run for state legislative office. Building on other
   intersectionality work within the American context, we take gender and
   race/ethnicity to be interactive and mutually constitutive, and thus
   women of color may face unique challenges and opportunities as
   candidates as compared to non-Hispanic white women. We examine how three
   structural features - legislative district demographics, incumbency, and
   partisanship - influence the emergence and electoral success of women of
   color candidates. The findings suggest that while women of color are
   very successful when they run for state legislative office, they are far
   too often missing from ballots in white districts, pointing to a
   particular intersectional issue in the partisan pipeline.},

Abstract = {Scholars have long claimed that political movements founded by
   charismatic leaders must undergo ``routinization,{''} or
   depersonalization, to survive. Yet many such movements appear to have
   sustained their charismatic nature and have persisted or reemerged in
   cases as diverse as Argentina, Venezuela, Peru, Turkey, and China.
   Focusing on Argentine Peronism and Venezuelan Chavismo, this article
   examines the potential of new leaders to revive their charismatic
   predecessors' legacies to perpetuate the movement and gain the
   followers' support. Through face-to-face survey experiments conducted in
   both countries, the article shows that new leaders who (a) implement
   bold, initially impressive policies and (b) symbolically tie themselves
   to the charismatic founder cause citizens to express stronger emotional
   attachments to the movement and garner political support. The results
   challenge the notion that charismatic movements are short-lived and
   underscore the potential of these movements to impact democratic
   politics and party-system development long after their founders
   disappear.},

Abstract = {Our article examines whether a politician charging a political
   candidate's implicit racial campaign appeal as racist is an effective
   political strategy. According to the racial priming theory, this
   racialized counterstrategy should deactivate racism, thereby decreasing
   racially conservative whites' support for the candidate engaged in race
   baiting. We propose an alternative theory in which racial liberals, and
   not racially conservative whites, are persuaded by this strategy. To
   test our theory, we focused on the 2016 presidential election. We ran an
   experiment varying the politician (by party and race) calling an
   implicit racial appeal by Donald Trump racist. We find that charging
   Trump's campaign appeal as racist does not persuade racially
   conservative whites to decrease support for Trump. Rather, it causes
   racially liberal whites to evaluate Trump more unfavorably. Our results
   hold up when attentiveness, old-fashioned racism, and partisanship are
   taken into account. We also reproduce our findings in two replication
   studies.},

Abstract = {Opening-up processes of candidate selection is often viewed as a means
   for political parties to regain legitimacy, and perhaps more crucially,
   members and voters. Despite a widespread belief that citizens want more
   democracy, including within parties, little research has questioned what
   sort of opening-up is desired-e.g., open or closed primaries-if at all,
   and by what type of citizens. Using data of the 2014 PartiRep voter
   survey in Belgium, we examine the diversity of preferences regarding
   candidate selection, and the extent to which preferences for open or
   closed primaries relate to voters' participation in party organisations.
   Given the diversification of party affiliation types, we operationalise
   participation through two distinct variables: the formal party
   membership status of the respondents, and their party activism. We show
   that both membership and activism influence individual preferences, and
   that their effects are in fact conditional upon each other. Findings
   also raise crucial issues regarding the consequences of the
   multiplication of affiliation modes, the motivations and direction of
   intra-party reforms, as well as feed the debate on their expected versus
   genuine consequences.},

Abstract = {The discussion on the future of Europe has been mainly focused on policy
   regimes and not (also) on governance models for managing them. An
   economistic bias has largely affected the proposals on the future of
   Europe advanced by EU and national leaders. The article brings the
   governance question back to the debate. Using a deductive approach, it
   identifies four governance models, and their connected policy
   implications, epitomizing different interpretations of the EU and its
   future. Two models are derived from the interpretation of the EU as
   regional organization and the other two from the interpretation of the
   EU as a federation in the making. Through the four governance models,
   the article aims to structure the discussion on the future organization
   of Europe on more solid, logically and empirically, bases.},

Abstract = {Over the past several decades, a new kind of labor politics has emerged
   in new venues (state and local levels), focusing on new governing
   institutions (employment laws), involving new strategies by labor
   unions, and featuring new organizational forms (alt-labor). The timing,
   form, and content of these developments have been powerfully shaped by
   the persistence of the increasingly outmoded but still authoritative
   national labor law, which has constrained and channeled the efforts of
   workers and their advocates to respond to growing problems. While the
   new institutions and organizations provide new substantive rights for
   workers and alternative vehicles for voice and collective action, the
   layering of these new forms alongside the oldwithout displacing the
   latterhas generated new problems without solving the problems produced
   by the ossification of labor law in the first place. Using novel
   empirical data and analysis, this article documents these changes,
   explores their causes, and considers their consequences for the changing
   politics of workers' rights.},

Abstract = {Political institutions have been considered important factors that
   influence local policy processes. This study investigates if different
   county political institutions, including the form of government and home
   rule charter, influence the processes among three policy arenas:
   allocational, development, and redistributive. We analyze the annual
   expenditure change in Florida counties from 1995 to 2008. Results show
   that both modernized and nonmodernized counties show similar levels of
   policy changes in allocational, developmental as well as redistributive
   policy arenas, while counties with modernized political institutions
   tend to experience a slightly higher, although minimal, level of policy
   change in each of the three policy arenas.},

Abstract = {How do elections and the economy affect authoritarian survival?
   Distinguishing among (a) nonelection periods in autocracies that do not
   hold competitive elections, (b) election periods in autocracies that
   hold regular elections, and (c) nonelection periods in such autocracies,
   I argue that bad economic performance makes authoritarian regimes
   especially likely to break down in election years, but the anticipation
   of competitive elections should dissuade citizens and elites from
   engaging in antiregime behavior in nonelection periods, bolstering
   short-term survival. Thus, compared to regimes that do not hold
   competitive elections, electoral autocracies should be more vulnerable
   to bad economic performance in election periods but more resilient to it
   in nonelection years. A study of 258 authoritarian regimes between 1948
   and 2011 confirms these expectations. I also find that the effect is
   driven by competitive elections for the executive office, and
   elections-related breakdowns are more likely to result in
   democratization.},

Abstract = {Domestic governments increasingly face the pressure to follow policy
   developments occurring at the international or supranational level. Yet
   international laws and policies need to be ``translated{''} to suit
   domestic political institutions and newly adopted policies may challenge
   or contradict preexisting domestic policies, institutions, and
   interests. To explore the domestic impact of international institutional
   developments, we studied the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and
   Cultural Organization (UNESCO) Convention for the Safeguarding of
   Intangible Cultural Heritage and its adoption in four countries (Japan,
   China, France, and Germany). Using historical institutionalism, this
   comparative case study sheds light on the effects of the Convention on
   cultural governance systems in two supposedly different ``camps{''}
   within the UNESCO: the East and the West. The study argues that it is
   the interaction and entangled relationship of exogenous and endogenous
   factors over time, particularly the timing and sequence in which they
   constrain and facilitate change, which shape actors' preferences and
   institutional development at both levels.},

Abstract = {Americans routinely petition their legislators for moral redress,
   drawing the US Congress into cultural debates about who we are as a
   people and what behaviors and social relationships are compatible with
   that shared identity. By engaging moral issues, Congress affirms one set
   of values over another, and legislative behavior is informed by cultural
   proxies such as religion, ideology, and partisanship. The institution
   falls short, however, when it comes to crafting lasting, comprehensive
   policy outputs in this domain. This is because moral issues do not lend
   themselves to compromise, whereas Congress is structured to seek
   compromise. The difficulties are exacerbated by party polarization
   driven by religious and ideological sorting. The upshot is that
   policymakers are often unable to build the broad coalitions necessary
   provide policy solutions. Assuming institutional arrangements and levels
   of polarization remain intact, and barring massive shifts in public
   opinion or developments in the courts, gridlock on moral issues will
   likely be the norm.},

Abstract = {Do class divisions and fear of redistribution impede political
   transitions? This article argues that tensions over economic
   redistribution in European settler colonies caused resisted
   enfranchisement and liberation wars in colonial Africa. It offers three
   main contributions. First, it identifies key scope conditions for
   redistributive transition models: in African settler colonies, the
   European elite monopolized the best agricultural land and could only
   secure their economic advantages by repressing majority rule-also
   incentivizing liberation wars. Second, it exploits a novel research
   design to assess redistributive theories. Statistical evidence from
   Africa during the decolonization era demonstrates that larger European
   settler population shares covary with smaller franchises and with more
   frequent colonial liberation wars. To account for the endogeneity of
   European settlement, the article introduces an instrument that measures
   climatic and other land suitability factors that affected where
   Europeans could settle. Third, it explains divergent decolonization
   paths.},

Abstract = {In lieu of a conclusion to the Special Issue, this article discusses the
   future of Europe as one of differentiated integration. It argues that
   this future takes the form of member-states' overlapping participation
   in the EU's many policy communities, making for a soft-core Europe, as
   an alternative option to the hard-core around the Eurozone. The article
   contends that this multi-clustered Europe is the only feasible future,
   given the challenges facing the EU from its many crises, its problems of
   governance, and the difficulties of decision-making against a background
   of increasing politicization. But such differentiation is not without
   its problems, given EU decision-rules, the interconnectedness of policy
   arenas that can spell problems of spillover, and the need for deeper
   integration in some policy areas (e.g., migration) while others may
   benefit from less or more highly differentiated integration (e.g.,
   Eurozone). Institutional reforms would also be necessary to ensure a
   positive future of differentiated integration: While the EU would
   continue to require a single set of institutions, it would need modified
   decision-rules to allow for more (and less) differentiation depending
   upon the area.},

Abstract = {This paper investigates the differences in the representational
   performance of mainstream and niche parties. It hypothesizes that
   mainstream parties represent their voters better on the socio-economic
   dimension and issues, while niche parties represent their voters better
   on the socio-cultural dimension and specific socio-cultural issues. To
   test these expectations, the congruence between Dutch local
   representatives of both mainstream and niche parties and their voters is
   measured using two surveys, one among Dutch voters and one conducted by
   the authors among a representative sample of municipal councillors. By
   analysing `many-to-many' scores of congruence, which compare the
   distributions of the preferences of the representatives and their
   voters, it is concluded that mainstream parties do not consistently
   represent their voters better on specific issues or dimensions than
   niche parties, or vice versa. Instead, a mismatch between the
   preferences of representatives and their voters sometimes occurs
   particularly on issues that a party `owns', because representatives tend
   to take more radical positions on these issues than their supporters.},

Title = {Immigrant influx and generational politics: A comparative case study of
   Hong Kong and Taiwan},
Journal = {ELECTORAL STUDIES},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {58},
Pages = {84-93},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Studies have long shown the existence of an age gap in voting behavior.
   We argue that the influx of immigrants can influence the size of this
   gap. Young people can become more apprehensive toward immigrants than
   older people because of the former's greater exposure to more
   competition from immigrants in the labor market and susceptibility to
   anti-immigrant sentiments in society. The age gap in attitudes toward
   immigrants can carry over to vote choice. We illustrate our argument
   with a comparative study of Hong Kong and Taiwan. While the two
   societies share many similarities, Hong Kong has experienced a
   significantly larger influx of immigrants from mainland China. Based on
   two election surveys in 2016, we find a distinct generational gap in
   attitudes toward immigrants in Hong Kong, but not in Taiwan. The age gap
   in Hong Kong also manifests itself in electoral support of
   China-resisting political parties.},

Abstract = {Most Russians applaud the official narrative that Russia has reemerged
   as a great power. Yet they increasingly disagree with the assertion of
   the Kremlin that the United States is a looming external danger and a
   subversive force in Russian domestic politics. In line with these
   opinions, many Russians balk at the costs of confrontation with the
   West, demonstrating the initially limited and now waning political
   significance of the ``Crimea euphoria{''} (or ``Crimea effect{''}) and
   ``rally `round the flag{''} phenomena. Russian elites often differ from
   the general public in their stronger backing for a more assertive
   foreign posture. Nevertheless, such preferences are frequently moderated
   by the apprehension that Russia will neglect domestic modernization
   indefinitely if its foreign policy is confrontational.},

Title = {Varieties of international co-operation: France's ``flexilateral{''}
   policy in the context of Brexit},
Journal = {FRENCH POLITICS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {17},
Number = {1},
Pages = {1-25},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {The aim of this article is to articulate conceptually the varieties of
   international co-operation in which states take part. In theories of
   international relations, international co-operation is generally
   analysed either through instances of multilateral collaboration (EU, UN,
   NATO), through bilateral alliances (Franco-German relationship), or
   through minilateral clubs (G7). Yet the literature does not offer a
   concept for linking these three models of international co-operation.
   Nevertheless, in practice, states simultaneously use varieties of
   international co-operation to address global public problems such as
   climate change, migration crises, and the fight against terrorism. To
   address this shortcoming, it is necessary to shift the focus from each
   type of international co-operation to their interstices, in order to
   identify the relations between the types of international co-operation
   and their reciprocal effects on decisions taken by the state. It is to
   do this that the concept of flexilateralism has been developed. This
   neologism describes the policy through which a state simultaneously
   implements varieties of international co-operation to address a public
   problem. A state's flexilateral policy, or flexilateralism, is
   operationalised by revealing four varieties of international
   co-operation: bilateralism (co-operation between two states),
   minilateralism (co-operation within an exclusive group of states),
   multilateralism (co-operation within an inclusive group of states), and
   unilateralism (no co-operation). The concept of flexilateralism is
   applied through the case of France's defence procurement policy in the
   context of the Brexit negotiations. By taking seriously varieties of
   international co-operation, the concept of flexilateralism goes a step
   further to explain the policy-making and implementation of state's
   foreign policy.},

Abstract = {The September 11th attacks marked a turning point in terms of our
   understanding of terrorism. For the first time, a religion-based
   terrorist organization not only attacked a Western country but also used
   the advantages of information and communication technologies (ICT) for
   its own benefit to carry out these attacks. From that point onwards, the
   jihad went from being a local phenomenon to acquire a global identity.
   The organizations operating within this new type of terrorism (Al-Qaeda
   or Daesh) fill their ranks with individuals who have undergone a process
   of indoctrination and radicalization. While this initially took place in
   a physical setting (offline), nowadays, it is clear that cyberspace
   (online) has become the ideal medium. In the case of Spain, a few years
   ago, 80\% of this process was conducted offline (in mosques or
   university centres) and always in the presence of a radicalizing agent.
   However, with the consolidation of ICTs, this percentage has been
   replaced by the online environment. This article has a dual objective.
   Firstly, it aims to provide a criminological and victimological
   explanation of the role of ICTs in the jihadist recruitment and
   radicalization. Secondly, it makes a comparison between the offline and
   online indoctrination processes.},

Abstract = {Individuals learn about the actions or behaviors of other people through
   the use of descriptive social norms. Previous work has argued that the
   use of negative descriptive norms (or information indicating many people
   are not doing something) depresses participation relative to positive
   descriptive norms. We show that for political actions this is not always
   correct. Using two experiments, we examine the willingness of
   individuals to take public action when these requests include either a
   positive or a negative descriptive norm. In the first, we invite
   individuals to write a local city official about city policy and in the
   second, we ask individuals to sign a petition advocating a specific
   policy at a large public university. We find that individuals are more
   likely to act when presented with the negative descriptive norm and that
   this effect stems from the anger negative descriptive norms elicit.},

Abstract = {This article discusses three different forms of genocide denial that
   have-broadly speaking-followed one another in post-genocide Rwanda since
   1994. Genocide denial is considered a stage of genocide, and each of
   these three forms of genocide denial is outlined, drawing on the seminal
   study on denial of Stanley Cohen. The article suggests that collective
   denial such as genocide denial should be distinguished analytically from
   more everyday forms of denial of atrocities and suffering. Three types
   of genocide denial-literal, interpretative, and implicatory-are
   identified and related to particular phases in post-genocide Rwandan
   history. It is shown that denial of the genocide against the Tutsi in
   Rwanda has been intertwined with post-genocide debates around
   fundamental causes and triggers of genocide. The article concludes with
   some reflections on instruments used by the Rwandan government to combat
   genocide denial, reflecting on the polarization of public and scholarly
   opinion on Rwanda's recent past.},

Title = {The Educational Correlates of Voting: A Cross-sectional Study of Finnish
   Undergraduates' Turnout in the 2014 European Parliament Election},

Abstract = {Why do well-educated citizens show high turnout in elections? Despite
   broad scholarly agreement that educational attainment predicts electoral
   participation, there is little consensus about which aspects of higher
   education account for this positive association. This study addresses
   this gap in the empirical literature by investigating the educational
   correlates of micro-level turnout. To this end, the article first
   discuss two types of factors that prior research has suggested to
   connect higher education to voting: participation-enhancing benefits;
   and the type of education. Using a unique, nationally representative
   survey of the 2012 cohort of Finnish undergraduates, the relative
   importance of and relationships between these competing factors in
   explaining the students' intended voting in the 2014 European Parliament
   election are tested. It is found that turnout is positively associated
   with the student's sense of political efficacy, which also mediates
   between an open classroom environment and turnout. Furthermore, students
   enrolled in the academic university track have stronger voting
   intentions - an effect that reflects their sense of civic duty. By
   contrast, no support is found for the effect of social network
   centrality. These results suggest that several, but not all, elements of
   higher education as discussed in the literature are relevant for
   electoral participation.},

Abstract = {We advance the literature on electoral institutions and legislative
   representation by investigating legislators' position taking strategies
   in Taiwan under the single non-transferable voting period. Existing
   research largely assumes that representatives elected from the same
   electoral rule behave similarly. We challenge this conventional
   understanding by arguing that legislators in multi-member districts
   (MMDs) tend to move toward the extreme direction from the party line if
   they come from districts where their party is less competitive. This
   pattern of legislative representation allows them to appeal to partisan
   voters, as lowering one's partisan profile can be too costly in such
   districts. On the contrary, those who are elected from strong partisan
   districts are expected to deviate from the party toward the moderate
   direction. Given a solid partisan foundation in these districts, these
   legislators may target voters across party lines. Our analysis covering
   the entire period of MMD elections after Taiwan's democratization
   (1992-2008) provides robust empirical evidence to our theoretical claim.
   Our findings, therefore, shed lights for future studies on the
   intertwining nature between electoral systems, district level factors,
   and legislative representation.},

Abstract = {Parliamentary debates provide an arena where Members of Parliament (MPs)
   present, challenge, or defend public policies. However, the ``plenary
   bottleneck{''} allows the party leadership to decide who participates in
   a debate. We argue that in this decision the timing of a debate matters:
   in proximity of elections, the leadership should be concerned with
   maintaining its brand name and therefore restrict floor access, in
   particular if the debate is salient for the respective party. We
   evaluate our hypotheses in a cross-country study drawing on a novel data
   set covering all speeches given during one or two legislative terms in
   six European parliaments. We find that the electoral cycle matters for
   the distribution of speaking time: Party leaders do restrict
   parliamentary speechmaking to a smaller number of MPs at the end of the
   term. This has important implications for our understanding of
   parliaments as an electoral arena and for our understanding of
   intraparty politics.},

Abstract = {The aim of this article is to show the scope and limitations of
   regulatory governance as a project of political modernization in
   Mexico-a project formally designed to foster greater inclusion in
   decision-making processes. To do so, I present empirical evidence from
   case studies of consultative bodies in four regulatory domains: the use
   of transgenic seeds; the regulation of telecommunications; the
   restriction of junk food in schools; and the control of carbon emissions
   from automobiles. Influencing the economic, social, and political
   interests of a wide variety of stakeholders (from consumers to big
   business and government), these decision-making processes constituted a
   ``living laboratory{''} through which to assess the effectiveness of
   institutional innovations designed to put regulatory governance into
   practice. Ultimately, this article contributes to understanding the
   challenges of a project of political modernization in Mexico, a project
   launched in the 1980s that still has not achieved its institutional
   strengthening mission of improving mechanisms of participatory
   democracy.},

Abstract = {This paper criticizes scientific deferentialism. This deferentialism is
   based on an erroneous understanding of science, but it has substantiated
   the current criticism of democracy as a process of collective
   decision-making. Plato, one of the earliest to see democracy as a
   problem, thought that the ignorance and the irrationality of the many
   justified the government of the wise. Brennan, in Against Democracy
   (2016), defended the same.
   The author offers, on the other hand, an innovative alternative based on
   a fallibilistic conception of knowledge and democracy, according to
   which democratic authority and legitimacy do not depend on the tendency
   of democracy to made correct solutions, but on the tendency of
   intelligent crowds, in the Information Age, to avoid wrong decisions.},

Abstract = {The emergence of green parties has injected new lines of competition
   into national party systems, with discernible issue competition effects
   for established, ideologically-proximate social democratic parties.
   Despite a burgeoning literature on green and social democratic issue
   competition tactics in settings where coalition government is common, we
   have less understanding of these same effects in settings where majority
   government is the norm. Using the case of the Australian Greens and the
   Australian Labor Party, we explore issue competition dynamics in a
   polity where the majoritarian electoral system reduces opportunities for
   coalition formation. We find that the absence of strong electoral
   imperatives for either party to enter coalitions has encouraged them to
   compete adjacent to one another, rather than in direct competition.},

Abstract = {This paper raises the question of the `existence' (the ontological
   status) of the nation and other `collective identities' in connection
   with issues of community and violence. It is widely recognised that `the
   nation' must be understood as a social construct rather than a naturally
   or essentially `given' entity; but this recognition is not enough if we
   then simply continue to think of the nation as an entity outside ongoing
   processes of construction and deconstruction. The details of the way
   each political entity is constructed are important. We examine two key
   documents and draw out two ways in which community (and thus democracy)
   can be constructed. An examination of the kind of `national identity'
   projected in the Proclamation of 1916 illustrates the process of
   denomination that posits closed collective `communities of identity'
   which reduce to friend-enemy, inside-outside binaries, thus setting the
   scene for conflict. Elements of the Belfast or Good Friday Agreement
   show we can extrapolate ways of creating a `we' that does not reduce to
   one or another positive identity but that takes place when different
   people combine in the space opened by a commitment to non-violence and
   democracy in a `community of others'.},

Title = {The military draft in Thailand: a critique from a nonkilling global
   political science perspective},
Journal = {GLOBAL CHANGE PEACE \& SECURITY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {31},
Number = {1},

Month = {JAN 2},
Abstract = {Thailand has had mandatory military service since 1905 and since 1954
   via a lottery system. Beatings and deaths frequently occur among
   draftees, and photographs and videos in which draftees are injured,
   tortured, and humiliated are widespread. This article describes for the
   first time the development and nature of the Thai military draft. The
   authors analyse the military draft from a nonkilling global political
   science perspective and present a nonkilling rationale for ending the
   draft. The article argues that retaining the military draft promotes a
   killing society and violates human rights, including the right to
   conscientious objection; causes mental anguish; is inefficient
   economically; causes corruption; and supports military interventionism.
   The authors further maintain that physical abuse that has accompanied
   the Thai version of military conscription constitutes a pro-killing
   manifestation of the military regime's approach to maintaining the
   existing institutional alignment and control in Glenn Paige's `funnel of
   killing'. Instead, we recommend converting the draft to a national
   service program with civilian alternatives, together with conscientious
   objection as a right.},

Abstract = {Electoral processes do not escape the digital transformation that our
   society is undergoing. The necessary adaptation of electoral regulations
   to the use of digital technologies implies respect for personal data
   protection regulations and the existence of adequate guarantees that
   prevent political parties from manipulating citizens' votes for the
   information they know or get to know about them through the Internet.
   The modification of article 58.bis).1 of Organic Law 5/1985, of the
   General Electoral System (LOREG), allowing political parties to collect
   personal data related to the political opinions of citizens, provoked
   from headlines, citizen criticism and interesting debates by experts in
   the field to the proposal by the Ombudsman of an appeal of
   unconstitutionality against said possibility. The Constitutional Court
   in the Jugdment 76/2019 ends the debate by manifesting not only the
   unconstitutionality of the contested precept, but also by demonstrating
   the importance of protecting citizens' personal data with due
   guarantees, especially when these data are a reflection of their
   political ideology and their treatment affects the correct democratic
   functioning of our State.},

Journal = {QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {14},

Pages = {383-400},
Abstract = {In 2008, a group of uninsured low-income adults in Oregon was selected
   by lottery for the chance to apply for Medicaid. Using this randomized
   design and state administrative data on voter behavior, we analyze how a
   Medicaid expansion affected voter turnout and registration. We find that
   Medicaid increased voter turnout in the November 2008 Presidential
   election by about 7\% overall, with the effects concentrated in men
   (18\% increase) and in residents of Democratic counties (10\% increase);
   there is suggestive evidence that the increase in voting reflected new
   voter registrations, rather than increased turnout among pre-existing
   registrants. There is no evidence of an increase in voter turnout in
   subsequent elections, up to and including the November 2010 midterm
   election.},

Volume = {95},
Number = {4},
Pages = {25-38},
Abstract = {The issue of justice has always been given a place of pride in political
   philosophy and philosophy of law. Amartya Sen, an Indian scientist, has
   made an significant contribution to the development of this problem. His
   concept, which took on its final form at the end of the 20th - beginning
   of the 21st centuries, remains very influential today.
   Sen's innovation is that he criticized the so-called ``transcendental
   institutionalism{''}, which underlies the approach to justice of many
   famous theorists, including John Rawls and his ardent opponent Robert
   Nozick. Altering the approach allowed Sen to go beyond the
   already-classic discussion of the nature of justice, which obviously
   came to a stalemate by the beginning of the 21st century. Using the
   original methodology, Sen created a theory of a truly global scale,
   claiming to solve a whole range of problems that humanity faces.
   Moving away from transcendentalism, Sen assigned a key role in social
   development to public reasoning and the democratic process that is
   inextricably linked to the former. However, this turned out to be an
   Achilles heel of his theory. The metamorphoses of democracy in the
   modern world do not give grounds for optimism regarding the growth of
   freedom and solidarity in human society. Meanwhile, since Sen denied
   rigid institutional structures, his concept cannot rely on some ideal
   model that can set a vector and a guideline for social development. As a
   result, Sen's ideas, for all their intellectual brilliance and appealing
   humanism, are divorced from reality and have a tinge of the very
   Utopianism that their author fought against.},

Abstract = {The objective of this text is to place the role of the Public legal aid
   on immigration in the debate of the migration control industry, as well
   as the migration rescue industry. While this service is framed within
   the structure of a private corporate body but of public interest, such
   as the Bar Associations, they are the result of a guarantee regulation
   of the recognition of the right to a due defense, particularly in
   sanction procedures for expulsion. Therefore, the main argument is that
   the Lawyers in this service are located in an intermediate space between
   the Control Industry and the Industry of rescue: although there is a
   certain remuneration and a profit in the assistance, these lawyers
   arise, to a large extent, from personal impulses and social values such
   as commitment to the rights of foreigners.},

Abstract = {Gyorgy Konrad was one of the outstanding intellectuals from
   eastern-central Europe. As a dissident, he shaped the profile of the
   opposition to communist rule. As an essayist and publicist, he dedicated
   his work to the study of the more recent history of eastern-central
   Europe, examined the areas of continuity and transformation of
   authoritarian rule, considered the fate of the Jews in the 20th century
   and ``Auschwitz{''} as a break with civilisation, and looked to the
   future of Hungary and the European Union with hopes, concerns and fears.

Abstract = {In what ways do everyday life and private spaces become productive
   elements for platform organizations? Referring to a research on Airbnb
   (a platform-based company and current leader at the global level in the
   online hospitality industry) recently conducted in a touristic
   north-eastern Italian province, this paper critically explores to what
   degree and how Airbnb pervades, changes and controls the Hosts' domestic
   space and spare time. To do so, first we will concentrate on the
   elements that regulate the relationship between the user and the
   platform and on some of the processes and mechanisms implied by the
   platform architecture. Then, by describing the everyday practices of
   ``house-management{''} enacted by the Hosts, we will highlight the
   invisible work involved in `performing the platform'. From this point of
   view, it is worth noticing how, although Airbnb does not aim to create a
   parallel labour market, it produces `platform workers' anyway, in that
   it implies the active engagement of its users in concrete activities.
   Airbnb is thus a perfect case to look at the ways in which platform
   organizations engage users in forms of production previously unknown,
   turning private goods and time into productive elements.},

Abstract = {Civil society actors have always been crucial players in the development
   of welfare systems. Far before the appearance of the welfare state, the
   provision of services to those in need was the domain of charities and
   guilds, and later on of the mutual aid organizations related to the
   labour movement. Together with providing services, civil society actors
   have exerted political pressure on the state, demanding an enlargement
   of social rights or challenging the principles of public intervention.
   Such a relevant role became even more pivotal after the `70s, when the
   welfare mix model paved the way for the entrance of third sector
   organizations into public service provision and governance processes.
   Within this scenario, this article aims to develop a historically-based
   conceptual framework, through which the huge heterogeneity of civil
   society actors and functions can be analyzed. The possibility of
   performing several roles represents an opportunity for civil society
   actors, but at the same times engenders contradictions and trade-offs
   for social movements and the third sector.},

Abstract = {In this article, I argue that we should measure a person's linguistic
   advantage within a particular linguistic environment according to the
   extent to which his or her preferences about that environment are
   satisfied. I begin by outlining three criteria that a model of
   linguistic advantage should satisfy, if it is to serve as a plausible
   guide for theories of linguistic justice. I then describe a model that
   is capable of satisfying these criteria - the preference satisfaction
   model - and defend it from several potential objections. Finally, I
   consider some practical implications of the PSM, and describe how the
   model should be modified in cases where there are insufficient resources
   for it to be fully implemented.},

Journal = {RUSI JOURNAL},

Volume = {164},
Number = {7},
Pages = {32-41},
Abstract = {At 0.92\% of GDP in 2019 and with the expectation that this figure will
   remain frozen until 2022, Spain's defence budget is, proportionally, the
   second-lowest of the NATO countries obliged to meet the 2\% target.
   However, (sic)12.9 billion has just been committed to replace older
   weaponry and ensure work for the country's defence industry. With a
   public debt that hinders military planning and no budgetary stability to
   guarantee the financing and maintenance of weapons and equipment, Spain
   risks fielding inoperative armed forces incapable of either contributing
   to collective security or satisfying the country's defence needs.
   Guillem Colom-Piella explores the current situation and its potential
   implications.},

Abstract = {The study explored the strength of national identification and
   intergroup attitudes of Chinese youth (n = 591, aged 12-15) toward the
   Chinese, the Americans, the Japanese, and the South Koreans. The
   participants were asked to fill in a questionnaire and write down
   reasons why they `like' or `dislike' the four groups. The results showed
   a consistency in in-group favoritism. Gender and age were both related
   to Chinese youths' national identifications and their national
   intergroup attitudes. Confucian ethics, media influence and historical
   complex were identified as main factors that may contribute to their
   attitudes toward the four groups.},

Title = {Finding the Question: A Puzzle-Based Approach to the Logic of Discovery},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE EDUCATION},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {15},
Number = {3},
Pages = {377-386},
Abstract = {When it comes to research design, the literature largely focuses on
   prescriptions for strengthening causal inference-identifying
   con-founders, selecting appropriately comparable cases, generating
   testable hypotheses, etc. This approach to research design features the
   logic of inquiry heavily, but overlooks the logic of discovery. The
   logic of discovery is a stage in the research design process that is
   often bracketed off as an unexplainable moment of inspiation, and is
   largely missing from the research design literature. We address this gap
   by advancing a puzzle-based approach to the discovery phase in the life
   cycle of a research project. We develop a typology of empirical,
   theoretical, and methodological puzzles, and provide guidance for
   identifying research questions in each. We argue that not only can the
   discovery phase of a research design be thought of-and taught-in a
   systematic way, but that a puzzle-based approach to developing research
   questions can structure subsequent decisions, such as case selection,
   identifying the appropriate theoretical framework, and concept
   formation. We conclude that a puzzle-based approach is a useful way to
   structure research design, both for practitioners and as a pedagogical
   tool.},

Abstract = {Legislative amendment poses a conundrum: why do governments amend
   legislation that they only recently drafted? An effective method for
   quantifying amendments across a wide range of policy areas and
   legislatures would be valuable for answering such questions. Existing
   studies almost all rely on hand-counting and coding of amendments,
   methods which are laborious, necessarily subjective, and difficult to
   replicate. Using insights from bioinformatics (the study of genetic
   codes), we developed a streamlined method to quantify and visualise the
   amount of amendment. In an exploratory study of three parliamentary
   sessions since 2008, we found that UK legislation was considerably
   amended and lengthened during the parliamentary process. We discuss our
   results in the light of theories of information asymmetries between the
   government and the legislature.},

Abstract = {The concept of open society is among possible projective alternatives
   that is related to the search for an acceptable arrangement of social
   and political structures of society, while largely reflecting the
   fundamental uncertainty of reality. The primary goal of this paper is in
   an endeavour to place the key political, philosophical and partly
   historical parameters of the concept of open society in the arena of
   contemporary political theory and practice, the analysis of strengths
   and risks of an open society concept in terms of its potential content,
   taking into account the cross/section of individual differentiated
   interests with circumstances, systemic pressures or ideological
   prejudices and making precise recommendations for a full-fledged
   implementation of an empirically verifiable form of coexistence,
   superior to any potential and/or existing totalitarian alternatives.
   Especially, we have outlined general framework of the concept of open
   society and the transformation of theoretical parameters of an open
   society into a political intention (system) in K. R. Popper and G. Soros
   theory of open society and the philosophy of critical rationalism.},

Abstract = {In the wake of displacement, people are tasked with reconstructing a
   sense of home in a new and unfamiliar location. In this article, we
   consider how the experience of displacement complicates our
   understanding of what it means to be at home by exposing the significant
   labour that goes into its imagination and re-imagination. We examine
   practices of homemaking after displacement through two interrelated
   themes: (a) narratives of home, where we discuss how displaced persons
   nurture a sense of home through memory and storytelling; and (b)
   textures of home, where we emphasize how a sense of home is sustained or
   re-imagined through material objects. Within this discussion, we
   maintain that there is a continuity between the violence of displacement
   and the violence of relocation, as the task of re-imagining home is
   often compounded by structural factors including socioeconomic
   marginalization and racialization in the country of settlement. We
   conceptualize displacement as an injustice and homemaking as a form of
   cultural labour that exemplifies the agency, innovation, and resilience
   of displaced persons.},

Abstract = {This essay reviews Financial Institutions and Development in China, by
   Satyananda J. Gabriel. In this book, the author studies the role played
   by the financial system in China's economic expansion and in the gradual
   transformation of that sector. The author's description of the financial
   sector is detailed and the information he provides is useful in
   picturing the various parts of the Chinese financial system. The author
   also raises important questions regarding financial reforms in China and
   how they have shaped capital accumulation. However, he falls short of
   his ambitious goal of elucidating the role of the financial sector in
   the Chinese expansion. There are important issues with the organization
   of the book, the analytical framework used, and the evidence or
   arguments brought forward to support many of the book's claims. As such,
   the reader is left without satisfactory answers to many of the
   intriguing questions raised in the book.},

Journal = {POLITICS AND GOVERNANCE},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {7},
Number = {3},
Pages = {51-61},
Abstract = {Climate change governance is one of the EU's priorities. The EU has
   developed a central (and arguably, a leading) role in global climate
   governance. The UK has been an important supporter of strong climate
   action both within the EU and in international climate negotiations. We
   investigate how/whether the EU's role in global climate governance will
   be affected by Brexit by focusing on potential changes in three
   conditions for EU leadership: (1) credible and ambitious internal
   climate policy; (2) constant and effective international engagement
   through climate diplomacy; and (3) the ability to attract followers. We
   find that the UK has sometimes played the role of a pivotal outlier,
   either pushing for more internal policy ambition or blocking certain
   policy options. Brexit is likely to have cumulative effects on the EU's
   role in global climate governance over the long term, through a series
   of changes in internal EU policymaking and climate diplomacy. The speed
   and scope of these changes depend on the nature of the future UK-EU
   relationship. We argue that the broader international context and
   strains on EU unity represent more urgent challenges to the EU's role in
   global climate governance than those posed by Brexit.},

Abstract = {This article analyzes how a party's policy statements affect voters'
   perceptions of where the party stands on a given issue. I argue that
   voters do not take a party's statements at face value because these
   messages can be a strategic tool to win elections. Voters discount
   popular statements because they may respond to vote-seeking incentives
   rather than reflect the party's sincere views. Espousing unpopular
   policies has less instrumental value in obtaining more votes and
   therefore is more credible. I have tested this argument with a survey
   experiment fielded in the United Kingdom that exposes respondents to
   Conservative and Labour Party statements on immigration and the National
   Health Service. I report evidence that popular statements tend to have a
   weaker effect on voter perceptions than unpopular ones. This finding
   suggests a paradox: the more a party needs to change its reputation in
   order to gain votes, the stronger the voters' skepticism.},

Pages = {165-175},
Abstract = {The results of Eurobarometer surveys in last two years shows that
   Slovaks have very negative perception of immigration from the non-EU
   countries. As suggested by Eurobarometer the attitude is influenced by
   factors such as education level, wealth, occupation, age and other
   socio-economic factors. The main aim of this contribution is to analyze
   Slovak attitude towards migration in relation to other EU countries and
   to search for possible causes of the negative attitude toward Slovak
   citizens with special focus on Nitra Region. To what degree people
   attitudes from Nitra Region differ from that of the Slovakia and the EU?
   The contribution will present research results dedicated to false
   assumptions and misunderstandings of citizens about migration which will
   be put in relation to migration in its deeper context. In this sense
   presented study will reveal discrepancy between Eurobarometer survey
   data and data collected on a local level in Nitra region. The main claim
   of the contribution is in line with existing literature and leads to the
   conclusion that negative attitude of citizens is mostly caused by lower
   level of education and lack of general knowledge about migrants.},

Abstract = {The growth of China's interest towards the Arctic over the past decades
   can be explained by three main driving factors: mineral assets, new sea
   routes and the need in scientific research. The first two components are
   obvious priorities, while the third one legitimizes the rising presence
   of China in the Arctic region fueled by the country's new geopolitical
   aspirations. In this regard, the paper aims to assess China's Arctic
   scientific potential by following it in dynamics, as well as to
   determine its impact on the overall changing global role of the PRC. To
   this end, the author examines in detail the main stages of China's
   research activities in the Arctic, which evolved from the Antarctic
   research of China. The beginning of one of the stages was associated
   with the transition from studying the Arctic natural status to assessing
   its regional business and strategic potentials what was inspired by the
   fact that Russian research expedition planted the Russian flag in the
   North Pole seabed in 2007. This event, among other things, gave rise to
   China's special interest in promoting scientific dialogue with Russia on
   the Arctic issues. The author also points out the evolution of the
   Chinese Arctic research institutes since the late 1980s, compares nine
   China Arctic National Research Expeditions and gives an update on
   China's regional infrastructure, drawing particular attention to its
   intended further expansion. In the paper, special attention is paid to
   the Chinese contribution to a broader international scientific effort on
   the Arctic, both as part of international scientific organizations'
   activities and/or bilateral and exclusive multilateral scientific
   dialogue. Basing on the data collected, the author demonstrates how
   China's increased investment in Arctic scientific programs has been
   transferred into specific scientific and technological achievements and
   how the importance of the Arctic research has gradually increased within
   the block of Chinese Polar research. The author concludes that these
   factors allowed China to turn from a country with limited Arctic
   research interest into a ``near -Arctic state{''}, a notable player in
   the region with its own developed infrastructure, knowledge of the
   Arctic and significant research potential as well.},

Title = {CAPTURE OF THE SOVIET TANKER ``TUAPSE{''}: A HOSTAGE SWAP ENDGAME
   (COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS OF THE EVENTS AND THE TRUE CAUSES OF THE INCIDENT)},
Journal = {SRAVNITELNAYA POLITIKA-COMPARATIVE POLITICS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {10},

Pages = {165-177},
Abstract = {The paper is a final piece of the three articles series, revealing a new
   eye-opening conception on true reasons and objectives of the
   ``Tuapse{''} incident. The story of Soviet tanker Tuapse, captured by
   the ROC (Taiwan) Navy on June 23, 1954 in open seas near Taiwan is
   widely covered in Russian and global mass media. The main events and
   dramatic story of the Tuapse crew are generally reconstructed, but the
   true reasons and aims of this incident remain an open question so far.
   This article, containing the comparative analyze of two incidents and
   multilateral politics at final stage of the related events
   (January-August 1955), gives a final answer to this question. It
   presents a special interpretation of the events, leading to conclusion
   that the capture of Tuapse and its crew was nothing but a special CIA
   hostage swap operation, instrumental to negotiations on the release of

Abstract = {German-Israeli relations are inseparably linked to the remembrance of
   the Holocaust. Despite this heavy burden, it has been possible to
   establish a relationship that is considered by both sides to be a
   friendship. It is based on shared values and the democratic order, and
   includes the willingness to show political solidarity with each other.
   However, it is not clear how much substance there is to this solidarity,
   or how far it might extend. Recently, Israel and Germany have moved
   further apart from each other. This is due to political differences,
   different interests and conflicting values. There are disagreements over
   attitudes to the two-state solution, the building of settlements, the
   Iranian nuclear programme and illiberal tendencies under Prime Minister
   Netanyahu.},

Journal = {POLITICS AND GOVERNANCE},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {7},
Number = {3},
Pages = {291-302},
Abstract = {The European Central Bank (ECB) became one of the key actors during the
   Eurozone crisis. However, its prominent role was not without
   controversy. On one hand, the Eurozone was stabilised, no member state
   defaulted, and no state had to leave the Euro. On the other hand, the
   ECB had to stretch its mandate, expand its policy remit, and adopt
   so-called `unconventional' monetary policies. These attempts to
   depoliticise political challenges through a technocratic approach
   reduced the opportunities for democratic contestation, but they also
   bred frustration that led to politicisation. This article studies to
   what extent this politicisation affected the perception of the ECB in
   national parliaments. For this purpose, it studies the extent to which
   ECB policy has become politicised in the German Bundestag through an
   analysis of plenary debates from 2005 to 2018. The Bundestag represents
   an unlikely case for politicisation despite wide-spread criticism of the
   ECB in the media, as Germany was traditionally attached to creating a
   highly independent ECB, until recently had no major Eurosceptic
   right-wing parties, and parliamentary scrutiny of the national central
   bank is low. However, by studying the salience of ECB policies, the
   polarisation of opinion in the parliament, as well as the range of
   actors participating in the debates, this article finds that the ECB's
   policies have become politicised and the subject of scrutiny and
   dissatisfaction.},

Abstract = {This article examines how the Zimbabwe African National Union Patriotic
   Front party turned against its cadres between 2004 and 2017. It argues
   that the infightings were caused by Mugabe, who pitted one faction
   against the other as the Zimbabwe African National Union (ZANU) PF
   cashiered its cadres to safeguard Mugabe. It was the same militarized
   factionalism that catapulted Mugabe to the helm of the national
   liberation movement in 1977, spearheaded his removal in 2017, and
   propelled Mnangagwa to become President. However, Mnangagwa - who
   replaced Mugabe, the Machiavellian manipulator of his party's
   factionalism - lacked adroit skills, hence the sense of rudderlessness
   and incoherence in the party.},

Abstract = {There is a large body of research showing that the provision of social
   policies is higher under proportional electoral systems than under
   majoritarian systems. This article helps advance this literature by
   showing that the geographic distribution of social recipients plays an
   essential role in moderating the impact of electoral institutions on
   social provision. Using data from twenty-two OECD countries, the results
   show that majoritarian systems increase the provision of social spending
   when recipients are concentrated in certain regions. When levels of
   concentration are high, social spending in majoritarian countries can
   surpass levels of provision in proportional representation systems.},

Abstract = {In the autumn of 2018, 40 concerts were forbidden in Russia. In musical
   and political terms, an extremely wide range of different artists were
   affected. What they have in common is that they mainly attract a young
   audience. The method used followed a particular pattern: ``outraged
   parents{''} contacted the local authorities and demanded that the
   performances be banned in order to protect minors from ``destructive
   content{''}. Frequently, the police did indeed intervene, and in some
   cases, even the FSB or special units from the Ministry of the Interior.
   However, it is not a battle against the opposition that forms the
   backdrop to this campaign, but rather measures against hip-hoppers and
   rappers and a case of ``moral panic{''}. The state is battling against
   purely fictitious risks with real means. In this way, the political
   leadership tries to increase its legitimacy.},

   Survey Timing},
Journal = {QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {14},
Number = {3},
Pages = {293-311},
Abstract = {Despite growing concerns about the diffusion of political rumors,
   researchers often lack the means to estimate their effects. Field
   experiments seem infeasible due to ethical issues. Survey experiments
   typically invoke strong assumptions about homogeneous treatment effects
   across subjects and settings. We argue that exploiting temporal overlap
   between rumor circulations and survey interviews can be a useful
   alternative. We focus on an accidental and sudden spread of
   ``Obama-is-a-Muslim{''} myths in September 2008. Using a
   difference-in-differences strategy that compares over-time belief
   changes of those interviewed for the September wave of the 2008-2009
   American National Election Studies surveys before the rumor circulation
   and afterwards, we find that this event increased people's belief that
   Barack Obama is a Muslim by 4 to 8 percentage points. To rule out
   various alternative explanations, we show that the treatment and control
   groups changed in parallel across waves in terms of an extensive set of
   placebo variables including political knowledge, other political
   misperception, and general attitudes toward Obama.},

Journal = {POLIS-POLITICHESKIYE ISSLEDOVANIYA},
Year = {2019},
Number = {5},
Pages = {148-166},
Abstract = {The article highlights challenges and responses to communication
   failures in politics and political science. In this context, the word
   translation refers to an adequate understanding of each other and
   oneself in political interactions. By its very nature, it is partial and
   relative. This ambiguity results from unsocial sociability (ungesellige
   Geselligkeit) as outlined by Kant, and corresponds to the principle of
   incompleteness of phenomena that triggers evolution (Deacon). Still,
   people at large associate many typical dysfunctions and losses in
   translation with ill will or technical errors rather than fundamental
   relativity of human communication. They readily endorse the illusion of
   one-to-one correspondence of phenomena, terms, their sense and
   reference. The authors examine the nature and parameters of translation
   and transfer providing examples like Parson's translation of Weber's
   stahlhartes Gehause as iron cage, as well as the interpretation of
   revolution, Europe and Eurasia, governance, polity, politics, policy,
   and police. Translation and interpretation expounds within fluid
   interfaces which embroil online political and communicative processes on
   the one hand and offline institutional and sign systems on the other.
   The ensuing relativity of translation, interpretation and transfer
   techniques allows the issue of variability and equivalence of terms and
   other tools of our communication and understanding to be reconsidered.
   Finally, the article outlines the format of the series ``Lost in
   Translation{''}.},

Title = {THE MIDDLE POWER CONCEPT: PRESENTING A COMPLEX APPROACH},
Journal = {POLITICKE VEDY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {22},
Number = {4},
Pages = {33-56},
Abstract = {Middle powers have traditionally played an important role in the
   international system. Nowadays, the label of middle power possesses
   relevant political implications and thus theorizing about middle powers
   is more significant than ever before. However, there is a lack of exact
   and complex middle power definition in academic as well as in political
   area. Hence, in the present study, an overview of the development of
   middle power theorizing from its beginning up to the present was offered
   in form of a literature review. Subsequently, the main
   conceptualizations of middle power were compared, the advantages and
   disadvantages of each particular attitude emphasized and a complex
   approach toward defining middle power was proposed. The results show
   that the complex approach towards the conceptualization of middle powers
   employs the strengths of previous approaches and overcomes their
   weaknesses. The emphasis on the relative position of a state in the
   power pyramid is based on the belief that this position, in combination
   with value orientation and self-image, affects both the state's actions
   and its ability to create conditions for the functioning of the
   international system and the ability to influence the basic parameters
   of the international system.},

Abstract = {Considering its conservative past, South Korea is undergoing an
   unprecedented turn to the left. Since priority was given to economic
   growth from the 1960s until the beginning of the 1990s, a close alliance
   between big business and government has characterised the country's
   labour market. Since the 1997 financial crisis, however, two decades of
   liberal and conservative governments have pushed a neoliberal agenda of
   labour market flexibilisation, which has resulted in growing inequality
   in a dualised labour market and left the trade unions in a marginal
   role. Following a rapid turn of events that led to the impeachment of
   conservative president Park Geun-hye, left-leaning President Moon Jae-in
   seems determined to roll back this legacy of labour oppression with the
   strong support of trade unions and young voters. His administration is
   pushing for policy change with a series of expansionary active labour
   market policies aimed at promoting stability and full-time employment.
   This article highlights the social-democratic character of these reforms
   and the constraints in implementing them.},

Abstract = {How party strategies vary by electoral system remains largely unexplored
   in election studies. Using qualitative and quantitative data from
   Spanish national and European elections, we test how party strategies
   diverge between districted electoral systems and systems using a single
   national district. We use the number of visits to districts by the party
   leaders to determine if targeted party strategies are driven by district
   magnitude, the share of the population entitled to vote in every
   district, the number of districts or the strength of parties' local
   organizations. Our results show that only the frequency of visits to
   districts by large parties are clearly affected by electoral systems
   and, more specifically, by the number of districts and district
   population.},

Abstract = {Emigration is now a permanent theme in the life of the Indo-Fijian
   community. Anyone who can, wants to leave. This piece once again touches
   on the theme of the trauma and tragedy of migration explored in the
   previous chapter. Soon after the coup of 1987 and the convulsions that
   followed, many Indo-Fijians sought desperately to emigrate, leaving
   behind elderly parents and relatives who did not meet the criteria for
   emigration. Some visited their children and grandchildren later, only to
   realise a gulf now separated them from their children. Mr Arjun's
   experience will find resonance in the lives of many others.},

Abstract = {The authors argue that Russian-Chinese rapprochement is a fundamental
   feature of the current changing system of international relations. The
   two countries are effectively enabling each other to conduct independent
   foreign policies often in direct opposition to the West. There is a
   degree of complementarity between the two sides with Russia having
   comparative advantage in the military, intelligence and diplomatic
   fields and China being an economic superpower. The region of Central
   Asia which, as some Western authors have expected, could become the
   hotpoint of the Russian-Chinese rivalry. Yet in reality it became the
   cradle of the two countries' cooperation which is now affecting a wide
   range of international issues. Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO)
   has emerged as the main platform for Russian-Chinese cooperation in
   Central Asia. After India and Pakistan joined the SCO in 2017 it is
   evolving into a mechanism of Russian-Chinese cooperation not only in
   Central Asia but in the Indo-Pacific as a whole. The Korean peninsula is
   another important area of coordination between Moscow and Beijing in the
   Asia-Pacific. Russia and China have also been working on increasing
   interoperability of their military forces in the region since mid 2000s.
   Technically they have already done a great job for preparing ground for
   a military alliance. However, politically they do not appear to be ready
   for that yet.},

Pages = {5-28},
Abstract = {As research on the empirical link between aid and growth continues to
   grow, it is time to revisit the accumulated evidence on aid
   effectiveness. This study extends previous meta-analyses, noting that
   the increased availability of data enables us to conduct a sub-group
   analysis by disaggregating the sample into different time horizons to
   assess whether there are temporal shifts in aid effectiveness. The new
   and updated results show that the previously reported positive evidence
   of aid's impact is robust to the inclusion of more recent studies and
   this holds for different time horizons as well. The authenticity of the
   observed effect is further confirmed by results from funnel plots,
   regression-based tests, and a cumulative meta-analysis for publication
   bias.},

Abstract = {If we sum up the tasks facing the Russian state in relation to the young
   generation, then all of them are associated with its harmonious
   inclusion in the social and political development of the country. At the
   normative level, the current need is declared for young people to form
   active citizenship and democratic political culture, which is possible
   only in a constant and equal dialogue between the authorities and young
   people. Ensuring the interaction of the younger generation with the
   political elite presupposes the existence of certain conditions - the
   creation and effective functioning of the information infrastructure of
   youth policy, as well as the conduct of an open active information
   policy.
   The article describes the results of a study of the political status of
   students of the capital of Tatarstan - Kazan, in particular, such
   parameters as youth interest in political information, trust in the
   sources of this information, and political participation. Together with
   the data of secondary studies, this made it possible to characterize the
   youth sector of political communication, identify the existing
   difficulties in the interaction of the government and youth, in
   particular, identify some difficulties in receiving and disseminating
   political information among the youth, which impede the development of a
   democratic political culture and the accumulation of social capital of
   the young generation.},

   responded to getting it wrong in 1948 and 2016},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF POLITICAL MARKETING},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {18},

Pages = {148-177},
Abstract = {The US presidential elections of 1948 and 2016 produced surprise
   outcomes when the predicted winners ended up losing the election. Using
   image repair theory, this article explains the strategies the media used
   to repair their image in light of predicting the wrong winner. Using a
   qualitative analysis of news coverage that immediately followed the 1948
   and 2016 presidential elections, this study finds that the media
   utilized similar image repair strategies of offering explanations for
   poor information, highlighting the media's good reporting, diminishing
   the harm caused by the inaccurate predictions, and justifying the
   inaccurate predictions of both elections. However, the media responses
   in 1948 and 2016 differed greatly in tone and in the utilization of a
   new attack strategy to deflect criticism of the media itself. These
   strategies suggest that media use of image restoration is limited
   because of the unique societal expectations placed on the press, and
   that the media's inaccurate 2016 predictions and subsequent attack
   strategies may have been contributed to the heightened criticism of
   mainstream news.},

Abstract = {The EU member states' modern security initiatives, realized by the
   defence alliance for Permanent Structured Cooperation (PESCO) have been
   found out. PESCO implementation process was initiated and headed by
   France and Germany. The countries proposed a step-by-step approach to
   strengthening defence capabilities and operational commitments to
   increase the overall defence efforts of United Europe. Allegedly,
   nowadays there are many practical problems and challenges on the way to
   the successful implementation of PESCO. Its successful overcoming will
   be facilitated by the ability of initiator countries to deal with
   short-term operational issues. The differences in the strategic culture
   and models of European defence, the long-term priorities of some member
   states also will have significant importance for the long-term
   perspective of the successful functioning of PESCO.},

Abstract = {In 1932, the American electorate was surveyed in a poll that has
   languished in the archives. The survey was conducted by Houser
   Associates, a pioneer in market research. It interviewed face-to-face a
   representative cross section about voter choices and issue attitudes.
   Although conducted on behalf of the Hoover campaign, the poll was not
   biased in his favor. The most striking revelation is that the electoral
   sway of the Depression was quite limited. The government was not seen by
   most voters as the major culprit or as having been ineffective in
   alleviating it. Even many FDR voters agreed. Moreover, there was no
   widespread ``doom and gloom{''} about the future. What loomed larger in
   1932 was the issue of Prohibition. The American people overwhelmingly
   favored repeal. The Democratic stand on it-that is, outright repeal-was
   a sure electoral winner, given Hoover's staunch defense of Prohibition.},

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL CRITICAL THOUGHT},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {9},

Abstract = {For many, the ``Trump phenomenon{''} represents an authoritarian phase
   of the neoliberal project. For others, it is a manifestation of a
   broader populist project that is the antithesis of, and arises in part
   as a reaction against, neoliberalism. Across Europe, political parties
   hitherto identified with the Far Right and thus beyond the margins of
   ``respectable{''} politics have sought to reinvent themselves as
   legitimate voices within this populist framework. The UK ``Brexit{''}
   vote and the policies of the May administration further suggest a
   coalition emerging around the Far Right and those on the nationalist
   wing of conservatism, putting them at odds with the neoliberals and
   neoconservatives who have dominated the political Right for some time,
   and who have been the principal drivers of capitalist globalization.
   This begs the question-does the new populism signal the end of the
   globalization project? And what, if anything, can the Left do in
   response?},

Journal = {PARTY POLITICS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {25},
Number = {1, SI},
Pages = {50-62},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {The reasons pushing parties to politicize noneconomic dimensions of
   competition, and the consequences of this for the representation of
   public opinion, are badly understood in the party competition
   literature. This is a pressing research gap, especially given the recent
   and significant reactivation of territorial or center-periphery
   conflicts in Western Europe. In this article, we first argue that bad
   macroeconomic performance increases the incentives of incumbent parties
   to deviate the attention toward territorial conflicts in order to avoid
   electoral punishment. Second, we also argue that the opposite is true
   for public opinion: it is precisely during periods of bad economic
   performance and high economic concern, when the electorate moves away
   from territorial interests. The dynamic emerging from our findings is
   thus far from an ideal bottom-up representation: elites divert the
   attention toward territorial conflicts to mask periods of poor economic
   performance, which is precisely when public opinion is less interested
   in center-periphery issues. We validate our claims using text analysis
   of party attention in Spain and time series models covering four
   electoral cycles (1996-2011).},

Abstract = {In this article, I carry out an analytical and experiential journey of
   the agrarian reform process and my experience of promotion and
   organization with communities and rural women in Canta (Lima), Puno and
   Piura. My analysis of agrarian reform is located from my origins and
   indigenous roots in the Quispampa peasant community (Huancabamba-Piura).
   From situated knowledge and decolonial sentipensar, I demonstrate the
   importance of recognizing the historicity of peasant communities, of
   promoting organizational strengthening and the autonomous movement of
   indigenous women. In Canta, I emphasize the community organicity of
   indigenous peoples; in Puno, the experience of Popular Education and
   radio communication; and, in Huancabamba (Piura), Permanent Education
   and participant research that strengthen women's autonomy and own voice.
   I demonstrate the racist, ethnocentric colonial legacy of economic
   injustice, inequality and patriarchal violence that impacts indigenous
   communities. I challenge to recover the practice of Buen Vivir and care
   for the network of life of the peoples of Peru to transform and generate
   necessary changes in the redistribution of common goods and free from
   capitalist oppression and for justice with the Peruvian peasantry.},

Abstract = {Focusing on feminism, this article describes the political, social and
   economic situation in Chile throughout 2018. We argue that during this
   year, the way in which power is structured between men and women was
   questioned in diverse spaces of Chilean society. This third wave of
   feminist protest, instigated primarily by female university students in
   2018, possibly constitutes the largest wave of feminism in Chilean
   history. These events forced political actors in both the legislative
   and executive branches to improve the participation and representation
   of group that are historically marginalized according to gender. We
   conclude that an analysis of the origins and consequences of the ``year
   of feminism{''} could enrich current debates on the quality of democracy
   in Chile.},

Abstract = {What explains the success of the upstart People's Party in the 2016
   Korean National Assembly election? Through preelection survey data, this
   article first identifies the demographic factors corresponding with
   support for the People's Party and how this differs from preexisting
   parties. Next, it elaborates on how the two-vote electoral system may
   have benefitted the People's Party by encouraging voters to cast a party
   list vote for the party while casting a district vote for one of the
   larger parties, consistent with strategic voting. Further analysis shows
   that People's Party supporters that intended to vote for their party's
   district candidate, and thus cast a sincere rather than strategic
   district vote, were less likely than other partisans to split their
   votes across two parties.},

Abstract = {This article is an introduction to the thematic dossier on the political
   implementation of ideas, i.e., the processes by which they are produced,
   circulated, and/or appropriated in a partisan environment. Beyond the
   presentation of the various contributions, it aims to show what the
   social history of political ideas can contribute to the understanding of
   the place, value, and uses of ideas within or at the margins of
   political parties in the contemporary period. Focusing on the study of
   minor intellectual literatures, it takes political ideas seriously by
   showing that they are also practices that should be analyzed according
   to a specific methodology. Seeking to analyze both the social properties
   of actors and the inherent logic of social spaces, in addition to taking
   into account historicity, this article consists of an undertaking to
   contextualize political ideas that breaks with the thoughtless
   continuities at the heart of the history of classical ideas such as the
   author, the work, the influence, or the tradition. Finally, in order to
   understand the uses made of it by various actors, it contributes to
   opening the black box of the production and appropriation of partisan
   ideas.},

Title = {POLITICAL AND LEGAL ASPECTS OF THEORY OF GIFT},
Journal = {POLITEIA-JOURNAL OF POLITICAL THEORY POLITICAL PHILOSOPHY AND SOCIOLOGY
   OF POLITICS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {94},
Number = {3},
Pages = {55-86},
Abstract = {The theory of gift, used today mainly in Anthropology, has a
   considerable heuristic potential for other humanities. The article
   represents an attempt to apply this theory to politics and law.
   In the political sphere, the theory of gift opens up a possibility of
   novel approaches to understanding the nature of political conflicts,
   especially in the societies that undergo a crisis, transition etc. The
   author does not intend to cover all such approaches and focuses only on
   some of them. In particular, the author draws attention to the enormous
   energy hidden in those structures, relations, and political instincts
   that remained from the system of gifts. He proposes a hypothesis that
   the political cataclysms of the last century can be explained (along
   with other reasons) by the attempts to restore relations of gift that
   grew out of the active participation of broad masses in politics, which
   led to the reduction of state and law into the direct connection between
   the masses and the leader.
   The author explains the disintegration of the system of gifts by the
   advent of money, which he views as one of the most large-scale factors
   of social transformation. Money called into existence a contract of
   purchase and sale as a negotiation about a price, which laid foundation
   for the whole system of modem law. Because a binding decision on price
   is possible only under the condition of free will of parties to a
   contract, the author considers that buying and selling became a source
   of free will that went beyond the law.
   In the final part of the article, the author turns to the legal
   implications of the theory of gift. First, he acknowledges the inability
   of Legal Science to provide a convincing answer to both the question of
   the nature of money and genesis of law. After that he shows that the
   theory of gift allows for a deeper understanding of the basic legal
   concepts, which in turn can be useful for solving many legal issues that
   cannot be resolved within the framework of the established doctrines.},

Title = {Food Democracy as `Radical' Food Sovereignty: Agrarian Democracy and
   Counter-Hegemonic Resistance to the Neo-Imperial Food Regime},
Journal = {POLITICS AND GOVERNANCE},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {7},
Number = {4},
Pages = {202-213},
Abstract = {This article argues that a thoroughgoing and meaningful food democracy
   should entail something closely akin to `radical' food sovereignty, a
   political programme which confronts the key social relational bases of
   capitalism. The latter comprise, in essence, `primitive accumulation,'
   the alienability or commodification of land and other fundamental use
   values, and market dependence. A thoroughgoing food democracy of this
   kind thus challenges the structural separation of the `economic' and
   `political' spheres within capitalism and the modern state (the
   state-capital nexus), a separation which enables purely political rights
   and obligations ('political' freedom or formal democracy) whilst
   simultaneously leaving unconstrained the economic powers of capital and
   their operation through market dependence ('economic' unfreedom or the
   lack of substantive democracy). We argue that much `food democracy'
   discourse remains confined to this level of `political' freedom and
   that, if food sovereignty is to be realized, this movement needs to
   address `economic' unfreedom, in other words, to subvert capitalist
   social-property relations. We argue further that the political economy
   of food constitutes but a subset of these wider social relations, such
   that substantive food democracy is seen here to entail, like `radical'
   food sovereignty, an abrogation of the three pillars upholding
   capitalism (primitive accumulation, absolute property rights, market
   dependence) as an intrinsic part of a wider and more integrated movement
   towards livelihood sovereignty. We argue here that the abrogation of
   these conditions upholding the state-capital nexus constitutes an
   essential part of the transformation of capitalist social-property
   relations towards common `ownership'-or, better, stewardship-of the
   means of livelihood, of which substantive food democracy is a key
   component.},

Abstract = {The peace building processes in the armed conflict scenarios, such as
   Samaniego, Narifio, show the diverse scope and multiple dimensions which
   can be considered to analyze citizenship. Keeping into account the
   acquired political capabilities by the local players during the peace
   construction between 2009 and 2014, one can analyze the capacity and
   democratic legitimacy to make of the peace process construction a
   relevant factor to analyze citizenship. The study can be used as a
   research method, the semi-structured interviews, the observations in
   situ and the documental analysis as tools to gather information; a
   methodology able to understand the context of different expressions of
   civil resistance is developed, and how they contribute in citizenship
   transformation.},

Abstract = {In 2015 and 2016, France was hit by some severe terror attacks.
   Following these attacks, the country experienced increased xenophobia in
   the form of anti-Muslim actions (anti-social peer punishment), and the
   French government reacted by declaring a state of emergency and
   intensifying policing activities such as house searches and police
   stops. Here, I analyze these reactions and show that intensified
   policing, even though well intended, can be associated with considerable
   anti-social effects. Furthermore, I will show that the state of
   emergency was associated with some dynamics that are worrisome for a
   democracy. Lastly, I will situate the findings in the conceptual
   distinction between institutional and peer punishment of behavioral

Volume = {24},

Pages = {275-294},
Abstract = {The article examines the coherence of conservative political theory by
   seeking out its principle and its form. It argues that conservative
   theory differs from liberal theory by the principle of differentiating
   between the activities of theorizing and doing. Two thought-figurations,
   called here `sympathetic' and `unsympathetic' dissent are outlined with
   respect to the perspective conservative theory holds vis-a-vis the
   liberal order. The article argues that only sympathetic dissent is
   coherent with the principle of conservative theory. The argument is
   illustrated by way of the thought of Michael Oakeshott. The form of
   sympathetic dissent is constituted by a double-movement of thought: a
   dissenting move, away from the historical context which deconstructs and
   critiques the existing political order, and a sympathetic, constructive
   move, which recovers the coherence of that very order.},

Title = {POLITICAL CONTEXT OF NARRATION WITH KARL MARX'S WERT-TERMINOLOGY: COST
   VS VALUE},
Journal = {POLIS-POLITICHESKIYE ISSLEDOVANIYA},
Year = {2019},
Number = {3},
Pages = {174-185},
Abstract = {The paper discusses the semantic models that determine the practice of
   the Russian translation of the key terminology of Karl Marx, as well as
   the ensuing consequences of choosing a simplifying interpretational
   strategy for such a translation and determining its political
   pragmatics. This strategy is a request for a scientific concept that
   rejects the prospect of capitalist development, as well as the goals of
   propaganda and political education. The terms der Wen (value), dos
   Wending (valuable thing), die Wengegenstandlichkeit (value objectivity)
   were translated as ``cost{''} in the canonical translation, enshrined in
   the publication of the Institute of Marxism-Leninism (1937). At the same
   time, two fundamentally different aspects of the product der
   Gehrauchswert (value as utility is a quality characteristic, not
   quantifiable) and der Tauschwert (exchange value, the ability to
   proportionally exchange) were translated, respectively, as use cost and
   exchange cost. This interpretation formed the basis of discursive
   practices in education, social sciences, journalism, and media. use
   ``value{''} translation versions were actually removed from scientific
   use. however, the ``cost paradigm{''} significantly reduces the analysis
   of market relations and contexts. This is confirmed by the appeal to the
   original texts of the first and second editions of ``Capital{''}.
   Discussions regarding the transfer of K. Marx's terminology in
   ``Capital{''} are not only instructive, but have important perspectives.
   Nowadays, the question has grown beyond the scope of a word dispute. The
   failure of value-to-value reduction is manifested in the problems of
   neoliberalistic marginalism, the coming to the fore social and cultural
   (neoinstitutionalism, ``culture matters{''}), psychological and
   communicative (R. Taler) factors of economic relations. At the same
   time, the value nature of market relations is important both in concepts
   like ``global value chains{''} (M. Porter, G. Jencify) and in the
   practices of tmnsfonnative investment (Impact Investing), including on
   the blockchain platform. `Ibis forces to return to the conceptual
   content of the original terms and rethinking practices appropriate
   narration.},

Abstract = {In Poland, since the collapse of the People's Republic, a
   ``right-wing{''} literature scene has developed. As was the case during
   the inter-war years, the phenomenon has many different facets. This
   literature reflects a political and ideological polarisation in society.
   The attitude of todays' ``right-wing{''} authors is marked by
   traditionalism, patriotism, Catholicism, anti-communism, catastrophism
   and a mistrust of liberalism, globalisation and the modern era.
   ``Right-wing{''} literature has emerged from its niche, is becoming more
   broadly received and is receiving positive reviews by literary critics.},

Abstract = {In today's Mexico, the resistance and mobilization of Indigenous people
   are diverse and no longer seem to constitute a single collective
   identity, as they did in recent decades, but rather a multiple and
   fragmented whole. As this article tries to show, there are four main
   causes behind this situation. The first is the diversity of conditions
   in which, for historical reasons, Indigenous people live. The second is
   the accumulation of grievances and challenges, both new and variegated,
   that the aggressive recurrence of extractive capitalist ventures is
   creating in their territories. The third cause is the government's
   indifference and neglect toward their social, economic, educational and
   political demands. And the fourth is the variety of initiatives that
   Indigenous peoples themselves introduce in their struggles to break and
   transcend, with much creativity, the status quo that oppresses and
   marginalizes all of them.},

Abstract = {Memoirs of politicians and diplomats present very interesting, but
   rather default field of the research of international relations. In the
   following paper the author examines with using of method of analysis and
   comparison the possible concepts of the activities of the selected
   Czechoslovak diplomats serving to the totalitarian state as a satellite
   of the Soviet bloc during the Cold War. The authors of the memoirs of
   the Czechoslovak Communist diplomats were divided by author into two
   groups with following results of research: The first group includes the
   politicians and diplomats who were active during the Prague Spring. At
   the same time, also those who approached (and actively endeavoured to)
   the Czechoslovak foreign policy and diplomacy as an ally of the Soviet
   Union but not as its satellite and that is complied with the needs and
   interests of the Czechoslovak state). To the second group belong the
   diplomats from the period after the suppression of the Prague Spring,
   i.e. from the period of normalisation. Unlikely to the first group,
   these diplomats strived for an absolute subordination to the foreign
   policy of the Soviet Union as the crucial guarantor of the Czechoslovak
   interests.},

Journal = {AFRICAN SECURITY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {12},
Number = {1},
Pages = {87-110},
Abstract = {Regional and subregional organizations have assumed a larger role in
   maintaining peace and security, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa. The
   African Peace and Security Architecture of the African Union (APSA)
   increasingly participates militarily in various peacekeeping operations.
   Policy-focused analyses of the APSA not only characterize it as an
   international regime but also assume the benefits of this regime.
   However, this depiction of the APSA as a regime obscures the military
   dimension of its approach to peace and security throughout the
   continent. This article argues that a regime analysis romanticizes the
   APSA, and the type of security that it practices requires more
   attention. Using a field-inspired approach, this article suggests that
   the security practiced by the APSA is a result of various internal
   struggles within different institutions of the APSA and its external
   relations over the meaning-making of peace and security.},

Abstract = {The article interrogates sustainable development as the dominant
   presumably alternative paradigm of development and functioning of
   societies that declaratively transcends the ecological and societal
   limits of the older models. It argues that the dominant understanding of
   sustainable development that promotes limited incremental changes to the
   capitalist development model can best be understood as the result of its
   gradual systematic co-optation and integration into the dominant
   neoliberal governmentality at the global and local levels. By analysing
   the gradual neoliberalization of sustainable development in the global
   and the Slovenian context it argues that these contexts are
   interdependent concerning the consolidation and resilience of the
   neoliberal vision of sustainable development in the face of multiple and
   multidimensional economic and environmental crises. By specifically
   focusing on the case of Slovenia it demonstrates and reflects on the
   crucial role of actors that formally and informally represent the public
   interest such as the state and the organized civil society in
   re-legitimizing and upholding the neoliberal vision(s) of sustainable
   development in the context of crises.},

Abstract = {As the world turns against international institutions, this article
   reviews evidence of the corrupting of global organizations. The review
   focuses on three international organizations that emerged from World War
   II: the Bretton Woods institutions {[}the International Monetary Fund
   (IMF) and the World Bank] and the United Nations (UN). The article
   explores evidence of major shareholders (mainly the United States) using
   the Bretton Woods institutions to funnel money and other favors to
   strategically preferred countries. Then the review discusses vote buying
   across a range of issues debated at the UN and finally turns to dark
   scholarship on the use of UN human rights institutions by autocratic
   states as a veil to violate those very rights. The article concludes
   that government pursuit of strategic objectives may be a necessary part
   of global cooperation, but scholarship should continue to delve into the
   micro foundations underlying the macro evidence presented here to better
   inform reformers on how to limit corrupting influences.},

Abstract = {Recently, governments, commercial firms, and individuals have increased
   their use of unmanned aerial vehicles (i.e., ``drones{''}). As with many
   new technologies, drone use has outpaced government oversight. Attempts
   to regulate the technology have been met with intense public backlash.
   Therefore, governments need to understand the public's preferences for a
   regulatory regime. Analyzing national survey data, we address two
   questions: (a) What policies do Americans prefer for the regulation of
   drones? and (b) Does the public believe the federal, state, or local
   government or nongovernmental actors should be responsible for
   regulating drone use? Public preferences are one of several important
   inputs affecting policymaking; therefore, our results provide an
   important overview of current public opinion toward drone policy, as
   well as a theoretical blueprint for understanding how such opinions
   might fluctuate overtime.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF GENOCIDE RESEARCH},

Pages = {178-200},
Abstract = {When and why do states launch campaigns of genocide against minorities?
   In 2017, in a violent campaign increasingly described as genocide, the
   Myanmar military drove almost 700,000 Rohingya from Rakhine State into
   Bangladesh killing an estimated 6,700 in the first month and an unknown
   number overall. This assault is particularly puzzling given the
   international goodwill and economic benefits the regime was accruing
   since it opened its political system after decades of isolation.
   Scholars have identified a number of causes of genocide yet this
   literature requires development in two areas. First, few studies compare
   cases of genocide with situations of lower level political violence,
   meaning it is difficult to distinguish between societies that are simply
   violent from those which are genocidal. Second, despite the central role
   played by militaries in genocide, most studies have treated the
   institution as simply a tool of nationalists and other genocidal leaders
   rather than as actors with their own incentives and fears. In this
   study, I develop an explanation of genocide that places militaries at
   its centre. I contend that armed forces sometimes choose genocide during
   periods of rapid political change when they perceive a serious threat to
   their political and economic interests or self-appointed status as
   ``guardian of the nation.{''} My study begins with a comparison between
   Rakhine State, Myanmar and a similarly volatile region that has avoided
   genocide, Assam in Northeast India. In a later stage of theory testing I
   examine another case of genocide, Indonesia in 1965/66.},

Abstract = {The Ukrainian voluntary battalions were created in a historic emergency.
   During the first phase of the war, these units acted in a highly
   autonomous way and pursued the same interests as the representatives of
   the state. However, the Minsk II Agreement fundamentally changed the
   relationship between the state and the voluntary units. The movement
   became fragmented. The volunteers find themselves confronted with
   considerable social and societal problems in their attempt to
   reintegrate into civilian society. The extent of their political
   capacity to act is also limited.},

   the role of multiculturalism?},
Journal = {CITIZENSHIP STUDIES},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {24},
Number = {2},
Pages = {228-246},
Month = {FEB 17},
Abstract = {Against the backdrop of a restrictive backlash in Europe, this article
   examines Portugal and Spain's policies on immigrants' acquisition of
   their national citizenships and assesses their potential convergence
   towards a common model. Drawing on a qualitative comparative analysis,
   this investigation also seeks to understand the evolution of the two
   Iberian countries' approaches by exploring the dominant theories on the
   variation of citizenship regimes. A significant degree of policy
   convergence over an assimilationist model was identified between the
   early 1990s and the mid-2000s. Thereafter, Portugal shifted towards a
   multicultural model, whilst policy stability was observed in Spain.
   Policy variation between the two countries was mostly associated with
   the role of political ideas, in particular the centre-left parties'
   commitment to multiculturalism. Furthermore, this investigation
   highlights the divergence of Portugal's approach from the wider
   restrictive backlash supposedly observed in Europe, whilst Spain
   continues to uphold an assimilation model in the twentieth-first
   century.},

Abstract = {Mill scholars usually classify as `proportional' the theory of political
   representation sustained by John Stuart Mill. However, Mill did not use
   the term `proportional' in his texts, and `proportional representation'
   as understood today has little to do with what Mill really proposed. A
   hypothesis is offered to explain the origin of the `proportionalist'
   interpretation that was accepted at the beginning of the 20st century.
   It is concluded that specialists in Mill should not use the word
   `proportional' when referring to his conception of political
   representation. In addition, political scientists should not quote Mill
   as the founder of proportional representation.},

Title = {Emotions and Affective Polarization: How Enthusiasm and Anxiety About

Volume = {48},

Abstract = {In the context of an increasingly divided populace, this article
   considered how the emotions (enthusiasm and anxiety) partisans feel
   toward U.S. presidential candidates may heighten or diminish affective
   polarization. In Study 1 (American National Election Studies {[}ANES]
   2008-2009 panel data), we found that enthusiasm for the in-group
   candidate and anxiety about the out-group candidate were related to
   higher levels of affective polarization, whereas enthusiasm for the
   out-group candidate was related to lower levels of affective
   polarization. In Study 2 (2016 panel data), we found that in-group
   enthusiasm was related to higher levels of affective polarization and
   out-group enthusiasm was related to lower levels of affective
   polarization, but neither in-group nor out-group anxiety was
   significantly related to affective polarization. These findings
   highlight that enthusiasm about out-group candidates may have a unique
   ability to disrupt affective polarization and that it is important to
   consider the source of an emotion response, not just the type of
   emotion.},

Abstract = {This article studies the impact of economic news on government support
   and the mediating role of people's national (sociotropic) and personal
   (egotropic) economic evaluations. Employing two complementary studies, a
   large literature is contributed to by adding a media perspective to the
   economic voting hypothesis. The first study was fielded in 2015 and
   combines an extensive content analysis of economic news (print,
   television, online; N = 5,630) with a three-wave panel survey (N =
   3,240). As a follow-up, an experiment was conducted in 2018 exposing
   participants (N = 1,452) to negative and positive economic news. Both
   studies confirm that the tone of news directly affects national economic
   evaluations but not personal ones. Whereas both types of evaluation
   predict government support, the effect of national evaluations is
   significantly stronger. Most importantly, it is shown that the effect of
   national evaluations on government support is actually a mediation of
   the effect of economic news.},

Abstract = {Six years of continuously baiting his opponents within the history
   profession eventually amounted to little where it mattered most. UK
   Secretary of State for Education, Michael Gove, finally backtracked in
   2013 on his plans to impose a curriculum for English schools based on a
   linear chronology of the achievements of British national heroes. His
   `history as celebration' curriculum was designed to instil pride amongst
   students in a supposedly shared national past, but would merely have
   accentuated how many students in modern multicultural Britain fail to
   recognise themselves in what is taught in school history lessons. Now
   that the dust has settled on Gove's tenure as Secretary of State, the
   time is right for retrospective analysis of how his plans for the
   history curriculum made it quite so far. How did he construct an
   `ideological' conception of expertise which allowed him to go toe-to-toe
   for so long with the `professional' expertise of academic historians and
   history teachers? What does the content of this ideological expertise
   tell us about the politics of race within Conservative Party curriculum
   reforms? This article answers these questions to characterise Gove as a
   `whig historian' of a wilfully extreme nature in his attachment to
   imperial heroes as the best way to teach national history in modern
   multicultural Britain.},

Abstract = {Nearly two-thirds of persons who receive an unsolicited ballot in the
   mail before Election Day choose to return their ballot in person, rather
   than through the less costly and more convenient U.S. Postal Service.
   Why? How and when voters choose to return their mail ballot is
   consequential to the administration of elections and the confidence
   voters have in the outcome of elections. We offer and test four
   explanations for how vote by mail voters choose to return their ballot,
   including the social rewards of voting, the costs of voting, trust in
   U.S. Postal Service and a preference to cast a ballot after campaigning
   ends. We find supporting evidence for each explanation conditioned by
   prior history of voting.},

Abstract = {Does the @realDonaldTrump really matter to financial markets? Research
   shows that new information about the likely future policy direction of
   government affects financial markets. In contrast, we argue that new
   information can also arise about the likely future government's resolve
   in following through with its policy goals, affecting financial markets
   as well. We test our argument using data on U.S. President Donald J.
   Trump's Mexico-related policy tweets and the U.S. dollar/Mexican peso
   exchange rate. We find that Trump's Mexico-related tweets raised Mexican
   peso volatility while his policy views were unknown as well as
   thereafter, as they signaled his resolve in carrying out his
   Mexico-related agenda. By helping politicians disseminate policy
   information to voters, and since voters hold governments accountable for
   their policy performance, social media allows investors to gather
   information about the likely policy direction and policy resolve of
   government, especially those of newcomers whose direction and resolve
   are unknown.},

Journal = {FORUM-A JOURNAL OF APPLIED RESEARCH IN CONTEMPORARY POLITICS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {17},
Number = {4},
Pages = {631-645},

Abstract = {While a number of studies in recent years explore the particularistic
   tendencies of presidents - targeting various benefits to districts and
   states that will help their and their party's electoral prospects -
   little work has explored how members of Congress react to such behavior.
   We take some initial steps in this regard by examining how members have
   responded to President Donald Trump's trade initiatives. We analyze
   congressional newsletter mentions of tariffs or trade as a means of
   exploring congressional reaction. We find a positive relationship
   between tariff/trade mentions and partisanship, as Republican members
   and members from states that Trump won in 2016 are more likely to refer
   to tariffs/trade in their newsletters. This represents, we argue, a
   different kind of credit claiming. These basic empirical patterns set
   the stage for more systematic analysis in the future.},

   the solution by supporting reform initiatives and smaller group
   negotiations. They have far more control over their own regional
   economic integration agenda and, recognizing that the medium-term future
   of their bilateral relations with external trading powers is reciprocal,
   they need to double-down on building meaningful market access

   centralization in all fields followed by a mild centralization spurt
   during the 1930s and substantial acceleration during the 1960s and
   1970s. Little fiscal centralization is found, except for increased
   conditions attached to federal aid. The principal instruments of
   centralization have been Congress and the Supreme Court; the principal
   political agents have been political parties and interest groups
   responding to opportunities created by exogenous forces such as market
   integration and technological change.},

Abstract = {Using data from nearly 5,000 votes cast by more than 400 judges in
   courts of last resort from all 50 states, we investigate whether there
   is a relationship between a state's judicial retention method and the
   likelihood that a judge votes to join a precedent-overturning majority.
   We find that relative to judges retained by institutions such as
   judicial commissions or state legislatures, those retained via either
   partisan or retention elections are significantly more likely to join
   majorities that overturn precedent. Most of this effect is due to
   behavior in high-profile cases that garner media attention. We find
   little evidence that an impending election moderates these effects.
   Finally, we find no evidence that judges retained via nonpartisan
   elections treat precedent differently than their institutionally
   retained colleagues.},

Abstract = {Charles U. Zug, following Jeffrey Tulis's The Rhetorical Presidency
   (1987), argues that the original design of the Constitution constrained
   presidents from cultivating a relationship with the American public. In
   reality, though, presidents are opportunistic politicians who always
   look for new ways to reach the public in order to gain political
   advantage and nurture their relationship with the people. In this effort
   they have often made use of new communication technologies, such that
   what may look like radical twentieth-century departures from previous
   understandings of the constitutional place of the president are actually
   continuous with attempts by presidents from Washington forward to engage
   in what was-in line with contemporaneous understandings of political
   issues-persuasive communication designed to influence public policy.},

Abstract = {In The Communist Manifesto (1848), Marx and Engels ``openly declare that
   their ends can be attained only by the forcible overthrow of all
   existing social conditions.{''} However, by 1872, Marx suggested that in
   some countries it was possible for workers to ``achieve their aims by
   peaceful means.{''} Since that time, Marxist political theorists have
   debated whether a transition to socialism can be achieved by
   parliamentary means alone or whether the transition to socialism
   requires the use of illegal or even violent tactics. This paper argues
   that with the resurgence of a socialist movement in the US, the question
   of tactics is once again an open debate. For this reason, it is useful
   to revisit the tactical debates of the Second International, because
   they are directly relevant to contemporary discussions of socialist
   strategy and tactics in the US, where tactical positions already run the
   gamut from parliamentarism to armed self-defense.},

Abstract = {Solar radiation management (SRM) - a form of geoengineering - creates a
   risk of `termination shock'. If SRM was to be stopped abruptly then
   temperatures could rise very rapidly with catastrophic impacts. Two
   prominent geoengineering researchers have recently argued that the risk
   of termination shock could be minimised through the adoption of
   `relatively simple' policies. This paper shows their arguments to be
   premised on heroically optimistic assumptions about the prospects for
   global cooperation and sustained trust in an SRM deployment scenario.
   The paper argues that worst-case scenarios are the right place to start
   in thinking about the governance of SRM.},

Title = {Analyzing ethnographic interviews: Three studies on terrorism and

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {42},
Number = {2},
Pages = {149-163},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {This article describes three analyses of ethnographic interviews
   conducted with violent and nonviolent political activists. The findings
   show that the deliberations of violent and nonviolent activists focus on
   state violence and rational choice calculations (Studies I and II),
   while nonviolent activists moreover consider perceptions of themselves
   and state actors, among other factors (Study II). In a highly repressive
   setting, nonviolent activists choose individual over collective
   resistance (Study III). By revealing how violent and nonviolent
   activists reason about their behaviour, the findings complement
   statistical analyses of datasets on external factors, such as economic
   conditions, political institutions, social networks or political events.
   Such datasets are typically readily available or can be constructed from
   publicly available data, while interview transcripts are more
   time-consuming to assemble. Furthermore, replicable quantitative methods
   are not straightforwardly applied to qualitative interviews. This
   article instead applies Spradley's ethnographic analysis (Study I) and
   Corbin and Strauss's grounded theory (Studies II and III) to examine
   interview transcripts. In addition to the substantive findings, the
   analyses make a methodological contribution to qualitative studies of
   interviews by systematically identifying each factor addressed by an
   interview transcript.},

Abstract = {Participatory governance practices are enjoying popularity, not least in
   local government. This is driven by legislation that requires councils
   to undertake some of these processes; also by communities and
   practitioners - parties that derive income from participatory
   governance. An industry is emerging: one characterised by demand and
   supply, with frameworks, strategies and processes, training and
   conferences. This industry warrants investigation so that its impacts
   upon local democracy can be understood. Following a theorisation of
   local democracy and community engagement, the paper describes the
   community engagement industry, presenting evidence about council
   activities, providers and professional associations to establish that
   the commercialisation of engagement is a significant phenomenon in
   Australian local government. Possible risks to local governance and
   local democracy are explored.},

Abstract = {The article explores the energy security relations of the European Union
   with the Russian Federation through the prism of the political
   discourse. It identifies key formations and topics related to the
   concept of security. Drawing on a detailed discourse analysis of 339
   statements, interviews, speeches, press releases, and documents produced
   by EU political leaders and institutions, the article focuses on (a) the
   basic themes of EU political discourse on the energy security relations
   with Russia and (b) the perception of Russia by the European Union. The
   majority of the documents used in the article come from 2010 to 2019,
   the period of the second Barroso Commission and the Juncker Commission.
   At the theoretical level, the article is focused on the relationship
   between the main concept, political discourse, and security.},

Abstract = {Set-theoretic multimethod research (SMMR) using Qualitative Comparative
   Analysis (QCA) formalizes the choice of cases based on a truth table
   analysis. We make three recommendations for improving SMMR. First,
   current standards can lead to faulty case selection if causal inference
   on a conjunction is the goal. Case selection needs to take into account
   that the non-members of a conjunction might be empirically diverse and
   that only selected types of non-members are ideal for causal inference.
   Second, we formally show that cases with similar fuzzy-set memberships
   in a term and the outcome are the superior choice for process tracing.
   They minimize the expected membership in the mechanism and make it most
   difficult to pass a hypothesis test. Third, we propose formulas that
   comply with all SMMR principles and identify the best pairs of cases for
   analysis. We illustrate our arguments with a study of the effectiveness
   of sanctions against authoritarian regimes.},

Abstract = {Terrorist attacks negatively affect support for immigration policy, and
   this has been linked to the extensive media coverage of terrorism. Yet,
   this coverage may also have a moderating effect. This article uses the
   timing of the fielding of the European Social Survey, which took place
   during the Charlie Hebdo and Hyper Cacher attacks, as a natural
   experiment. Because the media coverage of the attacks varied between
   France and other European countries, it is possible to study how
   differences in the media framing and priming of the attacks affected
   attitudes. The expected negative effect on immigration policy
   preferences is found outside France, but not within France. This study's
   findings lend support to a moderating effect of the media coverage of
   terrorist attacks, both as a framing effect that influenced the
   perceived relevance of the attacks to immigration attitudes and a
   priming effect that primed the public with tolerant French Republican
   values.},

   proportional representation (2004), and back to a mixed system (2011).
   Two additional reform attempts (1993 and 2001) resulted in minor changes
   to the electoral law. What explains the timing and direction of
   electoral reforms in Ukraine? Extant research fails to provide
   satisfactory answers. I argue that the shifting expectations of
   electoral change by the key actors explain the observed outcomes.
   Negative expectations led to adoption or preservation of permissive
   electoral systems, while positive expectations resulted in adoption or
   preservation of restrictive systems. Within-case analysis of five
   episodes of electoral reform supports this argument.},

Abstract = {The immigrant admission policies of states often demonstrate a strong
   preference for ?highly skilled? migrants, while making it more difficult
   for ?low-skilled? migrants to enter. Although those policies only
   exclude low-skilled workers on paper, empirical evidence has shown that
   they may also have a disproportionate impact on the admission of female
   would-be migrants. In other words, it indirectly discriminates against
   them. In this paper, I argue that such indirect discrimination is
   wrongful because it worsens existing disrespect towards women, and
   should therefore be recognised as problematic by those who already
   acknowledge the wrongfulness of direct gender-based discrimination in
   immigration policy. It worsens disrespect because immigration policy
   makers have negligently failed to consider the social meaning of women?s
   difficulty in being admitted under the ?skilled? category, which worsens
   demeaning stereotypes about female workers in patriarchal societies. As
   a result, it gives us a pro tanto reason to object to states? employment
   of talent-based immigration selection.},

Abstract = {In light of the growing public spending in many regions of the world,
   this study scrutinizes relevant determinants of core public
   administration expenditure at the cantonal level in Switzerland,
   focusing particularly on New Public Management (NPM) reforms. The
   empirical study comprises all 26 cantons in the period from 1993 through
   2014 and uses both cross-sectional and longitudinal analytical methods.
   In addition to NPM, we control for various variables related to
   political parties, institutions, socioeconomics and culture. The results
   show no clear relationship between NPM reforms and expenditure, although
   such reforms were often intended to cut costs. Our explanation for this
   finding is that NPM as a concept is rather inconsistent. Various control
   variables are either positively or negatively related with expenditure.
   All in all, our findings suggest that public expenditure is still mostly
   determined by politics and can only be influenced by administrative
   reforms within certain narrow limits.},

Abstract = {In October 2018, a coalition of UK trade unions and civil society
   organisations called a strike across the UK's fast food sector in
   support of a living wage, union recognition and the end to zero-hour
   contracts in the sector. This paper takes the day of action-labelled the
   McStrike-as a starting point for an account of the place of the EU and
   Brexit in the campaign for fast food rights, as well as the contrasting
   political standpoints adopted by the different trade unions involved in
   the action. Brexit is used as a prism through which to analyse aspects
   of Britain's contemporary food politics, especially those pertaining to
   freedom of movement, workplace organisation, and the role of EU
   legislation in protecting workers' rights. In exploring the
   international dimensions of union organisation among the UK's fast food
   workers, other, more conceptual considerations regarding the changing
   nature of public and private food consumption and the incorporation of
   food-to-go into the gig economy are also broached.},

Journal = {POLITICAL STUDIES REVIEW},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {17},
Number = {4},
Pages = {370-390},

Abstract = {The global diffusion of administrative institutions such as the
   Ombudsperson office provides clues into wider questions of democratic
   development. Explanations of institutional diffusion tend to assume,
   however, that the essential character of the institution remains
   relatively stable. While the office of the Ombudsperson has become a
   potent symbol of administrative fairness and independence in defense of
   the individual against the powerful public agency or corporation, we
   show that the essential identity of this office has changed over time.
   As the number of agencies calling themselves ombudsmen has proliferated,
   the number of functions performed have diversified, shaping public
   perceptions and expectations. The article describes this pattern of
   institutional diversification into a widespread network of classical,
   executive, organizational, and advocacy ombudspersons. The institutional
   proliferation has led to processes of institutional standardization, and
   an increasing motivation to defend the ombudsman ``brand{''} to justify
   its status and distinguish its place within different political and
   administrative systems.},

Abstract = {The presidential re-election in Colombia was a threat to the democratic
   institutions in Colombia. Alvaro Uribe and Juan Manuel Santos, supported
   by large coalitions in Congress, made use of the figure of
   candidate-president to govern during a second term. An evaluation of the
   formation of the Legislative branch in Colombia between 2002 and 2014
   shows a striking result: the seats of the parties declared in opposition
   increased when the presidential re-election was applied and tended to
   decrease when the presidential election had new candidates. The
   categories of parliamentary presence, opposition continuity, ideological
   stance and the concept of path dependent, coming from the historical
   institutionalism, serve as analytical points of view for the
   understanding of the opposing dynamics in the Colombian democracy, full
   of challenges in the post-conflict context.},

Abstract = {This paper studies the relationship between incumbent MPs' activities
   and their electoral fortune. We address this question in the context of
   the French political system characterized by an executive domination, a
   candidate-centered electoral system, and an electoral schedule
   maximizing the impact of the presidential elections. Given the
   contradictory influence of these three institutional features on the
   relationship between MPs' activities and electoral results, the overall
   link can only be assessed empirically. We test the effects of several
   measurements of MPs' activities on both their vote share and reelection
   probability in the 2007 legislative election. We show that MPs'

Abstract = {Despite the global growth in the use of Voter Advice Applications
   (VAAs), which advise users on how similar their own policy views are to
   the policy positions of the political parties, there have been few field
   experiments that isolate the causal effects of VAA use on party support.
   Nor has there been much investigation of how VAAs may help to ameliorate
   ethnically based voting divisions by refocusing voter attention on other
   issues. This article draws on evidence from a field experiment in the
   deeply divided context of Northern Ireland. We find that at the
   individual level party preferences are somewhat more closely related to
   voter ideology after the provision of advice. Yet, at the aggregate
   level, we find no evidence that advice leads to weaker ethno-national
   structuring of party support. These results suggest that while receiving
   advice from VAAs has some impact on users' party preferences, there is
   no observable overall impact on support levels for the ethno-national
   blocs in Northern Ireland.},

Abstract = {The trend of increasing major party polarization in the United States
   has raised concerns about the quality of representation and governance.
   One potential corrective is third parties, as they can hold the major
   parties accountable and instigate positive change. We, however,
   highlight limits to their influence. Two factors dampened the electoral
   support for third party candidates in the 2016 U.S. presidential
   election despite favorable conditions. First, the cost of third party
   voting is higher in the current polarized era, since casting a vote for
   a third party can lead to their less-favored major party candidate
   winning. Voters today have especially negative feelings toward their
   less-favored major party. Second, Trump co-opted voters distrustful of
   the government, which is a group that tends to support third parties.
   Our analysis of American National Election Studies (ANES) data from 1992
   and 2016 shows support for both factors.},

   electoral behaviour of Western citizens. Some go as far as to declare a
   new cleavage between winners and losers of globalisation, driven, for
   example, by individuals' exposure to international competition and their
   degree of national as opposed to cosmopolitan identification. Extant
   tests of this argument have, however, relied on class and education as
   proxies for these processes. In contrast, this study provides a direct
   test of the influence of the globalisation processes on attitudes to
   economic distribution, the European Union and immigration as well as on
   vote choice across nine West European countries. The results show that
   variables tapping the core aspects of globalisation have relatively
   little impact on attitudes and vote choice; are largely unable to
   account for the effects of class and education; and do not seem to lead
   to the establishment of new divisions between winners and losers within
   or across classes. Rather, the winners and losers of globalisation seem
   to be the traditional winners and losers with respect to material
   positions and political influence in modern Western societies - that is,
   those placed higher as opposed to lower in the class and education
   hierarchies. In this way, the proposed cleavage between winners and
   losers of globalisation may seem to be rather much like old wine in new
   bottles.},

Abstract = {There is substantial evidence that citizen assessments of political
   actors and associated institutions are shaped by shared partisanship.
   However, much of this evidence comes from citizen evaluations of
   political actors who are policy generalists-officials elected with broad
   policy jurisdictions (e.g., chief executives and legislators). We
   suggest that citizen assessments of policy specialists-officials elected
   with relatively narrow policy jurisdictions (e.g., labor commissioners
   and education secretaries)-may be shaped to a lesser degree by shared
   partisan leanings than evaluations of policy generalists. Using a survey
   experiment, we find evidence that, among out-partisans, favorable
   performance information has a greater positive effect for specialists
   than generalists, highlighting one way in which shared partisanship may
   be less influential for evaluations of specialists. These results may
   help to provide insight into the diversity of partisanship we see across
   policy generalists and specialists within the same governments and have
   potential implications for accountability.},

Abstract = {The current worldwide democratic regression has prompted debate about
   the drivers of democratic decline. One country experiencing decline is
   Indonesia, where most analysts blame the shift on actions of illiberal
   elites, casting the public as a democratic bulwark. Yet, as in other
   fragile democracies, regression in Indonesia has come at the hands of
   politicians enjoying popular support. To investigate drivers of
   democratic decline we ask: How democratic are Indonesian citizens when
   compared to the politicians they elect? We answer this question using an
   original, representative survey of provincial legislators, which we
   compare to a general survey of the Indonesian population. While both
   populations express overwhelming support for democratic government, we
   find significant differences between how elites and masses conceive of
   democracy, and in their commitment to liberal norms. Though neither
   group is a bulwark of liberal values, we find the legislators are
   systematically more liberal than voters. These findings challenge widely
   held assumptions about Indonesia's political class, and suggest a public
   that is either indifferent to, or supportive of, an increasingly
   illiberal democratic order. Our study demonstrates that comparing elite
   and mass attitudes to democracy and liberalism is one fruitful technique
   for investigating sources of democratic resilience and fragility.},

Abstract = {The Oresteia is conventionally read as an account of progress from the
   age of private vendetta to the public order of legal justice. According
   to G.W.F. Hegel, an influential proponent of this view, the
   establishment of a court in Athens was the first step in the progressive
   universalization of law. For feminists and Frankfurt School theorists,
   in contrast, the Oresteia offers an account of the origins of patriarchy
   and class domination by legal means. This article examines the two
   competing interpretations of Aeschylus's trilogy, arguing that they are
   not mutually exclusive. Rather than rejecting Hegel's progressive thesis
   altogether, the critical theorists discussed here focus on the underside
   of progress. They make two claims that are explicated and defended in
   this article: first, that law follows a dialectical progression wherein
   measures to advance justice simultaneously intensify domination; second,
   that the dialectic of progress arises from the legal form itself-its
   presumed universality.},

Abstract = {Language policies are important sociopolitical features of multilingual
   countries. Not only do they regulate relations with governmental
   authorities, but they can also impact intergroup relations. Yet,
   empirical research has tended to ignore language policies. Very little
   is known in relation to the factors that lead individuals to support or
   oppose such policies. Furthermore, to the best of our knowledge, there
   is relatively little knowledge regarding the influence of attitudes
   towards language policies on subsequent political phenomena. The present
   article seeks to address these gaps by exploring bilingualism in Canada
   and Finland. Specifically, using survey data from both countries'
   national election studies, the article, firstly, examines factors that
   can account for support towards bilingualism and, secondly, it
   investigates the relationship of these attitudes with vote choice. The
   results reveal two main findings. Firstly, support for bilingualism
   seems to be associated with context-specific factors; a general pattern
   of determinants is not indicated by the results. Secondly, attitudes
   towards bilingualism are found to have a significant association on vote
   choice in both Canada and Finland.},

Abstract = {With the looming reality of Brexit drawing closer, it is the intention
   of this article to explore Theresa May's post-referendum communicative
   behaviour on Brexit-the very issue that came to define her premiership
   agenda-and uncover what legacy it has left behind. Building upon,
   extending and updating the emerging literature on May's discourse, the
   inquiry helps us understand how May acted through language in order to
   influence and change other people's attitudes towards and ways of
   looking at Brexit. The article argues that there are at least seven
   ways, closely interrelated and feeding into each other, in which her
   discursive construction of Brexit has left a somewhat bitter legacy,
   contributing to the Brexit political paralysis and inspiring substantial
   levels of confusion and exasperation, both within the UK and abroad.},

   nations involved in an international conflict? This study examines
   op-eds in the US, China and the Philippines, which discuss the
   Scarborough Shoal conflict. Data processing includes word-association
   calculations and positioning analysis. Results demonstrate self-vested
   national identities. China-based articles create national identities
   around the goal of preserving political clout in the Asia-Pacific. US
   op-eds invert China?s goal and generate identities asserting US regional
   power. Philippine commentaries portray China as a bully and the US as a
   defender. Results are discussed in light of the link between politicized

Abstract = {As more data emerges on the Boko Haram phenomenon, the controversy over
   the roots of the insurgency persists. While some emphasise transnational
   motivational factors based on the Salafist ideology, others focus on
   diverse local structural factors, including the economy, religion, and
   politics. Although this article acknowledges the importance of these
   factors, it argues that these are ubiquitous contextual factors which
   insufficiently explain the location and timing of the insurgency. By
   introducing the Political Relevance Model, this article theorises the
   insurgency onset by focusing on the agency of the local political elites
   and their relationship with the sect. It finds that the insurgency is
   rooted in an initial mutually beneficial relationship between the local
   political elites and a politically relevant group that turned sour,
   resulting in the attempt by the elites to withdraw the group's earlier
   privileges using state coercion which the group frames as state
   repression requiring violent resistance. These agents have, in their
   interest, framed this struggle to resonate with the people.},

Abstract = {The cost of higher education to the taxpayer is determined in part by
   the choice of subject and institution made by students. The Augar report
   on higher education noted that there was an oversupply of `low value'
   courses and called on the government to `bear down on low value courses'
   and `target courses better aligned with the economy's needs'.(1) Until
   recently there was no reliable data to identify such courses or the
   institutions supplying them. The Institute for Fiscal Studies has
   utilised recently available longitudinal education data on earnings,
   courses and institutions to rectify this deficiency. Many of the lowest
   earning courses are in the creative arts. Not everyone is happy with
   using earnings to measure the value of courses. This paper discusses the
   IFS estimates of graduate earnings and the public cost of higher
   education, as well as the criticisms of using earnings data to measure
   the value of courses and institutions.},

Title = {Getting Rich Too Fast? Voters' Reactions to Politicians' Wealth
   Accumulation},

Abstract = {Asset declarations requiring politicians to disclose their financial
   information are becoming increasingly common across the world. The
   information contained in these disclosures frequently reveals that
   politicians rapidly accumulate wealth while in office, a fact that may
   raise suspicion among voters. However, little is known about the ways in
   which such information may affect voter behavior. To address this gap,
   we use original experimental and survey data from India to explore
   voters' reactions to information about wealth and wealth accumulation.
   Results suggest that voters strongly disapprove of wealth accumulation
   in office and associate it with corruption and political violence.
   Further analyses suggest several mechanisms that may partly explain why
   many ``wealth accumulators{''} win elections in India despite these
   negative reactions. Voters generally lack information about disclosures
   and many weigh wealth accumulation less than some other prominent
   concerns, such as performance in office or caste-based appeals.},

Volume = {54},

Abstract = {Even if the non-unitary nature of parties has come back into the party
   politics agenda, many of its features are still largely understudied.
   Specifically, an encompassing explanation of individual faction
   membership and of the role of party fusions in fostering faction
   membership is still missing. By performing a diachronic analysis, this
   article proposes a new approach to study the determinants of faction
   membership, highlighting the fundamental role of ideological, policy-
   and career-related factors. Moreover, the article uses as an explanatory
   factor a key element that has hitherto never been taken into account in
   intra-party analyses: psychological social identity, a variable that
   strongly conditions party members' behaviour in situations where parties
   are merging. The analysis also shows the crucial role of party fusion in
   shaping individual faction membership determinants, highlighting that
   the effect of these determinants varies considerably the more time has
   elapsed since the party's merger.},

Abstract = {We conducted a national survey of local party chairs that included a
   conjoint experiment to assess the effects of candidates' race and gender
   on chairs' assessments of their likelihood of winning a state
   legislative primary election in their area. Chairs from both parties
   viewed women candidates as just as likely as men to win the support of
   their base but viewed Latinx and black candidates as substantially less
   likely to win. The disadvantage chairs believe minority candidates face
   is insensitive to variation in county demographics among Republican
   chairs but is attenuated among Democratic chairs serving counties with
   larger minority populations. Our findings suggest that officials from
   both parties believe that minority candidates face an uphill battle with
   their base. This perception may color chairs' decisions about which
   candidates to recruit and most vigorously support.},

Abstract = {Preferences for redistribution and social spending are correlated with
   income and unemployment risk, but it is unclear how these relationships
   come about. I build a theory emphasizing that only large changes in
   economic circumstances provide the information and motivation needed for
   people to change their preferences. Stable long-run preferences are
   shaped mainly by early socialization, which includes economic and
   ideological influences from the family, and early labor market
   experiences. Enduring shocks, low intergenerational mobility and the
   tendency of left-wing parents to be poorer generate correlations between
   circumstances and preferences. Because preferences are stable, greater
   inequality may not increase aggregate support for redistribution.
   Support is found for the theory with panel data from Switzerland, using
   a range of empirical tests.},

Abstract = {There are considerable scholarly debates regarding the real consequences
   of corruption. Recent studies have argued that predictable corruption,
   in which bribers are guaranteed the delivery of government services, is
   less distortional and more efficiency-enhancing than arbitrary
   corruption in which officials engage in simple plunder. Yet the
   empirical evidence is mixed. By leveraging a vignette experiment
   embedded in an original firm survey in China, we find that overseas
   investors always consider corruption detrimental. There is some evidence
   that high-productivity and fixed-asset intensive investors might view
   predictable corruption more favorably than arbitrary corruption.
   Additionally, we find that compared to arbitrary corruption, predictable
   corruption is not associated with a significantly higher probability of
   market entry, but it increases the likelihood of majority ownership.
   Overall, the results provide little evidence that corruption ``greases
   the wheels of commerce{''} even in a most likely case and suggest that
   the perceived benefits of predictable corruption are limited.},

Abstract = {The upsurge of Somali based maritime piracy after 2005 resulted in
   considerable international activity in the Horn of Africa, ranging from
   naval missions to capacity building projects. It also ushered in a new
   focus by regional states on the dangers as well as the opportunities
   associated with the sea. In Kenya and Djibouti, two states directly
   impacted by piracy, this resulted in a strategic shift toward the ocean,
   breaking with a historical land-centric security approach, in an attempt
   to reform their domestic maritime sectors and coastal governance
   architectures by capitalizing on assistance from external capacity
   building providers. This article adds rigor to the field of maritime
   security studies by zooming in on how two key littoral states have
   reformed their domestic maritime sectors following a decline in acts of
   piracy. It explores important questions such as how have Djibouti and
   Kenya approached maritime governance historically? How are their
   territorial maritime spaces delineated and defined? How has the
   phenomena of piracy influenced the development of coastal governance in
   both countries? Has this led to innovative practices? Can these
   practices be applied in other jurisdictions? Finally, what has been the
   impact of external capacity building assistance on the development of
   both Djibouti and Kenya's maritime sector and respective approaches to
   coastal governance and enforcement? This research is significant as it
   sheds new light on the limitations and challenges facing domestic
   maritime security sectors in Africa, but also highlights new ways states
   can improve and build maritime constabulary governance through
   international partnerships, capacity development and embracing the blue
   economic agenda using the cases of Djibouti and Kenya as archetypal
   models.},

Abstract = {Historical institutionalism has demonstrated the value of close analysis
   of policymaking to explain institutional change. Scholars have
   distinguished four patterns of institutional change: drift, conversion,
   layering, and displacement. This paper analyzes pension reform in Russia
   and China to illustrate institutional change in
   bureaucratic-authoritarian regimes. While policymaking in both countries
   takes place almost entirely within the state bureaucracy, in China,
   state authority is much more decentralized than in Russia.? This
   difference helps to explain the difference in the patterns of policy
   change that we observe in the two cases: periodic abrupt reversals in
   Russia vs. incrementalism and layering in China.},

Abstract = {In July 2018, the leaders of Ethiopia and Eritrea signed a historic
   peace agreement. The emergence of new leadership in Ethiopia was key to
   the unprecedented coming together between the two countries. This piece
   briefly discusses Ethiopia-Eritrea relations, Ethiopian Prime Minister
   Abiy Ahmed Ali's ascent to power and the reconciliation between the two
   counties. It contends that the agreement is likely to affect the
   domestic political landscape in each country, while also affecting
   inter-state relations in the Horn of Africa.},

Abstract = {President Erdogan has expressed his objection to the current structure
   of the UN with the motto ``the world is bigger than five.{''} The
   international systemic root of this objection is the failure of the UN
   to make adequate contribution to peace and prosperity. Among other
   reasons behind this call for change are the AK Party's ideological
   orientation, Erdogan's charisma and his powerful sense of mission to
   carry the `periphery' into the center as well as Turkey's ascendancy to
   a rising power that has prompted it to advocate multipolarity in the
   international system. This article argues that the motto ``the world is
   bigger than five{''} has a number of connotations: a strong support for
   a just and peaceful international order; a plea against permanent
   membership and the accompanying veto mechanism; a call for reforming the
   UN to render the UNSC more representative, transparent and accountable;
   and an outcry against imperialistic interventions.},

   We ascertain the purpose of the establishment of international criminal

   system of human rights protection, the impact of the European Convention
   on Human Rights on the drafting of statutes of the international
   criminal courts and influence of the European Convention on Human Rights
   and case-law of the European Court of Human Rights on the interpretation
   of the right to legal assistance in the international criminal courts.
   Also the primacy of the right to legal assistance is proved, which is
   provided in the ECHR to the statutes of international criminal courts.
   At the same time, the international criminal courts, taking into account
   the purpose of their establishment and jurisdiction, give additional
   guarantees of the right to legal assistance.},

Abstract = {Scholarship suggests the Federal Election Commission lacks adequate
   enforcement tools to deter those who would violate campaign finance
   laws. But can and do voters hold political candidates accountable for
   violating these laws? In this article, we employ two studies to
   empirically evaluate these questions. The first examines the extent to
   which media cover campaign finance violations, and how they do so. The
   second employs an experimental approach to test the effects of such
   media coverage on evaluations of political candidates, in particular
   whether knowledge of a candidate's violation of campaign finance laws
   erodes voter support. We find that the media are more likely to cover
   campaign finance impropriety for high-profile offices, when criminal
   action is alleged, and for most serious violations. We also show that
   voters care about campaign violations, and certain violations lower
   voter support similar to other types of political scandal.},

Abstract = {It is commonly believed that the general public is heavily dependent on
   the media for its political news and views and that, as a consequence,
   the media exercise a strong influence over public opinion and behaviour.
   However, many millions in the Western world strongly believe things that
   are barely ever mentioned in the mainstream media, just as many millions
   also firmly reject or ignore some of the messages that are repeated
   incessantly by them. This confirms sixty years of experimental
   psychology research showing that most individuals are capable of
   preserving their beliefs, even in the face of overwhelming evidence,
   argument and logic to the contrary. Consistent with this, political
   science research finds little evidence of strong media influence on the
   party voting, political attitudes and election agendas of citizens. They
   have their own ways of gathering political information about the world
   around them, and they do not necessarily believe what they read in the
   papers, unless they are so inclined to start with. Consequently, media
   influences on mass opinion and behaviour are weaker than commonly
   assumed and, such as they are, their effects are more beneficial than
   harmful for democracy.},

   Responsiveness},
Journal = {POLITICAL RESEARCH QUARTERLY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {72},
Number = {3},
Pages = {623-636},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Voters are increasingly concerned that special interests control the
   policy process. Yet, the literature on representation is more
   optimistic: elected officials face strong incentives to listen to
   voters-not just lobby groups-and this makes for more responsive
   policies. Building on recent work, we argue a more nuanced point:
   different types of groups have different effects on responsiveness. We
   show empirically that lobbying from ``cause{''} groups-representing
   diffuse interests like climate change-strengthens responsiveness, while
   lobbying from ``sectional{''} groups-representing industry and
   professional associations-has no observable effect. Our project uses a
   novel data set of Canadian lobbying registrations spanning fifteen
   policy areas from 1990 to 2009. Using a dynamic panel model, we test how
   interest group lobbying moderates the effect of voter issue attention on
   government spending. Our findings contribute to contemporary debates
   over the influence of organized groups, suggesting some interest groups
   may improve representation.},

Abstract = {While researching populist attitudes within Hungarian and Polish
   societies, we found something much more dangerous and malevolent: the
   combination of Manichean, black and white narratives that divide the
   world into good and evil, and encourages authoritarianism that puts
   trust in a ``strong{''} leader. We labelled it ``tribalism{''}: a
   mentality which is based on rallying around the leader of the tribe and
   fighting against the other tribe with every tool possible. While it
   seems to be more of a zeitgeist than only a regional phenomenon,
   tribalism can be especially destructive for democratic institutions in
   Central and Eastern European countries where democratic norms are
   weaker. In this article, we approach Hungarian and Polish societies in
   the light of ``tribalism{''}, and examine its respective effects.},

Abstract = {In democratic countries, attention is devoted to the issue of freedom of
   speech and freedom of expression and the role of public authorities
   during elections. Today, freedom of speech and freedom of expression are
   guaranteed at both the international and national levels. The
   international community has created a significant number of
   international agreements and acts of ``soft law{''} on standards of
   freedom of expression. In particular, the Code of Good Practice in
   Electoral Matters establishes as the first general condition for
   democratic elections the respect for fundamental human rights, and
   particularly freedom of expression, assembly and association, without
   which there can be no true democracy. On the one hand, the problem of
   ensuring freedom of expression during elections is caused by the wider
   limits of permissible criticism of candidates and the importance of
   coverage of the election process. On the other hand, it is caused by
   restrictions on the conduct of election campaigning and the necessity to
   provide equal access to the media for the subjects of the electoral
   process. In this context, it is important to find a balance between the
   right to free elections, freedom of speech and other rights, freedoms
   and interests of the subjects of the electoral process. This article
   researches the modern problems of national legal guarantee of the
   freedom of speech and the freedom of expression and international
   electoral standards on the protection of freedom of speech and freedom
   of expression in the electoral process.},

Abstract = {In light of the growing public spending in many regions of the world,
   this study scrutinizes relevant determinants of core public
   administration expenditure at the cantonal level in Switzerland,
   focusing particularly on New Public Management (NPM) reforms. The
   empirical study comprises all 26 cantons in the period from 1993 through
   2014 and uses both cross-sectional and longitudinal analytical methods.
   In addition to NPM, we control for various variables related to
   political parties, institutions, socioeconomics and culture. The results
   show no clear relationship between NPM reforms and expenditure, although
   such reforms were often intended to cut costs. Our explanation for this
   finding is that NPM as a concept is rather inconsistent. Various control
   variables are either positively or negatively related with expenditure.
   All in all, our findings suggest that public expenditure is still mostly
   determined by politics and can only be influenced by administrative
   reforms within certain narrow limits.
   In Anbetracht der vielerorts stetig wachsenden Staatsausgaben analysiert
   diese Studie wichtige Determinanten der kantonalen Ausgaben im Bereich
   der allgemeinen Verwaltung in der Schweiz mit besonderem Fokus auf New
   Public Management-Reformen (NPM). Die empirische Studie umfasst die 26
   Kantone im Zeitraum zwischen 1993 und 2014 und bedient sich dabei
   diverser Quer- und L \& auml;ngsschnittanalysemethoden. Neben
   NPM-Reformen wird f \& uuml;r diverse Parteien-, Institutionen-, Kultur-
   und sozio \& ouml;konomische Variablen kontrolliert. Die Ergebnisse
   zeigen keinen eindeutigen Zusammenhang zwischen NPM-Reformen und
   Verwaltungsausgaben, obwohl erstere oft als Mittel zur Kosteneinsparung
   betrachtet wurden. Wir erkl \& auml;ren diesen Befund mit der
   konzeptionellen Inkonsistenz von NPM. Diverse Kontrollvariablen weisen
   entweder positive oder negative signifikante Zusammenh \& auml;nge mit
   den Verwaltungsausgaben auf, was wir im Text genauer diskutieren.
   Insgesamt legen unsere Befunde den Schluss nahe, dass Staatsausgaben
   stets politisch begr \& uuml;ndet sind und durch Verwaltungsreformen nur
   bedingt substituiert werden k \& ouml;nnen.},

Abstract = {The present paper aims to discuss the problem of declining political
   participation nowadays in conjunction with the level of state
   sovereignty in Europe. Is this a phenomenon worth worrying over? If so,
   for whom? Is the decline of people's interest in politics connected with
   a potential decline of state sovereignty? The issue of legitimacy in
   policymaking is the crux of the matter for the democratic future of the
   European Union. The multi-level analysis aims to link international
   relations theory and the state sovereignty problematique to the current
   issues of European party systems and their subsequent interlinkage with
   the EU structure.},

Year = {2019},

Abstract = {Estimates of the costs of war include the financial costs and the lives
   that are lost. Using estimates of the value of a statistical life and
   the value of a statistical injury, the health losses can be converted to
   a common monetary metric and added to the budgetary costs. Counting the
   monetary value of the direct war-related fatalities and injuries plays a
   relatively greater role for the Vietnam War than for the Iraq and
   Afghanistan conflicts. This article proposes an alternative war cost
   metric that also recognizes the lives that are also lost because
   economic resources are diverted to war efforts. All costs are converted
   to mortality costs using a measure of the mortality opportunity cost to
   the public of war-related expenditures. Recognition of these indirect
   mortality effects approximately triples the number of fatalities
   attributable to the post-9/11 wars. The relative role of these indirect
   mortality losses is less for the Vietnam War because of that war's
   higher rate of fatalities compared to financial costs.},

Abstract = {In implementing the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), there remains a huge
   perception gap between China and Indonesia. Differences in ideology,
   politics, race, religion, and ethnicity are hindering the great
   potential of the BRI from being fully realized. To bridge the gap and
   enhance mutual understanding, people-to-people exchange between both
   countries should be accorded greater significance. In addition,
   strengthening bilateral cooperation in education, labor, tourism, and
   culture can bring positive spill-over effects beyond basic intercultural
   learning. Such non-infrastructure cooperation creates more room for
   people-to-people bonds to flourish, where economic interests are not
   blindly pursued. Deepened mutual understanding will, in turn, help
   achieve the major goals of the BRI and promote the building of a
   community of shared future along the route.},

Abstract = {Political choice is central to citizens' participation in elections.
   Nonetheless, little is known about the individual-level mechanisms that
   link political choice and turnout. It is argued in this article that
   turnout decisions are shaped not only by the differences between the
   parties (party polarisation), but also by the closeness of parties to
   citizens' own ideological position (congruence), and that congruence
   matters more in polarised systems where more is at stake. Analysing
   cross-national survey data from 80 elections, it is found that both
   polarisation and congruence have a mobilising effect, but that
   polarisation moderates the effect of congruence on turnout. To further
   explore the causal effect of political choice, the arrival of a new
   radical right-wing party in Germany, the Alternative for Germany (AfD),
   is leveraged and the findings show that the presence of the AfD had a
   mobilising effect, especially for citizens with congruent views.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF ELECTIONS PUBLIC OPINION AND PARTIES},
Year = {2019},
Month = {2019 AUG 29},
Abstract = {A more profound analysis of the variables in the voting equation is
   needed to improve our knowledge on voting. In this paper, we endogenize
   the costs of voting (C) and test several models with the help of the
   Making Electoral Democracy Work database, which contains information on
   C and its potential determinants for national elections in France,
   Germany, Spain, Switzerland, and Canada. We test whether C is affected
   by sodo-demographic and attitudinal factors related to: (a)
   informational costs, (b) the costs of the act of voting itself, and (c)
   those bound to lead to an ex-ante rationalization of C. By doing so, we
   contribute to bridging the rational choice and the sociological and
   psychosociological models of voting. We find strong evidence that the
   three types of factors have a statistical and substantive effect on C.
   In particular, C falls with party identification, education, union
   membership, years in the region where the elections are held, interest
   in politics and the importance attributed to elections, while it is
   higher for women and rural dwellers. Age shows a curvilinear
   relationship, initially reducing C and increasing it later. Contrary to
   expected, the presence of kids at home does not significantly increase
   C.},

Abstract = {In this paper, I explore whether private money affects party extremism.
   This is one of the most important questions in the study of party
   politics, but it has not been systematically studied in the comparative
   context due to lack of data. I have assembled a novel and most
   comprehensive cross-national data about private donations that are
   currently available. Using these data that cover 45 parties in 9
   countries from 1996 to 2013, I show that the more private money parties
   receive, the more likely are they to take extreme positions. I further
   show that this effect is especially strong in the case of the more
   ideological, principled issues, and absent in the case of the less
   ideological, pragmatic ones. These findings contribute to our
   understanding of party position taking and the role of money in
   politics.},

Abstract = {Though 2017 saw historic levels of political activism in the form of
   anti-Trump protests, it remains to be seen whether these demonstrations
   actually led lawmakers to harden their resistance to President Donald
   Trump's agenda. Coupling state-level protest data, Senate voting
   records, and a collection of senators' tweets from 2017, I find that
   anti-Trump protests led to heightened opposition to the president in the
   U.S. Senate, though largely along party lines. Senate Democrats
   representing states that saw more intense Women's March demonstrations
   were more likely to oppose the president's legislative agenda,
   particularly on nominations votes. Moreover, the frequency of anti-Trump
   demonstrations back home increased the likelihood that Democratic
   senators issued tweets critical of President Trump. Senate Republicans,
   however, were unresponsive to anti-Trump protests, both in the chamber
   and on Twitter.},

Journal = {ELECTORAL STUDIES},

Abstract = {Until 2017, Germany was an exception to the success of radical right
   parties in postwar Europe. We provide new evidence for the
   transformation of the Alternative for Germany (AfD) to a radical right
   party drawing upon social media data. Further, we demonstrate that the
   AfD's electorate now matches the radical right template of other
   countries and that its trajectory mirrors the ideological shift of the
   party. Using data from the 2013 to 2017 series of German Longitudinal
   Elections Study (GLES) tracking polls, we employ multilevel modelling to
   test our argument on support for the AID. We find the AfD's support now
   resembles the image of European radical right voters. Specifically,
   general right-wing views and negative attitudes towards immigration have
   become the main motivation to vote for the AM. This, together with the
   increased salience of immigration and the AfD's new ideological profile,
   explains the party's rise.},

Abstract = {The prevailing interpretation of constituent power is taken to be the
   extra-institutional capacity of a group, typically ``the people,{''} to
   establish or revise the basic constitutional conditions of a state.
   Among many contemporary democratic theorists, this is understood as a
   collective capacity for innovation. This paper excavates an alternative
   perspective from constituent power's genealogy. I argue that constituent
   power is not a creative material power, but is a type of political claim
   that shapes the collective rights, responsibilities, and identity of
   ``the people.{''} I do so by recovering Thomas Hobbes's intervention
   into debates over constituent power among Scottish Presbyterians during
   the English Civil War. Though a materialist, Hobbes appreciated the
   centrality of the imagination to politics, and he argued that
   constituent power was one such phantasm of the mind. In Leviathan, he
   showed constituent power not to be a material power, but a world-making
   fiction that furnished political realities with ornamentation of the
   imagination, which might provide the beliefs and justifications to serve
   any number of political ends. More generally, the retrieval of a
   Hobbesian constituent power provides an important challenge to
   contemporary theories by demonstrating how partisan constructions of
   constituent power shape the political options available to groups.},

Abstract = {Interpersonal influence shapes political behavior and attitudes. So far,
   however, little efforts have been devoted to testing this mechanism
   comparatively in Europe. This paper aims at explaining differences in
   influence patterns in three European countries (Italy, Germany, and the
   UK). Based on works in demography, we argue that in Mediterranean
   cultures (characterized by high degrees of familism), people are more
   prone to be affected by attitudes and behaviors of their relatives with
   respect to other strong ties (e.g., spouses), while in continental,
   northern Europe, and the UK, this effect is less important. We test this
   argument using longitudinal data. Consistent with expectations, results
   show that the influence of relatives in familistic contexts is stronger
   than in non-familistic ones. At the same time, the spouse effect
   (namely, the effect of an intimate, non-relative discussant) is
   particularly strong in non-familistic contexts (and vice versa). In sum,
   we demonstrate that public opinion studies can be strengthened by
   theories developed in other social sciences, such as demography.},

Abstract = {Despite the high attention paid to the homicide rate in El Salvador, the
   empirical correlations of this variable with other explanatory variables
   have not been quantitatively substantiated. This study contributes to
   address this knowledge gap, calculating quantile regressions of the
   homicide rate per 100,000 inhabitants for each municipality in El
   Salvador in the 3rd, 50th and 98th percentile respectively, with
   population data for 2007. The resulting models show that the homicide
   rate is significantly correlated with the following variables:
   positively with the number of gangs per municipality, in the 3th and
   50th percentiles; positively with the index of urbanity and negatively
   with access to drinking water, in the 50th percentile; as well as
   positively with the number of gang members per 100,000 inhabitants, in
   the 98th percentile. These results can be used to guide policy, but they
   only explain part of the problem. There is an urgent need for better
   statistics to correct some limitations in future studies.},

Abstract = {This paper seeks to problematize the openings and limitations of
   different labor regulatory initiatives in the contemporary world. Such
   initiatives show collisions with a series of formal aspects - such as
   coercive restrictions - and factual ones - such as lobbying - that
   reduce its effectiveness. For this purpose, some theoretical and
   practical background issues on labor regulation are reviewed. The
   conclusions point to the need - and opportunity- to explore some
   resolution alternatives, such as the defense of the strike, the
   promotion and introduction of the universal basic income, and workers'
   control of production.},

Abstract = {Social accountability institutions are at the forefront of democratic
   reformers' efforts to improve well-being by harnessing the power of
   citizen participation. This article builds on recent research
   identifying a positive relationship between participatory budgeting (PB)
   and well-being. The article is the first large-N study to identify
   relationships between specific rules of PB programme design and
   well-being. A unique dataset of 114 Brazilian municipalities with PB
   programmes from 2009 to 2016 is constructed to evaluate whether internal
   mechanisms within PB explain variation in local infant mortality rates -
   an outcome associated with wellbeing. Hypotheses are tested that
   correspond to citizen participation, the scope of deliberation and
   embeddedness within local institutions. It is found that PB programmes
   are associated with lower infant mortality rates when they broaden
   participation, expand deliberation and embed the new institutions in
   ongoing policy-making venues. The results offer a framework for
   designing PB programmes and other social accountability institutions to
   maximise impact.},

Abstract = {This article examines the extent to which legislators use legislative
   debates to engage in localism activities to cater to the interests of
   their selectorate in nonpreferential electoral systems. We define
   localism activities as the delivery of tangible and intangible benefits
   to a geographically confined constituency that is instrumental to
   legislators' re-selection. Our primary argument is that legislators
   whose selectorate operates at the local level make more speeches with
   parochial references. Results show strong support for this assertion.
   Furthermore, we find that high district magnitude leads to higher levels
   of localism. We use a mixed-methods research design, combining an
   original data set of 60,000 debates in Portugal with qualitative
   evidence from elite interviews. We make a methodological innovation in
   the field of representation and legislative studies by using a Named
   Entity Recognition tool to analyze the debates.},

Abstract = {A key challenge of democratic societies is to ensure a continuous flow
   of information between the people and elites in order to secure
   representation of citizen preferences. While there may be occasions
   where deviations from citizen preferences are desirable, political
   systems with a sustained and systematic mismatch between citizen opinion
   and policy would typically not be considered democratic. Political
   parties have traditionally acted as key channels of representation
   helping to transmit citizen preferences to policy-makers. Yet their
   ability to secure democratic representation has been called into
   question. The lecture explores the state of democratic representation in
   Europe by presenting evidence from the GovLis Research Programme `When
   does Government Listen to the Public' on the link between public opinion
   and policy on a large number of policy issues. Beyond parties, it
   explores a series of alternative channels of citizen representation by
   considering the ability of political institutions and engagement in
   civil society associations to strengthen the link between public opinion
   and policy.},

Abstract = {The concept of social variegation developed by Bolivian intellectual
   Rene Zavaleta Mercado has been crucial for political thinking in Latin
   America. Likewise, the reception of this notion by Bolivian
   intellectuals has been wide. This article characterizes the general
   elements of variegation notion on the thought of Bolivian philosopher
   Raul Prada, in contrast with the problem of social variegation developed
   by Zavaleta. Therefore, this article proposes three general dimensions
   of Prada's notion of variegation: an ontological dimension, a
   social-historical dimension and an epistemological dimension.},

Abstract = {The period of exile entailed a thorough reconfiguration of the
   intellectual foundations of the Spanish Socialist Workers' Party (PSOE).
   Factors that contributed to this include the lessons learned from the
   intense experience of the Republic and the Civil War, the variables
   expected to put an end to the dictatorship and the cultural logic of the
   Cold War, in addition to the new cultural trends in the receiving
   countries and the influence exercised by the social democratic parties
   that lent their support. This article analyses the evolution of
   socialist thought in exile, as produced by the most important
   intellectuals of the time and leaders that harbosed intellectual
   pretensions. It addresses great theoretical works as well as lighter
   essays, speeches and conferences that were published as leaflets and
   circulated among party members. It is written from the perspective of a
   new political history, with political ideas that have been forged from
   the political, social and cultural conflicts of the time and articulated
   through a dialogue that is occasionally problematic within its own
   tradition. Along these lines, the article also contrasts the
   relationships of change and continuity within socialist thought with
   those of the Republic and the Transition.},

Abstract = {Lacunae in media images and reports of death and agrarian based
   suffering, experienced by India's debt prone farmers, have only begun to
   be addressed in the Indian news media. While the agrarian crisis is
   spectacularized through 24 hour news cycle images, analysis of
   underlying causes is less common in print and digital media. Kheti Badi,
   a photo-series produced from screenshots of FarmVille (an Adobe Flash
   gaming application on Facebook), interrogates this media impasse. It
   critiques homogenized images of food and farming, which rise to the top
   of web search results, and photojournalistic images showing the
   dignified suffering of Indian agricultural workers. Kheti Badi's
   computer made images are an alternative to visual stereotyping of rural
   India in photojournalism. Its technological inventiveness neither
   spectacularizes farmer protests or suicides nor aestheticizes pastoral
   qualities associated with the land. To make visible the changing nature
   of food production and need to reform farming in India, and its media
   coverage, Kheti Badi supplants the Indian pastoral with a new pictorial.},

Journal = {DESAFIOS},

Volume = {31},

Abstract = {In this paper we analyze the relationship between emotions, collective
   action and art in public space after the flood of April 2, 2013 in La
   Plata, focusing on a neighborhood assembly. The characteristics of their
   organization, their mural production, their repertoires of action and
   identifications and the conflict evidenced by artistic production will
   be addressed. It is up to the conclusion that the creation of murals was
   relevant in two ways. At the social level, it favored that neighbors who
   did not attend the meetings, approached and shared the collective
   moment. It is evident here the conformation of a shared affective
   atmosphere and the generation of bonds of friendship and companionship
   essential for the functioning and mobilization of the assembly members.
   At the political level it generated antagonist relations mainly with the
   municipality of La Plata. It is visualized that the artistic production
   was staged but, at the same time, it produced the conflict. The
   methodology is qualitative and is based on the construction of a case
   study. We used participant and non-participant observation and semi
   structured interviews in a transdisciplinary methodological design,
   which was composed of social studies of art, social studies of
   emotions/affections and political theory.},

Abstract = {Police use of force bears on central matters of political science,
   including equality of citizen treatment by government. In light of
   recent high-profile officer-involved shootings (OIS) that resulted in
   civilian deaths, we assess whether, conditional on a shooting, a
   civilian's race predicts fatality during police-civilian interactions.
   We combine Los Angeles data on OIS with a novel research design to
   estimate the causal effects of fatal shootings on citizen-initiated
   contact with government. Specifically, we examine whether fatal OIS
   affect citizen contact with the municipal government via use of the
   emergency 911 and nonemergency 311 call systems in Los Angeles. We find
   no average effect of OIS on patterns of 911 and 311 call behavior across
   a wide range of empirical specifications. Our results suggest, contrary
   to existing evidence, that OIS, in and of themselves, do not
   substantively change civic behavior, at least not citizen-initiated
   contact with local government.},

Abstract = {Drawing upon the `satisfaction with democracy' and `divisive primary'
   literatures, this article examines how losers of intra-party elections
   respond to defeat and the consequences that these choices have on party
   organization and strength. In other words, do losers of intra-party
   elections continue to support the party or do they, like losers of
   general elections, feel less satisfied with democracy and withdraw their
   support (or even `exit' the party)? Exploring rates of membership
   activism and satisfaction from a recent study of Canadian party members,
   this article demonstrates that losers of intra-party elections are more
   likely to exit the party, significantly less likely to remain active and
   engaged in party politics, and significantly more likely to report
   dissatisfaction with party membership. These findings suggest that
   parties must find a way of keeping losers engaged with the party.},

Abstract = {This paper seeks to clarify conceptually the difference between politics
   and biopolitics. To accomplish this objective, the text explores
   Foucault's concern for how biological life begins to be conducted by
   modern government techniques. Next, it complements Foucault's intuition
   with Agamben's perspective, showing that biopolitics is the metaphysical
   form that shapes the political in the West. Finally, with the help of
   Ranciere, it is shown that biopolitics is not a metaphysical form that
   produces bare life but a form of the police distribution of sensibility
   that reacts to the scandal politics brings.},

Abstract = {This paper analyzes the development of an urban park ``Parque Ambiental
   Bicentenario{''} in Metepec Estado de Mexico as an exercise of
   governance. Where the urban territory plays a central role as it is a
   space of identity and belonging for the inhabitants of the area. This
   shows an example of citizen organization to defend a space, property of
   the Government, before the attempt to be privatized to create an urban
   development with a strong emphasis in commercial proposes. This space,
   whose environmental, social and urban potential, is today a park, thanks
   to the resistance action of a citizen movement and its capacity to
   promote a process of negotiation, consensus, planning and implementation
   of a project that benefits the whole metropolitan area (Zona
   Metropolitana del Valle de Toluca), consolidating itself as one of the
   most important urban parks of the area.},

Abstract = {Do minority voters respond to co-racial or co-ethnic candidates? That is
   does the increased chance of substantive representation translate into
   increased participation? Here, we focus on this question among African
   American voters. While much of the empirical literature on this question
   has produced conflicting answers, recent studies suggest that minority
   candidates can significantly increase minority turnout. We argue that
   past work on this topic does not adequately account for the fact that
   minority voters in places with minority candidates may systematically
   differ in their level of participation than minority voters in places
   without minority candidates. In this study we address the weaknesses of
   previous research designs and offer a new design that exploits the
   redistricting process to gain additional leverage over this question. We
   find little evidence that African American voter turnout increases when
   voters are moved to African American candidates. We find some evidence
   that white voters, however, tend to vote at lower rates when they are
   represented by African American candidates.},

Abstract = {Promotion and tenure decisions frequently require an assessment of the
   quality of a candidate's research record. Without carefully specifying
   what constitutes a tenurable and promotable record, departments
   frequently adopt the Potter Stewart approach - they know it when they
   see it. The benefit of such a system is that it allows for multiple
   paths to tenure and promotion and encourages holistic review, but the
   drawback is that it allows for the promotion and tenure process to be
   more easily manipulated by favoritism and bias. Incorporating
   transparent metrics such as journal impact factor (JIF) would seem like
   a good way to standardize the process. We argue, however, that when JIF
   becomes determinative, conceptual disadvantages and systematic biases
   are introduced into the process. JIF indicates the visibility or utility
   of a journal; it does not and cannot tell us about individual articles
   published in that journal. Moreover, it creates inequitable paths to
   tenure on the basis of gender and subfield, given gendered patterns of
   publications and the variation in journal economies by subfield.},

Abstract = {It is common that political parties, considered here in their legal
   personality, have been involved in acts of corruption. However, since
   they are neither a control nor of power, they end up being ignored by
   the legal system at the time of the imposition of control mechanisms and
   sanctions. This paper addresses the issue of this legal ``vacuum{''} on
   partisan organizations, focusing on a proposal just to fill this gap. It
   has been objectified, through a literature review, to expose different
   initiatives in other countries that specifically target the legal
   personality of the parties, reducing the incentives of their use for the
   practice of misappropriation of resources, legitimization of capital and
   other crimes, building an own proposal that could be applied in many
   systems. In the end it is concluded that, even if it is a private
   entity, the parties cannot fail to be accountable, and the
   anti-corruption measures here exposed can strengthen the fight against
   corruption.},

Abstract = {The application of spatial voting theories to popular elections
   presupposes an electorate that chooses political representatives on the
   basis of their well-structured policy preferences. Behavioral
   researchers have long contended that parts of the electorate instead
   hold unstructured and inconsistent policy beliefs. This article proposes
   an extension to spatial voting theories to analyze the effect of varying
   consistency in policy preferences on electoral behavior. The model
   results in the expectation that voters with less consistent policy
   preferences will put less weight on policy distance when learning about
   candidates who should represent their political positions. The study
   tests this expectation for the 2008 US presidential election, and finds
   that for respondents with less consistent self-placements on the
   liberal-conservative scale, policy distance less strongly affects their
   voting decision. The results have implications for the quality of
   political representation, as certain parts of the electorate are
   expected to be less closely represented.},

Abstract = {Autocracies often rely on power-sharing to maintain political survival.
   The literature, however, does not provide an adequate explanation for
   why autocratic regimes differ in the capability to enforce
   power-sharing. Drawing on the case of imperial China in the Qing dynasty
   (1644-1911), this article argues that institutionalized bureaucratic
   system may be an arguably credible mechanism for facilitating
   power-sharing. Examining the pattern of bureaucratic turnovers in the
   Qing period shows that the sanctions and promotions for provincial
   governors were significantly affected by the level of internal armed
   conflicts. Favoritism was granted to Manchus, the ruling minority group,
   for the promotion toward the top level. With the presence of armed
   conflicts at the province level, however, the rulers were induced to
   select Han elites from the majority group, as governors. These results
   are consistent with the logic of power-sharing by virtue of a
   loyalty-versus-competence trade-off in bureaucratic selections.},

Abstract = {How successful are attempts to strengthen the capacity of national
   legislatures to better perform their law-making function? In response to
   executive dominance, some legislatures have attempted organisational
   reform to strengthen their capacity. One such institutional innovation
   is pre-legislative scrutiny (PLS) - a process whereby a parliamentary
   committee scrutinises draft bills and reports back with observations
   and/or recommendations to the ministry sponsoring the legislation. PLS
   is designed to enhance the capacity of parliament to influence
   government-sponsored legislation. We measure the impact of PLS on
   legislative outcomes by conducting a content analysis of PLS reports and
   subsequent Government bills introduced to the Irish Parliament between
   2011 and 2016. This analysis is supplemented with an in-depth case study
   of legislative change around gender recognition. The mixed method
   analysis suggesting that PLS can have a substantive impact on proposed
   government legislation. PLS serves to strengthen the role of parliament
   in law-making, with positive, and arguably generalisable, consequences
   for stakeholder engagement, parliamentarians and the quality of
   legislation.},

Journal = {POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {71},

Abstract = {Like many advanced industrial democracies, New Zealand has been
   experiencing relatively stagnant voter turnout levels. Much of the blame
   for low voter turnout has been directed towards voter apathy. The rapid
   development of Internet and communications technologies has made
   scholars consider the Internet as a possible remedy for the
   participation bias. In this research note, we extend the examination of
   Internet and vote mobilisation to the case of New Zealand. We ask
   whether the mobilisation by political parties and other people using the
   new media makes a difference in voter turnout. Specifically, we are
   interested in whether political parties mobilising citizens by using the
   new media and/or virtual methods make a difference to voter turnout.
   Using the 2014 New Zealand General Election as the basis of our
   analysis, we find that use of the Internet increases the probability of
   casting a vote. Moreover, we find that if Internet use is complemented
   by a party orientation, voters are more likely to vote as well. While we
   do not find support for party campaigning through the Internet in
   increasing the probability of voting, these findings give support to

Abstract = {Ethnic minority women tend to be better represented in parliaments than
   ethnic minority men. What does this mean for their substantive
   representation? This article makes use of intersectional analysis to
   study how the relationship between descriptive and substantive
   representation differs within and between gender and ethnic groups.
   Drawing on written parliamentary questions and the committee memberships
   of MPs in seven parliamentary sessions (1995-2012) in the Netherlands, a
   strong link is found between descriptive and substantive representation.
   Female ethnic minority MPs more often sit on committees and table
   questions that address ethnic minority women's interests than male
   ethnic minority and female ethnic majority MPs. The link, however, is
   fragile as it is based on a small number of active MPs. This
   demonstrates the importance of an intersectional approach to
   understanding how representation works in increasingly diverse
   parliaments, which cannot be captured by focusing on gender or ethnicity
   alone.},

Abstract = {Trilogues have been studied as sites of secluded inter-institutional
   decision making that gather the Council of the European Union, the
   European Parliament (EP) and the European Commission. Trilogues,
   however, are not exempt from formal and informal party-political
   dynamics that affect intra- and inter-institutional contestation. The
   increase in Eurosceptics in the 2014 EP elections offers an opportunity
   to investigate their efforts to shape the position and behaviour of the
   EP negotiating team in trilogues. Therefore, this article investigates
   to what extent Eurosceptic party groups participate in trilogue
   negotiations and how mainstream groups deal with their presence. The
   analysis shows that the opportunities to participate in trilogues and
   shape the EP's position are higher for those perceived as soft
   Eurosceptic MEPs, while mainstream groups apply a `cordon sanitaire' to
   those perceived as being part of hard Eurosceptic groups - which reduces
   the chances of MEPs from those groups being willing to participate in
   parliamentary work.},

Abstract = {The paper studies the legal enforced emergence of private and public
   title of compulsory origin to land plots in the Russian Federation which
   is not typical for the European legal practice. The authors examine the
   causes and consequences of its appearance and note that this is due to
   the national specifics of Russia's transition to a market economy and a
   rule-of-law state. The article analyzes legal procedures for the forced
   reissuance of the right of permanent (unlimited) property use, the
   emergence of the right of common share ownership of citizens who are the
   owners of a premises (apartments) in multi-family residential house, the
   forced transfer to public property of heirless estate, redistribution of
   landed property among different levels of public authority, transfer of
   a land lot which cannot by law belong to a citizen or a legal entity to
   public property, as well as a number of others issues.
   The authors believe that the legal practice of the compulsory emergency
   of the right to own land plots is in many respects a necessary
   condi-tion for securing important public interests which is
   inadmissibility of the existence of an ownerless estate where condition
   may threaten life, health and other legally protected goods, the
   invasion of land in civil circulation, attraction of additional
   financial resources to the Federal, regional and municipal budgets
   through the collection of land tax (or rent payment in the case of
   forcing the owner of the property to include a joint leasehold
   agreement).},

Abstract = {This article explores the everyday emotional attachments to martial
   discourses through the embodiment of popular culture representations of
   war(rior) bodies in cosplay. In cosplay - the (re)creation and wearing
   of costumes of characters from popular culture - the cosplayer is able
   to express and experience behaviours and emotions normally unavailable
   to them. This enables a radical, empathetic form of identity
   exploration, wherein the cosplayer is able to express and develop an
   understanding of their own and others' experiences. Building on
   autoethnographic fieldwork in cosplay as Black Widow, I posit three
   links between cosplay and the study of emotions in International
   Relations (IR): the first, going through the everyday constitutive
   character of popular culture; the second, linking the embodiment of
   representations of war(rior) characters in cosplay with the feminist IR
   challenge to study the human experience of war; and the third, arguing
   that the study of something so seemingly random can engender exciting
   insights, like a collage. I argue that cosplay can be used to understand
   our emotional attachments to violent, gendered discourses found in
   popular culture narratives, but that in the (re)enactment of these upon
   the body - in their embodiment - there is a space for resistance.},

Abstract = {Do images affect online political mobilization? If so, how? These
   questions are of fundamental importance to scholars of social movements,
   contentious politics, and political behavior generally. However, little
   prior work has systematically addressed the role of images in mobilizing
   online participation in social movements. We first confirm that images
   have a positive mobilizing effect in the context of online protest
   activity. We then argue that images are mobilizing because they trigger
   stronger emotional reactions than text. Building on existing political
   psychology models, we theorize that images evoking enthusiasm, anger,
   and fear should be particularly mobilizing, while sadness should be
   demobilizing. We test the argument through a study of Twitter activity
   related to a Black Lives Matter protest. We find that both images in
   general and some of the proposed emotional attributes (enthusiasm and
   fear) contribute to online participation. The results hold when
   controlling for alternative theoretical mechanisms for why images should
   be mobilizing, and for the presence of frequent image features. Our
   paper provides evidence supporting the broad argument that images
   increase the likelihood of a protest to spread online while teasing out
   the mechanisms at play in a new media environment.},

Abstract = {Donald Trump won the presidency by presenting himself to the electorate
   as someone who ``could get things done{''} and by promising to upend
   policy making in Washington. However, the first year of the Trump
   presidency has been characterized as disorganized and chaotic. The
   president's policy detachment and his penchant for improvisation and
   proclivity for heeding nontraditional sources of information have
   contributed to this generalized perception. This article assesses
   Trump's management style and identifies the main dynamics involved in
   the administration's foreign policy-making process in its first year in
   office by analyzing how the advisory system functioned in the decisions
   to withdraw from the Paris Agreement on climate change, decertify the
   Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, and recognize Jerusalem as the
   capital of Israel.},

Abstract = {Cultural diplomacy always links to and often overlaps with soft power
   and public diplomacy. Thus, the three notions have entered the lexicon
   of International Relations, and have become standard terms in foreign
   policy thinking. Drawing on the conceptualization of cultural diplomacy,
   this article examines the features, structure, actors, and possibilities
   of Turkey's foreign cultural strategy. Specifically, it focuses on an
   analysis of the double dimension of Turkish cultural diplomacy, the
   high-culture, and the pop-culture, asserting that the success of the
   latter has allowed Turkey to limit the damage to its soft power caused
   by domestic political turmoil. Furthermore, the research aims to
   highlight how Turkey has used culture as a resource for its
   diplomacy-useful for strengthening relations with other countries,
   enhancing cooperation, and promoting Turkish interests abroad.},

Abstract = {This article exploits variation in age among first-time eligible
   citizens in Norwegian elections that arises through voting eligibility
   rules and two-year election cycles to investigate voting habits. I find
   that obtaining the right to vote at a lower age is associated with
   substantially higher turnout among first-time eligible citizens,
   however, this difference in political participation does not persist for
   subsequent elections. Building on the established literature on the
   habitual nature of voting, the results show that getting young citizens
   to vote once is not sufficient to create a habit of voting, and suggest
   that how the voting decision is made matter for the habit formation
   process.},

Abstract = {Prior research has shown that social identities defined by an attachment
   to place (i.e., place-based identities) are influential in shaping how
   citizens understand and think about political topics. Moreover, prior
   research has also argued that candidates sometimes use place-based
   appeals in order to win support among the electorate, and that such
   appeals are seemingly widespread. While past research has provided a
   rich understanding of what place-based identity and place-based appeals
   are, there is a large gap in what we know about the causal effects of
   such appeals. In this study, we address this gap by testing
   experimentally the effects of place-based appeals on voters' evaluation
   of candidate likeability and ability to understand their constituents,
   across the broader American patchwork. Using a set of modified campaign
   mailer advertisements, we alter whether respondents see an ad that uses
   rural or urban imagery when introducing a candidate. Our results
   indicate that, consistent with existing theory, place-based appeals are
   impactful in shaping political evaluations among rural voters, but do
   not appear as relevant for urban voters. Overall, we argue that placeor
   symbolically charged geographical sitesis a useful, widespread, and
   potentially powerful political heuristic.},

Abstract = {En 1945, l'armee francaise qui participe a l'invasion de l'Allemagne au
   sein de la coalition occidentale presente le visage d'une armee
   coloniale et imperiale. En effet, la moitie de ses effectifs est
   composee de soldats colonises provenant principalement d'Algerie,
   Tunisie et du Maroc, mais aussi des colonies francaises d'Afrique
   subsaharienne. Apres l'occupation de la Rhenanie dans les annees 1920,
   par plusieurs milliers de sujets coloniaux, et qui avait provoque le
   scandale de la << honte noire >>, c'est la seconde fois au XXe siecle
   que l'armee francaise utilise des soldats colonises pour occuper des
   civils allemands. Les relations intimes, consenties ou non, entre
   colonises et femmes occupees, sont alors, a nouveau, au centre de toutes
   les attentions. Croisant les apports des travaux recents sur les
   sexualites et les relations de genre en guerre, et, d'autre part dans
   celle des recherches sur les masculinites en situation coloniale, cet
   article analyse la maniere dont l'institution militaire envisage les
   relations entre soldats colonises conquerants et des Allemandes
   vaincues. Il a pour ambition de montrer comment un Etat colonial en
   guerre, et plus precisement en sortie de guerre, controle la sexualite
   des Europeennes comme celle des colonises. Il s'agit de comprendre
   comment la hierarchie militaire gere de telles relations a un moment
   d'affaiblissement de la puissance coloniale mais aussi de reaffirmation
   d'une virilite conquerante des hommes metropolitains apres l'humiliation
   de 1940.},

Abstract = {This concluding article begins by considering the reasons behind the
   growing demand for policy-relevant comparative research into the
   institutional structures and processes of electoral management. It then
   outlines the theoretical framework used in this special issue -
   distinguishing the structure, capacities, and ethos of electoral
   management - and summarizes the key insights arising from the evidence.
   Research on electoral management is expanding, nevertheless it suffers
   from several major challenges, including the difficulties of isolating
   aid effectiveness in this sector and of determining the impact of
   electoral management on broader indicators of democratic performance.
   This constitutes the future research agenda.},

Abstract = {The question of who ought to be included in the demos is distinct from,
   and yet related to, the question of how to distribute decision-making
   power among those who are included. Political equality is the most
   common answer to the former question within democratic theory. In
   democratic practice, it is usually realized through one person one vote.
   Within democratic theory, there is not as much agreement as to what the
   answer to the latter question should be. The answer that has attracted
   most attention within the scholarly literature is that all those who are
   affected should be included. However, prominent scholars have argued
   that this all-affected principle is incompatible with political equality
   and therefore an unattractive answer to the question of inclusion. This
   article challenges this critique and argues that it is based on a
   misconception of political equality and a narrow reading of the
   all-affected principle.},

Abstract = {What are the consequences of unequal economic conditions on national
   election results? In this study, we use extraordinarily granular
   economic data measured without sampling error to assess how variation in
   local economic conditions across 3152 settlements affects incumbent
   support across the two most recent Hungarian elections. In addition, we
   use 95 monthly surveys capturing vote intention for nearly 100,000
   respondents to assess possible individual level mechanisms. We find that
   the local economic milieu has a substantial effect on incumbent support,
   and that this effect was especially pronounced in the 2010 election that
   coincided with the peak of the Great Recession. Our micro-level analyses
   support these findings and suggest that the effect of local unemployment
   is unlikely to be explained by an aggregation of dissatisfaction among
   the unemployed.},

Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL THEORY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {21},
Number = {2},
Pages = {211-229},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {This article revisits long-standing questions about consent, membership
   and emigration in Locke's thought. Commentators such as A John Simmons
   have argued that Locke opens political membership to both express
   consenters and some kind of tacit consenters, and not just to the
   former, as some have suggested. Simmons's reading seems to render Locke
   more sensible in that it does not exclude large numbers of people from
   membership or burden the few members with all the civic duties, and also
   in that it allows at least tacit-consenting members the right to
   relocate, while this right is denied to express-consenting members.
   Against this reading, the article shows, by resolving seemingly
   conflicting claims in the text, that people become members only by
   express consent. It also responds to the criticism that the
   express-consent-only reading would limit membership to a few and so
   would render Locke's account implausible from a practical point of view.
   The article then addresses the purported restriction Locke imposes on
   express consenters' right to emigrate, arguing that the restriction
   concerns the change of membership and not the right to relocate.},

Abstract = {This paper explores state-economy relations in an understudied European
   country, i.e. Portugal. Main research questions are: How does the
   country fit into the Varieties of Capitalism conceptual framework? Are
   there specific patterns that define the case as a distinct model of
   statist economy? The research is influenced by Becker's open, historical
   institutionalist approach to capitalism (Becker, U. 2009. Open Varieties
   of Capitalism. Continuity, Change and Performances. Basingstoke:
   Palgrave Macmillan). The paper offers a macro-account of major
   transformations in state ownership, in democratic Portugal, followed by
   analysis of state-economy relations at a sectorial level, namely in the
   waste management sector. Findings suggest that Portuguese capitalism has
   evolved from statist socialism into a formally liberalised economy but,
   in reality, it re-configured into a model of state-dependency
   perpetuated by the allocation of vast external resources. From
   large-scale owner to large-scale privatizer, the state adjusted its role
   as a large-scale aggregator.},

Abstract = {For over a decade, the Australian Political Studies Association (APSA)
   has maintained a list ranking journals into A{*}, A, B and C bands.
   However, we know little about how Politics scholars use and view the
   list. In this study, we firstly discuss the history of the APSA list,
   before then presenting the results of an original survey conducted in
   March 2017 with over 250 members of the discipline. While the APSA list
   seems to enjoy overall support, we find that there are concerns about
   its purpose, its assessment of journal quality and how it treats
   different subfields and methodologies. In the discussion section, we
   address some of the main criticisms that have been made of the list and
   offer a number of suggestions for revisions. These include widening the
   consultation process, making submissions to the ranking committee public
   and extending the range of journals included in the list.},

Volume = {8},

Abstract = {The article focuses on a conceptual alternative which is advocated as
   being crucial for the contemporary political philosophy. The alternative
   that needs to be examined and deconstructed is the one between ``group
   identity{''} and ``collective identity{''}. By using the group as unity
   of reference alias modality of identity building, dangerous
   misunderstandings can be avoided: those who refer to the ``group{''} do
   so, in the first instance, in order not to give for granted compact,
   strong identities which are independent of individuals, unlike the
   concepts immediately evoked by the notion of ``collective identity{''}.
   The term ``group identity{''}, secondly, implies the capacity of
   individuals to reflect and negotiate and compete according to specific
   intersubjective frames of behaviour and understanding. Intersubjective
   identity is the intersection between the subjective and objective aspect
   of a continuous, unstable, conflictual and asymmetrical process of
   re-elaboration of shared experiences, but in order to be maintained over
   time it needs vessels, symbols. They are the meaningful glue, in need of
   permanent reinterpretation, of the living together (2, 3). This is the
   core of the first part of the article. Therefore, in the second part
   some symbols are summoned to a pervasive criticism, through various
   hermeneutical tools, in order to help citizens and institutional bodies
   to prevent the most dangerous involutions in the everyday metaphorical
   pragmatics concerning identity issues. Racism and xenophobia in politics
   are to be detected in advance by means of a accurate polyphonic
   sensitivity towards the emerging of the corresponding imaginaries in the
   cultural and social dimensions of experience (4, 5, 6).},

Abstract = {States use repression to enforce obedience, but repression-especially if
   it is violent, massive, and indiscriminate-often incites opposition. Why
   does repression have such disparate effects? We address this question by
   studying the political legacy of Stalin's coercive agricultural policy
   and collective punishment campaign in Ukraine, which led to the death by
   starvation of over three million people in 1932-34. Using rich
   micro-level data on eight decades of local political behavior, we find
   that communities exposed to Stalin's ``terror by hunger{''} behaved more
   loyally toward Moscow when the regime could credibly threaten
   retribution in response to opposition. In times when this threat of
   retribution abated, the famine-ridden communities showed more opposition
   to Moscow, both short- and long-term. Thus, repression can both deter
   and inflame opposition, depending on the political opportunity structure
   in which post-repression behavior unfolds.},

Abstract = {This study suggests that in-group loyalty, defined as the degree to
   which people favor their own group over others, undermines the
   punishment of corruption. We present evidence from two studies. First,
   we utilize a real-world corruption scandal involving the ruling party in
   Spain that broke during survey fieldwork. People exposed to the scandal
   withhold support from the incumbent, but in-group loyalty based on
   partisanship weakens this effect. Second, we explore in-group loyalty
   beyond partisanship through laboratory experiments. These experiments
   artificially induce group identities, randomly assign the group identity
   of candidates and shut down any instrumental benefits of in-group
   loyalty. The experimental evidence suggests that people support corrupt
   candidates as long as they share a group identity and are willing to
   sacrifice material payoffs to do so. Our findings have important
   implications. Most importantly perhaps, they suggest that candidates can
   get away with corruption by engaging in identity politics.},

Abstract = {Citizenship is a difficult concept to apply to non-Western societies.
   The idea of citizenship has its origins in Ancient Athens and Republican
   Rome, its modern form having been shaped by the French Revolution and
   the nationalisms of nineteenth- and twentieth-century Europe. Yet the
   idea of a social contract between members of a society and their leaders
   is also found in non-Western societies. The notion of integrated rights
   and duties of free individuals has existed for centuries among the Bugis
   and Makasar peoples of South Sulawesi, Indonesia. In this paper,
   concepts and practices developed by the Bugis and Makasar are compared
   against Classical Greek and Roman citizenship, and the status of Bugis
   women is briefly examined. In conclusion, it is argued that an important
   contractual principle that has its origins in patron-client relations
   was fundamental to the foundation of the South Sulawesi states and to
   their economic and social well-being.},

Abstract = {Despite the vast amount of comparative research on right-wing populist
   parties over the past decade, there has been little work on non-European
   parties (as opposed to leaders). In this article, we argue that the
   international literature on populist parties has largely overlooked a
   significant non-European case: India's ruling Bharatiya Janata Party
   (BJP - Indian People's Party). Following the ideational approach to
   understanding populism, we examine whether the three distinguishing
   features of right-wing populism - its conceptions of ``the people{''},
   ``elites{''} and ``others{''} - are reflected in the views from
   interviews we conducted with BJP officials and representatives. We find
   that they are and so then consider whether they have been manifest in
   actions and statements while in power or whether, as some scholars
   claim, governing parties like the BJP moderate their populism. We
   conclude that the BJP can be very fruitfully included in comparative
   research on right-wing populist parties and propose a series of concrete
   ways in which this could be pursued.},

Abstract = {Insurgent organizations have become major players in criminal
   enterprises around the world. However, research examining why some
   participate in crime while others do not remains underdeveloped.
   Analyzing newly collected annual data on 140 insurgent groups from 1998
   to 2012, we examine the conditions driving insurgents' participation in
   drug crimes, extortion, smuggling, kidnapping for ransom, and robbery.
   We find that control of territory positively affects involvement in all
   types of crime. However, we also find notable differences in the
   conditions driving participation in episodic crimes versus crimes that
   require institutional investments. Institutional crimes are, with the
   exception of smuggling, more likely to occur as insurgent groups age,
   whereas efforts to cultivate legitimacy-as indicated by the ongoing
   provision of social services-substantially reduces the probability of
   involvement in episodic crimes. We discuss how this latter effect is
   reflective of a legitimacy trade-off that emerges for groups pursuing
   both social support and material resources.},

Abstract = {In contrast to much of the political economy literature, this article
   explores acts of refusal that obstruct attempts to impose austerity
   measures on advanced industrial democracies. It thereby complements a
   literature that has thus far focused far more upon the (apparently
   unobstructed) imposition of austerity. In doing so, it uses two
   typically `low-resistance' countries - Japan and the UK -as least-likely
   cases and finds that austerity is rarely uncontested. Using fuzzy set
   Qualitative Comparative Analysis, it highlights the `causal recipes'
   sufficient for both (1) anti-austerity activity to have a significant
   impact on austerity proposals and (2) the smooth (unobstructed)
   imposition of austerity. The politics of austerity is shown to be better
   understood as an iterative interaction between proposals for austerity
   and the acts of refusal they encounter. These obstacles to austerity
   appear more straightforward to activate effectively in Japan's
   coordinated model of capitalism, whilst the UK's liberal market economy
   tends to generate more innovative forms of dissent that (if they are
   sufficiently militant) provide an alternative route towards the
   obstruction of austerity.},

Abstract = {Recent research on parliamentary institutions has demonstrated that
   legislatures featuring strong committees play an important role in
   shaping government policy. However, the impact of the legislators who
   lead these committees - committee chairs - is poorly understood. This
   study provides the first examination of whether the partisan control of
   committee chairs in parliamentary systems has a systematic impact on
   legislative scrutiny. The article argues that committee chairs can, in
   principle, use their significant agenda powers to serve two purposes:
   providing opposition parties with a greater ability to scrutinize
   government policy proposals, and enabling government parties to better
   police one another. Analyzing the legislative histories of 1,100
   government bills in three parliamentary democracies, the study finds
   that control of committee chairs significantly strengthens the ability
   of opposition parties to engage in legislative review. The analysis also
   suggests that government parties' ability to monitor their coalition
   allies does not depend on control of committee chairs.},

Abstract = {First ladies are increasingly acquiring political capital, influencing

   literature has not documented this trend. In this article, we argue that
   the involvement of this group of women in the Executive Power makes it
   necessary to consider them as part of the political elite. To have a
   better understanding of the political influence of the first ladies, we
   propose a typology that generates four categories in which we then
   classify the 88 women who held the position between 1990 and 2016.},

Abstract = {What motivates politicians to engage in legislative activities? In
   multilevel systems politicians may be incentivized by ambitions to
   advance their careers either at the state or federal level. This article
   argues that the design of the electoral institutions influences how
   politicians respond to these incentives. Analyzing a unique dataset of
   both `stated' and `realized' career ambitions of Members of the European
   Parliament (MEPs), it finds that those who seek to move from the
   European to the national (state) level participate less in legislative
   activities than those who plan to stay at the European (federal) level.
   For MEPs who aim to move to the state level, attendance and
   participation in legislative activities is substantively lower among
   legislators from candidate-centered systems. Importantly, the effect of
   career ambitions on legislative participation is stronger in
   candidate-centered systems than in party-centered systems. These
   findings suggest that the responsiveness associated with
   candidate-centered systems comes at the expense of legislative activity.},

Abstract = {In this paper we introductorily explore the Chilean parliamentary
   elections which, together with the presidential ones, took place in
   November 2017. To do so, we have employed the Chilean post-election
   questionnaire of the Comparative National Elections Project (CNEP),
   carried out by the Universidad Diego Portales (UDP). After reviewing the
   circumstances under which the elections took place, we have analysed the
   profiles of the voters de Chile Vamos (CV), La Fuerza de la Mayoria
   (FM), and Frente Amplio (FA), as well as those of non voters. Finally,
   we have estimated a multinomial logit model.},

Abstract = {This article analyses the communication model for accountability based
   on open data portals used by Spanish regional governments. Based on the
   theories of agency, new institutionalism and legitimacy, two behaviour
   patterns are proposed, referred to as ``sincere transparency{''} and
   ``apparent transparency{''}. Although the data sets available have
   increased significantly over the period analysed, the results in
   relation to transparency and accountability remain poor. According to
   the behavioural analysis, four Autonomous Communities implement policies
   that evidently strive for sincere transparency, while seven clearly
   display behaviour of apparent transparency with respect to their open
   data portals.},

Abstract = {Why do states accept refugees? While there are a number of factors that
   influence a state's decision to accept refugees, interstate relations
   play an important yet understudied role in refugee flows. In this paper,
   we build on previous work that has suggested that states with an
   adversarial relationship will be more likely to accept refugees. We
   incorporate existing conceptualization and theory from the rivalry
   literature and extend this logic to state strategy of refugee acceptance
   to provide one of the first empirical evaluations of refugee acceptance
   by states. Specifically, we argue that the issues rivals are contending
   over will change the incentives and disincentives for admitting a
   rival's refugees. We anticipate that rivals disputing over ideology will
   be more likely to accept their rival's refugees than rivals contending
   over other rivalry types. We test and find evidence for our arguments
   using a data set of all directed dyads from 1960 to 2006.},

Abstract = {In this article, we consider the gender gap in political participation
   by analyzing recent survey data about German adolescents.
   Differentiating between institutional, non-institutional, and expressive
   participation, we show that, even in Germany where there is strong
   gender equality, type-specific gender differences persist. Testing for
   resource, socialization, and attitudinal explanations, in multivariate
   regression analyses, we identify socialization in civic forms of
   participation together with the lower confidence of women in their
   personal and political skills as major drivers for the sexual
   differences in political engagement, especially so for institutionalized
   forms of participation.},

Title = {Legal guarantees of privacy in the United Kingdom: (lack of) data
   protection after Brexit},
Journal = {IDP-INTERNET LAW AND POLITICS},
Year = {2019},
Number = {29},
Month = {MAR-SEP},
Abstract = {In British law, the legal references for what we currently identify as
   privacy law are closely related to the protection of citizens' personal
   information. The 1984 Data Protection Act was pioneering data protection
   legislation, and even inspired Directive 95/46/EC, now repealed by
   General Data Protection Regulation 2016/679.
   A second stage of privacy protection in the United Kingdom was
   consolidated with the approval of the 1998 Human Rights Act - in the
   image and likeness of the European Convention on Human Rights -, which
   represented a turning point for the United Kingdom legal system, acting
   as a Bill of Rights in the British constitutional order and which, from
   then on, recognized the right to privacy in its Article 8.
   This issue is currently immersed in a third stage, made up of various
   events, and its future is still to be determined. On the one hand, there
   has been a reduction in the high standard of protection that privacy
   enjoyed in the United Kingdom thanks to the special legislation enacted
   over the last 15 years. On the other hand, Brexit makes it necessary to
   reconsider the privacy protection model, in addition to data protection,
   since when the ``disconnection{''} takes place, the United Kingdom will
   be considered a ``third country{''} and the data flow between it and the
   EU will be ``international transfers{''}.
   Meanwhile, the Data Protection Regulation has come into force. It is
   also directly applicable in the United Kingdom and, until the latter
   leaves the European Union, it obliges British legislation to adapt to
   the new European legislation, as it has done through the 2018 Data
   Protection Act.},

   explores the forces that are driving these developments and discusses
   the problems they pose at both the individual level and the national

Abstract = {For the past 50 years, Bernard Bailyn's The Ideological Origins of the
   American Revolution (1967) and Gordon S. Wood's The Creation of the
   American Republic (1969) have dominated scholarship on the American
   Revolution. Surely, though, it should not be the case today that the
   best books on the Revolution were written in the 1960s. This article
   develops a new methodological approach to the study of history, one that
   I call the ``new moral history.{''} This new approach should be viewed
   as an alternative to the dominant school of historical thought of the
   past 50 years-the so-called ideological approach associated with Bailyn
   and Wood. This article will, first, present and critique the
   ``ideological{''} approach to the study of the Revolution and, second,
   present an outline of the new moral history.},

Abstract = {Between 1975 and 1979 approximately two million men, women, and children
   perished during the Cambodian Genocide. These deaths are attributed to
   specific administrative policies and practices initiated by the senior
   leadership of the Communist Party of Kampuchea (CPK), all of which were
   geared toward the basic objective of increasing agricultural production.
   Many of these deaths resulted from starvation, disease, and exhaustion;
   for others, death resulted from torture, murder, and execution. Within
   this context, women and men both were subject to sexual and gender-based
   violence. Scholars understand that much sexual and gender-based violence
   is directly associated with broader CPK policies toward the family. Less
   attention, however, has addressed the historical context and ideological
   basis of CPK family policy. This paper provides a primary-sourced
   assessment of CPK ideologies of the family and evaluates these within
   the context of CPK economic planning. In so doing, the CPK's ideology of
   revolutionary families is situated within the larger history of family
   policies of communist governments.},

Abstract = {As the strategic importance of cyber security increases, the question of
   how to foster a stable cyber order compatible with the current
   international order is one of the most urgent issues for the
   international community. International cyber governance and strategic
   cyber stability maintenance have thus become two emerging fields in
   international studies. Generally, there are three states of stability in
   cyberspace: stable, delicately stable, and unstable. To promote the
   study of cyber order and enhance rational decision-making, it is
   necessary to adopt a cyclic perspective and fully explore the transition
   of cyberspace among the three states. International cyber governance is
   mainly about managing the cycle of transition of cyberspace and
   designing robust institutions to prevent instability; in these
   institutions, international norms, rules, and law will be made as
   essential guidance for cyber behavior of individual countries. As
   existing human knowledge and theoretical frameworks are the basis of
   studies on cyber strategic stability, it is imperative that effective
   dialogue and joint research among all international stakeholders be
   conducted on issues of their common concern. This helps to shape the
   strategic thinking and policy deliberation of individual countries on
   cyberspace and foster an international order that is conducive to cyber
   strategic stability.},

Journal = {CHINESE POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW},

Volume = {4},
Number = {1},
Pages = {71-85},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {This article contributes to our understanding of the economic logic
   behind social policies in China. Low-rent housing provision is a welfare
   reform with large short-run fiscal implications. With empirical data, I
   show that local policy choices related to these issues are driven
   primarily by economic, not social, considerations. Because land for
   subsidized housing is allocated administratively without the land
   conveyance fees that constitute a major source of local government
   revenue, municipalities more dependent on real estate development have a
   stricter policy on low-rent housing allocation. This research draws on
   fieldwork interviews, content analysis of subsidized housing policies,
   and statistical analyses.},

Abstract = {In recent years, the comparative literature on presidential democracy
   has emphasised the role of coalitional politics in attenuating the
   `perils' facing minority presidents. Yet since the beginning of the
   Third Wave of democratisation in 1974, a surprising number of minority
   presidents have eschewed cabinet coalitions (defined minimally as the
   awarding of at least one portfolio to a party other than the nominal
   party of the president). Unipartisan governments are observed just under
   half of the time. What explains the adoption of single-party cabinets by
   minority presidents? Cross-sectional time-series analysis is employed to
   address this question. Hypotheses are tested that relate to the size and
   distribution of the formateur (presidential) and largest non-formateur
   parties that make up the legislature; the nature of party linkages and
   ideological distance between the president and possible partisan allies;
   and the extent of reactive veto powers held by the president.},

Abstract = {Reflecting the importance of inequality for individuals' lives, the
   implications of labor market inequality for core elements of democracy
   are crucial topics in comparative politics and comparative political
   economy. This article critically reviews the main findings of the
   emerging literature on insider-outsider divides to highlight its
   possible contributions to adjacent fields, in particular the research on
   party politics, the literatures on economic voting, political
   participation, and democratic representation or the study of social
   movements. The conflict between labor market insiders and outsiders
   demonstrates that in today's societies with their diversified risk
   structure and sophisticated welfare states, distributive conflicts are
   about specific social and regulatory policies that have different
   implications for individuals depending on their situation on the labor
   market. By drawing our attention to new divides within the social
   democratic electorate, the insider-outsider literature reveals an
   additional argument why the social democratic parties find it hard to
   mobilize their voters and to win elections. Moreover, the
   insider-outsider literature can help to bring the economic dimension of
   politics back to the study of social movements and to light on the
   relationship between contentious and conventional politics.},

Abstract = {This work takes existing justifications for Australian asylum seeker
   policy at face value. For the past five years now both major parties
   have articulated themselves using the rhetoric of consequentialism,
   arguing that the policies of offshore detention and boat turn backs are
   all about securing the safety of refugees. This work puts the personal
   opinions of each member of parliament aside and examines whether these
   rhetorical justifications are internally consistent. What will become
   clear is that the utilitarian framework used in this debate does not sit
   on terra firma. Rather, its foundations lead to conclusions many might
   find uncomfortable - suggesting that existing theoretical justifications
   for Australian asylum seeker policy are ultimately implausible.},

Abstract = {A recent line of argument insists that replacing democracy with markets
   would improve social decision making due to markets' superior use of
   knowledge. These arguments are flawed by unrealistic assumptions, unfair
   comparisons, and a neglect of the epistemic limits of markets. In
   reality, the epistemic advantages of markets over democracy are
   circumscribed and often illusory. A recognition of markets' epistemic
   limits can, however, provide guidance for designing institutions in ways
   that capture the advantages of both.},

Abstract = {My critics and I agree that ideology is understudied, though I think it
   is the most important factor while they reserve a lesser role for it.
   Hertog's analysis of personality traits is suggestive and valuable,
   though it illuminates a path that leads to the Islamic State's ideology
   (but also to other, perhaps less dangerous places) rather than to its
   violence. Owen correctly identifies the challenge the Islamic State -
   and other forms of revivalist religion - pose for Lockean toleration.
   Fadel's swerve toward an ideology of Arab despotism is a diversion.
   Juergensmeyer rightly notes parallel forms of violence in other
   traditions, and his analysis of the role of social conditions is partly
   shared by ISIS supporters themselves.},

Title = {The Doctrine's Role in the Field of Legal Regulation of Public
   Relations: Problems and Prospects},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF POLITICS AND LAW},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {12},
Number = {5},
Pages = {42-47},
Abstract = {The paper contains a comprehensive analysis of the legal doctrine's role
   in the field of legal regulation of public relations arising in modern
   public law practice. The theoretical and legal features of the legal
   doctrine are revealed. In particular, conclusions are drawn confirming
   the arguments that the legal doctrine allows building clear guidelines
   for the practice of lawmaking, enforcement of the right, and especially
   law enforcement and that the doctrine acts as a scientifically based
   criterion for the legitimacy, rationality, and effectiveness of states.
   Special attention is paid to the historical aspects of the legal
   doctrine development which have significance and influence on the
   formation and development of international and domestic law.
   Particular attention of the authors of the paper is drawn to the place
   and role of legal doctrine in international legal practice. The paper
   notes that the legal doctrine manifestation in the activities of modern
   states can be observed in such functions as prognostic, evaluation,
   regulatory, methodological, world outlook and ideological function. In
   addition, it is noted that the doctrine plays an important role in the
   activities of the UN International Court of Justice, where the doctrines
   of the most qualified specialists are often used in making decisions and
   drawing up advisory opinions; in the development of international
   treaties at international conferences and in international
   organizations, etc. Specific examples of the legal doctrine
   manifestations in the activities of the ECHR are given.},

Abstract = {The world is sleepwalking to a fundamentally new stage in the state of
   international security life in a nuclear and other arms race without any
   restrictions, rules and exchange of military information. The
   denunciation of the Treaty on the elimination of intermediate-range
   missiles (INF) is almost inevitable; START III Is likely to expire in
   2021 without extension; and the next review conference of the Treaty on
   the nonproliferation of nuclear weapons (NPT) in 2020 is almost doomed
   to failure. However, the important experience of the past half-century
   is that the renunciation of treaties in this area has never enhanced the
   security of States, but has always weakened it. During the same time,
   the history of the arms race has given many examples of how the primacy
   in the creation of new weapons subsequently turned out to be a loss, not
   a gain, for the security of one side or another The most important
   lesson is that nuclear deterrence can be a guarantee of peace only when
   combined with the maintenance and expansion of the nuclear anus control
   system and regimes. Today, the first priority is to save the INF Treaty,
   which is still possible. Then the agreement on the extension of the
   START Treaty after 2021 or the urgent start of negotiations on the
   follow-on strategic treaty. After that, measures to strengthen the NPT.
   Only consistent disarmament steps in parallel with positive changes in
   the international political and strategic environment can enhance
   universal security in the coming century.},

   from the Kurdish Conflict},
Journal = {CIVIL WARS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {21},
Number = {3},
Pages = {410-433},
Abstract = {Previous literature explains peace negotiations mainly with
   country-level factors or events related to the countries where the peace
   efforts take place. This closed polity approach contrasts with
   contemporary peace processes where the actors and demands transcend
   nation-state boundaries. This paper challenges this dominant
   understanding in the peace process literature and focuses on the role of
   the rebel groups' transborder kin connections in affecting peace process
   dynamics. By studying the Kurdish Peace Process conducted between the
   Government of Turkey and the PKK, the paper argues that the transborder
   kin connections can both remedy and exacerbate bargaining problems acute
   to peace processes.},

Abstract = {The rapid expansion of soft-power scholarship has made its central
   concept one of the most recognisable terms in the discipline of
   international relations. Yet the increased attention has not spurred the
   resolution of the underlying conceptual issues. Instead, soft-power
   scholarship has drifted into separate streams: concept-driven and
   case-centred studies. The emerging divide impedes the healthy exchange
   that holds the key to a more resonant impact on the field of
   international relations. This article seeks to bridge the gap by
   revealing the common ground where both the unresolved problems and the
   conceptual achievements of the nascent research programme have their
   roots.},

Abstract = {What explains women's inclusion in sub-national cabinet positions? While
   much of the existing literature has examined women's appointments to
   national ministerial cabinets, scholars have not considered women's
   access to provincial level cabinets. To address this gap, we adopt the
   conventional wisdom of a supply and demand approach to evaluate the
   findings at the subnational level. Using an original time series dataset
   from 1992-2016 across all 24 subnational jurisdictions, we find that
   demand factors are more relevant as the probability that women are
   appointed ministers increases when cabinets are larger, when there is a
   female governor, and when the governor belongs to a peronist coalition;
   conversely, a larger legislative contingent of the governor's party
   decreases the probability of appointing women.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this work is to analyze the negotiation of the free trade
   agreement (FTA) signed between Colombia and the US, which has had
   unfavorable effects for Colombia. This issue is addressed in the light
   of the various theories and approaches about international trade and
   economic integration; The accumulated trade deficit of 7,908 million
   dollars presented during the last four years, indicates that the FTA
   affects the national productive apparatus, especially the agricultural
   and industrial sector, results that merit an urgent revision of the
   Treaty.},

Abstract = {In this article we argue that democratic transitions can reverse,
   oscillate, or simply stall. These transitions are exemplified in the
   different types of states we categorize. We construct a model of
   stability vs openness using three dimensions of stateness, namely
   authority, legitimacy, and capacity. With the additional application of
   a six-fold typology of states, we offer a robust analytical framework
   with which to identify and explain changes in state status. Our
   construct of stability and openness leads to a novel development of a
   global conflict damage index, which is built upon conflict risk, but
   considers a state's capacity to deal with conflict. The paper concludes
   with implications for policy and the application of the model to
   conflict prediction when states under go transition.},

Abstract = {During the international financial crisis, Portugal found itself in a
   very difficult and vulnerable socioeconomic situation that has led to an
   increase in social inequalities. This article seeks to understand two
   things: firstly, how much the impacts of the crisis contributed to a
   general perception that people's social position has gone backwards,
   compared to their pre-crisis situations; secondly, whether it is
   possible to link this generalized perception that living conditions have
   gone downhill to an increase in and diversification of collective action
   practices. The authors analyse data from a 2014 survey of 1,500
   residents of the Lisbon Metropolitan Area, which they use to measure how
   far the level of collective action practices has increased and varied in
   accordance with a set of social inequality indicators, such as resource
   and educational inequalities.},

Abstract = {Building on the previous two steps of the context analysis, the aim of
   the present chapter is to go into the details of the crisis emerged in
   2007/2008 as the immediate context of the conflict under observation.
   After a general overview on issues of crisis and crisis management at
   European level (Sect. 6.1), the chapter turns to an in-depth
   investigation of these dynamics in the specific Italian case by focusing
   both on Berlusconi's government and on the first steps of Monti's
   `technical' government (Sect. 6.2). Section 6.3 concludes with a review
   of the main findings relevant for the conflict over the 2012 labour
   market reform.},

Abstract = {Narrative has recently garnered in much attention in the study of
   terrorism but remains poorly understood. This paper offers some initial
   steps towards translating the promise of narrative approaches into a set
   of steps for systematically analysing and understanding terrorists' own
   accounts of their engagement with extremism and militancy. This approach
   rests on the assumption that terrorist authored accounts are more than
   post-hoc rhetorical exercises that aim to persuade others, or even the
   authors themselves, of the righteousness of their political cause or
   otherwise mitigate their responsibility for their involvement in
   violence. In particular, I advance a framework for methodically applying
   narrative approaches to terrorist authored texts, in particular,
   autobiographies. In doing so, I will demonstrate how this approach can
   help better comprehend how individuals involved in militancy understand
   the world, draw upon existing narrative resources and give meaning to
   their actions.},

Abstract = {In this paper I compare Adam Smith and Ayn Rand on their respective
   understandings of capitalism. The paper begins by describing the
   ``myth{''} that surrounds each of these thinker's depiction of
   capitalism followed by a discussion of how accurately those myths accord
   with the texts of these two thinkers. In the case of Smith I argue that
   the myth is somewhat wide of the mark, but in Rand's case much closer.
   It would appear, therefore, that we have two quite different
   understandings of the nature of capitalism. I conclude, however, by
   arguing that we may have only one capitalism with a focus on two
   different aspects of it, which are not necessarily in contradiction
   though those aspects may indeed be in tension. I end by suggesting that
   what may be keeping the tension from breaking apart is entrepreneurship.},

Title = {Blurring European and Islamic values or brightening the good - bad
   Muslim dichotomy? A critical analysis of French Muslim victims of Jihadi
   terror online on twitter and in Le Monde newspaper},
Journal = {CRITICAL STUDIES ON TERRORISM},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {12},
Number = {2},
Pages = {250-272},
Abstract = {Victimhood remains under analysed in the Critical Terrorism Studies
   literature, including the abilities of Muslim victims of terror attacks
   to blurring social boundaries and possibly de-securitise Muslims in
   Europe. This is of specific importance in France, which has not only
   suffered the most terror incidents in Europe in the past five years but
   also is a country where Muslims have been securitised for decades. This
   paper uses a mixed methods approach to analyse twitter data for the
   \#jesuisahmed hashtag used to commemorate the Muslim police officer
   killed in the Charlie Hebdo attacks, and the le monde online memorials
   created in the wake of the Paris and Nice terror attacks. This analysis
   demonstrates French Muslim victimhood attacks blur Muslim social
   boundaries, influences the way that terror events are constructed and
   also present opportunities for the desecuritisation of Muslims in
   France. Muslim victimhood does this through three key themes - Muslims
   being situated as defenders of European values on twitter, Muslim
   biographies demonstrating ``banality{''} in the le monde online memories
   and visual nuances of group identity through victim photos included in
   the le monde memorial. However, these narratives also can re-enforce a
   problematic good/ bad Muslim dichotomy.},

Journal = {POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {70},
Number = {3},
Pages = {224-239},
Abstract = {The literature on vote choice in Taiwan has regularly identified
   ethnoterritorial ideology - preference for independence or unification
   with China - as the main ideological cleavage in Taiwanese party
   politics. This paper contributes to the literature by investigating the
   effects of two more ideological dimensions on vote choice: social and
   economic. Based on data from the Taiwan Election and Democratization
   Study (TEDS) for the 2016 presidential and legislative elections, our
   findings demonstrate that social and (to a lesser degree) economic
   ideologies do have significant influence on vote choice, though
   ethnoterritorial ideology remains the primary ideological determinant.
   Findings were similar for the presidential and legislative elections. On
   this basis, we make a case for increased attention to social and
   economic ideologies in future research on vote choice in Taiwan, and we
   encourage scholars to study Taiwan in comparative perspective with other
   societies that are divided along ethnoterritorial lines.},

Abstract = {By its unconventional nature, the Trump Presidency has shaken
   theAmerican constitutional order and raises unprecedented issues. This
   paper analyzes the relationship between Donald Trump and constitutional
   lawthrough three perspectives. The first is the extent to which, quite
   counterintuitively, Trump's presidency has vivified and increased the
   volumeof constitutional discourse, through the rediscovery of
   forgottenconstitutional provisions and the development of new theories.
   The secondis the extent to which Donald Trump is actually violating
   constitutional law. Lastly, the paper analyzes the ways in which Donald
   Trump has shaped constitutional law, primarily through his judicial
   nominations.},

Abstract = {This paper studies the Constitutional Reform Act published in the 2005
   in United Kingdom. This important reform means a deep constitutional
   change in an unwritten constitution model. The first part shows,
   critically, the old model explaining how the judges were appointed. The
   second part analyses the new model in which the most relevant role is
   played by the judicial Appointments Commission, this new public body
   designed as recommendation body appoints the judiciary in United Kingdom
   and it's being representative of the deepest change amid the classical
   concept of Judicial independence. More than ten years before the JAC's

Abstract = {This article traces the evolution of representative claim-making by the
   Chinese Communist Party (CCP) since the proclamation of the People's
   Republic of China in 1949 up to the present day. Based on the analysis
   of official political discourses on the mass line, the Three Represents
   and more recent ongoing discourses on digitalization, we demonstrate the
   change and continuity of claim-making by the CCP. We show that while
   representative claim-making has undergone a significant transformation
   from the CCP as the representative of the working class to the sole
   representative of the Chinese people and nation, the CCP has been
   consistent throughout decades in maintaining its hegemony over
   representative claim-making.},

Abstract = {China's experimentation with its financial markets and institutions is
   centered around a primary mission of channeling capital to state-owned
   enterprises and, to a lesser extent, the growing private sector. Future
   growth rates in value and the related concept of GDP are dependent, in
   part, on the success of financial-sector restructuring. Economic
   development strategies and the outcomes of such strategies are never
   determined solely by local conditions but are overdetermined by changing
   global conditions. The nexus connecting local conditions to global
   conditions is partly made of financial relationships by which global
   capital flows are directed toward certain corporate structures,
   providing the potential for intensified exploitation, expanded value
   creation, and sustainable rates of national growth. It is imperative
   that those deploying Marxian and/or other heterodox tools to uncover
   existing relationships shaping the ``nature{''} of future social
   formations integrate financial processes and networks with global
   corporate and political relationships.},

Abstract = {The adoption of a constructive vote of no confidence in Spain for the
   first time since the adoption of the Spanish 1978 Constitution has led
   to the change of political sign of the Government in the middle of the
   XII legislature or term, characterised by the fragmentation of the
   Congress of Deputies which has replaced the former nearly two-party
   system. The essay analyses the consequences of this change on the
   functioning and functions of Parliament and on the instability of a
   Government that has been in power for only nine months, taking stock of
   the period extending from the vote of no confidence to dissolution of
   Parliament, comparing it with the equally difficult previous period and
   with other terms, to ultimately show how the end of the two-party system
   has influenced Government-Parliament relations in the Spanish
   parliamentary political system.},

Abstract = {Citizens' initiative for referendum is the power attributed to a number
   of citizens or to a percentage of them to trigger a referendum
   concerning a political question of general interest or a legislative
   text, thus giving the electorate the decision regarding its relevance,
   approval or repeal. Unlike initiatives for referendum attributed to
   sub-central entities in some composite states and initiatives granted to
   parliamentary minorities, citizens' initiative for referendum is
   generally acknowledged in comparative law. Where introduced, citizens'
   initiative for referendum is used to tackle the passivity or lack of
   receptiveness of legislators and to promote the adoption of
   constitutional or legislative reforms; it can also be used to control
   and correct the result of parliamentary processes involved in the
   formation of the general will. In this study, we will analyse the
   comparative regulation and practice of citizens' initiatives whose
   purpose is the holding of propositional referendums concerning rules and
   decisions of national importance, the ratification of voted but not
   enacted laws and the repeal of laws in force. We will also study the
   attempts to regulate citizens' initiatives in Spain, paying special
   attention to the proposal for constitutional reform approved by the
   General Board of the Principality of Asturias, which is still pending
   consideration.},

Abstract = {Democracy and the welfare state are two of the most extensively studied
   concepts and themes in the field of comparative politics. Debate about
   how to best measure the two concepts has failed to contemplate the
   extent to which political and social rights are uniformly present across
   distinct regions of the national territory, despite the presence of
   substantial subnational research that underscores wide variation inside
   countries. We argue that this omission hampers our understanding of the
   two phenomena and we propose a new measure of democracy and healthcare
   universalism, which we call the Adjusted Measures of Democracy and
   Welfare Universalism. The new measures integrate territorial inequality
   into existing national-level indicators, providing a more accurate
   picture of country performance and opening the door to new, multi-level
   theory building.},

Abstract = {This article examines the continuing importance of the left-right
   dimension for voting behavior in Western Europe. We test the extent to
   which economic internationalization may affect the capacity of this
   dimension to structure party preferences. We explore two dimensions of
   internationalization, long-term openness and short-term changes,
   assessing, respectively, the impact of international trade and foreign
   investments on voters' preference formation. To study the influence of
   changing context, we use four waves of the European Election Study
   (1999, 2004, 2009, and 2014). We show that openness to international
   economic exchanges tends to weaken the left-right cleavage. At the same
   time, long-term economic openness appears to soften the impact of
   short-term shocks for the relevance of left-right politics.},

Abstract = {After the Anfal and Halabja massacres took place inside Kurdistan, Iraq,
   there was no place for immediate political reaction. For many years,
   culture took on the role of soothing the tremendous pain everybody was
   holding while hiding in fear of the Ba'ath regime. Songs were the first
   medium to represent the tragedy, as images were heavily controlled
   inside Iraq. Songs were distributed secretly at first, but later the
   government turned a blind eye to the distribution of many of the songs
   that were forbidden. After the Kurdish uprising of 1991, a political
   priority was the opening of the first Kurdish television station. From
   the very beginning, its programs featured images of both tragedies,
   which in turn became a permanent part of the station's broadcasts. These
   images were so impactful that they were instrumental in the departure of
   the Saddam regime. Although these images shocked society, they lost
   their power and became routine from their constant repetition, enforcing
   public forgetfulness and deeply affecting the entire culture.},

Abstract = {This article contributes to the analysis of the relationship between
   reproductive technologies and religions. This allows a debate on the
   meanings of reproduction, sexuality, the family and the cultural
   significances about human life. We will work on three levels:
   regulations and legal discourses, religious experts and religious users
   of reproductive technologies. As methods, biographical interviews with
   users and documentary analysis of legislation, resolutions and judicial
   decisions and literature and courses on fertility in religious spaces
   are used. With the extension of the use of the reproductive technologies
   in Argentina, the Catholic religious experts propose an alternative that
   adapts to theological doctrine. However, women who consider themselves
   Catholic, decide to use the technologies by adapting the doctrine to
   their own convictions. This occurs within the framework of a process of
   individuation and autonomy and a minor influence of religious
   institutions in the private life of people, as indicated by the main
   social studies on religion.},

Abstract = {The paper deals with the presentation of European Union in Slovak
   pro-Kremlin media. The main objective is to identify the basic
   discourses about the European Union present in the migration news in
   Slovak pro-Kremlin media. As a problem-solving method of research a
   qualitative discourse analysis is selected. This method allows us to
   investigate patterns, which create social reality through discourse. The
   Theory of discourse by Ernesto Laclau and Chantal Mouffe makes our basic
   theoretical background. They deal with the battle of discourses for
   hegemony in the certain discursive field. Pro-Kremlin media can be
   considered as a challenge to standard media discourses, which try to
   create a hegemony of discourses that suits Russia. At the same time, the
   existence of pro-Kremlin media can be also considered as a part of so
   called hybrid warfare that Russia is waging (not only) against
   individual countries of the European Union to achieve its goals. The
   migration is an ideal opportunity for politics of Russia and people who
   support it to gain an advantage in this hybrid warfare, where not only
   media systematically uses propaganda.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this research is to improve understanding of how
   democratized video technology is changing the market for video
   communication during political campaigns. The same content analysis
   methodology was applied to United States senate campaign YouTube videos
   during both the 2006 election when YouTube first made its mark on
   politics and the 2016 election a decade later. The evidence does not
   support the theory that democratized video technology will produce new
   winners communicating in new ways about political campaigns. The 2016
   election was marked by a slight increase in the proportion of repurposed
   television ads compared to the 2006 election. Over the course of its
   first decade, the market for political campaign communication on YouTube
   has increasingly struggled to attract investors of creative capital.},

Title = {ENGLISH CONCEPT OF FREEDOM: EXPERIENCE OF DECONSTRUCTION},
Journal = {POLITEIA-JOURNAL OF POLITICAL THEORY POLITICAL PHILOSOPHY AND SOCIOLOGY
   OF POLITICS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {93},
Number = {2},
Pages = {48-65},
Abstract = {The article attempts to deconstruct the English concept of freedom.
   Having documented the multi-layered structure of this concept, which can
   be represented as a set of shells that consistently embrace the nuclear
   concept, the author traces the history of the formation of its key
   components, such as Anglicanism, individualism, property, trade, and
   etatism. It took over one hundred years to combine all these components
   into the concept of freedom, after which it entered the stage of the
   applied implementation. According to the author, it was the English
   concept of freedom that formed the basis of the British Empire, as well
   as the international legal order that developed in the 19th century, and
   the British national character.
   It is noteworthy that the British Empire was built on formally
   anti-imperial value foundations. It is primarily about the concept of
   free trade that allowed England to fully utilize the advantages of
   possessing the most developed industry in the world at that time.
   Although in theory free trade provides freedom to everyone, in practice
   England was the only beneficiary because free trade reduced many
   politically motivated costs for England. The analysis conducted by the
   author reveals that in fact the liberal free-trade theory contains class
   approach, which was used to justify the right of the possessing class to
   dominance. The world order, for its part, was based on the
   ``metaphysical essence of the world market{''}, which de facto
   structured the international legal space of the 19th and 20th centuries.},

Pages = {1-20},
Abstract = {Media coverage of politics is widely considered essential to political
   participation. However, studies on local elections do not yet generally
   take the effect of the media environment into account. This article
   posits that the territorial fit between newspaper markets and municipal
   boundaries makes citizens' exposure to locally relevant news more
   likely. We use fine-grained data on newspaper readership in order to
   assess the effect of the territorial structure of the newspaper market
   on turnout in municipal elections in Switzerland. The analysis shows
   that newspaper audience in a municipality and the congruence of
   newspaper markets with municipal territories both have substantial
   positive effects on levels of turnout in municipal elections. The
   findings suggest that future research on local political behavior should
   better acknowledge the influence of the media environment - which can be
   adequately measured by newspaper audience and congruence. Implications
   are that current structural changes in the media system bear threats to
   local democracy via the territorial upscaling of media markets.},

Abstract = {Comparing conflicts intentionally and consciously ascribes meaning to a
   political subject. When Afghanistan is linked to Vietnam, or its
   democratic development to Switzerland, normative scales are introduced
   to order discursive practice. Discovering meaning and making meaning is
   what Simone de Beauvoir (1947) views as existential condition of human
   beings: political acts are measured against existing norms of the
   acceptable. In conjunction with Mannheim's sociology of knowledge
   (2015), this article explains the social situatedness of crisis
   knowledge and the norms enshrined therein. In conflict comparisons,
   reservoirs of knowledge are being connected and repertoires of action
   prescribed. Based on these theoretical approaches, the article unpacks
   the power relations and political intentions at work in these
   comparisons.},

Abstract = {Since 9/11, scholarly work has demonstrated that Muslim Americans are
   viewed unfavorably, but existing measures lack enough contextual
   specificity to capture the unique experiences and situation of Muslims
   in the United States. Given the central role that Muslims and the war on
   terror played in the 2016 presidential campaign and election, we fill
   this void by introducing a new measure that focuses on Muslim Americans,
   specifically, and then examine its role in explaining presidential vote
   choice in 2016. Across five distinct surveys fielded on convenience and
   nationally representative samples from May 2016 to June 2017, we find
   that anti-Muslim American sentiment is a strong and significant
   predictor of supporting Trump, even when controlling for a whole host of
   factors. Our measure of Muslim American sentiment also more strongly and
   consistently predicts support for Trump, relative to previous measures
   of anti-Muslim sentiment.},

Journal = {REVISTA ANDINA DE ESTUDIOS POLITICOS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {9},

Pages = {122-144},
Abstract = {In 1960 the peasant community of Rancas (Pasco, Peru), building on
   previous communal agreements, recovered its lands that previously owned
   by the Cerro de Pasco Corporation. This action, in which the entire
   community participated, led to an act of harsh repression known as the
   ``Massacre of Huayllacancha{''}. The massacre marked a watershed in the
   history of peasant land struggle, but substantially gave room for
   underpinning the Peruvian Agrarian Reform. In this context, I look for
   the conditions in which ranqueria women found themselves at the time,
   the underlying gender relations, and their participation in the land
   dispute. These reflections are guided by the following question: what
   were the ranqueria women' daily life and community and family relations
   during the period of land retaking? By examining aspects of private life
   in the community, I will better understand the situation of peasant
   women in the region, as well as the power dynamics that shaped the
   struggle in the private and public arenas.},

Journal = {POLITICS AND GOVERNANCE},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {7},
Number = {2},
Pages = {242-267},
Abstract = {Voting decisions in high-stakes referendums can have crucial
   consequences for the fate of national governments and the implementation
   of major reforms. Prior studies have found that referendum campaigns can
   substantially influence their outcomes. Yet few have taken into account
   the fact that the effect of campaign arguments depends on a number of
   factors, including individual knowledge levels and the degree of
   uncertainty surrounding the alternatives on the ballot. In this study we
   investigate how political knowledge and campaign arguments stressing
   risks and opportunities influenced vote choice in Colombia's 2016 peace
   referendum. Drawing on a nationally representative survey (Study 1) and
   an original experiment (Study 2), we find that stressing the
   opportunities that the peace deal could bring to the country, rather
   than the risks associated with failing to conclude it, increased the
   probability that Colombians voted Yes in the referendum. While highly
   knowledgeable voters were more likely to support the deal than those
   with little knowledge, we find that pro-referendum opportunity arguments
   reduced the gap between these two groups by increasing the likelihood of
   a Yes vote among those with little knowledge. These findings contribute
   to research on voting behavior and campaign effects in direct
   democracies. Additionally, by exploring the crucial issue of attitudes
   towards peace, our findings also have important implications for
   countries trying to secure citizens' approval of high-stakes issues-such
   as negotiating the end of decades of war-through democratic instruments.},

Abstract = {This article reports black and Asian descriptive representation in
   London's elected local government. In both absolute and relative terms,
   the levels of descriptive representation are higher than previously, and
   London's Asian population is now represented proportionately, although
   black Londoners remain under-represented. Such aggregate levels of
   representation, however, mask considerable disparities between the two
   groups in many instances. The same is true of gender representation,
   with overall figures hiding the fact that Asian men are over-represented
   (and white women broadly proportionately represented) while black men
   are the least represented category analysed.},

Abstract = {Modern Dispute resolution mechanisms have been positively influenced by
   the advent of the internet. Through Online Dispute Resolution (ODR),
   several ADR mechanisms have been adapted to for small claims, online and
   cross-border financial transactions. Existing ODR mechanisms seem to
   ignore certain underpinnings of Islamic jurisprudence in the
   development. This has made dispute resolution automation unattractive to
   shariah complaint sectors. Therefore, this paper seeks to examine the
   relevance of ODR under Islamic jurisprudence. The paper adopts a
   doctrinal method to expound principles of Islamic jurisprudence
   (usul-ul-figh) which supports new ways of resolving disputes using the
   internet. The study finds that existing Islamic law ethos such as: sulh,
   maslahah, sad-ul-dhariah among others are in agreement with the modern
   realities of online dispute resolution.},

Title = {BETWEEN SCYLLA OF NATIONALIZATION AND CHARYBDIS OF REGIONALIZATION:
   FEATURES OF DEVELOPMENT OF PARTY SYSTEM OF UKRAINE},
Journal = {POLITEIA-JOURNAL OF POLITICAL THEORY POLITICAL PHILOSOPHY AND SOCIOLOGY

Abstract = {The article analyzes the process of consolidation of the party system of
   Ukraine on the basis of the results of the 1994-2019 parliamentary
   elections. Methodologically, the article is based on the theory of
   nationalization of party systems. To measure the level of
   nationalization, the author employs indices of nationalization of
   political parties and party systems developed by M.Jones and
   S.Mainwaring, as well as the index of territorial coverage proposed by
   D.Caramani. Identification of typical and deviant electoral regions is
   carried out by calculating the Euclidean distance.
   The research study conducted by the author demonstrates that the
   development of the party system of Ukraine witnesses two clear trends -
   towards nationalization and regionalization. In certain time periods,
   one trend starts dominating the scene, which depends on the combined
   influence of a number of factors, such as the features of the
   post-communist transition, electoral system, form of government,
   political regime etc.
   The author shows that the models of the electoral behavior of the
   population of Ukraine, formed during the constituent elections, are
   inherently regional. The exception is the parliamentary elections of
   2014 and 2019, when the nationalization index was quite high. The author
   explains this change by the fact that Donbass and Crimea - the regions
   that were crucial for many parties - disappeared from the electoral map
   of Ukraine, as well as by the relatively low voter turnout in southern
   and eastern Ukraine. According to him, the increased electoral
   homogeneity observed during these elections does not guarantee an
   increase in the level of nationalization of the country's party system.
   A high level of volatility coupled with relatively low values of both
   the nationalization index and the index of an effective number of
   parties indicates that, despite significant changes in the actor
   structure of the party space, the heterogeneity (regionality) of party
   preferences of the Ukrainian citizens remains very important.},

Abstract = {Do democratic dyads handle their disputes more peacefully than
   non-democratic dyads, or have they cleared the most contentious issues
   (that is, unsettled borders) off their foreign policy agenda before
   becoming democratic? This study compares the conflicting answers of the
   democratic peace and the territorial peace and examines the empirical
   record to see which is more accurate. It finds that almost all
   contiguous dyads settle their borders before they become joint
   democracies. Furthermore, the majority of non-contiguous dyad members
   also settle their borders with all neighboring states before their
   non-contiguous dyad becomes jointly democratic. Such findings are
   consistent with the theoretical expectations of the territorial peace,
   rather than the democratic peace. They also weaken a core argument of
   the democratic peace, for this analysis finds that one reason democratic
   dyads may handle their disputes more peacefully than non-democratic
   dyads is not because of their institutions or norms, but rather because
   they have dispensed with the disputes most likely to involve the use of
   military force prior to becoming democratic.},

Abstract = {It is investigated that socialization is a necessary condition for the
   functioning of society. It is learned that political socialization is
   the most effective factor in maintaining the political system, its
   strengthening and stabilization. The process of political socialization,
   political institutions, reproduction and continuity of the most
   important political values are described. It was found that due to the
   political socialization man becomes not only the individual but also a
   citizen of the state. The interrelation of functioning democratic
   institutions and the transformation of political culture in the state
   are showed. It is analyzed that the role of political cultural factors
   in the evolutionary processes of government learn under a form of
   democratization of society today.},

Journal = {POLIS-POLITICHESKIYE ISSLEDOVANIYA},
Year = {2019},
Number = {2},
Pages = {161-172},
Abstract = {This piece is a reaction to the series of articles on the state of IR
   discipline published in the previous issues of this journal. The authors
   emphasise the problems of IR theory in Russia (insufficient attention to
   the current IR trends, ideologization of theories and methods, which
   leads to numerous difficulties of integration of the Russian academic
   community into the world academic discussion). Particular attention is
   paid to the specificity of the formation of new theoretical approaches
   where interdisciplinary character is the key underlying principle.
   Ignoring it would seriously limit the capabilities and depth of Russian
   analytics. To illustrate these points, the article addresses the
   analysis of the EU Global Strategy - 2016 with `resilience' as the key
   category. The article demonstrates inevitability of addressing theory
   for the sake of analysis of this document as well as for the study of
   EU-Russian relations at large. The first part of the article examines
   the specificity of how IR theory is addressed by the Russian academic
   community. The second part is devoted to the main problems of the
   contemporary discussion on the essence of IR. The third part gives an
   illustration of how theoretical approaches can be used to analyse one
   specific document, which is important for EU-Russian relations.},

   jointly developed this approach as a pioneering concept for a just peace
   in the Middle East. Today, the EU's Middle East policy is on the verge
   of becoming irrelevant. Furthermore, the member states are finding it
   increasingly difficult to agree on a common position. However, those
   that criticise the continued adherence to the two-state solution offer
   no alternative concepts for peace in the Middle East. The EU would
   therefore be wise, with its new concept of resilience, not throw what is
   regarded as being the right approach overboard.},

Abstract = {The article deals with the actual aspects of regional security in the
   Arctic, in the context of Russian-Chinese interaction and cooperation in
   the region. Strategic importance of the Arctic increases in global
   geo-economics and geopolitics steadily, but. consistently. Due to the
   climate changes, prospects of enhanced access to rich mineral resources
   in the region, as well as possible opening of the North West Passage and
   development of the Northern Sea Route, have resulted in increased
   military presence in the Arctic of a number of States.
   Modernization of the Russian military potential in the Arctic serves to
   strengthen border guard potential and to protect Russian Arctic
   territories (which become more accessible), rather than to project
   Russia's power outside the region. Unlike Russia as an Arctic State,
   China, which positions itself as a `Near-Arctic State' with certain
   interests in the region, nowadays is not being involved in any kind of
   military activities in the Arctic. However, China does not exclude the
   possibility of militarization of the Arctic, especially if China itself
   will be more actively involved in exploitation of Arctic resources.
   To avoid mutual misunderstanding or mistrust on regional security policy
   issues, Arctic States should clarify to each other their military
   doctrines and military operation rules, as well as agree on military
   transparency and confidence-building measures on bilateral and
   multilateral levels. Near-Arctic States, including China, could join
   these measures as well. Russian-Chinese cooperation in the Arctic could
   be extended to the military sphere, especially in case of common or
   similar security challenges and threats in the region.},

Abstract = {Traditional theories of collective action would predict that, after a
   triggering event, the trajectory of a wave of protest is determined by
   the institutionalisation-radicalisation tandem. Based on the Spanish
   cycle of anti-austerity and against the political status quo protest in
   the shadow of the Great Recession, this article contends with this
   approach, as a clear trend towards radicalisation is never observed as
   the cycle unfolds. An alternative interpretative framework is developed
   to understand protest trajectories when collaborative
   inter-organisational strategies prevail. The eventful 15M campaign
   triggered in 2011 represents the most remarkable turning point in the
   Spanish socio-political mobilisation scene in recent years and had a
   transformative capacity over subsequent protest endeavours.
   Specifically, after the 15M campaign, the combination of downward scale
   shift and coalition building shaped the trajectory of mobilisation, and
   allowed for the peak of protest to persist until late 2013, when
   institutionalisation took over. Data from an original Protest Event
   Analysis dataset are used to illustrate the main arguments.},

   possibilities of participation in the social system, for this reason,
   some discussions waged by jurists of the Weimar Republic. Some
   conceptions pointed to a possibility of reaching socialism through
   Social Law and State, other ways of doing capitalism, while other
   theories aimed, on the contrary, to emphasize precisely the
   impossibility of radically moving reality by making use of the legal
   instruments of the time. This mosaic of rich theories of the state, of
   politics and of the constitution will serve to criticize social
   constitutionalism and to point out the possibilities in subscribers and

Abstract = {With only a handful of exceptions, most research examining the impact of
   constituency preferences on committee assignments in legislatures
   outside the USA is comprised of single-case studies. This raises the
   question whether the impact of constituency preferences on committee
   assignments seen in previous studies apply cross-nationally. Focusing on
   committees whose remit includes agricultural affairs-because such
   committees may be particularly sensitive to constituents'
   particularistic interests-this study examines the impact of constituency
   preferences on committee assignments in 29 legislatures. The analysis
   suggests that constituency preferences may impact committee assignments
   in legislatures around the world, and that this effect varies to only a
   limited extent according to differences in electoral systems, committee
   organisation and the partisan consequences of personal vote-seeking.},

Abstract = {Offering amendments represents an important tool for individual members
   to engage in behaviors that help them pursue reelection, like
   position-taking and credit claiming. When the House leadership limits
   the opportunities for rank-and-file members to offer amendments on most
   measures debated on the floor but leaves spending bills relatively open
   to amendment, we might expect that individual members will respond by
   redirecting their amendments to the appropriations process. In this
   article, I explore whether members use these opportunities to pursue
   personal goals and to enhance their party's collective reputation.},

   Democracy in Spain},
Journal = {POLITICS AND GOVERNANCE},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {7},
Number = {2},
Pages = {187-197},
Abstract = {The declining trust in the representative institutions of liberal
   democracy after the 2008 economic crisis has generated a rise in appeals
   to substitute the representative model in favor of a participatory
   democracy. Although political representation has been in crisis since
   its very inception, for the first time the new technologies of
   communication based in the Web 2.0, smartphones and social media make
   replacing the elites' intermediation in decision-making a real
   possibility. Aiming to critically address this issue, the article uses a
   political theory framework to analyze the role of political
   participation within the main models of democracy as a first step from
   where to question the viability and convenience of participatory
   democracy nowadays. Then, the article focuses on the case of Podemos in
   Spain, a left-wing populist party that advocates for instruments like
   referendums and citizen initiatives as a solution for the Spanish
   political crisis. Here, the article highlights the shortcomings of
   Podemos's participatory proposal, mainly focused on aggregating
   predetermined positions instead of addressing the dynamics that
   undermine the quality of political debate. Finally, we conclude that
   dealing with the citizens' political disaffection requires institutional
   innovations designed to increase the deliberative quality of our
   representative democracies.},

Title = {The background of the material successes of international migration: the
   case of mexiquense migrants},
Journal = {CIMEXUS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {14},
Number = {1},
Pages = {81-102},
Month = {JAN-JUN},
Abstract = {Studies on return migration often show the successes or failures of
   migrants, but do not combine them with the frictions and contradictions
   that imply the material and immaterial achievements they obtained.
   However, during the migration several obstacles are faced, that although
   migrants can overcome and even take some advantage of them, it is
   evident that they bring with them various consequences (illnesses,
   fractures, religiosity, marital separation, death experiences). These
   non-visible events constitute the background of different successes
   (owning a house, speaking another language, having business, bringing
   work knowledge), this is explored in this work. To this aim, a
   non-random sample of migrants is taken as a reference in the Estado de
   Mexico and the analysis is based on their own testimonies.},

Abstract = {The topical focus of research on terrorism has frequently been critiqued
   for being too narrow, too event-driven and too strongly tied to
   governments' counterterrorism policies. This article uses keyword
   analysis to assess the degree to which these issues remain present in
   the literature on terrorism as represented by the 3.442 articles
   published between 2007 and 2016 in nine of the field's leading academic
   journals. Several fluctuations notwithstanding, research on terrorism
   has retained a strong focus on al-Qaeda, jihadist terrorism more
   generally, and the geographic areas most strongly associated with this
   type of terrorist violence. Results also indicate that the field remains
   event-driven and consistently underemphasizes state terrorism as well as
   non-jihadist terrorism, such as that perpetrated by right-wing
   extremists.},

   documentary research strategy supported by analytical method and

   treaty committed by a international public law subject constitutes a
   human rights degressivity mechanism of citizens, because always human
   rights will be above States rights. Human rights do not have borders and
   State can not hide behind sovereignty principle State in order to reduce

Abstract = {This article is a contribution to the debate on whether or not to
   abolish provincial councils. The work exposes the origin and evolution
   of the provincial regime in Spain, since 1812, and then examines the
   current constitutional framework and its legislative development. With
   these premises is analyzed the main argument to justify the maintenance
   of provincial councils: municipal minifundismo, and is confronted with
   the praxis of recent years. In this context, intermunicipality is
   defended as the most logical and coherent response (also in comparative
   law) to an excessively fragmented municipal map and the suppression of
   provincial councils is proposed.},

Title = {Remembering the Past in Diasporic Spaces: Kurdish Reflections on
   Genocide Memorialization for Anfal},
Journal = {GENOCIDE STUDIES INTERNATIONAL},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {13},
Number = {1, SI},
Pages = {10-33},
Abstract = {Diasporas engage in a variety of practices and activities to commemorate
   past massacres and genocides that might have led to the formation of the
   diaspora in the first place. In this process, certain massacres can be
   constructed as the ``chosen trauma{''} and consequently become a central
   element in commemoration practices and identity formation. In this
   paper, we discuss genocide memorialization in the context of the Iraqi
   Kurdish diaspora in Europe. We focus specifically on genocide
   memorialization of the Anfal Campaign (1986-1989) that was orchestrated
   by Saddam Hussein's regime against the Kurdish population in Northern
   Iraq. We examine how collective remembering for Anfal takes place in the
   diasporic space, what diasporic articulations and representations of
   Anfal as the chosen trauma are produced in commemoration practices, and
   how these genocide memorialization processes differ from those in the
   homeland context. The article asks the following questions: How do
   Kurdish diaspora communities in Europe commemorate Anfal? How do
   diaspora narratives relate to collective memory and identity? What
   spatial and generational dynamics are at play in these processes?},

Abstract = {The Recall of MPs Act 2015 allows constituents to petition for their MP
   to be unseated. A petition of recall is opened, for six weeks, if an MP
   has received a custodial sentence or been suspended from the House of
   Commons for ten or more sitting days. Should 10 per cent of constituents
   sign the petition, a by-election is required, which the deposed MP has
   the right to contest. The first test of the Act came in 2018, when Ian
   Paisley, MP for North Antrim, was suspended from the Commons for thirty
   days. This article examines how the Act was implemented and assesses
   whether procedural oddities played any part in the petition failing to
   attract sufficient signatures to trigger a by-election.},

Abstract = {This article focuses on the questions left open by the impossibility of
   a ``natural{''} transfer of forces from individuals to the state. In
   this sense, it shows how Hobbesian discourse is articulated on at least
   two levels: a dominant level, which sees force or power as a consequence
   of law, and a more withdrawn, almost removed level, which sees law as a
   consequence of force or power. Through this path, it aims to clarify in
   what sense and within what limits democracy can represent, if not the

Title = {``It is a motherhood that must be reinvented{''}: lesbian mothers,
   assisted reproduction techniques and challenges they face},
Journal = {POLITICA Y SOCIEDAD},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {56},
Number = {2},
Pages = {361-380},
Abstract = {This research analyses how lesbian couples, who have become mothers by
   using assisted reproductive techniques (ART), redefine or invent it in
   several aspects. In the first part, we analyse the impact of the legal
   advances (the changes in the Civil Code that allowed same sex couples to
   get married in 2005, and the Assisted reproduction law of 2006), and the
   impasses and setbacks in the applications of these laws. After that, we
   show the questioning of biology as the fundamental bond to establish
   kinship in these families, and the almost mandatory ``coming out{''}
   that lesbian motherhood means for these couples. The empirical analysis
   is based on Falguera's doctoral thesis (2016), which carried out
   forty-three in depth interviews in the province of Barcelona with
   lesbians who were mothers through ART in private clinics. The article
   concludes with some reflections about how their dilemmas, decisions and
   strategies challenge many of the assumptions of Sociology and
   Anthropology of the family in relation to filiation and kinship, among
   other issues, while shedding light on less known aspects which,
   nonetheless, are relevant both socially and academically speaking.},

Title = {China's international socialization of Caribbean state-society
   complexes: Trinidad and Tobago as a case study},
Journal = {ASIAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {27},
Number = {2},
Pages = {157-176},
Abstract = {Using the case study of Trinidad and Tobago, this article analyzes the
   process of reciprocal international socialization that allows Beijing to
   construct a cognitive and normative space conducive to a new regional
   order in the Caribbean which should be politically friendly,
   economically profitable, and socially open to its government, companies,
   and citizens. We argue that there has been a shift in the identity of
   Trinidad's state-society complex due to the influence of China's very
   visible political, economic, and social conditionalities. Their impact
   on political elites (which is reflected in government discourse and
   actions) and on the society at large (as shown by interviews with 30
   Trinidadian nationals) is analyzed in order to show that Type I, `role
   playing' socialization has been reached. However, frustration within
   Trinidad's society with the domestic effects of China's economic and
   social conditionalities clearly limits the potential for the evolution
   toward the more advanced Type II socialization exemplified, in the same
   region, by the Soviet-Cuban relationship. This suggests that, at least
   in the near future, key features of the Chinese approach incompatible
   with its self-proclaimed win-win nature will prevent Beijing from
   upgrading its status to that of a decisive socializer in the Caribbean.},

Abstract = {Nations are viewed as metaphorical families having common ancestors.
   Czechs, for example, share the legend about a forefather ech who brought
   his people into Czechia. Analysing the Czech ISSP 2013 data we examine
   how the importance of having Czech descent depends on Christian
   denomination, openness towards immigration, perceived commonality with
   `significant Others', foreign-born parents, and socio-demographics.
   Results of the analysis suggest that Czech ancestry is less important
   part of national identity among younger cohorts, people living in big
   cities and towns, descendants of foreign-born parents, and people who
   are in favour of immigration from poor countries outside the EU.},

Title = {PROSPECTS, NEEDS AND PITFALLS OF CONSTITUTIONALIZATION OF THE EU AND THE
   EAEU},
Journal = {POLIS-POLITICHESKIYE ISSLEDOVANIYA},
Year = {2019},
Number = {4},
Pages = {89-103},
Abstract = {Sooner or later all integration associations using mechanisms of
   supranational legal regulation, decision-making process and execution
   face problems of constitutionalization. They need to build a coherent
   and consistent system of relations between supranational,
   intergovernmental and national authorities, between supranational and
   national sources of law. They need to overcome the obstacles that lie in
   the way of building a common economic space, to remove the
   contradictions caused by the need to ensure the four basic freedoms of
   the common market. Constitutionalization provides both the theoretical
   basis and the necessary tools. The European Union first encountered this
   problem. He followed the path of hierarchization of relations and law.
   The European Union has formed a separate legal system giving the
   internal legal order of association a set of qualitative characteristics
   that are considered to be classical to some extent. Priority attention
   was given to the development of fundamental values that are now of a
   high importance for the EU and to the gradual promotion of the
   legislative process to the forefront of such a supranational body as the
   European Parliament. The experience gained by the EU in this area can be
   of great benefit to the Eurasian Economic Union that is also formed
   according to the patterns of supranational institutional and legal
   construction. This experience is of particular importance in view of the
   crisis experienced by the EU since only the EU was able to develop
   institutional and legal solutions that can work within the framework of
   the integration association and which should be discarded. The article
   shows that the EAEU differs from the EU in a wide range of parameters,
   its goals and principles of functioning. It argues that the recipes of
   constitutionalization in the form they were used by the EU it is not
   suitable for the EAEU. At the same time the technical tools of
   constitutionalization developed by the EU may be suitable for the EAEU
   to solve the current tasks of self-assertion, consolidation and
   positioning in the international arena.},

Abstract = {Recently, scholars have shown a growing interest in radical left parties
   (RLPs). In terms of electoral success, the rise of the KPo Graz, the
   Communist Party in Austria's second biggest city, represents perhaps the
   most counterintuitive case in Western Europe. Adding to previous
   studies, the rise of the KPo Graz contradicts many of the claims made
   and patterns found about the conditions for the electoral success of
   RLPs. While the national KPo was voted out of parliament in 1959, the
   Graz branch has been a member of local government since 1998. Since
   then, the party has managed to gain 20 per cent of the vote in three out
   of four elections. In 2017, the KPo defended its place as the second
   largest party in local legislature and stayed ahead of the radical right
   FPo, on the rise at the national level. In stark contrast to the
   Communists' current strength, however, they did not gain even 2 per cent
   of the vote in 1983. This analysis shows how the party has managed to
   own' the issue of housing and to exploit local political opportunities
   in order to be electorally successful. The findings point to the
   importance of agency and the subnational level for RLPs, and highlight
   more general questions in the study of this party family.},

Abstract = {Committees are central to the operation of the European Parliament (EP),
   providing fora for the detailed consideration of legislative proposals.
   This article provides the first systematic assessment of how far and why
   Members of the European Parliament (MEPs) are successful in obtaining
   places on the committees to which they most want to be assigned. In
   doing so, we employ a new dataset of MEPs' committee preferences,
   information which has never before been systematically collected.
   Adapted forms of three theories of legislative organisation
   (distributive, informational and partisan) provide a framework for the
   analysis. The results indicate a high degree of success for MEPs in
   achieving the committee assignments they want, within the restrictions
   of proportional representation of party groups on committees. We find
   strong support for the informational approach to legislative
   organisation when examining variations in success rates. Nevertheless,
   there is also some evidence that partisan concerns influence the
   assignment process. This, in combination with the role of party
   coordinators in the EP, means that party groups and national parties in
   the EP attempt to limit the agency losses that might result from a high
   degree of self-selection in committee assignments.},

Title = {Free Trade versus Democracy and Social Standards in the European Union:
   Trade-Offs or Trilemma?},
Journal = {POLITICS AND GOVERNANCE},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {7},
Number = {4},
Pages = {291-300},
Abstract = {This article aims at conceptualising, in analytical as well as
   normative-theoretical terms, the tensions between free trade, democratic
   and social standards, and national sovereignty that are named in Dani
   Rodrik's ``globalisation trilemma{''} for the case of the European Union
   (EU). It is argued that the trilemma concept is much more fitting to the
   EU than a simple trade-off concept. This model offers a conceptual path
   to both analysing existing tensions and thinking of resolving them: a)
   the EU has, indeed, been intervening into national democracies and
   national sovereignty as its legislation is superior to national
   legislation; b) EU legislation and judgements of the Court of Justice of
   the EU have been reducing national social standards; c) executives and
   numerous new institutions and agencies with indirect legitimation have
   taken over competencies that formerly lay in the domain of national
   directly legitimated legislatives; and d) these negative effects relate
   to the EU's giving preference to the liberalisation of free trade of
   capital, goods and services over democracy, social standards, and
   national sovereignty. Against the framework of the globalisation
   trilemma, analysis is combined with normative-theoretical judgements on
   the quality democracy of the setting that has been found and a
   conceptual discussion. The article concludes by discussing the
   perspectives of the setting examined and the possible paths to
   solutions, arguing that in order to keep a high level of economic
   integration, democracy, and social standards in the EU, national
   sovereignty needs to give way.},

Journal = {FORO INTERNO-ANUARIO DE TEORIA POLITICA},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {19},
Pages = {77-92},
Abstract = {This article argues that the harm principle is a mechanism that seeks to
   strike a balance between individual judgement and social stability. I
   will refute the claim that the harm principle can be interpreted in a
   paternalistic way and, instead, argue that the purpose of John Stuart
   Mill's view of the harm principle was to foster social progress.
   Therefore, Mill's emphasis often shifted from individual freedom to
   social control. Contrary to what some scholars claim, this was not the
   result of an inconsistency in his thinking but was derived from his
   focus on social progress.},

Journal = {OSTEUROPA},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {69},
Number = {12},
Pages = {55+},
Abstract = {After 1989/90, many crime scenes of the communist secret services were
   converted into museums. The buildings that used to serve the state
   security apparatus as prisons and headquarters have turned into places
   of remembrance, where the perpetrators are symbolically called to
   account and the victims are honoured as moral victors and heroes. This
   meets a need among societies to form a post-communist identity. However,
   as a result of the blending of historiography and remembrance, the
   complex picture of the communist system is reduced to its criminal
   dimension. In the Stasi museums in Berlin and Dresden, the banality of
   evil is revealed, while in the KGB Museum in Tallinn, the ugly face of
   the communist espionage system is shown through an ironic prism.},

   Russia's entry to the WTO in 2012 did not alter the policy due to the
   general wording of these agreements together with the GOST (State
   Standard) norms valid in the post-Soviet space allow Russia to misuse
   these norms. Russia holds their nonfulfillment in reserve and activates
   them only if a political clash occurs. Such cases are usually not taken
   to the WTO organs by the impacted states because of the weaknesses of
   the WTO appeal process.},

Abstract = {This article seeks to develop a new approach in Holocaust studies,
   namely an environmental history of the Holocaust. A case study of the
   former concentration camp at Auschwitz-Birkenau demonstrates the extent
   of the entanglement of the politics of memory and the politics of
   nature, or political ecology, to use Bruno Latour's term. I suggest that
   memorials should be treated as an environment, and thus explored as an
   assemblage of human and nonhuman (f)actors. Analysing both the official
   preservation strategies adopted by the Auschwitz-Birkenau Memorial and
   Museum as well as artistic projects (including Lukasz Surowiec's
   Berlin-Birkenau), I consider commemorative practices' environmental
   impact. My investigation thus primarily focuses on the role of the
   figure of the tree-as-witness in preservation work and in the use of
   powerful herbicides (namely Roundup) in preserving traces of the camp.
   This study could open the way to further comparative studies of ecocide
   and genocide.},

Abstract = {Building on a critical engagement with the diffusion literature, this
   article introduces a refined model of diffusion that sheds light on
   crucial but so far neglected aspects of the diffusion process. First, by
   introducing four analytically distinct constellations of diffusion, we
   highlight important differences between the participating units of a
   diffusion process. Therefore, the model also allows for analysing very
   early developments of social policy under the conditions of colonialism
   and relations between states of equal or different economic strength,
   and under conditions of continuing post-colonial ties. Second, we
   conceptualize diffusion as consisting of three stages which involve
   different actors from both units: the stage of perception and
   translation, the stage of cooperation and conflict and the stage of
   collective decision-making. Third, we argue that the dominant focus of
   diffusion research on the macro-level obscures that people, money and
   procedures are key promoters of diffusion. From this refined model of
   diffusion, it becomes possible to analyse diffusion processes in a more
   detailed way. We demonstrate the added value of our model by analysing
   the development of education policy in Chile and Argentina in the 19th
   century, and the establishment of project funding for social policy
   purposes under conditions of colonialism in the British Empire in the
   mid-20th century.},

Abstract = {In recent electoral contests, political observers and media outlets
   increasingly report on the level of ``authenticity{''} of political
   candidates. However, even though this term has become commonplace in
   political commentary, it has received little attention in empirical
   electoral research. In this study, we identify the characteristics that
   we argue make a politician ``authentic{''}. After theoretically
   discussing the different dimensions of this trait, we propose a survey
   battery aimed at measuring perceptions of the authenticity of political
   candidates. Testing our measure using data sets from different
   countries, we show that the answers to our items load on one latent
   concept that we call ``authenticity{''}. Furthermore, perceptions of
   candidate authenticity correlate strongly with evaluations of political
   parties and leaders, and with vote intention, while they are empirically
   distinguishable from other traits. We conclude that candidate
   authenticity is an important trait that should be taken into account by
   future research.},

Abstract = {There is a growing interest among policy makers in the use of subjective
   well-being (or ``happiness{''}) data to measure societal progress, as
   well as to inform and evaluate public policy. Yet despite a sharp rise
   in the supply of well-being-based policymaking, it remains unclear
   whether there is any electoral demand for it. In this article, I study a
   long-run panel of general elections in Europe and find that well-being
   is a strong predictor of election results. National measures of
   subjective well-being are able to explain more of the variance in
   governing party vote share than standard macroeconomic indicators
   typically used in the economic voting literature. Consistent results are
   found at the individual level when considering subjective well-being and
   voting intentions, both in cross-sectional and panel analyses.},

Abstract = {Based on 29 Armed Forces' statements produced on the Comprehensive
   Counterterrorism Operation of Sinai 2018, this case study argues a
   consequential faculty and a constitutive functionality of war on terror
   discourse in reproducing social national identity. Examining an under
   researched discourse, this paper claims an underlying `crowd discursive
   manipulation' as a function of this discourse. In doing so, it contends
   a delicate reformulation in the compositional perspective of a terrorist
   using dialectical formation of a fellow-citizen/kindred enemy who is
   combated rationally, ethically, and emotionally. This paper proposes an
   additional dimension of the terrorist's social identity which may render
   a consequential restructure of the dynamics of social context. Informed
   by a fuse of Reisigl and Wodak's Theory of Argumentative Topoi (2001)
   and Van Dijk's Ideology Square (1998) in Critical Discourse Analysis,
   this paper critically analyses the dialectical and the discursive
   construction of ideology, and the reformation of identity deploying new
   socio-political realities. It conceives at least three cardinal
   dialectal strategies: conflict, fear, and legitimacy which work
   consecutively to sell `noble war'. The results suggest that war on
   terror discourse relies on constructive, transformative, destructive,
   exclusionary, and justificatory meso-strategies. This marks the
   discursive reconstruction of nationalism instantiating social exclusion,
   impersonalisation and Otherness.},

Abstract = {Forms of governments vary depending on the standard we want. In terms of
   the method of access to government, governments are divided into
   Republican Governments and Royal Governments. Royal government refers to
   the government by which the governor takes over governance through
   inheritance for an indefinite period. As for the Republican government
   it refers to the government by which the governor takes power through
   elections and for a defined period.
   In this paper, we will recognize the King's Prerogatives as stated in
   the Jordanian Constitution as we will recognize the legislative and

Abstract = {Maintaining adequate pension levels throughout the entire retirement
   phase is a persistent challenge in old-age protection. Most public
   pension schemes in OECD (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
   Development) countries provide for some form of indexation for pensions
   in payment. These mechanisms have been object of frequent revisions for
   different purposes, in particular across Europe. This article explores
   the social and financial policy objectives linked to standard indexation
   parameters in public pension schemes, and offers a rough taxonomy of
   additional factors used to modify traditional indexation arrangements,
   with a special focus on changing rules and practices adopted in the
   European Union (EU) area after the 2008 international economic and
   financial crisis. Analysis suggests that early responses were mainly
   driven by cost containment ideas, whereas more recently, a subtle shift
   towards adequacy-oriented interventions can be noticed. The article
   argues that restrictive pension indexation rules in combination with
   overall retrenchment of public pension provision fail to take into
   account the increasing duration of retirement and corresponding pension
   erosion. Such failure calls into question not only income security
   during retirement as a major objective of old-age pensions but also
   compliance with international standards of social security set by the
   International Labour Organisation (ILO) and the Council of Europe. More
   social policy research is needed in view of the increasing complexities
   of indexation rules, as shortfalls in indexation can cause significant
   impairment in the living conditions of older pensioners, predominantly
   women.},

Abstract = {The push to implement Open Access (OA) as the new standard for academic
   research dissemination is creating very real pressures on academic
   journals. In Canada, the Social Science and Humanities Research Council
   (SSHRC) recently adopted a policy requiring that journals applying for
   its Aid to Scholarly Journals (ASJ) grant make their scholarly content
   freely accessible after no more than a 12-month delay. For journals such
   as the Canadian Journal of Political Science (CJPS) that not only
   publish high-quality, peer-reviewed articles to a specialized audience
   but also support the work of scholarly associations through the revenues
   they generate, the push to move to OA comes with a number of challenges.
   The Canadian Political Science Association (CPSA) and the Societe
   quebecoise de science politique (SQSP) established a committee to chart
   the best course of action for the CJPS in light of this changing
   landscape. This article summarizes the key findings of the committee and
   underscores some of the challenges of OA for journals with a profile
   similar to the CJPS, as well as for the broader research ecosystem that
   they support.},

Abstract = {In this article, we build on research on affective (emotion-based)
   polarization in American politics by investigating whether and how it
   has manifested in campaigns for the presidency. Drawing on a new data
   set of more than 11,000 statements about opponents from presidential
   stump speeches over the 1952-2016 period, we use quantitative content
   analysis to examine trends in negativity, fearful content, and anger
   content in these statements. We also conduct case studies of the 1968,
   1992, and 2016 elections to examine qualitative patterns in these
   statements. We find compelling evidence that negative, fearful, and
   angry content in candidate statements about their opponents has been
   increasing over time among presidential candidates. We also find
   indications that fearful and angry rhetoric toward opponents is becoming
   more directed toward opponents' character flaws rather than their issue
   stances. Our research suggests that affective polarization in
   presidential campaigns is a long-term, and likely durable, development.},

Title = {Non-universal suffrage: measuring electoral inclusion in contemporary
   democracies},
Journal = {EUROPEAN POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {18},
Number = {4},
Pages = {695-713},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The electoral franchise has become more universal as restrictions based
   on criteria such as sex or property have been lifted throughout the
   process of democratisation. Yet, a broad range of exclusions has
   persisted to this date, making the suffrage non-universal, even in
   established democracies. In this article, we present ELECLAW, a new set
   of indicators that captures the subtle and variegated legal landscape of
   persisting electoral rights restrictions. We measure the inclusiveness
   of the right to vote and the right to stand as candidate across four
   levels and three types of elections for three categories of voters:
   citizen residents, non-citizen residents, and non-resident citizens.
   ELECLAW currently covers fifty-one democracies in three different
   continents (the Americas, Europe, and Oceania) depicting the legal
   situation in 2015. The article introduces the methodology used for
   building the indicators so as to make it transparent to the broader
   research community. To this aim, it successively unpacks the
   conceptualisation underlying the indicators, explains the measurement by
   providing specific examples, and discusses the merits of a
   differentiated and context-driven method of aggregation.},

Abstract = {This article examines candidate emails from the 2016-17 Conservative
   Party of Canada leadership race to explore how candidates communicated
   with party supporters on issues of moral traditionalism (for example,
   abortion and sexuality diversity) and minority religious accommodation.
   We find that the level of public support for a given policy position
   shaped how overtly candidates signalled their views, with those
   supporting moral traditionalism or restrictions on religious minorities
   tending to express their views covertly and vice versa. Message
   overtness also changed following the deadline for new members to join
   the party before the vote. This article marks the first systematic study
   of how party leadership candidates attempt to solicit support from
   particular party factions and how candidates' appeals evolve throughout
   a campaign. The results also show that the high-profile debate around
   minority religious accommodation during the leadership race did not
   displace contestation between candidates over issues such as sexual or
   reproductive rights.},

Abstract = {Social movements engage in processes of identity work to construct and
   reconstruct identities. Within movements characterized by group
   differences, such as contemporary LGBT movements, demands for
   representation of group identities challenge the coalitional identity
   movement to perform hard identity work. What strategies do trans
   activists utilize to achieve representation within the Brazilian LGBT
   movement? This research argues that processes of institutionalization
   within the state condition opportunities and strategies for conducting
   hard identity work. Institutionalization within state policy leads to
   innovative discursive strategies for contending and negotiating group
   representation. These processes offer important strategies for the
   coalitional LGBT movement to address some of its most divisive internal
   conflicts in productive ways. This research draws on fifteen months of
   fieldwork, semi-structured interviews, and participant observation.},

Abstract = {The Nolan Report will celebrate its twenty-fifth anniversary in 2020,
   and for most of this last quarter-century, it has provided the
   underlying ethical basis for public life in the United Kingdom. However,
   its principles are now being called into question in a number of areas,
   following the Conservative government's loss of its parliamentary
   majority in the 2017 election, with the interests of party taking
   precedence over adherence to both the spirit and the codified practical
   implementation of some of the ultimate outcomes of Nolan, namely the
   Ministerial Code and the Commissioner for Parliamentary Standards. This
   article argues, with explicit evidence and examples, that ministerial
   conduct which would not have been tolerated before 2017 is now being
   routinely ignored in the interest of maintaining party unity in order to
   deliver some form of Brexit. The article concludes by asking whether
   Nolan norms still command consensus post-Brexit.},

Abstract = {This article argues that the agenda-setting power of protest must be
   understood in dynamic terms. Specifically, it develops and tests a
   dynamic theory of media reaction to protest which posits that features
   of street demonstrations-such as their size, violence, societal
   conflict, and the presence of a ``trigger{''}-lead protest issues to be
   reported and sustained in the media agenda over time. We conduct a
   unique empirical analysis of media coverage of protest issues, based
   upon a data set of 48 large-scale street demonstrations in nine
   countries. Time-series cross-sectional analysis is used to estimate the
   dynamic effects of demonstration features on media coverage of the
   protest issue. The findings show that violence can increase media
   attention in the short term and larger protest size sustains it over the
   longer term. The agenda-setting power of protest is structured in time.},

Abstract = {Claims that the mainstream media are biased in favor of the Democratic
   Party are commonplace. However, empirical research has yielded mixed
   results and neglected potential bias in the dynamics of media behavior.
   This article contributes to this literature by using time series
   analyses of the dynamics in media tone based on more than 400,000
   stories on inflation and unemployment from top-circulating American
   print media and the Associated Press newswire. The results suggest there
   is bias in favor of Democratic presidents. Media tone in unemployment
   and inflation coverage is more favorable during Democratic presidencies
   after controlling for economic performance. Tone is also generally more
   responsive to negative, short-term changes in economic conditions during
   Republican presidencies. In other words, bias is stronger with worsening
   economic conditions.},

Abstract = {No Mas AFP demonstrations emerged in 2016, demanding the change of
   Chilean pension system, using a varied repertoire of strategies. This
   article aim at describing the set of tactics used by the movement,
   beyond the traditional distinction between insiders and outsiders; and
   at exploring the factors of innovation in repertoire of strategies. To
   do so, we build on Rossi (2015), who constructed the concept of
   repertoire of strategies to overcome the distinction between
   conventional and unconventional repertoires. The innovation in No Mas
   AFT repertoire is the product of the political context - Myriam Olate
   case, AFP tax benefits and national elections - and internal definitions
   - especially the autonomy of social movements in relation to political
   parties.},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Most scholarship within social reproduction theory focuses on women's
   paid and unpaid care and domestic work, typically within the global
   North. Rarely has social reproduction theory grappled with unfree labour
   in commodity supply chains, particularly in the global South. However,
   these labour relations also involve gendered power relations that cut
   across the productive and reproductive realms of the economy, which can
   be illuminated by social reproduction theory analysis. In this article,
   we reflect on how social reproduction theory can be used to make sense
   of unfree labour's role in global supply chains, expanding its
   geographical scope and the forms of labour exploitation encompassed
   within it. Conceptually, we harness the insights of social reproduction
   theory, and Jeffrey Harrod and Robert W Cox's work on `unprotected work'
   in the global economy to examine how gendered power relations shape
   patterns of unfree labour. Empirically, we analyse interview and survey
   data collected among cocoa workers in Ghana through LeBaron's Global
   Business of Forced Labour project. We argue that social reproduction
   theory can move global supply chain scholarship beyond its presently
   economistic emphasis on the productive sphere and can shed light into
   the overlaps between social oppression, economic exploitation, and
   social reproduction.},

Abstract = {The article focuses on Greek Cypriot internally displaced persons and
   their attitudes towards the island's reunification talks. We utilize
   quantitative data from two representative sample surveys, conducted in
   2016-2017, which probed respondents on their views on territorial
   readjustments, property provisions and power-sharing. Contrary to the
   current findings in the literature, internally displaced persons status
   is associated with higher levels of support for a negotiated peace
   settlement. The article examines the impact of anticipated threats and
   economic opportunities accompanying a settlement and suggests a set of
   institutionalized mechanisms to incorporate the views of internally
   displaced persons and other disadvantaged groups in future reunification
   talks.},

Abstract = {Political knowledge is central to understanding citizens' engagement
   with politics. Yet, as surveys are increasingly conducted online,
   participants' ability to search the web may undermine the validity of
   factual knowledge measures. Recent research shows this search behavior
   is common, even when respondents are instructed otherwise. However, we
   know little about how outside search affects the validity of political
   knowledge measures. Using a series of experimental and observational
   studies, we provide consistent evidence that outside search degrades the
   validity of political knowledge measures. Our findings imply that
   researchers conducting online surveys need to take steps to discourage
   and diagnose search engine use.},

Abstract = {This article approaches the recent Wonder Woman (2017) film as a
   presentation of the tensions traditionally associated with the paradox
   of democratic foundations. Steeped in classical mythology, Wonder Woman
   adapts two origin myths from the Athenian polis: the myth of Pandora and
   the myth of the heroic colonizing demigod. Through its adaptation of
   these myths I argue that Wonder Woman offers two competing responses to
   the democratic paradox of founding. One is exceptionalist, where
   sovereign interventions by extraordinary `super-agents' like Wonder
   Woman are justified by their unique origins and identities. The second
   response subverts this narrative, however, offering a tragic depiction
   of democratic agency. Through the relationships formed with Diana's
   human companions, I argue that Wonder Woman shows the insufficiency of a
   politics of heroic origins, suggesting agents must continually struggle
   to establish communities which do not ignore their historical failures
   or their powers to address these. Wonder Woman therefore provides
   important imaginative resources for resisting the kinds of seductive,
   exceptionalist political narrative it also presents.},

Abstract = {Unsurprisingly, most scholarship on the English Defence League (EDL)
   focuses on the Islamophobic nature of the group's politics. This has
   found that, whilst the group presents a more moderate, public-facing
   image, the EDL's backstage discourse is a far less nuanced brand of
   Islamophobia and cultural racism (Allen, C. (2011). Opposing
   Islamification or promoting Islamophobia? Understanding the English

   League: ?Not racist, not violent, just no longer silent?. British

   fundamental area of EDL ideology has been left unexamined, however: what
   notion of ?England? is the EDL trying to ?defend?? Using content
   analysis of EDL online discourse, this article examines how the EDL
   articulates, represents, and uses English national identity within its

Abstract = {Immigration and new class divisions, combined with a growing
   anti-elitism and political correctness, are often used as explanations
   for the strong gains for right-leaning populist parties in national
   elections across Europe in recent years. But contrary to what we might
   assume, such parties have been very successful in the most developed and
   comprehensive welfare states, in nations-such as the Nordic
   countries-with the best scores on economic equality and social inclusion
   and long established political and judicial institutions enjoying a high
   degree of popular legitimacy. As argued in this article, this seems to
   happen because a duopoly of the centre-left and centre-right political
   establishment has kept issues such as immigration and new class
   divisions off the public agenda and hence paved the way for
   right-leaning `disruptor' populist parties with an anti-immigration
   agenda in times of increasing immigration.},

Volume = {72},
Number = {4, SI},
Pages = {945-964},

Abstract = {Select committees play an important role in scrutinising government
   policy. They have come under increasing pressure to seek evidence for
   their inquiries-including both formal and informal evidence-from a wider
   range of stakeholders. Two particular pressures can be observed within
   this trend. First, committees are expected to show commitment to hearing
   from a more diverse set of stakeholders. The second pressure relates to
   the representativeness of those providing evidence. Consequently, they
   have been urged to increase public engagement. The recent Citizens'
   Assembly into adult social care points to one mechanism for engaging a
   `mini-public' in committee inquiries. Due to their use of random and
   stratified sampling to recruit participants, mini-publics could
   diversify the evidence base and facilitate public scrutiny of the
   committees. However, we know little of what committee members and staffs
   think about these issues. In this article, we draw insights from over 60
   interviews with select committee chairs, members and staff to gain
   insight into their perspectives on evidence diversity and the potential
   of mini-publics to promote this. We find that traditional approaches to
   inquiries are still favoured. While mini-publics are seen as a solution
   to the failings of current approaches to public engagement, this is for
   instrumental reasons, meaning that they are only valued in particular
   circumstances. Ultimately, further culture change is required if
   committee inquiries are to move substantially beyond the traditional
   approach.},

Abstract = {Discretion is fundamental to understanding interbranch interactions in
   the US separation-of-powers system. Yet, measuring discretion is
   challenging. The few existing measures have difficulty capturing both
   delegation and constraint in a consistent way over time. In this
   article, we propose a novel measure of executive discretion based on
   legislative appropriations to all agencies, weighted by spending
   limitations imposed by Congress in appropriations committee reports. We
   provide evidence for the validity of the measure, including a test of
   the ally principle to establish construct validity. Finally, we
   demonstrate the wider utility of the measure by employing it to evaluate
   hypotheses about how political control over the bureaucracy influences
   congressional policy making in the context of discretion. We show that
   agency design and presidential control are important factors in
   congressional decisions. Overall, we present a versatile measure of
   discretion that researchers can use to explore a variety of questions in
   American politics.},

Abstract = {Several prominent accounts suggest that democratic transitions are more
   likely to take place when opposition to the incumbent regime is led by
   certain social groups. We further develop the argument that opposition
   movements dominated by industrial workers or the urban middle classes
   have both the requisite motivation and capacity to bring about
   democratization. To systematically test this argument, we collect new
   data on the social composition of antiregime opposition movements,
   globally from 1900 to 2006. We find that movements dominated by one of
   these urban groups more often result in democracy, both when compared to
   other movements and to situations without organized mass opposition. As
   expected, the relationship is stronger in urban than rural societies,
   and in more recent decades. When further differentiating the groups and
   accounting for plausible alternative explanations, the relationship
   between industrial worker campaigns and democratization is very robust,
   whereas the evidence is mixed for middle-class campaigns.},

Abstract = {A broad literature has analyzed the effects of Mediterranean welfare
   regimes on the political-electoral sphere and on the policy making
   process. Part of the literature on the insider-outsider divide has
   identified in the insiders the real core-constituency of the social
   democratic parties. The union movement, politically linked to the main
   left-of-center parties, would similarly show poor ability of
   representing the interests of the outsiders. Since the beginning of the
   Great Recession, new parties advancing a populist discourse have been
   able to attract vast segments of the leftist electorate. This article
   focuses on Podemos and the Five Star Movement and explores, mainly
   through in-depth interviews with political and union leaders, to which
   extent the critiques advanced by these parties towards the union
   organizations are motivated by the normative implications of the
   insider-outsider literature. The analysis shows that the critiques are
   more related with the ancillary role played by the unions towards their
   political referents than with their supposed ``over-protection{''} of
   the insiders. However, it emerges that the stances assumed by the two
   parties towards unionism diverge, due to different ideological and
   ``meta-political{''} roots: while Podemos can potentially develop a
   relationship of cooperation with trade unionism, the Five Star Movement
   positions itself as a competitor.},

Abstract = {What explains the gender gap in political knowledge found by surveys
   across different contexts? This article proposes that female political
   representation affects the levels of knowledge expressed by men and
   women and, ultimately, the gender gap. The underrepresentation of women
   makes gender stereotypes salient, and these in turn affect how much
   cognitive effort individuals put into thinking about politics. Moreover,
   I argue that surveys are often responsible for enhancing the effect of
   those considerations. I analyze cross-national survey data from 120
   countries to test whether the gap in knowledge decreases as female
   representation increases across countries. Then, I manipulate the gender
   composition of feeling thermometer batteries in a survey experiment with
   American subjects to test whether priming considerations about female
   representation affects respondents' performance on knowledge questions.
   The findings suggest an explanation for why surveys often reveal gender
   differences in knowledge and a mechanism connecting women's
   representation and public opinion.},

Abstract = {Russian membership in the Council of Europe is a function of two
   threats: isolation internationally and too much
   democratization/liberalization domestically. These concerns conditioned
   Russia?s halcyon first decade of membership. Looking forward, however,
   the obligations of membership challenge Vladimir Putin?s limited
   interest in further domestic reforms at a time when international
   isolation bothers him less. The authors argue that understanding these
   varying domestic and international pressures is a good predictor of
   Russia?s membership interests. The authors explore general hypotheses
   from this case study about the conditions under which illiberal regimes
   willingly cede sovereignty in order to join more liberal and democratic
   international organizations.},

Abstract = {Brexit is not solely a UK crisis. Ireland, more than any other member
   state, stands to be deeply and profoundly impacted by the UK's departure
   from the EU. The crisis which Ireland faces is multi-dimensional:
   economic and political, constitutional and existential in nature. The
   nature and impact of Brexit changes Ireland's relationship with the EU,
   and this is because the UK's decision to leave the European bloc is also
   a crisis for the EU. Brexit challenges the balance between
   intergovernmental and supranational institutions and dynamics in the EU;
   alters power and policy balances; and adds a degree of contingency to EU
   membership for all member-states. This article explores the various
   political, economic and constitutional crises generated for Ireland by
   the Brexit vote and assesses how Brexit impacts on the Europeanisation
   and/or de-Europeanisation of the Irish political system and
   British-Irish relations. This includes an analysis of the extent to
   which the traditional Europeanised characteristics of the Ireland-EU
   relationship and the British-Irish relationship will endure or perish
   within the confines of a post-Brexit EU.},

Abstract = {Populism raises questions about the extent to which public opinion
   should be a legitimate foundation for executive power. In the United
   States, it is often thought, such a foundation was established at the
   beginning of the twentieth century through the creation of a newly
   ``representative{''} modern presidency (one that enabled the president
   to represent the popular will). This new presidency, it is held, acts as
   an agent of populist majorities to undermine constitutional and legal
   norms. In fact, however, the argument for presidential representation is
   a long-standing element of politics in the United States. It is appealed
   to, recurrently, by what might be called the party of opinion against
   its natural opponent, the party of law.},

Journal = {AMERICAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE},

Volume = {63},

Abstract = {Negative elite and news media attention to Latino-relevant issues,
   particularly undocumented immigration, has dramatically increased in
   recent years, potentially stigmatizing attributes of Latinos such as
   immigration status and language use. Concomitantly, immigration policy
   changes were leading to widespread arrests and deportation of many
   Latinos. Herein, we ask two questions: First, to what extent do Latinos
   perceive and experience discrimination? Second, to what extent do
   immigration status, generational status, and language use moderate
   beliefs about discrimination? Using Pew National Survey of Latinos data,
   we find that Latino beliefs about the problem of discrimination is a
   decreasing function of ``proximity{''} to the ``canonical
   immigrant{''}-defined here as first-generation immigrants who are
   Spanish-language dominant. Further, we demonstrate that reported rates
   of victimization due to discrimination exhibit no clear pattern and are
   flat over time. We conclude by demonstrating that discrimination beliefs
   have significant implications for systemic trust, anxiety, and policy
   preferences.},

Abstract = {When do executive constraints provide credible commitment power in
   dictatorships, and under what conditions do leaders establish such
   constraints? This article argues that institutions successfully
   constrain autocrats only when elites are given real access to state
   power, such as appointments to key governmental positions. I present a
   game theoretic model in which an autocratic leader decides whether to
   establish binding constraints at the start of her rule. Doing so shifts
   the future distribution of power in favor of elites, alleviating
   commitment problems in bargaining. I show that leaders are likely to
   place constraints on their own authority when they enter power
   especially weak, and these initial decisions shape the rest of their
   rule. Even if a leader enters power in a uniquely weak position
   vis-a-vis other elites, and is on average, quite strong, the need to
   alleviate commitment problems in the first period swamps expectations
   about the future distribution of power. I illustrate the model's
   findings through case studies of Cameroon and Cote d'Ivoire.},

Abstract = {The U.S is one of the foreign nations that have been deeply involved in
   the affairs of the Middle East region, particularly in Iran. The threat
   posed by terrorism to international peace and stability was one of the
   reasons why the U. S thought it wise to be involved in the affairs of
   the Middle East. Besides the insecurity concerns, laid the interests of
   the U. S in the region that is known to have vast reservoirs of oil and
   the leading producers of the source of energy in the world. According to
   the U.S, it would have been foolhardy to let the region slip into an era
   of political unrest as the rest of the world watched, yet the region is
   a source of livelihood and economies of different nations the world over
   because of their vast oil deposits. Consequently, the U.S drafted
   several measures and policies that, according to them, were aimed at
   restoring peace and political stability in the region. These included
   coalition building, supporting peace ventures, and provision of
   humanitarian aid In their policies, they believed that a stable Middle
   East region would ensure a more stable world than was witnessed before
   their involvement. Despite their involvement in trying to find lasting
   peace in the region, the U.S has also encountered several challenges
   along their way that made their peace efforts slip every moment they
   thought they were close to finding lasting peace in the region.},

Abstract = {How do German intra-party tribunals manage internal conflicts? More
   specifically, why do they accept some cases for trial but reject others?
   Required by law to strictly adhere to implement rule of law standards,
   German intra-party tribunals are designed to insulate conflict
   regulation from politics. Meanwhile, research on judicial politics
   highlights the role of political and strategic considerations in
   accepting cases for trial. Building on the latter, we develop a theory
   that emphasizes tribunals' political concerns such as winning elections.
   We test our hypotheses with a mixed-effects logit model on a novel data
   set covering 1088 tribunal decisions in six German parties from 1967
   until 2015. Our findings indicate that political factors exert a strong
   effect on tribunal case acceptance. Tribunals are more likely to accept
   cases when suffering electoral loss and after losing government office.
   Moreover, tribunals dismiss cases more easily when their parties display
   relatively high levels of policy agreement.},
