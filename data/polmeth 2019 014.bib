Abstract = {Diagnosing women's under-representation in electoral politics often
   involves a blame game, seeking to identify the primary factor
   responsible for depressing the share of women among candidates as well
   as elected officials. The Danish electoral system - in which parties
   present ordered lists of candidates but voters have the option to cast
   preference votes that can rearrange the list order - provides an
   opportunity to assess the relative role of elite versus voter bias in
   shaping women's electoral fortunes. Using data from local elections in
   2009, we find greater evidence for elite bias against women. We also
   observe, however, that voters do not widely exploit their preference
   votes. In an original post-election survey, we discover that candidate
   gender is less important for male and female voters than a host of other
   characteristics when deciding for which candidate to cast a preference
   vote.},

Abstract = {In spite of its peculiar international standing and regardless of its
   geographical distance as well as politico-cultural differences with the
   Middle East, Taiwan has surprisingly managed to forge rather manifold
   connections to the region for close to seven decades. Taiwan has built
   amicable and symbiotic politico-diplomatic ties with key Mideast
   countries, developing continuous partnership with them without the
   privilege of having those instrumental types of attachment. As a result,
   Taipei occupies a unique position in the international relations of the
   region. Still, this phenomenon has largely escaped the attention of both
   academic and policy circles around the world, as major developments in
   Taiwan's interactions with the Middle East over past decades were hardly
   recorded or scrutinized. This study probes Taiwan's atypical foreign
   policy orientation toward the Middle East by looking into critical
   milestones in Taipei's connections with the region.},

Abstract = {August 31, 2016 registered the historical impeachment of Brazilian
   president, Dilma Rousseff, indicted for contravening the budget law and
   misstating the public deficit that propelled the country into deep
   economic recession. Many disagreements on this matter have permeated the
   country's conflict atmosphere, supported by arguments that the
   collective will of more than 54 million voters was disrespected. Based
   on 3,010 interviews conducted in 204 Brazilian cities, we construct a
   pairwise comparison to present arguments that Rousseff had no legitimate
   representation in the 2014 national elections. We demonstrate how the
   suboptimal support of invalid votes and deliberate abstentions might
   have misrepresented the results of Brazilian presidential election by
   choosing a pseudo-Condorcet loser candidate. The results in the
   Brazilian case study presented here point to the weakness in the social
   process of aggregating preferences by relative or absolute majority, and
   sets out recommendations.},

Abstract = {There appear to be striking contradictions between different strands of
   anarchist thought with respect to violence - anarchism can justify it,
   or condemn it, can be associated with both violent action and pacifism.
   The anarchist thinkers studied here saw themselves as facing up to the
   realities of violence in politics - the violence of state power, and the
   destructiveness of instrumental uses of physical power as a
   revolutionary political weapon. Bakunin, Tolstoy and Kropotkin all
   express ambivalence about violence in relation to political power.
   Instead of reading this ambivalence as a mark of inconsistency, or of
   abdication of responsible judgement, we argue that it signals a profound
   recognition of the dynamics of violence in both repressive and resistant
   politics. Kropotkin and Bakunin seek a cooperative collective political
   effort which is negated by individual acts of violence although it
   cannot be committed to non-violence as such. Tolstoy by contrast in his
   recognition of the organised violence of political power, turns from
   politics to morality, from organisation to individual renunciation.
   Tolstoyan non-violence is the opposite of Kropotkin's mutual aid, and
   paradoxically Tolstoyan renunciation has effects only when it is
   underpinned by violence. Tolstoy leaves violence in its place, in his
   renunciation of it; and Bakunin and Kropotkin leave violence in its
   place in their plans for its undoing.},

Abstract = {The landslide victory of the Democratic Progressive Party in Taiwan's
   2016 presidential and legislative elections is often interpreted as a
   persistent swing in attitudes toward cross-strait relations and Taiwan
   independence. Popular as this interpretation may be, it still runs the
   risk of mistaking a short-term reaction to a lame duck president's
   policy performance for a long-term change in attitudes.
   This study analyzes the evolution of independence unification (III)
   views in the Taiwan population from 1996 to 2016. After reviewing the
   literature on political generations in Taiwan, I hypothesize that a
   long-term cohort succession replacing older prounification generations
   accounted for the evolution toward proindependence views. By pooling six
   independent face-to-face surveys into repeated cross-sectional data,
   this study applies a comprehensive multilevel cross-classified
   random-effect model of age period cohort analysis. Markov chain Monte
   Carlo estimation results confirm that, besides age and period effects,
   younger cohorts and the 1999 Taiwan-centered high school curriculum have
   had significant effects on the change in trends in IU views.},

Abstract = {Voter turnout still receives considerable attention in electoral
   studies. Recently, there have been numerous investigations of a
   neglected determinant, sometimes labeled patrimony and here labeled
   wealth. This variable, measuring how much wealth a voter has, appears to
   help account for party choice, beyond more usual socioeconomic measures.
   However, as yet we know little about how wealth affects voter turnout.
   In this article, we explore the relationship of wealth to voter turnout,
   using a battery of questions on wealth, administered in 28 nations, from
   the Comparative Study of Electoral Systems (CSES). We observe that more
   wealth corresponds to higher voting turnout. Further, the strength of
   this link compares favorably to that of more traditional measures, such
   as income and education. Theoretically, such a sharp empirical result
   suggests expanding the resource model of electoral participation in
   order to include this less traditional, but more encompassing, measure
   of economic status.},

Abstract = {Understanding the drivers of party issue emphasis and the specific role
   of public opinion is important to shed light on the mechanisms of
   contemporary party competition and to assess the quality of
   representation in liberal democracies. Previous research has produced
   conflicting results between issue ownership and issue dialogue
   perspectives and has ignored the role of time in party communication
   strategy. We present a theory focused on the economy in which proximity
   to election day increases the incumbent's cost of not responding to
   opponent attacks and subsequently decreases the incumbent's attention to
   public opinion. We validate the main empirical implications of the model
   via content analysis of party discourse in Spanish parliamentary
   speeches (1996-2011) and time series analyses. Our results have
   pessimistic implications for an ideal conception of bottom-up
   representation. As electoral accountability pressures increase over the
   electoral cycle, endogenous party competition overshadows public opinion
   as a driver of representatives' agenda.},

Abstract = {Most Latin American countries have in their institutional design the
   figure of the Vice President to address the succession of the President
   in case of death, illness, resignation or inability. Although this
   succession function -and by extension the vice-presidential figure- are
   conceived as guarantors of stability and continuity, a review of the
   recent political history of Latin America shows that in practice the
   actual result is very different. Latin American Vice Presidents have
   been remarkably frequently sources of political conflict and instability
   for the Executive Branch to which they belong. This article
   recapitulates such critical situations, confronts the Latin American
   model of Vice Presidency with other succession methods, and concludes
   the convenience of replacing the rigid Vice Presidency with a different
   succession figure.},

Abstract = {The recent censorship requests made by Chinese authorities to Western
   academic publishers have sent shockwaves throughout the academic world.
   This article examines the high-profile The China Quarterly incident as a
   case in point. Because the censorship is expected to be followed by
   similar demands to other publications, it is important for the academic
   community to explore the logic behind it. This research article provides
   a preliminary analysis of publications on the censorship list and
   compares them to uncensored articles on similar themes. This exercise
   allows us to draw important insights. Theoretically, this article makes
   an original contribution by going beyond the censorship within to
   outside China. Empirically, it offers a comprehensive analysis of what
   China wants to censor and the context for its actions.},

Title = {Did the minority Gillard government keep its promises? A study of
   promissory representation in Australia},

Abstract = {When the Gillard government formed a minority government in 2010 many
   commentators argued that the government would be unable to fulfil its
   mandate. Despite this, the Gillard government was able to pass a record
   amount of legislation - comparable to previous majority-led governments
   - suggesting the government was effective at negotiating legislative
   passage. Less understood is whether the Gillard government was able to
   keep its election promises given the constraints of minority government.
   This is an important empirical and normative question. In their most
   basic form elections are designed to allow the public to hold
   politicians and political parties to account for their past performance.
   Central to this is whether parties have fulfilled the promises they made
   at the previous election. But how do parties express election promises
   to citizens and are they likely to fulfil these promises? Does minority
   government status make a difference? We examine these questions in the
   first contemporary Australian study of promise fulfilment, examining
   promises made and promise fulfilment of the Gillard minority government
   (2010-2013). We adopt the methods of the Comparative Party Pledges
   Project (CPPP). Consistent with the international literature, we find
   that the Gillard government fulfilled most of its election promises
   suggesting minority government status did not have a large effect on
   promise fulfilment.},

Journal = {BRITISH POLITICS},

Volume = {14},
Number = {1},
Pages = {1-22},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {It is easy to show that the UK Government rarely conducts `evidencebased
   policymaking', but not to describe a politically feasible use of
   evidence in Westminster politics. Rather, we need to understand
   developments from a policymaker's perspective before we can offer advice
   to which they will pay attention. `Policy-based evidence' (PBE) is a
   dramatic political slogan, not a way to promote pragmatic discussion. We
   need to do more than declare PBE if we seek to influence the
   relationship between evidence and policymaking. To produce more
   meaningful categories we need clearer criteria which take into account
   the need to combine evidence, values, and political judgement. To that
   end, I synthesise policy theories to identify the limits to the use of
   evidence in policy, and case studies of `families policies' to show how
   governments use evidence politically.},

Abstract = {Targeting a group of developing nations in a specific region,
   whole-of-region diplomacy as a relatively new practice of China's
   diplomacy has caught much attention across the world. Since the 1990s,
   China's whole-of-region diplomacy has achieved remarkable break-throughs
   in terms of its geographical coverage, extending from Southeast and
   Central Asia to the Middle East, Africa, Latin America, and even Central
   and Eastern Europe. Through whole-of-region diplomacy, China has not
   only fulfilled its political commitment and strategic reassurance toward
   developing nations, but also enhanced the collective identity of various
   developing regions. Despite the great achievements, China's
   whole-of-region diplomacy is far from fully developed and needs further
   upgrading so as to lay a solid foundation for the country's sustainable
   rise. In the future, China's whole-of-region diplomacy can be advanced
   by clarifying its strategic position, renovating its institutional
   framework and scaling up its capacity-building efforts. In the long run,
   whole-of-region diplomacy, as a key component of the ``Xi Jinping
   thought on diplomacy{''} and ``major-country diplomacy with Chinese
   characteristics,{''} is expected to help China tackle challenges of
   interest, identity and influence in the developing world and to
   ultimately achieve its peaceful rise.},

Abstract = {After the 2006 war between Israel and Hezbollah, the UN launched the
   peacekeeping operation UNIFIL II. Italy embarked on the demanding task
   of taking responsibility for leading the mission. We present a model of
   military intervention in multilateral operations that aims at
   highlighting the mechanisms at stake. In so doing, we argue that an
   analytical eclectic approach offers a novel explanation of Italy's
   behaviour. We explain the drivers of Italy's intervention in Lebanon in
   two ways. First, we analyse Italy's actions at the outset of the crisis.
   Second, we provide an account of the parliamentary debate that took
   place in both chambers of the Italian Parliament between July and
   October 2006.},

Abstract = {This study aims to clarify the provisions of the liability of the moral
   person in the electoral publicity crimes in the Jordanian House of
   Representatives Electoral Law No. 6 of 2016, and to clarify the problems
   of implementing the criminal sentences issued against him. The study
   indicated that the Jordanian legislator did not stipulate any
   substantive or procedural rules concerning the penal liability of the
   moral person for the electoral crimes in the House of Representatives
   Electoral Law No. 6 of 2016 relying on the general rule stated in
   Article 74 of the Jordanian Penal Code No. 16 of the year 1960 and its
   amendments, which established the penal liability of the private moral
   persons and excluded the public moral persons i.e. the governmental
   department or official or public institution. The study concluded that
   the liability of the moral person in the electoral publicity crimes is
   subject to the general provisions included in the general section of the
   Penal Code and the Code of Criminal Procedure concerning the general
   procedural rules applicable to the natural person that are in line with
   the nature of the moral person, which constitutes a legislative
   deficiency as its adoption is not sufficient to establish of the penal
   liability of the moral person in the electoral publicity crimes, without
   creating an integral procedural system for prosecuting the moral person
   when he commits the electoral publicity crimes.},

Abstract = {Between 2007 and 2014 the United Nations (UN) assisted more than
   one-third of all national elections worldwide. Its experts routinely
   provide substantial technical advice on election management, logistical
   support such as the procurement of ballot papers and financial
   assistance. However, it remains doubtful if, and under which conditions,
   such assistance contributes to free and fair elections or has a positive
   long-term impact on democratization. This study assesses the impact of
   UN electoral assistance (UNEA) in Sudan, Nigeria and Libya. It finds
   that such assistance contributed to election quality in the presence of
   regime elites prioritizing electoral credibility in Nigeria (2011) and
   Libya (2012). In Nigeria, it seems plausible that UNEA had a medium-term
   impact on democratization. However, if regime elites undermine electoral
   freedom and fairness - as in Sudan (2010) - such positive effects are
   unlikely. Furthermore, in such contexts, the involvement of the UN may
   legitimize authoritarian practices.},

Abstract = {This essay challenges dominant interpretations of Foucault's lectures on
   parrhesia as affirming an ethical, non-political conception of
   truth-telling. I read the lectures instead as depicting truth-telling as
   an always political predicament: of having to appear distant from power
   (to achieve credibility), while also having to partake in some sense of
   political power (to render one's truth significant). Read in this way,
   Foucault's lectures help us to understand and address the disputed
   politicality of truth-telling - over who counts as a truth-teller, and
   what counts as the truth - that his ethical interpreters tend to
   neglect. Yet the essay also shows that Foucault's depiction of the
   predicament of truth-tellers is problematically gendered: focused on the
   masculine problem of moving in and out of the public sphere, rather than
   on the experience of the dispossessed, who are excluded from political
   power altogether. The essay mobilizes an alternative reading of one of
   Foucault's key texts - Euripides' Ion - to draw out an alternative, more
   democratic model of the predicament of truth-telling: of having to
   constitute power that can lend significant to truth-telling, while
   speaking from a position of powerlessness.},

Abstract = {Whether nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) undermine or build
   democratic linkages between citizens and governments in developing
   contexts is a long-standing debate. This research explores the divergent
   claims of whether service-delivery NGOs, by doling out goods, decrease
   demands made of governments or whether they facilitate interactions with
   governments. Using a mixed-methods approach based on original household
   data from the Peruvian Amazon and interviews with community leaders,
   NGOs, and government, the research paints a nuanced picture fleshing out
   aspects of the NGO debate. The likelihood of pressing for services and
   interacting with government increases with more NGO interaction,
   supporting claims about the positive effects of NGOs. However, higher
   levels of NGO activity in communities can have a deterrence effect on
   petitioning government for support, a result that likely hinges on the
   role of information. The research has implications for the role of NGOs
   in affecting government responsiveness and accountability.},

Abstract = {The purpose of the article is try to assess whether inclusive procedures
   of selection are more likely to appoint a candidate who can be
   competitive in the general elections compared with less inclusive ones.
   Accordingly, I took into account nomination processes (NPs) to
   select/appoint the prime ministerial/presidential candidate for general
   elections held in four Western European countries (France, Italy, Spain,
   the United Kingdom) over approximately the last two decades. Using an
   original data source and innovative indicators, I assessed the
   inclusiveness of each NP and the party/candidate's performance in the
   following general election in order to look for a possible relation. The
   outcome shows a very weak negative correlation between the two
   variables. Thus, while it does not appear that inclusive systems of
   selection have a clear positive impact at the electoral level, it is
   likewise hard to maintain that systems such as primary elections cause
   electoral failure.},

Abstract = {As Islamic extremist threats have grown to be a common issue of focus
   and a major cooperation area between China and Central Asian states
   since the 1990s, the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) provides
   China with an important regional and even international
   counter-terrorism platform. Highlighting sustainable security
   cooperation and countering terrorism in a peaceful way under the
   ``Shanghai Spirit,{''} the SCO helps stabilize China's internal security
   environment while enhancing the country's economic and cultural
   cooperation with its Central Asian neighbors. This article reviews the
   Islamic extremist and terrorist challenges to China and the
   counter-terrorism cooperation between China and Central Asian states
   under the framework of the SCO, with a focus on how to tackle the
   weaknesses of such cooperation. It is concluded that SCO member states
   must be prudent in taking further steps in counter-terrorism
   cooperation, especially with regard to whether the organization should
   be transformed into a quasi-military and political alliance.},

Abstract = {How and when do people participate in sustained collective action via
   the courts? Previous research highlights group identity or resources and
   political opportunities but overlooks civil procedural rules' effects
   beyond the courtroom. This article explores how rules regarding privacy
   shape individuals' decisions about sustained participation. Fears of
   exposing one's identity deter participation, especially in the context
   of public trials. Yet, a paired comparison of litigation by victims of
   hepatitis C-tainted blood products in Japan and Korea reveals that
   court-supervised privacy protections, which were available in Japan but
   not in Korea, facilitate plaintiffs' participation inside and outside
   the courtroom. They ease plaintiff recruitment and enhance claimants'
   credibility. Counterintuitively, they also let claimants strategically
   shed pseudonymity to send a costly signal about their commitment to the
   cause. Theorizing ``pseudonymous participation{''} as an understudied
   mode of activism between full exposure and anonymity demonstrates that
   seemingly technical aspects of law have significant political
   consequences.},

Abstract = {The aim of the paper is to analyze the zero-hour contract in the context
   of platform work; specifically, the risks and opportunities of this type
   of provision of services. In the context of the sharing economy and
   gig-economy, there have emerged multiple App-based companies that have
   significantly altered the way in which services are provided. Companies
   like Uber, Lift, Taskrabbit, Deriveroo, Glovo or Amazon Mechanical Turk
   have introduced new forms of work that have altered the boundaries of
   Labor Law. The model of these companies is the division of their
   production into microtasks, the externalization of their entire
   production to a wide number of independent contractors through an App or
   webpage and the hiring of each service on-demand. As a result, new
   technologies have allowed these companies to avoid hiring workers and to
   provide their services entirely through self-employed workers. This
   hiring on-demand implies the use, de facto, of the zero-hour contract,
   as platform workers are not subject to a specific working time regime,
   having absolute liberty to determine, not only their schedule, but also
   their working time and, even, their willingness to work. In this
   context, the aim of the paper is to analyze the zero-hour scheme in the
   context of platform work. The final objective of the paper is to
   determine, from a lege ferenda perspective, if jurisdictions should
   introduce this type of contract to promote the business model used by
   digital platforms or, on the contrary, if they should ban it.},

Journal = {SCOTTISH AFFAIRS},

Abstract = {Political scientists often debate how much information people have and
   deploy when making electoral decisions. Some scholars suggest that
   voters are aware of which party is likely to win in their local
   constituency at British general elections; however, this might not be
   the case in situations when there is substantial and spatially varying
   change in the relative fortunes of two or more parties between
   elections. That argument is evaluated here using as a case study the
   2015 and 2017 general elections in Scotland: at the first, the SNP's
   vote share more than doubled, and it won 56 of the country's 59 seats,
   having won just six at the previous contest; at the second, its vote
   share fell by about a third, and it lost 21 of those 56 seats. Analysis
   of British Election Survey data collected before and during the
   campaigns preceding those elections shows that most respondents were
   aware of the SNP's surge in 2015 and expected their victory in every
   constituency. In 2017, most voters were aware which of the SNP's three
   competitors was the biggest threat in each constituency, and that
   awareness became clearer during the campaign; yet, voters - especially
   those who identified with the SNP and were contacted by it during the
   campaign - still (incorrectly) anticipated a local SNP victory.},

Abstract = {Transnational social movements, campaigns and individual activists have
   described their activities in the traditional vocabularies of political
   dissent: as protest, opposition, contestation, dissidence or rebellion.
   Where strategies have involved illegal, well-publicised activities, the
   vocabularies of resistance and of civil disobedience have become an
   activist lingua franca. What all such descriptions have in common is
   that they paint a largely defensive picture of activist aims and
   self-understandings. In contrast, the emergence of the `global
   constitutionalist' paradigm in international law and politics has
   re-introduced the category of constituent power. Transnational
   initiatives such as the Democracy in Europe Movement 2025 (DiEM25) have
   begun to frame their activities in a `constitutive' and less in a
   `reactive' language. When countering the challenges of cross-border
   domination, new collectives may grasp the chance for extra-institutional
   self-activation. The special issue aims to assess and compare the
   features and the various strengths and weaknesses of the respective
   languages of contestatory and constitutive politics.},

Abstract = {Radical democratic political theorists have used the concept of
   constituent power to sketch ambitious models of radical democracy, while
   many legal scholars deploy it to make sense of the political and legal
   dynamics of constitutional politics. Its growing popularity
   notwithstanding, I argue that the concept tends to impede a proper
   interpretation of civil disobedience, conceived as nonviolent,
   politically motivated lawbreaking evincing basic respect for law.
   Contemporary theorists who employ it cannot distinguish between civil
   disobedience and other related, yet ultimately different, modes of
   political illegality (e.g. conscientious objection, resistance,
   revolution). The essay also examines Jurgen Habermas' recent
   contributions to a theory of mixed or dualistic (postnational)
   constituent power, conceding that Habermas avoids many theoretical and
   political ills plaguing competing radical democratic theoretical
   retrievals. Nonetheless, Habermas' attempt to salvage the idea of
   constituent power as part of his reformist agenda for the European Union
   not only breaks with his earlier understandable skepticism about the
   idea but also risks trimming the admirably ambitious sails of his
   radical democratic interpretation of civil disobedience.},

Journal = {POLITICAL STUDIES REVIEW},

Abstract = {It is widely assumed that Donald Trump is a `celebrity politician' and
   that he has cashed in his success on the reality show The Apprentice to
   secure political credibility and attention. In this respect, he fits
   what Matthew Wood et al. have labelled the `superstar celebrity
   politician'. This characterisation is the latest in a number of
   refinements to the definition and understanding of the celebrity
   politician. While this is a helpful move, I want to suggest that it
   might overlook one key dimension of the phenomenon. Definitions of the
   celebrity politician tend to focus on the source of their `celebrity' -
   how they became famous, rather than on how they act out their celebrity
   role. This latter dimension features in media coverage, where
   journalists and commentators borrow from show business to describe
   politics, but is less often analysed in the political science
   literature. It matters because, I want to suggest, celebrity politicians
   like Trump act as stars, whether of reality television, rock music or
   film. They do not just resemble stars, they are them. This is evident in
   how they are represented, how they perform and how their `fans' respond
   to them. It is also symptomatic of wider changes in the conduct and form
   of the contemporary, mediatised political realm.},

Journal = {IDP-INTERNET LAW AND POLITICS},

Pages = {109-126},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Blockchain or DLT (Distributed Ledger Technology) provides any object
   with a permanent digital identity over time, regardless of its nature.
   Beyond its success in the financial sphere, its applications in public
   administration seem to be extensive and disruptive, especially in terms
   of the registration of different types of assets - and the European
   Union may be one of its main drivers. However, this technology is still
   at a very early stage and the current literature tends to highlight its
   potential benefits, without analyzing its implementation or limitations
   in a systematic way. It is also costly to find examples of consolidated
   projects at a governmental level, mostly due to the regulatory reform
   that must precede their full adoption.
   This article focuses on this issue, gathering a compendium of real-use
   cases related to identity and property registers, based on blockchain
   technology, in countries such as Estonia, Sweden and the United States.
   Based on this analysis, and applying a functional and technical
   classification, it attempts to infer its different operating schemes and
   to extract both its benefits and, especially, its main implications and
   challenges within the current legal framework. It adopts a
   technical-legal perspective and pays special attention to aspects such
   as smart contracts.},

Abstract = {In this paper we focus on how individuals' level of political
   sophistication conditions how they respond to growing elite
   polarization. The party coalitions in the electorate have become
   increasingly ideologically sorted. We assess whether all citizens have
   sorted into the ideologically ``correct{''} partisan camp or whether
   this phenomenon is limited only to the highly sophisticated. Using a
   combination of ANES and DW-NOMINATE data we show that individuals of all
   sophistication levels have become more likely to identify with and vote
   for the party that best matches their policy orientations as a function
   of increasing elite-level polarization. Our findings suggest that the
   effects of increasing polarization are felt throughout the electorate.},

Abstract = {We know that voters have a baseline preference for candidates with whom
   they share a racial background, but whether and why a shared racial
   identity influences political decisions is the critical question. This
   article examines how shared racial characteristics lead racial minority
   voters to vote for candidates of the same race. Using a unique online
   experiment, we test the social psychological bases for racial affinity.
   We expect that for higher status minority groups, identity- rather than
   interest-based motivations offer the greatest explanatory value. Our
   findings support this supposition. Our results provide new insights into
   the political behavior of racial minority voters, and have implications
   for theories of vote choice and affinity, as well as practical
   applications for party strategists and candidates.},

Number = {23},
Abstract = {The late Renaissance Italian secretary was a figure of importance at the
   very heart of the state, but the particulars of what the role entailed
   provoked debate in the proliferation of advice literature which emerged
   to guide this political profession. This article draws parallels between
   works aimed at the instruction of the secretary in the sixteenth and
   early seventeenth centuries and the many iterations of Italian political
   advice literature which preceded it, as well as investigating the
   presence and use of classical political theory in Italian secretarial
   literature, in particular Aristotle's Politics. It delves into the
   question of whether the secretary's role was based in rhetoric, the
   composition of letters, or if the secretary could aspire to some kind of
   political involvement - perhaps even advising a prince - and therefore
   required knowledge of politics and political philosophy.},

Volume = {31},

Abstract = {In this article, I ask how to interpret the border regime of South
   America. I reflect on the possible relation between international
   migration, states and borders in the field of migration studies in order
   to build analytically situated categories. In order to do so, I use a
   qualitative methodology based on a set of documents such as final
   declarations and technical reports of the South American Conference on
   Migration (SACM), and resolutions of the Southern Common Market
   (Mercosur) and the Andean Community (can). In order to interpret the
   border regime, I construct three categories: (i) the border
   externalization, associated with the regionalization process of
   migration control policies in South America, (ii) the crossing from one
   national territory to another, linked to the control at the border
   points, and (iii) the borders of permanence, associated with the state
   mechanisms that stipulate the ways of residence. South America, through
   its regional organizations, constitutes a sub-region of the global
   border regime, which favors and stimulates organized, planned and
   integrated migration control policies. At ``the borders{''}, such
   controls identify migrants belonging to a member state of the can, the
   Mercosur, or an out-of-region migrant. Thereby, the subjects are
   subordinated under the political stratum of the state to which they
   belong. The states set a differential mode to enter and stay in a
   territory according to the national origin of the subjects.},

Abstract = {Owning a house is the most important economic choice most families will
   ever make. Yet, our understanding of the political causes and
   consequences of homeownership is rather thin. This review argues that
   political scientists need to take housing much more seriously, not least
   because of the unprecedented surges and collapses of house prices over
   the past two decades. The housing market is both a proxy for and a cause
   of growing social cleavages that shape how citizens view political
   issues from the size of the welfare state to the attractiveness of
   populist campaigns. The article begins by re-examining classic work on
   property from the nineteenth century as a still-relevant guide to the
   winners and losers from property market shocks and regulations. It then
   turns to the postwar era and work that suggests that the welfare state
   and property ownership are in some sense substitutes. It concludes by
   examining the role housing plays in shaping contemporary political
   preferences, both as a direct measure of individuals' wealth and welfare
   and as a proxy for the relative fortunes of different places.},

Abstract = {The political science and social science literature on legitimacy is
   extensive and diverse. Furthermore, the empirical-descriptive as well as
   normative-ethical conceptions of legitimacy are extremely heterogeneous.
   This applies both to the concepts themselves and to their use as
   scientific terms. Thus, it is hardly surprising that questions about
   suitable operationalizations and measurement instruments are a central
   and not uncontroversial point of discussion in empirical legitimacy
   research. Characteristic of this is a conceptual conflation of system
   support and legitimacy, which is very closely linked to the insufficient
   availability of suitable indicators in survey research. As a result,
   many studies present inadequate measures of legitimacy that are
   difficult to compare, which is expressed in different interpretations of
   the findings and has considerable consequences for empirical research.
   Against this background, our paper aims at a critical assessment of the
   indicators used to measure the through- and output legitimacy of
   political systems. Based on this critical review, especially with regard
   to their inconsistent use, existing and new methodological procedures
   such as web probing in the field of cognitive interviews are presented
   and the necessity of their application is justified. The paper concludes
   with recommendations for a new construction of an instrument to measure
   the political legitimacy of democratic systems.},

Abstract = {In 1947, the French Communist Party (PCF) set up an economics department
   to collect information for its leaders. The creation of this body and
   its journal, Economie et Politique, occurred in a context marked by the
   rise of the figure of an expert with specialized knowledge and the
   dissemination of economic belief, i.e., the imposition of an
   understanding of the social world through an economic lens. However,
   this innovation threatened the internal balance within the PCF, where
   most of the political staff came from the working class and were
   attached to certain fundamental doctrinal principles. Depending on their
   resources and the political situation, the members of the economics
   department were more or less inclined to comply with the party's
   existing standards, restricting them to a role of illustrating its
   partisan positions. This article shows the efforts made by members of
   the economics department to accommodate the party rules and to harmonize
   them with the knowledge they had gained from other areas. It explains
   the conflicts within the economics department and how they were
   politicized when they became embedded in the struggles within the
   political leading group.},

Title = {Electoral Reforms and the Administration of the 2015 General Elections
   in Nigeria},
Journal = {DEMOCRACY \& SECURITY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {15},
Number = {3},
Pages = {207-229},
Abstract = {Since the return of Nigeria to civil democracy in 1999, elections and
   their administration by the electoral body, like they were in the
   previous defunct republics, have been rather problematic to the effect
   that many observers have even doubted whether electoral democracy could
   fit in into the country's social milieu. However, in recent times,
   following the controversial and widely condemned elections of 2003 and
   2007, a series of electoral reforms have been initiated to improve the
   quality of elections in the country. This article, adopting descriptive
   and historical methodology, examines how the series of reforms initiated
   by the Electoral Management Body (EMB), the Independent National
   Electoral Commission (INEC) before the 2015 general elections impinged
   on the overall outcome of the exercises. The article notes that there
   were tremendous improvements in the administration of the 2015 General
   elections by INEC. It argues that the improved electoral administration
   of the 2015 General elections may be connected with the reforms
   initiated by the elections body prior to the 2015 elections. it
   concludes that, even though, INEC may have fared better in comparison
   with how it handled similar endeavors in the past, yet more works still
   need to be done in order to have even better outcomes in the 2019 round
   of elections.},

Abstract = {Over the course of three semesters spanning the 2016 primary and general
   elections, we conducted a series of quasi-experiments to evaluate the
   effects of prediction markets on undergraduate interest in the political
   process. We gave several classes in our institution's core American
   politics course the opportunity to collectively invest in
   election-related markets on Predictit.org, and over two-thirds of our
   students reported that the exercise stimulated their interest in the
   elections and political process. Roughly half also reported reading more
   news articles because of their participation in the market. While our
   treatment group did not demonstrate statistically-significant
   improvement in tangential political awareness, knowledge, or engagement,
   our findings do challenge previous conclusions that prediction markets
   have limited capacity to motivate students in an introductory learning
   context.},

Title = {Constitutionalization and Entrepreneurship: Explaining Increased EU
   Steering of Renewables Support Schemes},
Journal = {POLITICS AND GOVERNANCE},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {7},
Number = {1},
Pages = {70-80},
Abstract = {This article sheds light on two under-researched issue areas: the energy
   policy-shaping role of the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU)
   and how constitutionalization of EU state aid law gives the European
   Commission (Commission) increased leverage over EU policy development.
   EU state aid governance is embedded in the Treaty of the Functioning of
   the EU's prohibition of state aid. The CJEU and the Commissions'
   Directorate-General for Competition (DG Comp) have played important
   roles in the emergence of stronger EU steering of renewable energy
   support schemes after 2014. For many years, powerful member states, most
   notably Germany, stopped the adoption of EU rules requiring more market
   streamlining and European harmonization of renewables support. This
   primarily played out in regular EU decision-making (co-decision) related
   to adoption and revision of the Renewable Energy Directive. A radical
   shift occurred in 2014 when the Commission introduced new guidelines on
   state aid for environmental protection and energy, giving the Commission
   increased authority over development of renewables support schemes
   across Europe. These guidelines called for renewables investments to
   become more exposed to energy market pricing and introduced auctioning
   as the main allocation mechanism. Support schemes for renewable energy
   were included for the first time in the EU state aid guidelines for
   environmental protection in 2001. Back then, member states had ample
   leeway to design support schemes as they pleased. The 2014 version of
   the guidelines includes far more detailed requirements. While the first
   CJEU ruling on renewables state aid hindered the Commission to
   intervene, new CJEU rulings after 2008 enabled the Commission to draft
   more restrictive guidelines. This article concludes that
   constitutionalization, combined with the policy entrepreneurship of
   Commission officials, explains the shift in EU steering in 2014. This
   indicates that constitutionalization and Commission entrepreneurship
   should be assessed in conjunction. Constitutionalization may be
   particularly important in the state aid area due to the superior
   competence of the Commission.},

Abstract = {Why do young men from working-class neighborhoods run away from the
   police when they shouldn't have anything to fear? Based on an
   ethnographic fieldwork, this article shows that running away is based on
   interactional tensions. The hypervisibility of ``les jeunes de cite{''}
   (inner city youth) is displayed in the interactions with police
   officers. This ecology of encounters embodies a political relationship.
   ``Les mecs de cite{''} routinely cultivate a pattern of interactions
   which draws neither from social disorganization nor from a culture of
   violence, but from an ongoing political process of valuing the
   legitimacy of police action. In this social setting, conflict is

Title = {Establishing an NHRI in a Contested Political Space: A Deliberative
   Process in Israel},
Journal = {NORDIC JOURNAL OF HUMAN RIGHTS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {37},
Number = {3, SI},
Pages = {281-299},
Abstract = {How can a National Human Rights Institution (NHRI), as the centrepiece
   of a national human rights system, be established and contribute to the
   domestic institutionalisation of human rights in a contested political
   space? Could the effectiveness of domestic human rights actors be
   enhanced without a formal NHRI? This article reflects on a deliberative
   process regarding the establishment of an NHRI compliant with the `Paris
   Principles' as the prevailing international standard, in the contested
   political space of Israel. It describes the discussion's overall setting
   and analyses the main elements of the consultative process. Although
   none of the institutions working in the field of human rights in Israel
   merit NHRI accreditation, in concert they constitute a functional system
   of domestic institutionalisation. The project raised several dilemmas
   looking ahead: should the goal be a `first-best' NHRI? Would an Israeli
   NHRI be able to address the most severe human rights violations? Could
   the political atmosphere have adverse effects on the protection of human
   rights? How should an NHRI be designed with effectiveness in mind? We
   conclude that the Paris Principles, however necessary, do not in
   themselves ensure effectiveness, and might be too demanding politically
   in contested spaces, such as present-day Israel.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this essay is to present a critical analysis about the
   nation state in Latin America by utilizing the conceptual tools
   originating in so-called post/decolonial studies. To accomplish this
   task, two steps will be carried out. First, a brief genealogy of the
   concept of the coloniality of power will be formulated. In dialogue with
   Jacques Ranciere, it will be shown how coloniality is a constitutive
   element of the post-colonial nation state in Latin America, representing
   a partition of the sensible and therefore the generation of an excluded
   population `without part'. Finally, the case of `la Regeneracion' in
   nineteenth-century Colombia will be offered as a historical image where
   coloniality led to a partition of the sensible, as it updated and
   transformed itself to consolidate the cognitive legacies of colonialism.},

Abstract = {At present, China's government website system has basically been
   completed, with most governments at all levels equipped with the three
   major service functions of information disclosure, online handling of
   government affairs, and interaction between the government and the
   public. These websites have now developed into an important channel for
   the party and government to communicate regarding public opinion, and an
   important platform for the provision of services to the public. However,
   as the internet has grown rapidly more widespread, the development of
   government websites now faces unprecedented challenges. On the whole, if
   Chinese government websites are to further increase their capacity to

Abstract = {Since the dawn of Reform and Opening, practical innovations at the basal
   level have provided unending, fresh models for reform and development in
   all areas of the nation; E-governance is no exception. Over the past
   decade, some local governments have made real autonomous progress in
   E-governance, giving rise to a few ``best practical implementation{''}
   representative cases. These cases have set standards for the rest of the
   nation and are serving as models; some have even been propagated across
   the nation. We will analyze and summarize the practical experience of
   these local governments, and present the six development models that
   have exerted the greatest influence on E-governance development in
   China: the Jiangxi model, the Qingdao model, the Dongcheng model, the
   Ningbo 81890 model, the Chengdu model, and the Jiyuan model.},

Title = {NEW PHASE OF DECOLONIZATION: FROM FORMAL SOVEREIGNITY TO REAL ONE},
Journal = {POLIS-POLITICHESKIYE ISSLEDOVANIYA},
Year = {2019},
Number = {1},
Pages = {124-135},
Abstract = {After the collapse of the bipolar world order, politicians and experts
   almost everywhere faced the requirement of making corrections in the
   political concepts and narratives of decolonization as a dominant global
   development trend. Not a long time before, the United States proclaimed
   the process of decolonization completed and referred to it as a past era
   supplanted by imperatives of modernization, Europeanization,
   westernization, globalization, etc. In reality, however, only two of its
   phases - attainment of formal political independence and gaining
   sovereignty over natural resources - have been completed. The process
   entered the third phase of actual decolonization when China and a large
   group of rapidly developing economies had turned into the world's
   manufacturing and assembly factories. Russia's reemerging as one of the
   leading global players bolsters up and further spurs the process of
   decolonization. The balance of forces on the world stage goes through
   tectonic shifts and gives additional chances for final success of
   decolonization. What is expected to come up is the next, and final,
   phase of practical decolonization. Its purpose is to acquire
   technological and financial independence as well as the ability to parry
   military force or threat of the use of force whatever its origin. There
   exist objective and subjective factors that get in the way of
   decolonization. These include political destabilization and pressure,
   redirection of financial flows, sanctions, wars, etc. They will not have
   a critical impact, however, if all constructive forces around the world
   pool their efforts towards cooperation. With such an understanding of
   dominant and latent trends, ongoing worldwide transformations look no
   longer like unpredictable and dramatic chaotization of international
   relations but are being taken for what they actually are: the struggle
   for practical decolonization of the parts of the planet that used to be
   dependent territories.},

Abstract = {This article deals with democratic constitutionalism in order to
   investigate the proper nature of constitutionalism, by wondering about
   its peculiarities and specific objects. Against this background, this
   essay aims at providing a paradigmatic definition of constitutional
   theory, for more specifically exploring its different undertones. For
   this reason, the first section of the article offers an analysis of the
   most relevant theoretical contributions within modern and contemporary
   constitutionalism. Thus, the first section explores Carl Schmitt's, Hans
   Kelsen's and Robert Dahl's definition of constitutional democracy. The
   second section then focuses with more attention on contemporary
   liberal-democratic constitutionalism, manly on one of the most debated
   issues: the dichotomy between legal and political models of
   constitutionalism, which goes hand in hand with a distinction between
   dualist and monistic accounts of democratic theory. The last section
   proposes an insight into the Italian constitutional system, by comparing
   it with the U.S. model, by especially focusing on the functioning and
   structure of the Constitutional Court compared to the U.S. Supreme
   Court.},

Title = {Fact or Fiction? Designing Stories for Active Learning Exercises},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE EDUCATION},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {15},
Number = {2},
Pages = {179-190},
Abstract = {Stories can be employed in a variety of ways in college classrooms-such
   as in case studies, simulations, and problem-based learning (PBL)
   activities. Sometimes these stories are historically accurate, while in
   other instances they are fictional. What might be the benefits and
   challenges of using fictional narratives? This article draws upon data
   from student surveys and 15 years of teaching practice to consider the
   advantages and drawbacks of using fictional stories in PBL exercises. It
   finds that using fictional stories develops problem-solving and teamwork
   skills, promotes deep learning, enables the discussion of sensitive
   topics, and helps to build a community of learners. Also, the stories
   can be easily modified so as to meet learning objectives and enhance
   instructional flexibility. Moreover, the challenges of using fictional
   stories are manageable. Writing such narratives can be easier than
   imagined if professors fictionalize a case study with which they are
   familiar. Concerns about the acquisition of substantive knowledge can be
   addressed by discussing the similarities between fictional stories and
   real-world cases. Students report that the use of fictional narratives
   clarifies abstract concepts and aids in the long-term retention of
   course material. While this article focuses on PBL, its findings are
   pertinent to other forms of active learning.},

Abstract = {Limited government supported by elite coalitions can facilitate the
   development of fiscal capacity by tying rulers' hands and enhancing
   their credibility. This paper presents evidence of the effect of the
   Mining Tribunal, an institution for the mining elite in late colonial
   Mexico that credibly constrained the Spanish Crown, on the development
   of fiscal capacity. The mining elite resisted the development of a
   strong fiscal state that was controlled by unconstrained Crown
   authorities. However, when mine owners were granted the ability to
   organize and protect their economic interests through a corporation,
   they ceased resisting. This enabled the Crown to invest in strengthening
   its fiscal capacity and raise more taxes from sectors other than mining.
   Difference-in-differences estimates using detailed fiscal data from
   regional royal treasuries indicate that this institution led to a
   substantial increase in the resources assigned to civil administration,
   as well as in revenues from nonmining production and trade.},

   use of preference votes},
Journal = {ACTA POLITICA},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {54},
Number = {1},
Pages = {1-21},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {This paper examines the use of preference votes under the open-list
   proportional representation system in the elections of assemblies at
   different levels of government. Our empirical analysis focuses on the
   elections held in Poland, where similar system is applied in elections
   of councils in three subnational tiers. This setting allows us to test
   the hypotheses concerning the impact of party magnitude and district
   size on the usage of preference voting. Earlier research demonstrated
   that the distribution of preference votes is heavily influenced by
   candidates' ballot positions and their personal vote-earning attributes.
   While the ballot position serves as a cue for less-informed voters in
   all tiers, we demonstrate that the elections held in smaller
   constituencies, where voters are more proximate to their
   representatives, are more personal. This is reflected by the higher
   chances of changing the candidate order by using preference votes in
   constituencies characterized by the lower voters per seat ratio. We also
   find that preference voting matters more when party magnitude is larger.
   Our theoretical expectations are tested using logistic regression
   models, accounting for candidate- and list-level effects.},

Abstract = {In the past 20 years, two related literature strands have gradually
   moved centre stage of the attention of EU Studies scholars. The first is
   preoccupied with the `politicization of European integration', a
   multi-faceted concept that aims to tie together a multitude of political
   and societal manifestations underlying an increasing controversiality of
   the EU. A second concerns the parliamentarization of the EU, referring
   to the changing (institutional) role and EU-related activities national
   parliaments engage in. The key point of this contribution is simple, but
   often overlooked: We can and should be seeing parliamentarization as a
   necessary, yet insufficient, component of a wider process of
   politicization. Doing so goes beyond the often ad hoc or pars pro toto
   theoretical assumptions in both literature strands, sheds new light on
   the normative consequences attached to these phenomena, and furthers a
   more complete understanding of how a `comprehensive' politicization of
   European policies develops.},

Abstract = {A series of writers who have come to Israel or Germany from the Soviet
   Union and its successor states are processing their experiences of
   migration in their novels. Some write in Russian, others in Hebrew or
   German. A shift to German means enlarging their readership, while
   switching to Hebrew tends to narrow it. A lot depends on the age at
   which the authors left their old homeland. Those who came to Germany or
   Israel as adults usually remain part of a Russian-speaking culture,
   while those who came as children often have a hybrid sense of identity
   that is usually connected to specific places. This is reflected in their
   literature.},

Abstract = {Platform labour is a new phenomenon that brings new forms of labour
   control with it. The article looks at crowdwork and analyses the various
   types of control inherent in this phenomenon. It is argued that
   crowdwork is not controlled by technological instruments alone, such as
   algorithms. Indeed, the method of organising labour is a complementary
   control element. Analytically, a technological and an organisational fix
   can be distinguished. Their specific characteristics are empirically
   investigated on the basis of crowdwork platforms covering the entire
   spectrum of qualifications. The result is that already existing
   asymmetries between capital and labour are intensified by the
   interaction between the technological and the organisational fix.},

Abstract = {Much thinking on war has been inspired by von Clausewitz' famous dictum
   of ``war being merely the continuation of policy by other means.{''}
   Such a politics/war dialectic conceives of war as being excluded from
   life within state and society; yet, contemporary warfare is in many ways
   constitutive for societies on and off the battlefield. Recent debates on
   war call for rethinking war in a more vernacular, critical sense. By
   joining this call, the articletakes its cues from the theory of hegemony
   as developed by political theorist Ernesto Laclau in order to pave a
   theoretical avenue on how war reaches into society. Paraphrasing
   Clausewitz, I argue that war is the continuation of hegemony with other
   means, explaining how and why war has stabilizing and constraining
   effects on (democratic) political and societal life. Illustrating my
   argument with observations from the ``Global War on Terror,{''} I am
   able to show how war is entangled with society having dire
   consequencesfor societal cohesion in Western societies.},

Abstract = {Over the last fifty years, gender quotas have transformed the
   composition of national legislatures worldwide. But a lack of systematic
   cross-national longitudinal data limits the questions researchers are
   able to ask about quotas. This article introduces a new dataset-QAROT
   (Quota Adoption and Reform Over Time)-the first global dataset on gender
   quota adoption, implementation, and reform over time. Theoretically, we
   clarify important issues in extant quota research. The dataset moves
   beyond traditional categorizations of quota policies with new measures
   of quota design, quota thresholds, placement mandates, sanctions for
   non-compliance, and quota effectiveness. We also create a
   single-variable measure of the presence of an effective quota to be used
   by comparative politics researchers to control for this powerful
   institutional feature.},

Abstract = {The field of youth development sits at the frontier of new opportunities
   for research and practice. Likewise, sustainability of development has
   remained an area of interest and attracted debates among academia. In
   advanced economies, development has been successfully sustained over a
   long period of time but has proofed difficult in developing economies.
   Though different strategies to empower youths have been put in place in
   Nigeria, the resulting effects are not sustainable with the rate of
   poverty and unemployment still on the high side. Thus, there is the need
   to review the application of sustainable development concepts and its
   practicability in Nigeria. This paper is an attempt in this direction.
   To this end, this study reviews youth empowerment programme in Nigeria
   with the view to identifying the challenges militating against its
   success and proffer solutions. Primary data was collected through
   personal telephone interview with the commissioners of industries,
   commerce and trade in twenty-two states (out of 36 states) in Nigeria
   and secondary information was extensively gathered through research
   reports and academic publications. Analysis of data collected was done
   in frequencies and percentages. The paper found that youth empowerment
   is hinged on the fact that more than half of the Nigerian population is
   youth, about 70\% of the population are poor with more than 29.5 per
   cent unemployed. Youth empowerment programmes were coordinated through
   Federal Ministry of Youth Development in Nigeria. Such programmes
   include Youth Empowerment Educational and Vocational Training, Youth
   Empowerment Agriculture (YEAP) and Job creation programmes such as SURE
   - P; CSWYE; YOUWIN; NAPEC; NAPEP together with Youth Empowerment
   Financial Intervention which were done through Non-Governmental
   Organisations (NGOs), Government, Philanthropists and Financial
   Institutions. All these programmes were found not to be successful
   because of some identified challenges: poor implementation of policies,
   misappropriation of funds, youths not being adequately involved in
   decision making process, and corruption among others. The paper affirmed
   the benefits embedded in the adoption of youth empowerment programme as
   a strategy for sustainable development and thus advised government to
   focus attention more on the youth empowerment by involving them more in
   the decision-making process.},

Abstract = {I develop a theory of fundraising competition between candidates whose
   ability to raise money depends on the policy they will enact if elected.
   Unlike in existing models of money in politics, there is no exchange of
   policy favors for donations; donors merely have better information than
   the electorate about candidates' policy intentions. Even in the absence
   of quid pro quo exchanges between candidates and donors, I find that
   fundraising competition may skew policy outcomes away from the center.
   High spending may signal policy extremity to the median voter, but
   candidates sympathetic to special interests either spend enough to
   overcome the bad signal or conceal their intentions by not raising money
   at all. Consequently, when extremists can raise money most easily, there
   is a tradeoff between information disclosure and policy
   representativeness: the chance of electing a centrist is highest when
   candidates' spending decisions do not reveal their policy intentions. A
   key policy implication of the model is that campaign finance reforms
   that raise the opportunity cost of fundraising, such as individual
   contribution caps, never reduce (and sometimes increase) the chance of
   electing a centrist, even when the fundraising advantage is associated
   with centrism rather than extremism.},

Abstract = {The Civil Code of the Russian Federation regulates the use of various
   measures to protect violated rights and interests: first, these include
   universal methods for protecting civil rights (article 12 of the Civil
   Code); second, these include provisions of Chapter 25 of the Civil Code
   regarding the liability for violating one's obligations; both of them
   jointly comprising the institution of protection of civil rights. This
   article studies the issue of consequences for violating a party's duties
   under a loan agreement. The article differentiates safeguarding measures
   and liability measures to be used in case of an offense. The article
   also makes a conclusion regarding whether such differentiation is
   appropriate. Based on such differentiation, we analyze Paragraph 1 of
   Chapter 42 of the Civil Code of the Russian Federation.},

Volume = {29},
Number = {3},
Pages = {299-317},
Abstract = {Women's descriptive underrepresentation in parliaments is traditionally
   presented as the result of a process that discards women as they move up
   the ladder of recruitment. In this article, the case of Denmark is used
   to demonstrate an alternative hourglass pattern where women's presence
   does decrease in the early phases but increase in the later phases.
   There are fewer women among party members than among party voters, and
   fewer women among potential candidates than among party members.
   However, there is a higher share of women among nominated candidates
   than among potential candidates, and women are more likely than men to
   get elected. This hourglass pattern is found at the aggregate level as
   well as across political party and over time. There are two implications
   of this finding: (1) the traditional pyramidal pattern cannot be taken
   for granted, and (2) in countries where women's representation follows
   an hourglass shape, scholars and advocates alike should focus on
   membership recruitment by political parties and on internal party
   processes that aim to develop party members' willingness to run for
   political office prior to the formal nomination process.},

Abstract = {Since the early 1990s, one million people have emigrated to Israel from
   the Soviet Union and its successor states. When majorities are slim,
   their votes have a major influence over the outcome of elections. Over
   the past 30 years, a third of them have voted for an immigrant party; in
   particular, in the last 15 years, for Yisrael Beitenu led by Avigdor
   Liebermann. These voters are of above-average age, with lower levels of
   education and lower incomes compared to immigrants to Israel overall,
   and live away from the centre of the country. A further third voted for
   moderate right-wing parties, particularly Likud. There is almost no
   support for religious parties. Within this group, the level of
   popularity of the left-wing parties has decreased more markedly than
   among the population overall.},

Journal = {STATE CRIME},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {8},
Number = {2},
Pages = {241-269},
Abstract = {This article argues that Myanmar's authorities subject the Rohingya to
   human rights violations that can be accurately described as the crime of
   apartheid. Myanmar's discriminatory application of its citizenship laws
   and processes is central to this crime, yet while Myanmar is not a
   signatory to the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court, the
   court's jurisdiction remains limited. However, Myanmar's government has
   brought this crime to the territory of International Criminal Court
   (ICC) member state Bangladesh. Because Myanmar's government insists upon
   Rohingya participation in discriminatory citizenship processes as a
   precondition of refugee repatriation to Myanmar, this presents the ICC
   with an opportunity to assert its jurisdiction. While current ICC
   investigation focusses mostly on alleged crimes committed by the Myanmar
   military, crimes associated with Myanmar's citizenship processes would
   likely be the responsibility of Myanmar's civilian government, including
   State Counsellor Aung San Suu Kyi, making Myanmar's civilian political
   leaders liable for the first time to ICC prosecution.},

Abstract = {We use two original surveys (including survey experiments) conducted the
   week before the 2015 elections in the Britain and Denmark to explore the
   best method for measuring individuals' knowledge of the partisan
   distribution of legislative seats in multiparty democracies. The
   complete lack of such questions in the corpus of survey research on
   multi party democracies is a testament to the skepticism that many
   survey researchers have about the feasibility of such complex questions.
   However, our analysis, which is the first empirical test of this
   skepticism, reveals little evidence of respondents' frustration or high
   levels of non-cooperation with these questions. Additionally, our survey
   experiments, which examine the usefulness of different question formats,
   make it clear that such questions should be framed in terms of the
   numbers of seats each party holds rather than shares or percentages of
   seats.},

Abstract = {The article deals with topical aspects of Chinese-Russian relations, in
   the context of regional security and cooperation in Northeast. Asia. The
   author implies that relations between the two countries are of key
   importance for mutual security and development, and also play a decisive
   role in politics, security, economic cooperation and stability in
   Northeast Asia.
   Current Chinese-Russian relations have such basic features, as mutual
   respect and equal political dialogue; non-alignment, non-confrontation,
   not targeting third parties, absence of ideological motivation;
   cooperation and win-win approach as a long-term driving force for the
   development of the bilateral relations; `always friends and never
   enemies' as a basic principle.
   The positive impact of Chinese-Russian relations on regional security
   and cooperation in Northeast Asia is primarily due to common or shared
   security interests of China and Russia in the region. China and Russia
   promote regional economic integration on the basis of their regional
   economic interests. Both countries also stand for humanitarian
   cooperation and exchanges in Northeast. Asia in tourism, education,
   innovation, etc. spheres which facilitate enhancement of mutual trust
   between the peoples of the region, and steadily strengthen the social
   basis for regional cooperation.},

   Attractiveness},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF POLITICAL MARKETING},

Volume = {18},

Pages = {240-266},
Abstract = {Given the focus of the media on female candidate appearance in the 2008
   presidential election, this research investigates the effects on voter
   evaluations of calling attention to female candidate attractiveness. The
   current research hypothesizes that pointing out candidate attractiveness
   likely has a negative effect on subsequent evaluations and reports of
   vote likelihood, particularly for female candidates. Role congruity
   theory, which argues that evidence of prejudice against female leaders
   is the result of a discrepancy between people's stereotypes of women and
   their stereotypes of leaders, provides an explanation for these
   findings. This study establishes the negative influence of calling
   attention to a candidate's attractiveness. In particular, a female
   candidate described as attractive are evaluated more negatively than a
   male candidate described as attractive and compared to male and female
   candidates, who are not described as attractive.},

Abstract = {The article is devoted to a relatively new issue of functioning of the
   so-called GONGO (government-organized non-governmental organizations) in
   the modern political system. The importance of studying this type of
   organizations and movements is due to the proliferation of the practice
   of using non-governmental organizations and ``non-state actors{''} as
   tools of the political struggle of internal elites and foreign policy
   influence embedded in the arsenal of mass consciousness manipulation
   tools, such as ``psyop{''}, soft power, color revolutions and more. Due
   to their specificity, GONGO have binary functionality, divided into
   official, declared, explicit functions and unofficial, latent. Their
   position in the political system is connected not only with obvious or
   latent engagement with loyal attitude towards the ruling regime, they
   also act as an instrument of state policy aimed at building civil
   society institutions in developing countries which are pursuing a
   secondary catch-up modernization. Thus, GONGO can be both an instrument
   of political reaction and a collective actor of social change. On the
   basis of teleology and the criterion of loyalty, GONGO are divided by
   the author into three types: ``Open Conformists{''}; ``Loyalists{''};
   ``Latent Loyalists / Nonconformists{''}. The author also identifies the
   functions of GONGO: diagnostic; communicative; adaptive; social
   selection; social integration; legitimization; mobilization;
   socialization; political, sociocultural and ideological expansion;
   suppression of internal protest and deviations; valuenormative
   morphogenesis. As an actual case of using GONGO, the events of the Arab
   spring in the countries of the Middle East are considered. The author
   highlights several reasons for the weakness of ``pro-Western{''} GONGO:
   the problem of resource self-sufficiency; weak ideological, religious,
   social and cultural agenda; low level of motivation of their
   participants, insufficient to confront highly motivated opponents
   religiously and ideologically. In conclusion, the author identifies
   signs of ``successful{''} or ``effective{''} GONGO.},

Abstract = {The contemporary expansion of images implies dramatic changes in the
   concept of public sphere. The article starts from the convoluted
   definition of the object of study of visual culture. The complexity of
   this definition makes approaches from that field of study remain diluted
   within mediocentric perspectives that prevent the analysis of the
   transformations that contemporary images provoke in public sphere. In
   order to develop a framework for the study of the articulations between
   image and public sphere, the article pays attention to some significant
   concepts of contemporary image and visuality, such as ubiquity,
   circulation, agency, and imagination. Finally, the article proposes to
   review the concept of public sphere understood as mobile,
   interconnected, and decentralized.},

Abstract = {The article analyzes Russian-Turkish relations from the 18th century
   until the 21st century on the basis of Vadim Tsymbursky's civilizational
   conception. The author notes that one of the ways of possibly developing
   this theory could be to analyse the role of Turkey in the European
   conflict system and the system of the Large Mediterranean. We put
   forward the hypothesis that the function of the Ottoman Empire in the
   European system had many similarities with that Russia had for the last
   three centuries - the function of the Eastern balancer in the
   continental concert of powers. The article reaches the conclusion that
   one of the factors for improving relations between Russia and Turkey is
   the ``ostracism{''} of these two countries by the Euro-Atlantic
   civilization which has become its ``political line{''}. Consequently,
   the rise of civilizational self-conscience, both by Russia and Turkey,
   should be recognized as, in many aspects, a result of ``pupation{''} of
   Euro-Atlantic community.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF POLITICAL POWER},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {12},
Number = {2},
Pages = {276-292},
Abstract = {South Africa has high levels of visible protest, which occur in parallel
   with less visible forms of protest. This paper considers the quieter
   forms of resisting in Durban drawing from two cases studies: informal
   street traders and shack dwellers. It applies Scott's concept of
   `everyday resistance' and Bayat's notion of `quiet encroachment'. Street
   traders represent an `invisible' power, preferring to avoid engagements
   with authorities and undermining power structures through a repertoire
   of daily trading tactics. Shack dwellers are more of a `visible' power
   where protest is entrenched as part of the settlement `culture'
   reflecting an `offensive'.},

Abstract = {Two powerful arguments have been raised against the notion of
   self-ownership. One is that a robust right of self-ownership makes too
   many things impermissible. In particular, it is argued that the concept
   yields deeply counter-intuitive results when we consider trivial
   infringements such as very mild pollution or trivial risks such as
   having planes fly overhead. The other is that if we are to advance a
   plausible theory of self-ownership, then libertarians must make rights
   infringements fungible for social good. But avoiding this weighing and
   compromising is seen by many libertarians as a key attraction of their
   view. If these arguments are correct, then it seems that any plausible
   libertarianism, if we can still call it that, will be weak indeed. In
   this paper, I argue that both of these claims are false and in doing so
   I seek to rescue self-ownership from these objections.},

Abstract = {This article examines the political use of history as construction of
   traditions, concentrating on the identity building surrounding the
   National Day commemorating the Revolution of 1956 (23rd October) in
   Hungary. The study analyses public discourse, represented by Hungarian
   newspapers, related to the commemorations. Our discussion draws on three
   ideal types: 1996 (Hungary's new democracy), 2006 (renewal of historical
   conflict) and 2016 (legitimisation of the administration). We claim that
   the question is not merely of an invention of tradition but a separation
   between legacy and tradition. Whereas legacy is given, although not
   always remembered, traditions can be selected and commemorated.},

Abstract = {Legal policy is a transformation of political goals into state programs
   and projects and achievement of such goals based on law. Nowadays the
   problem of effectiveness of legal policy is extremely discussable.
   We should underline that for the role of law in Russian society
   increases as well as a flow of legal information. Various legal acts
   have been adopted and the new system of legal regulation in different
   spheres (in particular, in politic sphere) is emerging. As the result
   our society, individuals and legal entities have more actively began
   using ``Law{''} to solve their problems, to protect their rights, to
   resolve conflicts.
   But narrow-minded and weak legal policy with the inappropriate
   legislation is continuously being reflected in the unsatisfactory
   implementation of social, economy and etc. policies. So, the
   effectiveness of legal policy determines, inter alia, how effective are
   the legal policy entities. Some of them take part in all forms of legal
   policy realization, some of them are active only in particular form.
   This research helps to understand the peculiarities of the role of legal
   policy entities.},

Abstract = {This paper uses the Repertory Grid method to investigate the influence
   of political (European Union-specific) knowledge on perceptions of the
   legitimacy of the European Union. The aim of the study is firstly
   methodological. It is intended to test the significance of political
   knowledge on the object of investigation as a possible limitation of the
   Repertory Grid method. Here, the result shows the suitability of the
   method to represent not only rational decisions but also intuitive
   decisions in an integrative way. Second, in a still underdeveloped field
   of research, hypotheses are developed on the influence of political
   knowledge on perceptions of legitimacy. The data collected in a
   preliminary study provide indications that the importance of democratic
   norms and values for evaluating the legitimacy of national and European
   institutions is increasing, but at the same time criticism of the
   political system is also increasing and the perception of legitimacy is
   thus decreasing.},

Pages = {21-32},
Abstract = {The article analyzes the meanings of the term ``public diplomacy{''} in
   contemporary diplomatic theory and practice and tries to find its
   suitable definition. It is concluded, that public diplomacy should be
   defined as a complex of activities carried out or supported by a state
   which focuses on influencing public opinion abroad with the aim of
   reaching or promoting a certain foreign policy goal. In this context,
   public diplomacy should not be confused with government public relations
   and foreign propaganda. It is argued that while the former is, unlike
   public diplomacy, targeted on domestic public primarily and its aim is
   to inform rather than to influence the citizens, the latter uses the
   means of communication based on one-way messaging rather than dialogue.},

   NGOs in transnational advocacy},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CIVIL SOCIETY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {15},
Number = {2},
Pages = {99-122},
Abstract = {This article integrates previous research on NGO behaviour with economic
   theory on collective action to create a generalizable and predictive
   model of advocacy campaign growth. It identifies three types of goods
   which NGOs may pursue in advocacy: unlimited, non-rival (public) goods;
   rival and excludable (private) goods; and rival but non-excludable
   goods. It then models an individual NGO's decision to (not) join an
   existing advocacy campaign using a cost-benefit analysis conditioned by
   the presence or absence of competition for the good(s) sought by the
   NGO. This model of individual behaviour forms the basis for predicting
   collective action among NGOs with varying cost structures and pursuing a
   variety of rival and non-rival goods. The theory is illustrated using
   two cases of NGOs campaigning on World Bank policy.},

Abstract = {Since at least Cicero, we have known that ``money is the sinew of
   war.{''} Is it possible for a political economy of security (PES)
   subfield to contribute knowledge beyond Cicero's claim? This article
   aims to delineate the boundaries of a PES subfield by using the classic
   ``guns versus butter{''} trade-off to define the existing literature
   within the subfield. Thinking seriously about this trade-off, including
   conditions under which a trade-off may not exist, raises a host of
   questions. The two most direct questions are: How does consuming
   ``guns{''} influence the consumption of ``butter{''}? And how does using
   ``guns{''} influence the consumption of ``butter{''}?},

Abstract = {The libidinal unconscious, as theorized by Slavoj Zizek, takes the form
   of a transhistorical ``real kernel{''} that returns as the force of
   desire, with subversive consequences for the discursive structure of
   language; individual praxis is cast accordingly as the genetic origin of
   social structures and the main dynamic in the transformation of society.
   In contrast, the ideological unconscious, as formulated by Juan Carlos
   Rodriguez, is ``secreted{''} by the social relations of production
   ``before{''} being formally legitimized within the State Apparatus. Far
   from denigrating human subjectivity, Rodriguez devotes considerable
   attention to theorizing the radically historical variants of the
   unconscious and also to exploring the contradictory structural forces of
   which this social subjectivity is deemed to be a condensation. The
   present essay aims to put both versions of the unconscious to the test
   of their objects through the close analysis of selected literary texts.},

Abstract = {In this paper, I argue that the perilous journey undertaken by many
   Mexicans, Central Americans, and other Latin Americans wishing to enter
   the United States without legal authorization (to which I refer as `the
   migrant journey') plays a key role in what I call socially undocumented
   or `illegal' identity formation within the United States. As such, the
   migrant journey perpetuates certain aspects of anti-Latina/o/x and
   anti-Native American racisms within US borders. Having established this,
   I then argue that the United States is required, as a matter of
   immigration justice, to render the journey to the US of `unauthorized'
   Latin American migrants less violent and inhumane. I conclude by arguing
   that other `migrant journeys' across the globe may present similar
   injustices, and I call for more philosophical and normative attention to
   the human movement that migration processes entail.},

Abstract = {What explains the American public's support for military conflict with
   North Korea? Despite increased rhetoric, few analyses address American
   public opinion or whether priming the public to consider casualties
   influences their perceptions. The results of an experimental survey
   design suggest that mentioning the human cost-even without explicit
   references to American casualties-reduces support for American military
   action against North Korea but not broader perceptions of North Korea.},

Title = {EPOCHS OF TURBULENCE AND WAYS TO OVERCOME THEM},
Journal = {POLITEIA-JOURNAL OF POLITICAL THEORY POLITICAL PHILOSOPHY AND SOCIOLOGY
   OF POLITICS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {92},
Number = {1},
Pages = {81-96},
Abstract = {The article is devoted to conceptualization of the phenomenon described
   by the term ``epoch of turbulence{''}. The epoch of turbulence is
   defined as a historical period when social and international conflicts
   become more frequent and aggravated, exacerbated by the increased
   violence, which is reflected in the social sentiments full of confusion
   and anxiety, intensity of insurrections, revolutions, and wars that
   affect the strongest states and violate significantly their internal
   social order, as well as the order of international relations. Epochs of
   turbulence occur at both regional and global levels. Due to the European
   nations' global expansion that started in the 16th century, epochs of
   turbulence in Europe are especially important, and by the 20th century
   they have become increasingly global. Six major epochs of turbulence can
   be identified: 1) 1517-1648 (Reformation and religious wars); 2)
   1789-1815 (Great French Revolution, the subsequent revolutionary and
   Napoleonic wars), 3) 1848-1871 ({''}Spring of Nations{''}, the Crimean
   War, the Bismarck Wars, the Paris Commune); 4) 1914-1919 (World War I,
   the Russian Revolution and the polemogenic revolutionary waves); 5)
   1939-1953 (World War II, Communist Revolutions and Korean War); 6) 2003
   - present (the current epoch of turbulence). The notion of the epoch of
   turbulence is included in the conceptual model of the coevolution of
   social, mental and functional orders. It is shown that each of the
   epochs of turbulence was overcome through the adoption of a new
   international order, new principles of the internal political structure
   of the states, the spread of novel religious, social, and moral values.
   On the basis of the factors that made it possible to overcome the epochs
   of turbulence in the past and documenting the basic causes of the
   current epoch of turbulence, the author delineates the contours of the
   international order that is capable of providing a solution to the
   situation of chaos and uncertainty.},

   a vast wave of European revolutions of 1848-1849 the imperial center
   (Vienna) and ethnic provinces of the Austrian Empire (Venice-Lombardy,
   Hungary and the Czech Republic) were taken for analysis. The factors of
   creating a revolutionary situation are clarified and the hypothesis of

Abstract = {Emanuela Ceva's Interactive Justice addresses the crucial need for
   dialogue between political philosophy and the field of conflict
   management. I raise two concerns. I ask how her procedures of
   interactive justice would cope with the Teri Schiavo case that she
   presents. Do they possess the type of generality justice seems to
   require, or are they necessarily particularistic, contingent, and
   opportunistic? I also question, here and more generally, framing matters
   in terms of value conflicts. Ceva's aim is to supplement political
   liberalism. I suggest her project can be developed into a more critical
   perspective towards that view.},

Journal = {POLITICA Y SOCIEDAD},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {56},
Number = {2},

Abstract = {Democracy seems to be very sick, but it has to resolve its original
   paradox. The institutional crisis and the ``populist era{''} require a
   new definition of what is democracy and which are the limits of popular
   power. However, the historical conflict between liberalism
   (constitutionalism) and democracy (popular sovereignty), as Chantal
   Mouffe declared, ought to be turned down. Democracy does not have two
   different and antinomian traditions: on the one hand, the legal face and
   its individual freedom as control of power, guarantees of fundamental
   rights, and subjection of constituted powers under one juridical order;
   and, on the other hand, the political side as identity between ruler and
   ruled, democratic paradox, and people-building and its vox populi vox
   dei. Moreover, if we want to defend our Democratic and Social State, we
   need to reject the mistaken doctrine of Spanish Constitutional Court
   about the relationship between rule of law and legitimacy. Thus, the
   definition of democracy must fight against the return of the people as
   unlimited will. Democratic system is also constitutional values and
   state integration wider the international order and its limits of
   sovereignty (ius cogens). In short, the democracy ought to be also
   understood as intangible meaning, or -as mere majoritarian and electoral
   power- the totalitarianism will win this final fight.},

Title = {DOES WASHINGTON HAVE ANY REAL STRATEGY TOWARDS RUSSIA? (Thoughts on the
   Monograph ``Russia and the United States in the Evolving World
   Order{''})},
Journal = {POLIS-POLITICHESKIYE ISSLEDOVANIYA},
Year = {2019},

Abstract = {Russia and the United States remain decisive players in international
   relations as members of great power club though America is the
   superpower. Relations between the countries exert influence on
   international development, solution of global and regional problems,
   other countries. Russia is seeking constructive interaction with the
   United States, America also seemed to have sought the same kind of
   relations, and however, it turns out that countries have dissimilar
   understanding of a constructive dialogue, its agenda, and terms of
   conducting such dialogue. It is often mentioned that the main source of
   contemporary state of affairs is misunderstanding/misperception. In
   order to improve the situation, the Russian authors of the monograph
   Russia and the United States in the Evolving World Order presented their
   view of such important problems as world order formation, structural
   trends in many countries and worldwide, policy of the United States and
   Russia in Asia Pacific region, integration in post-Soviet space, the
   Crimea case, Russian-American relations per se and their peculiarities
   in the 21st century. The American contributors analyzed history of
   bilateral relations, and showed how the messianic idea manifested itself
   in American and Russian (Soviet) policies. Reading this monograph,
   Americans can get a more clear idea of how Russian experts evaluate
   behavior of the United States, and how they explain Russia's actions and
   decisions. The authors conclude that though the issue of misperception
   and misunderstanding is often characterized as the main reason for
   aggravation of tension in bilateral relations the situation should be
   explained by dramatic divergences of Russian and American interests, in
   their vision of the future world order and its institutions. The United
   States refuses to change its strategy of constructing liberal world
   order with the use of military methods, and Russia refuses to recognize
   America's absolute right to consolidate America-centered order. Their
   positions make it impossible to have constructive dialogue and
   interaction. American actions bring instability into bilateral relations
   and relations with other countries, make international situation fraught
   with conflicts. The authors see their task in encouraging bilateral
   dialogue with their American colleagues, first, with those in the United
   States who are interested and willing to change the situation.},

Year = {2019},
Volume = {11},
Number = {1},
Pages = {104-121},

Abstract = {The persistence of tensions in Iran-Saudi Arabia relations is the result
   of negative emotional predispositions that have formed the identities of
   the Islamic Republic of Iran and Saudi Arabia vis-a-vis each other. The
   national component of the Iranian identity enforces disinclination
   towards Saudi Arabia, whereas its religious component is mired in a
   feeling of pain inherited from mistreatment that the Shi'a have
   tolerated throughout history. This pain translates into resentment
   against Saudi Arabia, a state seen as oppressing Shi'a populations. This
   is aggravated by the feeling of being humiliated by the western powers,
   with Iran's emotional perception of Saudi Arabia becoming more negative
   due to close cooperation between Saudi Arabia and the Western great
   powers. Saudi identity also inherits Arabism's reluctance to accept
   Iran. As a result, both countries live in an atmosphere of mutual
   mistrust and fear that explains the persistence of tensions in their
   relations.},

Journal = {POLITICKE VEDY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {22},
Number = {4},
Pages = {8-32},
Abstract = {In the last three decades Polish-Ukrainian reconciliation has taken a
   structured and regular form of an international dialogue dominated and
   controlled by central governments, which simultaneously diminished the
   importance of the local perspective. Yet, it is the regional level where
   the Polish-Ukrainian tensions have originally escalated at, and the
   local borderlands' communities have always played a crucial role in the
   inter-ethnic relations. That is why this article tackled the topic of
   Polish-Ukrainian reconciliation as framed by the Polish borderlands'
   elites, framing it with three dimensions of reconciliation: encounters,
   relationship, and innovation. It critically addressed the intractable
   tensions between Poles and Ukrainians in the borderlands, exploring the
   contemporary dynamics of distrust, narrowness and historical resentments
   which are continuously present in the local Polish narrative and stand
   in the way of reconciliation. The role of the European integration was
   viewed as an important context and a double-edged sword in the
   Polish-Ukrainian reconciliation. The article contended that it is
   crucial to look at Polish-Ukrainian reconciliation beyond the
   state-level and consider that without the involvement of the borderlands
   and their perspective, the process is still on a rocky road. The
   findings were based on primary and secondary sources, including
   semi-structured interviews conducted in the Polish-Ukrainian
   borderlands.},

Abstract = {In recent years we are immersed in a deep social, political and legal
   debate about the so-called surrogate motherhood. This practice, which
   consists of the implantation by in vitro fertilization or artificial
   insemination of an embryo in a mother, with which the parents of
   intention have signed a previous contract, with or without economic
   remuneration, implies a real conflict of fundamental rights. The present
   study intends, through the analysis of existing jurisprudence, to detect
   the rights of all the subjects involved and extract balancing parameters
   that guarantee the protection of those that must be prioritized, in
   order to guide the resolution of future cases and the design of policies
   in this area.},

Journal = {POLITIQUE EUROPEENNE},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {66},
Number = {4},
Pages = {170-193},
Abstract = {This contribution focuses on how two artistic texts represent precarious
   Europeans: vulnerable social subjects (citizens, inhabitants of
   Europe/the EU) who may be deemed ``losers{''} of the European project.
   These precarious people are seldom - if at all - represented as
   participants in the complex processes of Europeanisation. The texts
   analysed and discussed in this contribution are the Dutch novel Tascha
   by Mira Feticu (2015) and the French feature film, Bande de Filles by
   Celine Sciamma (2014). I argue that a critical analysis of these
   narratives enables us to probe open the category that constitutes
   ``Europeans{''} and nudges us to rethink who is considered to be
   ``European{''}.},

Abstract = {This paper deals with the Northern Sea Route, the Russian seaway, and
   its potential for maritime oil transport. The main objective is to
   determine if the Northern Sea Route might serve as an alternative to the
   current Sea Lanes of Communication used for maritime oil transport. It
   is concluded the route is not a suitable alternative to the current Sea
   Lanes of Communication, especially in light of the geography of oil
   production and consumption, as well as economic factors, legislative
   issues, and the undeveloped state of infrastructure. The Russian
   Federation, however, envisions the route as the next maritime highway.},

   projects spatialize the memory of Jewish and German presence in
   Stettin/Szczecin and map Jewishness in the urban space. Analyzing local
   memorial projects and autobiographical writings that address the Jewish
   past in Stettin/Szczecin, I investigate the particular conditions of
   urban nostalgia in the so-called ``Regained Lands{''} where the Jewish
   legacy is inseparable from the German one and where the rediscovery of
   Jewish spaces thus entails a process of cultural translation and
   ``overwriting{''} of contested spaces.},

   capital and civil society},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CIVIL SOCIETY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {15},
Number = {4},
Pages = {326-352},
Abstract = {Civil society research can be categorized into a school in the tradition
   of Gramsci focusing on social movements and a Tocquevillean school
   focusing on associations and social capital. The author reviews both
   schools' research on the Japanese case and analyse a number of
   pro-nuclear citizen groups built up by the Japanese nuclear industry.
   The author analyses their financial data and historical development to
   demonstrate that they have been built up as counter-movement by the
   nuclear industry. The author traces their mobilization processes to
   criticize the social capital approach. In Japanese political science,
   traditionally a dense web of hierarchical associations and ties of
   obligation have been seen as enforcing clientelism and top-down
   political control. This makes Japan an interesting case for the social
   capital approach. Social capital researchers have reinterpreted
   hierarchical networks as indicators of a strong civil society. Taking
   into account Bourdieu's notion of social capital challenges this view
   and supports arguments of state influence forwarded by parts of the
   Gramscian school.},

Journal = {NEW POLITICAL SCIENCE},

Volume = {41},
Number = {2},
Pages = {345-359},
Abstract = {The question of ontology in thinking about global order(s) remains
   largely unexplored in International Relations (IR) theory. By reviewing
   the Heideggerian ontological difference and Laclauian postfoundational
   outlook, this article reconstructs how to conceive of global order(s)
   from an ontological perspective. The logical conjunction of the strictly
   philosophical and the political in Heideggerian-Laclauian
   postfoundational thought leads to two central claims:
   (1) An ontology of order is impossible because order has not per se a
   factual side or an essence. Rather, order is always only a contingent
   manifestation of the historically specific investment of its ordering
   function.
   (2) There can be no ontologically prior universal order. Yet an always
   already failing structuration is not necessarily a failure in its
   negative connotation. Going beyond the confines of ontological fixity,
   the failing global order(s) come(s) to terms with challenges of
   politicization, decision, responsibility, and the need for political
   contestation.},

Abstract = {Rulemaking is a critical part of American government and governance.
   This article reviews the political underpinnings of modern rulemaking.
   Specifically, it highlights the process and impact of agency
   regulations, as well as the key tools used by the legislature, elected
   executive, and courts to oversee the rulemaking process. The article
   also reviews who participates in the rulemaking process, as well as who
   influences regulatory content. Finally, new directions in regulatory
   policymaking are explored, including data collection advancements, as
   well as the potential role for guidance documents as replacements for
   more traditionally issued notice and comment regulations.},

Abstract = {This research note presents EPAC 2017, a dataset resulting from the
   second round of an expert survey on ethnonationalism in party
   competition. EPAC provides cross-sectional data on the positions of
   (ethno-) national and mainstream parties on an ethnonational (also often
   referred to as `territorial' or `centre-periphery') dimension, as well
   as other important dimensions of political competition. The 2017 edition
   covers 222 political parties in 22 multinational European countries. The
   research note presents the main survey items and performs a series of
   validity and reliability tests on the data. Results show that EPAC 2017
   provides valid and reliable measures of party positions on an
   ethnonational dimension. A short analysis of party system changes in
   Spain and Bosnia and Herzegovina illustrates the opportunities of
   combining the 2011 and 2017 editions. The combined dataset allows
   studying the mobilization of the centre-periphery cleavage in party
   competition across Eastern and Western Europe and over time.},

Abstract = {Can voters learn meaningful information about candidates from their
   electoral campaigns? As with job market hiring, voters, like employers,
   cannot know the productivity of candidates, especially challengers, when
   they elect them. The real productivity of representatives only reveals
   itself after the election. We explore if the information revealed during
   the ``hiring process{''} is a good signal of the legislative effort of
   elected representatives. In the incomplete information environment of
   election campaigns, candidates should turn to credible signals to
   indicate their ``type{''} to voters. Campaigns-and campaigning-are means
   by which candidates can, in principle, signal their motivations to
   voters. Is a candidate's behavior on the campaign trail informative
   about his or her behavior and effort as a legislator? Does it, for
   example, reveal whether a candidate will be more hard working and
   legislatively active? Using evidence from the European Parliament, we
   show that campaign activity prior to the election is not related to
   policy-seeking behavior in the legislature post-election. The finding
   also holds in two national-level settings and across a variety of
   measures of legislative effort. Those who campaign harder do seem more
   likely to win the election, but campaign effort seems to provide a poor
   guide to what the winner does once elected.},

   Rethinking informal deliberative citizen participation processes},

Abstract = {German municipalities are increasingly implementing informal citizen
   participation processes, a form of participation that can be understood
   as an umbrella term for deliberative formats known and used
   internationally. Green republican scholars claim that deliberative
   formats could provide space for the crucial transformation of individual
   preferences in the pursuit of the common good. However, it is unclear
   under which conditions deliberative formats really allow for preference
   transformation. Against this background, I aim to contribute to debates
   about sustainability-oriented participation and green republicanism by
   arguing that informal deliberative citizen participation processes and
   thus deliberative formats dealing with sustainability issues ought to
   foster phronesis (political judgement formation) in order to facilitate
   preference transformation. The Aristotelian concept specifies steps and
   elements of citizen participation aiming at decision-making and action
   oriented towards the common good. However, since it originates against a
   specific historical and cultural background, it needs to be adapted to
   contemporary polity settings, for instance with regard to the underlying
   understanding of citizenship. After outlining the concept of phronesis,
   I propose necessary adaptations to the original Aristotelian concept in
   order to arrive at an updated version of phronesis referred to as
   `green' political judgement formation. Subsequently, I discuss
   possibilities for the practical implementation of phronesis and `green
   political judgement formation', before summarizing my findings and
   delineating further research needs in this field.},

Abstract = {This article explores diversity within top leadership positions in state
   governments, specifically, the role that position selection method plays
   in promoting the inclusion of racial and ethnic minorities into
   positions of power. We hypothesize that minorities will be more likely
   to serve in appointed positions as governors consider diversity in
   making appointments and less likely to serve in elected positions due to
   the additional hurdles for candidates of color. Using an original data
   set of state executive leaders from 2001 to 2017 from all 50 states, we
   find evidence that institutional design influences levels of diversity
   among state executive leaders. Racial and ethnic minorities are more
   likely to be appointed than elected to state executive leadership
   positions. In addition, we find that Democratic governors are more
   likely than Republican governors to appoint minorities. Ultimately, this
   evidence is important for understanding how institutional design can
   have consequences for descriptive representation, specifically for
   groups that have been historically excluded from political life.},

Title = {More or less equality? Direct democracy in Europe from 1990 to 2015},

Abstract = {Within the last decades, western democracies have experienced a rise of
   inequality, with the gap between lower and upper class citizens steadily
   increasing and a widespread sentiment of growing inequalities also in
   the political sphere. Against this background, and in the context of the
   current ``crisis of democracy{''}, democratic innovations such as direct
   democratic instruments are discussed as a very popular means to bring
   citizens back in. However, research on direct democracy has produced
   rather inconsistent results with regard to the question of which effects
   referenda and initiatives have on equality. Studies in this field are
   often limited to single countries and certain aspects of equality.
   Moreover, most existing studies look at the mere availability of direct
   democratic instruments instead of actual bills that are put to a vote.
   This paper aims to take a first step to fill these gaps by giving an
   explorative overview of the outputs of direct democratic bills on
   multiple equality dimensions, analyzing all national referenda and
   initiatives in European democracies between 1990 and 2015. How many pro-
   and contra-equality bills have been put to a vote, how many of those
   succeeded at the ballot, and are there differences between country
   groups? Our findings show that a majority of direct democratic bills was
   not related to equality at all. Regarding the successful bills, we
   detect some regional differences along with the general tendency that
   there are more pro- than contra-equality bills. Our paper sheds new
   light on the question if direct democracy can serve as an appropriate
   means to complement representative democracy and to shape democratic
   institutions in the future. The potential of direct democracy in
   fostering or impeding equality should be an important criterion for the
   assessment of claims to extend decision-making by citizens.},

Abstract = {Governments in advanced industrial democracies generally regulate
   foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows with two types of policy
   measures: entry barriers and post-establishment restrictions. This
   article provides an integrated account for the two types of FDI
   restrictions, which is largely absent in the existing literature. We
   argue that the government's choice of FDI policies is shaped by a
   compound effect of the incumbent's ideological orientation and the
   political influence of unionized labour. Although inward FDI broadly
   benefits domestic workers, the entrance of multinational corporations
   (MNCs) adversely impacts the unionized interests of labour by
   transforming the labour market in ways detrimental to unions'
   wage-bargaining leverage. Leftist governments, driven by the preferences
   of their labour constituency, tend to lift entry barriers to FDI in
   order to promote capital inflows. At the same time, leftist governments
   may also need to address unions' concerns about inbound MNCs by
   tightening post-establishment restrictions on FDI, which impose
   constraints on the globalized business and operational model of MNCs. We
   argue that leftist incumbents generally liberalize entry barriers but
   tighten post-establishment restrictions when the level of labour
   unionization is high. We found evidence consistent with our argument
   from country-level and sector-level analysis of FDI restrictions, using
   a sample from the early 2000s to the mid-2010s of Organisation of
   Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries.},

Title = {The measurement of electoral competition, with application to Indian
   states},
Journal = {ELECTORAL STUDIES},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {62},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {We investigate the measurement of three distinct, but related dimensions
   of electoral competition in a majoritarian electoral system:
   contestability in the struggle for governing power; competition among
   candidates at the constituency level; and competition among existing
   parties at the level of the legislature. At each step, the analysis is
   made concrete by calculating our preferred indexes of these dimensions
   of competitiveness for 14 major Indian states from 1972 to 2009 (and
   from 1952 in some cases), while comparing them to others that have been
   widely used, though not always calculated for Indian states. We also use
   our preferred indexes to study the importance of the level of
   development for an understanding of how competition has evolved across
   the states. The paper concludes by posing questions about the
   measurement of competitiveness, in general and in the Indian case, that
   arise in the course of our investigation.},

Abstract = {Party capability theory posits that litigation success is predicated on
   litigants' experience as parties to lawsuits as well as their access to
   resources. The stakes are particularly high for disadvantaged litigants
   in asymmetric power relationships, such as those between government
   ({''}The Haves{''}) and criminal defendants ({''}The Have Nots{''}).
   Scholars have found that interest group participation via amicus
   curiae-or ``friend of the court{''}-briefs can reduce litigant power
   disparities in federal appellate cases, but it remains unclear whether
   the same holds in criminal matters before courts of last resort. As a
   starting point to understanding interest group behavior in state supreme
   court criminal cases, this study examines party capability theory and
   the extent to which, if any, amicus participation affects decision
   making that favors the government. Findings underscore the importance of
   interest group participation that supports disadvantaged litigants and
   the impact crime severity has on outcomes in criminal state supreme
   court cases.},

Abstract = {During the 2016 election cycle, both Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders
   received roars of approval from supporters when discussing plans to roll
   back decades of trade liberalization and more specifically North
   American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). In the past, protectionist
   politicians who failed to follow through on promises paid little
   electoral cost, arguably because NAFTA received relatively little media
   or political attention after it was passed. Now in the spotlight, could
   trade policies cost President Trump voters in 2020? I argue that the
   highly partisan nature of today's trade discourse - a new dimension for
   trade opinion - creates obstacles for electoral accountability because
   preferences follow rather than drive partisanship. Drawing on previous
   research and a 2017 survey experiment fielded before and after Trump's
   trip to China, I show that the ability of trade messaging to cross party
   lines has weakened and that Trump's followers strongly react to
   information cues from Trump but fail to react to information based
   accusations of flip flopping on his most prominent trade related
   promise: increased protection against China. The ability of politicians
   to shape preferences rather than respond to the will of constituents
   calls into question the electoral connection on critical government
   policies even when they become salient.},

Abstract = {This study aimed at investigating Al Balqa' Applied University Students
   attitude towards Jordanian woman's political participation in
   parliamentary elections. Researchers used a questionnaire in order to
   obtain needed data for the study. The sample of the study consisted of
   (1327) male and female students (589 male) and (738 female) students.
   The study posed the following questions:
   1) What are the attitudes of Al-Balqa Applied University students
   towards woman's participation in politics in Jordan?
   2) Are there any statistically significant differences due to gender,
   college education level, and residency variables?
   In order to achieve the study's objectives, researchers used various
   statistical analyses, such as averages account, triple t - test, and
   Shiva posteriori comparisons. The study reached the following results:
   1) Students attitude towards woman's political participation in all
   questionnaire items were medium with means of (3.68).
   2) The paragraph that read ``woman better able to understand the status
   of woman{''} comes in the first place with means of (4.35), and the
   paragraph that reads ``woman's participation in parliamentary elections
   increases herself confidence{''} came in second place with means of
   (4.17), and The paragraph that reads I support the election of a woman
   who has high education and culture came in third place with means of
   (4.14), while the paragraph that reads ``woman is well qualified
   physically and intellectually for political participation{''} came in
   the last place, with means of (3.06).
   There is statistically significant differences due to gender variable in
   favor of female student.
   There is no statistically significant difference due to residency; there
   are statistically significant differences due to study level in favor of
   fourth year students.
   There are no statistically significant differences due to college type.
   Recommendations are expressed.},

Abstract = {Will voters hold an incumbent more electorally accountable for the
   quality of a policy outcome if the incumbent's political responsibility
   for the underlying policy increases? To answer this question, this study
   exploits a reform of labor market regulation in Denmark that exogenously
   assigned more political responsibility for unemployment services to some
   municipal mayors. The study finds that in subsequent elections these
   mayors were held more electorally accountable for unemployment services,
   but not more accountable for other policy outcomes. This suggests that
   the relationship between political responsibility and electoral
   accountability is causal, adaptive and tied to specific policies. On
   balance, the electorate thus seems to be quite judicious when assigning
   electoral credit or blame, moderating the extent to which incumbents are
   held accountable for specific outcomes based on the extent to which
   these incumbents crafted and implemented the policies that shaped these
   outcomes.},

Abstract = {With pressures stemming from the increasing dissatisfaction with the
   democratic deficit, the European Union (EU) has taken different measures
   for getting closer to its citizens. One such measure is the European
   Commission's funding of interest groups, which consequently encourages
   their formal and informal participation in EU policymaking. In this way,
   the EU also supports interest groups in their generating of expertise
   and giving valuable information to EU officials who are preparing
   legislation. In this article we analyse the main characteristics of
   national interest groups from selected Central and Eastern European
   post-socialist countries that receive EU money and at the same time are
   supposed to be supported with EU money vis-a-vis Western EU
   member-states to a lesser extent. The analysis is based on the data
   collected in frame of Comparative Interest Groups Survey project with a
   web survey that was conducted among national interest groups from
   Slovenia, Lithuania and Poland. The research results show that although
   EU funds are less important sources of funding than other sources, they
   have a substantial effect on interest groups in Central and Eastern
   Europe. Interest groups that receive EU funding have bigger budgets,
   better access to national and EU decision-makers and are more likely to
   lobby.},

Abstract = {In the system of multilevel democracy emerging from the Lisbon Treaty,
   the ordinary legislative procedure (OLP) embodies the idea that it is
   possible to have democratic law-making in a polity characterized by a
   plurality of organized demoi. This article takes stock of this idea by
   examining what role democratic aspirations played in the invention of
   the OLP and how this procedure has affected EU policy-making processes,
   legislative outputs, and political participation in critical new areas
   of market regulation. Though the OLP is no silver bullet for EU
   democracy, it embeds the EU policy-making process in a rule-based logic.
   Its democratic effects are intimately bound up with the evolving
   institutions of the so-called legislative trilogues.},

Abstract = {This article attempts to empirically test the claims made by several
   commentators that religious polarization was at the core of the 2019 Lok
   Sabha election verdict. Relying heavily on the National Election Study
   (NES) data sets, it finds that the election result was in large measure
   an outcome of massive vote consolidation on religious lines, with the
   majority Hindu community preferring the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led
   National Democratic Alliance (NDA) in unprecedented proportion and the
   main religious minorities largely staying away from it, although there
   were some exceptions. It shows that, for two national elections in a
   row, the Narendra Modi- and Amit Shah-led BJP has been able to overcome
   the caste hierarchies among Hindus and systematically construct a Hindu
   category of voters versus others. This chasm between Hindus and the
   minorities is also seen with respect to their attitudes regarding the
   government, its leadership and contentious issues like the Ayodhya
   dispute. This article, however, does not find sufficient evidence with
   regard to the claims that a large part of the Hindu support for the
   BJP-led alliance may have been on account of anti-minority sentiments.},

Abstract = {Ballot box voting is the main mechanism of political choice in modern
   liberal democracies. It is also often thought of as the essence of
   political freedom. Traditional voting has significant virtues. But as a
   mechanism for exercising political freedom, ballot box voting has
   serious flaws. The average citizen has almost no chance of affecting the
   outcome of an electoral process. In part as a result, he or she also has
   strong incentives to make ill-informed and illogical decisions. ``Voting
   with your feet{''} is a superior option on both fronts. It is thereby
   often a superior mechanism of political freedom.},

Abstract = {This research work is an inquiry into whether paths to power matter for
   the survival of ministers. Four different paths to ministerial positions
   are defined: `Parliamentary', `Party', `Public Service' and
   `Independent'. The theoretical perspective is based on both the ex-ante
   informational asymmetry and the moral hazard problem. A rigorous
   survival analysis was developed for the Portuguese case, and the main
   conclusion is that ministers who have attained power through the `Party'
   path last longer in government than `Parliamentary' ones.},

Abstract = {How does governments' ability to gain financing from oil income affect
   their behaviour? Numerous studies have explored the effects of oil
   wealth on countries' political characteristics, especially the level of
   democracy. Oil has also been associated with a significant electoral
   incumbency advantage across different political regimes. However, the
   relationship between oil wealth and incumbent governments' behaviour,
   including election-year fiscal manipulation, has been studied to a
   lesser extent. This article argues that higher oil rents increase
   election-year public spending as they provide national governments both
   with direct revenue and increased financing opportunities. However,
   fiscal transparency mitigates this effect. Consequently, oil-induced
   electoral budget cycles decrease as fiscal transparency increases. Using
   a high-quality measure of fiscal transparency in a panel of countries,
   robust evidence in favour of this argument is found. The findings
   suggest that many of the previous results on the political effects of
   oil, including incumbency advantage, might run through an election-year
   spending channel, and that fiscal institutions might matter
   substantially for the political effects of oil.},

Abstract = {While the feminist literature on social reproduction is broad and
   diverse, one area that has remained relatively under-explored relates to
   the linkages between social reproduction and finance, particularly
   between social reproduction and household debt. In our contribution to
   this Special Issue, we seek to document and to analyse the structural
   linkages between social reproduction and debt, with a specific focus on
   pawnbroking in early modern England and contemporary Pakistan. We have
   four main aims in this article. Our first aim is to contribute to
   feminist theorizing about social reproduction by showing both how the
   daily and generational reproduction of households has relied upon
   historically specific forms of credit and how these social relations of
   credit/debt have been central to the development and reproduction of
   capitalism in different times and places. Second, we show how particular
   forms of `everyday finance' are gendered and, specifically, how they are
   feminized. Our third aim is to elucidate the relationship between pawn
   loans, which have received almost no attention from feminist or other
   critical political economists, and the social reproduction of households
   in England and Pakistan. Fourth, we elucidate some of the gendered
   implications of the growing incursion of masculinized capitalist finance
   into new spaces of everyday life.},

Abstract = {In this paper, we analyse the causes that allowed social movements in
   2011 to transform into political parties in Spain and Chile. For this,
   an in from the premises of radical democracy regarding the construction
   of the antagonistic other and the notion of party-movement. From this
   framework is made a comparative analysis of the cases of Podemos and the
   Frente Amplio, carried out based on four political change dimensions:
   socio-economic conditions, political-cultural rupture, actions and
   discourses of hegemonic construction, and solidification of a
   generational break. Based on this analysis it is possible to verify,
   although with different intensity, that political and cultural factors
   existed that allowed to materialize in political parties the dynamics of
   opposition to the neoliberal social structure of social movements},

Abstract = {Multilevel regression and post-stratification (MRP) is the current gold
   standard for extrapolating opinion data from nationally representative
   surveys to smaller geographic units. However, innovations in
   nonparametric regularization methods can further improve the
   researcher's ability to extrapolate opinion data to a geographic unit of
   interest. I test an ensemble of regularization algorithms and find that
   there is room for substantial improvement on the multilevel model via
   more flexible methods of regularization. I propose amodified version
   ofMRPthat replaces the multilevel model with a nonparametric approach
   called Bayesian additive regression trees (BART or, when combined with
   post-stratification, BARP). I compare both methods across a number of
   data contexts, demonstrating the benefits of applying more powerful
   regularization methods to extrapolate opinion data to target
   geographical units. I provide an R package that implements the BARP
   method.},

Title = {Does Public Opinion Constrain Presidential Unilateralism?},
Journal = {AMERICAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW},

Volume = {113},
Number = {4},
Pages = {1071-1077},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Whether presidential unilateralism is normatively advantageous or
   parlous for American democracy may depend on the extent to which a check
   remains on its exercise and abuse. Because the formal institutional
   constraints on unilateral action are weak, an emerging literature argues
   that the most important checks on unilateralism may be political, with
   public opinion playing a pivotal role. However, existing scholarship
   offers little systematic evidence that public opinion constrains
   unilateral action. To fill this gap, we use vector autoregression with
   Granger-causality tests to examine the relationship between presidential
   approval and executive orders. Contra past speculation that presidents
   increasingly issue executive orders as a last resort when their stock of
   political capital is low, we find that rising approval ratings increase
   the frequency of major unilateral action. Low approval ratings, by
   contrast, limit the exercise of unilateral power.},

Title = {National protest agenda and the dimensionality of party politics:
   Evidence from four East-Central European democracies},
Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL RESEARCH},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {58},
Number = {4},

Abstract = {Contemporary democracies show considerable differences in the issue
   composition of their protest politics, which tends to remain relatively
   stable over time. In countries like Germany or the Czech Republic, the
   vast majority of protests have been mobilised around sociocultural
   issues, such as human rights, peace, nuclear power or the environment,
   and only a tiny portion of protest has focused on economic issues. At
   the opposite extreme, protest in France or Poland usually has a strongly
   economic character and voices demands relating to material
   redistribution and social policy. What lies behind the cross-country
   differences in national protest agendas? In this article, the national
   protest agenda depends on what issues mainstream political parties are
   contesting: the content and strength of the master-issue dimension. In
   reference to the literature on the multidimensional political space and
   niche political parties, one should expect that there is a substitutive
   effect; where the stronger a specific master-issue dimension is in party
   politics, the less salient that issue dimension is in protest politics.
   This substitutive effect results from the tendency of electoral politics
   to reduce political conflict to a single-dimension equilibrium, which
   decreases the importance of other issues and relegates the contest over
   secondary, niche issues to the realm of policy-seeking strategies, with
   protest being a common type of this political strategy. In party systems
   where single-dimension equilibrium does not exist and the master-issue
   dimension is weaker, the same dynamics result in a more convergent
   relationship between party and protest politics and a greater similarity
   between the protest- and party-system agendas. To investigate this
   theory, the national protest agendas in four countries are examined. The
   Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland and Slovakia show four combinations of
   two crucial factors that are not available in the old Western
   democracies: the content and the strength of the master-issue dimension.
   The study draws on an original dataset of protest events organised in
   the four countries between 1993 and 2010, and on qualitative and
   quantitative data on issue dimensions of party politics obtained from
   studies on party politics and expert surveys. The results show that in
   the Czech Republic, where the master-issue dimension has remained
   strongly economic, protest has been predominantly sociocultural. In
   Poland between 1993 and 2001 and Hungary between 1993 and 2006, the
   master-issue dimensions are strongly sociocultural, while protest is
   predominantly economic. There is no single-dimension equilibrium in
   party politics in Slovakia or in post-2001 Poland and mainstream parties
   compete on both economic and sociocultural issues. Consequently, the
   substitutive dynamics between party and protest politics is weaker and
   the issue agendas in party and protest arenas are here more alike.},

Abstract = {Why do regional security organizations choose different approaches to
   implementing global gender norms? To address this question, we examine
   how the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) and
   the European Union (EU) integrated requirements derived from UN Security
   Council Resolution 1325 (UNSCR 1325) on women, peace and security into
   their security policies. We identify differences in scope and dynamics
   between the change processes in the two organizations. The OSCE simply
   adapted its existing gender policy and has not changed it since, whereas
   the EU introduced a new, more extensive and specific policy, which it
   has already amended several times. Drawing on historical
   institutionalism and feminist institutionalism, we found that, first,
   reform coalitions prepared the ground for gender mainstreaming in the
   organizations' respective security policies; and that, second, embedded
   policy structures, including rules and norms about external interaction
   as well as existing policy legacies, were responsible for the different
   approaches of the EU and OSCE with respect to UNSCR 1325.},

Abstract = {This article is part of a series of investigations on the phenomenon of
   political clientelism in Galicia (Spain). The main objective is to
   verify the theoretical and empirical relationship between the phenomenon
   of clientelism and its funding through corrupt methods. The article uses
   a theoretical definition of clientelism and corruption as differentiated
   phenomena that can, nevertheless, become interdependent and overlapping
   at an empirical plane. This, in turn, gives rise to hybrid phenomena.
   The text proposes an analytical framework to explore the linkage between
   both concepts, especially when corruption becomes an instrument for
   financing patron-client networks. The paper presents the results of an
   original research based on three thorough case studies of clientelistic
   relationship where political corruption has taken place to finance the
   party machine and distribute favours.},

Abstract = {Communist regimes were avowedly leftist authoritarian regimes, a
   relative rarity among autocracies. The growing literature on regime
   legacies would lead us to expect that postcommunist citizens would be
   more likely to exhibit ``left-authoritarian{''} attitudes than their
   counterparts elsewhere. Finding that this is the case, we rely on 157
   surveys from 88 countries to test if a living through Communism legacy
   model can account for this surplus of left-authoritarian attitudes.
   Employing both aggregate and micro-level analyses, we find strong
   support for the predictions of this model. Moving beyond previous legacy
   studies, we then test a variety of hypothesized mechanisms to explain
   how exposure to communist rule could have led to the regime congruent
   left-authoritarian attitudes. Of the mechanisms tested, greater state
   penetration of society is associated with a strong socialization effect
   and religious attendance-and in particular attending Catholic religious
   services-is associated with weaker socialization effects.},

Title = {Intergovernmental relations on immigrant integration in multi-level

Abstract = {The study of intergovernmental relations (IGR) is a classical research
   area in scholarship on federalism and territorial politics. However, it
   has largely ignored the relatively new, and recently decentralized area
   of immigrant integration. The aim of this Special Issue is twofold.
   First, it aims to analyse how governments in multi-level states
   coordinate on immigrant integration. Second, it wishes to explain the
   dynamics that shape the features of intergovernmental relations. In
   doing so, we focus on four multi-level states; two of which are federal
   (Belgium and Canada) and two that are decentralized (Italy and Spain).
   Whilst we engage with the established literature on intergovernmental
   relations to formulate hypotheses about the nature and dynamics of
   intergovernmental relations, we also formulate less explored hypotheses.
   Our overarching argument is that the scholarship on IGR benefits from
   in-depth comparative case studies comparing IGR not just across
   countries, but also across policy areas and over time.},

Abstract = {This article argues that capitalism in general and social reproduction
   theory in particular must be understood through the body. Based on a
   study of hunger and starvation in Britain between 1830 and 1914, it
   maintains that the conflicting dialectics between the `freedom to
   starve' underpinning competitive labour markets and the `right to live'
   institutionalised by society's attempt to offset its worst effects are
   key for understanding how social reproduction orders are historically
   established and stabilised.},

Abstract = {New cohorts of students expect universities to meaningfully incorporate
   the use of technology-enhanced learning within their provision and they
   respond particularly well to an active approach to learning. One
   response has been for colleagues to make use of audience-response
   systems. The existing literature suggests that the use of these
   platforms allows for the adoption of active, student-driven pedagogy
   which creates a significantly enhanced environment in which to learn.
   This review explores one example of a new generation of fully online
   audience-response systems?Mentimeter. It outlines the range of new
   functionality offered by this new web-based platform which takes a
   significant step beyond existing card-based or clicker-based systems. It
   explores both the practical and pedagogical thinking necessary to
   optimize the introduction and use of Mentimeter, particularly
   surrounding the construction of pedagogically sound, higher order
   questions and impact of shifting away from instructor-focused to
   student-focused learning on the teaching session itself.},

Journal = {CONFLICT STUDIES QUARTERLY},
Year = {2019},
Number = {29},
Pages = {3-16},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Burkina Faso has suffered the numerous cruelties of terrorism, Ansaroul
   terrorism inclusive. Prior to their dormancy, two popular terrorist
   groups, the Ansaroul Islam and Jama'a Nusrat ul-Islam wa al-Muslimin
   (JNIM) had existed as the principal terrorists in Burkina and adjacent
   political entities. In some past years, the masters who had been behind
   the mask of violence in Burkina has been the Ansaroul. Believed to
   belong to a jihadist sect of the Mali rebellion and as well traced to
   the Al-Qa'ida, the Sahel area hosted this popular terrorist. The group
   has been responsible for far-reaching radicalism and cutting-edge
   violence within the Sahel, spreading its influence on the neighboring
   Afro Islamic countries, especially Burkina Faso. Against this
   background, this paper conducts an examination of the Ansaroul Islam
   activities. Inferences are drawn from secondary sources, thus articles
   which has already an about the subject of interest. The study will route
   audiences through analysis of literature to present the implications of
   related policies, their significance and consistency in giving a deadly
   blow to terrorism in the said region. However, the unrevised terrorism
   policies which do not align with provisions in a holistic international
   framework lacks the ability to break the shackles of terrorism on Africa
   and the global anti-terrorist society. Efforts to combat terrorism will,
   in the bosom of weak policies, remain infidel to peace.},

Abstract = {Party support has a strong influence on candidate success in the
   primary. What remains unexplored is whether party actions during the
   primary are biased along racial and gender lines. Using candidate
   demographic data at the congressional level and measures of party
   support for primary candidates, we test whether parties discriminate
   against women and minority candidates in congressional primaries and
   also whether parties are strategic in their support of minority
   candidates in certain primaries. Our findings show parties are not
   biased against minority candidates and also that white women candidates
   receive more support from the Democratic Party than do other types of
   candidates. Our findings also suggest that parties do not appear to
   strategically support minority candidates in districts with larger
   populations of minorities. Lastly, we also find no significant
   differences in the effects of party support on the likelihood of success
   in the primary by candidate race or gender.},

Abstract = {Committees are important vehicles for parliamentary careers both as
   means to a (ministerial) end and as an end in themselves. This article
   explores the relationship between select committee membership and
   parliamentary career by analysing committee membership and frontbench
   appointments for the 2130 Members of Parliament (MPs) first elected
   since 1979. We focus on two of Donald Searing's four informal backbench
   roles-Policy Advocates and Parliament Men and Women-and three of the
   four formal leadership roles-Whips, Junior Ministers and Ministers. The
   membership patterns of select committees suggest that MPs approach this
   aspect of their parliamentary work in different ways concomitant with
   the roles of Generalist and Specialist Policy Advocates and Good House
   of Commons Men and Women. The membership patterns also suggest that
   different groups of MPs-by party, gender and ethnicity-often (choose or
   are forced to) approach committee work in different ways. We also find
   membership of some committees is more strongly associated with
   leadership roles than others.},

Title = {The (de-) politicization of EU freedom of movement: political parties,
   opportunities, and policy framing in Germany and the UK},
Journal = {COMPARATIVE EUROPEAN POLITICS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {17},
Number = {5},

Abstract = {Freedom of movement (FOM) of EU citizens within the European Union (EU)
   has become a salient issue in some member states. In Germany and the UK,
   EU FOM prompted governments to tighten the residency and benefits
   prerequisites for EU migrants. Interestingly, these policy reforms
   prevented EU FOM from becoming a major political concern in Germany but
   not in the UK. Understanding the causes of this divergence can cast
   light on the driving factors behind EU de-politicization. Analysis of
   the UK case shows that several key factors, including rightist party
   ideology, political opportunity, and policy framing strategies, fuelled
   the country's critical debate over its EU membership. By contrast,
   Germany's successful de-politicization of the EU FOM issue can largely
   be explained by the absence of Euroscepticism in the government, limited
   political opportunities for mobilization, and the specific framing
   strategies used by the politicians who reformed EU FOM at the domestic
   level. Taking into account the existing scholarly work on
   politicization, this article provides an in-depth qualitative case study
   of the driving factors behind reactions to EU FOM in the UK and Germany,
   and discusses how to prevent the politicization of EU policy to turn
   into criticism of the EU polity level.},

Abstract = {China officially ended its one-child policy effective from 1 January
   2016. Yet the effects of the relaxation of birth control policy have
   been limited thus far. Largely relying upon policy incentives, China's
   policymakers also face pressure to take more direct measures to boost
   fertility rate. Whether the Chinese government is able to balance the
   needs of the nation and the citizens' private rights remains a big
   question mark.},

Abstract = {Parties may rely on different issue agendas when tailoring their
   electoral campaigns in an attempt to win elections. This paper compares
   two key party issue strategies to examine which one the victorious
   Austrian Peoples? Party (?VP) relied on the most during the 2017
   Austrian election campaign vis-?-vis its main competitors. These two key
   party strategies are the ?riding-the-wave? model, which posits that
   parties focus on issues that currently concern voters the most and the
   recent ?issue-yield model?, which instead suggests that parties adopt
   strategic behaviour targeting all those issues with genuine
   opportunities for electoral expansion. It is found that, compared to the
   other main parties in the 2017 Austrian election campaign, the ?VP was
   the one most clearly relying on the issue-yield approach. These results
   have important implications for our understanding of electoral
   campaigns, party?s exploitation of issue strategies, and voter
   representation beyond the Austrian case.},

Abstract = {The article examines the compatibility of agonistic democracy and
   populism as well as their relationship to the idea of constitutionalism.
   The first part shows that Chantal Mouffe's recent attempts to reconcile
   her normative approach of an agonistic pluralism with a populist style
   of politics are not fully convincing. Although there are undeniable
   commonalities between an agonistic and a populist understanding of
   politics - the appreciation of conflict, the rejection of moralistic and
   juridical modes of conflict resolution etc. - the populist mode of the
   construction of the people (and the denunciation of political opponents
   as enemies of the people) risks impeding the transformation of
   antagonistic into agonistic modes of political contest. The tensions
   between agonism and populism are especially evident in matters of
   constitutionalism. This topic is examined in the second part of the
   article, which provides some ideas for reducing the normative and
   institutional blind spots of contemporary theories of agonistic
   democracy. It focuses on elementary principles for an agonistic concept
   of democratic constitutionalism that differs from the populist view of
   the relationship between politics and law, especially in respect of its
   interpretation of the concept of `resistibility' of legal norms.},

Title = {How Emotional Displays of Political Leaders Shape Citizen Attitudes: The
   Case of German Chancellor Angela Merkel},
Journal = {GERMAN POLITICS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {29},
Number = {2},
Pages = {158-179},
Month = {APR 2},
Abstract = {The personalised format of TV broadcasts and more recently the
   self-presentation on social media platforms are seen by some scholars as
   enhancing the role of political leaders on public opinion formation. The
   visibility of their emotional displays could further shape citizen
   attitudes towards political leaders. As demonstrated by some empirical
   studies, American presidents often succeeded in improving their approval
   ratings by displaying positive emotions, but lost support when sending
   negative emotional messages. This article examines whether similar
   processes of emotional contagion occur in the different institutional
   and cultural setting of Germany. It analyses whether positive and
   negative emotional displays of German Chancellor Angela Merkel change
   the assessment of her general and specific leadership qualities among
   the recipients. Although the data largely support the assumption of a

   to Merkel's general evaluation and likeability ratings, but do not

   variation of the experimental setting, emotional contagion depends on
   the political context such as the co-appearing political opponents.},

Abstract = {President Trump is often at odds with the conservative establishment
   over a range of issues, not least of which is foreign policy. Yet it
   remains unclear whether supporting ``Trumpism{''} is commensurate with
   coherent foreign policy views that are distinct from conventionally
   conservative positions. We evaluate whether the foreign policy views of
   Trump's supporters, both in the voting public and among activists,
   differ from those of other Republicans. We use the 2016 ANES to examine
   Republican primary voters and the new 2016 State Convention Delegate
   Study to assess Republican activists. In doing so, we reveal systematic
   differences in foreign policy preferences between Trump supporters and
   more establishment conservatives. We demonstrate that the status-threat
   model need not be confined to domestic politics. Indeed, it may be
   extended to explain foreign policy preferences on the political right,
   that of Trump's supporters in the present case. In doing so, we also
   find evidence that status threat may well be the source of fracture in
   the Republican Party.},

Abstract = {Since his election to British Labour's leadership in 2015 Jeremy Corbyn
   has excelled in defying expectations. Labour's unanticipated surge in
   the 2017 British election is a compelling example. This article argues
   that Labour's success was the result of its construction of a vivid and
   compelling vision of a possible alternative future that could be
   realised by a Labour government. This was a far-reaching
   conceptualisation of a different type of society, invested with
   substantial emotional energy, presented as a realistic alternative to
   the status quo that could be built through practical and immediate
   political action. This article conceptualises this form of future
   imagining as the development of a `concrete utopia' as famously
   theorised by Ernst Bloch. It demonstrates how this concept was embedded
   in Labour's 2017 election campaign through consideration of its
   well-received party manifesto.},

Abstract = {This article examines the first two decades of the transregional Asia
   Europe Meeting (ASEM) from its inception with the Bangkok Summit of
   1996. Examining instances of region building and the socialisation of
   states, it identifies the gradual emergence of a role for the forum, one
   that stands in some contrast to initial participant expectations. In
   this respect, rather than a structure for delivering substantive
   negotiated outcomes around issues such as trade liberalisation, the
   value of ASEM across its first 20 years came increasingly to be seen in
   its ideational aspects: identity building, norm diffusion, and dialogue
   without preconceptions.},

Abstract = {Recent scholarship on the emergence of oligarchic trends in American
   politics focuses on the effect of the concentration of wealth on
   distributions of power in electoral politics. In this literature, the
   authors make claims that oligarchic organization of power will have
   multiple and far-reaching consequences for the organization of political
   institutions. In this article, we examine some hypothetical consequences
   for American federal bureaucracy, specifically bureaucratic control,
   under conditions of civil oligarchy. We focus on the challenges to the
   arrangement of bureaucratic control institutions that oligarchic
   concentrations of wealth might present. We demonstrate these challenges
   argumentatively and graphically.},

Abstract = {Since Nigeria's return to electoral rule in 1999, the People's
   Democratic Party (PDP) ruled the country as the majority party at both
   levels of its federal system until 2015. However, despite this
   dominance, the relationship between presidents and governors was often
   so divisive that the instability within the party threatened the
   stability of not only the ruling governments, but also the federation as
   a whole and undermined its productivity. This article examines this
   anomaly against the background of scholarship emphasizing the crucial
   role of federation-wide parties in fostering smooth intergovernmental
   bargains and in facilitating federal stability. It argues that Nigeria's
   recent experience provides counterevidence of this theory and discusses
   the mutually reinforcing contextual factors that might have influenced
   this development, focusing on the PDP's norms and the country's
   intergovernmental fiscal structure.},

Volume = {17},

Abstract = {Many explanations of the 2016 election result, a seemingly anomalous
   macrolevel phenomenon, have centered on two seemingly anomalous
   microlevel phenomena: many counties and citizens who had voted for Obama
   in 2008 and 2012 flipped and voted for Trump, and low-education whites
   gave more of their votes to Trump than to Clinton. In this article, I
   first assess the novelty of these phenomena by placing them in the
   context of past elections. Compared to past presidential elections, the
   number of flips in 2016 was not unusually large, even in the Midwestern
   states. In contrast, the partisan divide by education was the highest
   ever in 2016. Using a series of counterfactual analyses, I then assess
   whether these factors were pivotal. If the flipping counties had not
   flipped, Clinton would have won the electoral college by 3 votes, and if
   the lowest-educated 20\% of counties voted as they did in 2012, she
   would have won the electoral college by about 30 votes.},

Volume = {90},
Number = {3},
Pages = {402-407},

Abstract = {When the 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) was drafted,
   governments grasped that human rights are needed as safeguards, not only
   against authoritarianism but also against the causes of
   authoritarianism. For this reason, the UDHR encompasses civil,
   political, economic, social and cultural rights. This holistic vision of
   human rights was obscured during the Cold War and more recently by
   economic neo-liberalism. The UK government neglects social rights, which
   have a very low public profile, although there is evidence that the
   profile of these human rights is increasing. UK domestic law and
   practice is inconsistent with the holistic vision of human rights and
   the government's binding international social rights obligations. The UN
   Special Rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights recommends that
   the UK provides for `the legislative recognition of social rights' which
   can be approached in various ways. One way is to proceed social right by
   social right (for example, the rights to housing, health and education),
   and sector by sector (for example, the sectors of housing, health and
   education). This administrative law approach advances explicit social
   rights without implicating or jeopardising the Human Rights Act 1998.},

Abstract = {The 2015-2019 election period was long; hence, the election campaign had
   already begun when the Prime Minister called the election for 5 June
   2019, just 10 days after the EP election. Nine already established
   parties, one old yet unrepresented party and three new parties, two of
   which are (very) opposed to immigration, fielded candidates across the
   10 electoral districts for the 175 seats in parliament (excluding the
   four MPs elected in Greenland and the Faroe Islands). The overlapping EP
   election, climate and immigration characterised the campaign agenda. One
   of the new (anti-immigration) parties made it into parliament, and among
   the established parties, some were (more than) halved, others were (more
   than) doubled and some remained stable. In particular, the two
   government (supporting) parties, Liberal Alliance and Danish People's
   Party, received a slap in the face from the electorate. While the Prime
   Minister's party, the Liberals, did well, the majority shifted to left
   of centre, which resulted in a minority Social Democratic government
   headed by Mette Frederiksen, supported by the Red-Green Alliance,
   Socialist People's Party and Social Liberals.},

Abstract = {This article examines the dynamic between the wartime presidency and
   domestic policy advocacy. The Truman administration developed a strategy
   to rhetorically link themes and programs of social welfare and national
   defense, particularly as concerns about the latter emerged on the
   national agenda. I find that this practice of rhetorical linkage often
   involved framing Fair Deal objectives as critical to America's national
   strength. My conclusion is supported by archival evidence from the
   Truman Library. Rather than merely a rhetorical posture, it is evident
   that many Fair Deal advocates maintained the idea that a broad social
   welfare agenda was necessary to uphold American national security
   objectives.},

Abstract = {Approval affects congressional support for the president, with a
   reelection motivation the main linkage mechanism. Yet, the literature
   has not fully explored this linkage due to theoretical barriers and
   serious data limitations. Using a new theory and novel data, we argue
   that the impact of the reelection motivation should vary with contextual
   factors. This paper identifies two such factors rarely explored
   together: member party and chamber. We hypothesize that opposition party
   legislators will be more responsive to constituent approval than
   co-partisans, but this partisan differential will hold only for the
   Senate, not the House. We test our hypothesis on House and Senate data,
   from 2006 through 2012, using multiple regression poststratification
   (MRP) to measure district and state approval of the president. The
   analysis finds support for the chamber differences hypothesis that has
   implications for partisanship and representation.},

Abstract = {Members of parliament are accountable to both their district and party.
   Consequently, they have to balance their responsiveness to these
   competing principals when their preferences diverge. Existing research
   on this representational dilemma focuses mostly on the role of political
   institutions, whereas this article offers a new individual-level
   explanation: pre-parliamentary party careers. Using sequence analysis,
   three ideal-typical pre-parliamentary career paths are identified: the
   party local, the party functionary, and the party civilian. The share of
   party locals increases over time at the expense of party civilians in
   the Danish parliament, and these party locals are more likely to diverge
   from the party's position when it is unpopular among their constituents.
   These findings corroborate existing evidence of political
   professionalisation in parliamentary democracies, but they also suggest
   that professionalisation may be associated with a localisation of
   politics leading to more rather than less constituency representation.},

Abstract = {Why do voters re-elect the same party for prolonged periods of time even
   when there are reasonable alternatives available? When and why do they
   stop doing so? Based on a quantitative analysis of elections between
   1972 and 2014, we test the significance of `economic governance' for the
   continuance and fall of one-party dominance. With data from India we
   show that, under a command economy paradigm, a national incumbent party
   sustains its dominance by playing politics of patronage, but in a
   marketized economy, state governments gain considerable scope in
   managing their economic affairs. This enables different state parties to
   create a stable pattern of support in states. As state-level effects
   cease to aggregate at the national level, the party system fragments.
   However, such an aggregation can re-emerge if a single party
   consistently delivers in the states which it governs.},

Journal = {COMPARATIVE POLITICAL STUDIES},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {52},
Number = {9},
Pages = {1396-1424},

Abstract = {Economic and cultural factors are often presented as alternative
   explanations of Brexit. Most studies have failed to recognize the
   interplay between contextual economic factors and individual attitudes
   such as nativism and Euroscepticism. We argue that both economic and
   cultural factors matter to explain the outcome of the referendum.
   Economic factors are critical because they shape cultural attitudes.
   British citizens who live in economically depressed and declining
   districts are more likely to develop anti-immigrant and Eurosceptic
   views. These cultural grievances, in turn, explain support for Brexit.
   Using both aggregate economic and electoral data at the local level (380
   districts) and data from the 7th wave of the British Election Study
   2014-2017 panel, we find strong support for our argument that cultural
   grievances mediate the effect of long-term economic decline on support
   for Brexit. Our results have important policy implications, and suggest
   targeted economic policies are necessary to protect the ``losers of
   globalization.{''}},

Abstract = {Environmental changes in the Arctic region attract global attention.
   China, with its growing power, has been steadily increasing its presence
   in the region and in January 2018 published its first Arctic policy
   paper. At the same time, there are numerous actors within China that are
   interested in the Arctic and have the capacity to influence China's
   Arctic decision-making process. However, what is less clear, is how
   China's Arctic policy is being formulated across the Chinese government
   and what role different subnational actors play in its formulation and
   implementation. This research seeks to fill this gap. Drawing on
   fieldwork and Chinese texts, this study aspires to further develop our
   understanding of the workings behind Chinese state policy formation.},

   second-order elections},
Journal = {ELECTORAL STUDIES},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {60},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Why do many mainstream party voters switch to voting for niche parties
   in second-order elections? I develop a simple framework to explain niche
   party switching in second-order elections and propose that some voters
   defect strategically to niche parties as a way to signal the salience of
   an otherwise overlooked issue to their preferred mainstream party. Using
   panel data from the United Kingdom and Germany, I find that vote
   switching in second-order elections is more common among those who
   perceive a mismatch between the party they feel close to and the party
   perceived as best able to handle an issue of importance to them, as well
   as when they believe less is at stake and when they place much
   importance on an overlooked issue.},

Abstract = {Research shows that peacekeepers reduce conflict intensity; however,
   effects of deployment on nonpolitical violence are unknown. This article
   focuses on criminal violence and proposes a twofold mechanism to explain
   why peacekeeping missions, even when effectively reducing conflict, can
   inadvertently increase criminal violence. First, less conflict opens up
   economic opportunities (so-called peacekeeping economies) and provides
   operational security for organized crime, thus increasing violent
   competition among criminal groups. Second, demobilized combatants are
   vulnerable to turn to crime because of limited legal livelihood
   opportunities and their training in warfare. While UN troops may
   exacerbate these dynamics, UN police's peculiar role is likely to
   successfully contain criminal violence. Cross-national and subnational
   empirical analyses show that large UN military deployments result in
   higher homicide rates, whereas UN police, overall, moderate this
   collateral effect.},

Abstract = {Do radical right fringe parties affect main parties in Central and
   Eastern Europe (CEE)? Using data from the Manifesto Project, we analyze
   the relationship between radical right fringe parties' and main parties'
   policy programs regarding sociocultural issues in six post-communist
   countries of CEE. Even though radical right fringe parties have
   participated in government in several of these countries, and in Hungary
   a fringe party has become the country's second largest party, our
   analysis shows that the sociocultural issues in radical right fringe
   party manifestos do not systematically relate to the changes in main
   party manifestos regarding those issues. Even if some of the main
   parties in our study might often agree with the radical right fringe
   parties, our analysis shows that the latter do not directly influence
   the policy priorities of the main parties.},

Abstract = {Gender equality is firmly established on the European Union development
   policy agenda. However, a series of interrelated crises, including
   migration, security and climate change, are becoming more prominent in
   European Union development policy. This article asks whether development
   objectives have been subsumed under these crisis-driven European Union
   priorities, whether this is compatible with efforts to achieve gender
   equality and women's empowerment through development cooperation and
   whether it will affect the ability to keep gender equality high on the
   European Union's development policy agenda. The theoretical framework
   draws on horizontal policy coordination and nexuses. The analysis of
   European Union development policy documents shows how migration,
   security and climate change are constructed as crises, how they
   intersect in various nexuses and how gender intersects with each of
   these nexuses. This research finds that gender equality is absent from
   the migration-security-climate nexuses, which are increasingly driving
   development policy priorities. The article argues that it is quite
   straightforward to keep gender equality on the development policy
   agenda, but it is difficult to retain a focus on gender equality when
   multiple policy areas intersect. The research suggests that the
   discourse of crisis has blocked the way, and this will have an impact on
   the European Union's internal and external activities.},

Abstract = {Although scholars agree that ethnically divided societies are generally
   more prone to political violence, critics of consociationalism suggest
   that proportional representation and parliamentarism provide poor
   solutions for ethnically heterogeneous settings. I argue that extant
   findings about the impacts of powersharing institutions on conflict
   likelihood assume that institutions have a linear relationship with
   ethnic diversity, whereas in reality, the relationship is more complex.
   I demonstrate that proportional representation and parliamentarism are
   associated with an increased likelihood of civil conflict at mid-range
   levels of diversity but are associated with a decreased risk of conflict
   in more extremely divided settings, while federalism is independently
   associated with greater conflict risk at higher levels of ethnic
   heterogeneity. The results underscore that the peace-promoting effects
   of institutions may depend on how polarized societies are, encouraging
   scholars to think more seriously about the effectiveness of
   consociationalism for mitigating violence where there is greater ethnic
   diversity.},

Abstract = {This article presents an analytical framework that guides the
   contributions to this special issue and, in general terms, aims at
   enabling a systematic investigation of processes of negotiation in the
   international promotion of democracy. It first briefly introduces the
   rationale for studying democracy promotion negotiation, offers a
   definition, and locates the general approach within the academic
   literature, bringing together different strands of research, namely
   studies of negotiation in international relations as well as research on
   democratization and democracy promotion. The larger part of the article
   then discusses key concepts, analytical distinctions and theoretical
   propositions along the lines of the three research questions that are
   identified in the introduction to this special issue. More specifically,
   the article (1) offers a typology that facilitates a systematic
   empirical analysis of the issues that are discussed in democracy
   promotion negotiations; (2) takes initial steps towards a causal theory
   of democracy promotion negotiation by identifying and discussing a set
   of parameters that can be expected to shape such negotiations; and (3)
   introduces key distinctions and dimensions that help guide empirical
   research on the output and outcome of negotiations in democracy
   promotion.},

Abstract = {While Australian political studies often appears to have neglected
   engagements with Indigenous peoples and politics, we argue this is not a
   simple question of omission. In fact, the discipline is deeply
   implicated in imperial knowledge production and the authorisation of
   racialised colonial governance. As non-Indigenous scholars working
   within Australian political studies, in this paper we reflect on our own
   discipline in light of several decades of critical scholarship,
   identifying the production of disciplinary innocence through a
   theoretical and institutional analysis of Australian political studies
   knowledge practices. We explore this production via canonical
   knowledges, institutional processes that contain Indigenous people and
   knowledge to subjects of policy, and the operation of disciplinary
   divisions which neutralise scholarship on policy and political
   institutions.},

Abstract = {Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people navigate the social and
   political order of the Australian settler state in ways that seek to
   increase their personal freedoms and political autonomy. For some groups
   this means seeking a firmer place within the social, political and
   economic life of Australia, and for others it means navigating away,
   towards a more distant relationship based in the resurgence of
   Indigenous nationhood. This navigation is composed of multifaceted and
   multidirectional relations between Indigenous Australians, settler
   Australians, and the settler state. As a discipline, political science
   must move beyond the study of settler institutions and begin to engage
   more comprehensively in research that considers the dynamics and
   structures of Indigenous-settler relations as a matter of priority.},

   residential trajectories that led them to the neighborhood, and 2) the
   political dimension of a practice that organizes their everyday life in

   approach, it is proposed to analyze aspects of the network of
   relationships and meanings that mark life in the neighborhood, as well

Title = {Rebel Groups between Adaptation and Ideological Continuity: The Impact

Journal = {GOVERNMENT AND OPPOSITION},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {54},
Number = {3, SI},
Pages = {513-535},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {The question of how involvement in institutional politics and governance
   affects rebel groups' behaviour is pertinent when studying violent
   non-state actors, both during and in the aftermath of conflict. This is
   especially the case when participation in the political system becomes
   sustained over time. The interactions between the political and
   governance practices of a rebel group and its overall ideological
   orientation and state-building aspirations are not sufficiently analysed
   in the literature, especially in the context of hybrid armed-political
   organizations operating in latent, frozen or protracted conflicts. This
   article aims to begin to fill this gap by examining how involvement in
   institutional politics has shaped both Hamas's and Hezbollah's branding,
   interpretation and reliance on their own constitutive ideological
   manifestos, with an emphasis on both organizations' dynamic processes
   aimed at reconciling political participation with their previous
   ideological rejection of the legitimacy of the political system and
   their constitutive calls to dramatically restructure the political
   order. Based on these detailed accounts, this article reflects on how
   the complex relationship between politics, electoral competition,
   governance and ideological principles can shape an armed group's
   political identity.},

Abstract = {Notions of momentum loom large in accounts of presidential primaries
   despite imprecision about its meaning and measurement. Defining momentum
   as the impact election outcomes have on candidate support above and
   beyond existing trends and leveraging a rolling cross section of more
   than 325,000 interviews to examine daily changes in candidate support in
   the 2016 nomination contests reveal scant evidence that primary election
   outcomes uniquely affect respondents' preferences over the competing
   candidates. Preferences sometimes respond to election outcomes, but the
   estimated effects are indistinguishable from effects occurring on
   nonelection days. There is also no evidence that those who should be
   most receptive to new information are more affected by election
   outcomes. As a result, our investigation strongly suggests that election
   outcomes are not uniquely important for affecting opinions and shaping
   the outcome of nomination contests.},

Abstract = {In 2009, the governments of Brazil, Russia, India, China and then South
   Africa were grouped around the globally recognized BRICS acronym. Ten
   years after the creation of this block, it is worth asking: What
   benefits have each of its members obtained as a result of participating
   in this block? The purpose of this paper is to analyze the individual
   evolution of each of the member states of BRICS in order to specify the
   possible advantages that the block meant for each one of them.},

Abstract = {This article objective is to identify the determinants of the long-term
   exchange rate pass-through into domestic prices in the APEC economies
   for the 2000-2018 period. To that aim we develop a panel data
   cointegration analysis between exchange rates and domestic prices of
   different groups of countries, according to a classification based on
   price stability, nominal exchange rate stability, growing rates, per
   capita income, economic development and trade openness. We conclude that
   the exchange rate pass-through into domestic prices is an economic
   rather that financial phenomenon. As pass-through is mainly related to
   the economic development level, the best way to reduce it is an
   industrial policy that supports growth of some key economic sectors in
   the less developed countries.},

Abstract = {Incomplete information exacerbates the problems inherent in collective
   action. Participants cannot efficiently coordinate their actions if they
   do not know each other's preferences. I investigate when ordinary
   communication, or cheap talk, may resolve mutual uncertainty in
   collective action problems. I find that the efficacy of communication
   depends critically on the relationship between contributions and the
   value of the joint project. The incentive barriers to honesty are
   highest when every contribution increases the project's value.
   Participants then have a strict incentive to say whatever would induce
   others to contribute the most, so cheap talk lacks credibility. By
   contrast, when contributions may be marginally worthless, such as when
   the project has no value unless contributions hit a certain threshold,
   communication may help participants avoid wasted effort. Using these
   findings, I identify which collective action problems in politics might
   benefit from communication and which require more expensive solutions to
   overcome uncertainty.},

Abstract = {Many studies show that past and current economic conditions are strong
   determinants of citizens' attitudes toward government and political
   institutions. In this article, we develop a forward-looking theory and
   argue that economic expectations also drive the level of satisfaction
   with democracy. Crucially, we contend that this relationship is
   conditional: hope for a better tomorrow matters more to the poor and to
   those who live in less affluent countries. We use survey data from 34
   countries to study the conditional relationship between economic
   expectations and satisfaction with democracy and find that the allure of
   the ``American Dream{''} can be more or less potent, depending on one's
   place on the socioeconomic ladder. These findings contribute to our
   understanding of a fundamental aspect of political life: support for
   democracy may rest on a coalition between the wealthy and those who
   expect to become wealthy.},

Title = {The Relationship between the IMF and Borrowing Governments in a
   Theoretical Viewpoint. The Contribution of IPE Centered on Interests},
Journal = {DESAFIOS},

Abstract = {The ability to provide financial assistance along with its role as
   auditor and guarantor of economic programs provides the International
   Monetary Fund (IMF) with an important power resource when intervening
   countries that face external imbalances. Regardless, the mere imposition
   of policies of the IMI over the borrowing governments does not
   characterize their relationship, neither that the IMF invariably shows
   dissatisfaction with the countries' non-compliance. This paper proposes
   a theoretical contribution for analyzing the relationship between the
   IMF and the borrowing governments based on the International Political
   Economy's (IPE) contributions about the incidence of the interests of
   world power countries and the financial sector, bureaucracies, and
   domestic actors of the country. The framework of analysis also considers
   the contributions of the constructivist sociological theory about the
   characterization of the all , and the borrowing governments as social
   actors, the restrictive and enabling character that structures have over
   the agency, and their implications for autonomy.},

Abstract = {This is the fourth and final work on the Thomistic theory in a series of
   articles published by the author in this journal. The Thomistic
   Jusnaturalism of the twentieth century in the United States offers an
   overview of the strength and depth represented by American
   jusnaturalism. This part presents the various currents of thought and
   doctrines related to Thomism, its link with natural law, the most
   influential authors and their works and the distinctions and current
   debates among them. It also presents the main magazines, Thomistic and
   Medievalist congresses, which allow us to understand the importance and
   vitality of American jusnaturalism.},

Abstract = {Production of techno-scientific knowledge about the environmental
   impacts of a large-scale mining project is a central element in order to
   analyse the environmental conflicts generated by the extractive
   activities. The official reports are controlled and supervised by the
   State and the mining companies, thus the production of scientific
   knowledge about the project is essentially designed to support and
   legitimize the extraction.
   Although there are some participatory mechanisms linked to these formal
   procedures, local communities affected by extractive activities can
   barely influence the decision making process. Therefore, anti-mining
   movements seek for different alternative options to counteract the
   official scientific knowledge production. In this paper, I describe
   different processes of environmental participatory monitoring, where
   local population affected by the Mirador Project in Ecuador collaborate
   with NGO and independent research centres.
   I analyse to what extent this kind of process can actually be a form of
   ``counterwork{''} and active resistance to the mining project, a
   ``science of resistance{''} in the words of the anti-mining movement.
   Combining the interdisciplinary approaches of political ecology and
   peace and conflicts studies with the decolonial perspective, the
   analysis of this case reveals dilemmas and difficulties of resistance
   processes, but also possibilities of generating alternative ways of
   building scientific knowledge and transformation of the conflict.},

Abstract = {Populist discourse is conceptually antiestablishment. Extensive research
   has found that political dissatisfaction is associated with populist
   support. However, most tests have been in cases with populist parties in
   opposition. This essay asks what happens to antiestablishment populist
   supporters once their candidate wins a national election. I argue, based
   on cognitive dissonance theory, that these supporters change their view
   of which actors constitute the political establishment so that their
   leader is not part of it. The hypothesis is tested with survey data from
   Bolivia and Ecuador collected when two populist presidents (Evo Morales
   and Rafael Correa) were elected. Results confirm that populist
   supporters dissociate the federal government from other political
   institutions once a populist is elected president, and that this
   dissociation can last for a few years. This has theoretical implications
   for understanding how individuals continue to support antiestablishment
   governments, important in a time of populist victories in several
   countries.},

   alterities that resists the colonial-patriarchal-capitalist pattern and

   their re-existences, with the perspective of including a conceptual and
   rhetorical space for the constitution of an archive. Finally, from a
   militant research, situated from the epistemologies of the south, I take
   account in the ways in which the peasant-indigenous memory of the
   Argentine agrarian otherness persists, contained particularly in the
   struggle of the ``Union de Trabajadores Rurales Sin Tierra{''} (UST) of

Abstract = {This article seeks to describe and analyze the implementation of
   indigenous peoples' right to prior, free and informed consultation (ILO
   169 Convention) through a participatory process developed by the Chilean
   state: The `consultation of the consultation'. The procedure called
   Table of Consent was created in 2013, during the first government of
   Sebastian Pinera, with the purpose of co-elaborating with indigenous
   peoples the regulation of the application of said Convention. From a
   qualitative and ethnographic approach, which favors observation and
   interviews with civil servants and indigenous people who participated in
   this procedure, we conclude that the consultation mechanism uses
   different types of arguments, and emotions have a fundamental role since
   they are mobilized proscribed or prescribed according to political aims.},

Abstract = {In many European countries, anti-immigrant sentiments seem to have
   spread following recent economic challenges. By drawing on relative
   deprivation (RD) theory, we establish a theoretical connection between
   economic downturns and anti-immigrant prejudice. We argue that the
   experience of individual-level relative deprivation (IRD) is comparable
   to that of social threat and social exclusion. We draw on a large body
   of research that suggests the experience of social threat and
   uncertainty leads to the perception of the world in ethnocentric terms
   and rejecting pluralistic belief systems. Unlike much of the literature,
   we focus on individual-level perceptions and distinguish between an
   objective and subjective relative deprivation. Given our focus on
   individual-level predictors, we also test for the effects of
   authoritarian preferences on the likelihood of anti-immigrant bias. Our
   study demonstrates that unlike objective deprivation, both subjective
   deprivation and authoritarianism have a significant impact on
   anti-immigrant sentiments. Furthermore, we find evidence that one
   component of authoritarian preferences, namely authoritarian submission,
   moderates the effect of relative deprivation on economic (not cultural)
   forms of anti-immigrant prejudice.},

Abstract = {This study investigates how antidiscrimination policy and related policy
   knowledge influence citizens' support for the democratic system and its
   institutions. The article argues that antidiscrimination measures and
   knowledge about rights to equal treatment foster perceptions of
   government responsiveness, which increase political support among target
   groups and citizens who advocate egalitarianism. Utilizing a
   longitudinal design and more valid measures to resolve causality issues,
   the results of the empirical models show that increases in policy
   knowledge over time systematically predict higher political support,
   especially among individuals who hold egalitarian values. Individuals
   who are discriminated against express particularly high political
   support in contexts where antidiscrimination laws are expanded. Overall,
   the results amplify the role of policy knowledge as a key factor in
   studying policy feedback effects.},

Abstract = {Despite their geographical proximity, common history, and joint
   experience with social segmentation, there is a surprising dearth of
   studies systematically comparing consociationalism in Belgium and the
   Netherlands. This paper aims to help fill that lacuna by discussing the
   similarities and differences between the two countries in this respect.
   The similarities range from the time period of consociationalism, the
   original cleavage structure, to the existence of cross-pressures at the
   organizational level. The most important difference is that geography
   always played a bigger role in Belgium. This was true even before the
   politicization of the language divide, but it also explains why Belgium
   entered a new phase of consociationalism after depillarization and the
   Netherlands did not. Both countries currently face challenges by
   anti-establishment parties against the elite cartel, which raises
   questions whether this is not inherent to consociationalism once the
   original social segmentation has eroded.},

Abstract = {This article examines Western Balkans/EU bordering and debordering
   practices through a borderscape method in the context of the
   geopolitical positionality and (de)institutionalization of migrant
   housing in Serbia. From this perspective, a new `border variation' can
   be seen emerging after the securitarian turn, transforming the external
   borderscape of the EU into a space of circular movement. The article
   sheds light on discourses, practices and places that constitute these
   spaces of circular movement within the EU external borderscape. In
   particular, the Western Balkans borderscape is investigated with
   reference to Serbian migrant housingscapes emerging at the intersection
   of state-run camps and migrant collective self-organized squatted
   housing. The focus on migrant housingscapes points to the
   interconnectedness of camps and squats in the process of facilitating
   circular movement by the state, the production of mobile commons as a
   debordering practice, and the production of visual representations of
   the external border as stabilized `scape' for the EU.},

Abstract = {To better understand the role of local news in voters' opinions of
   candidates, we ask whether candidate coverage in local news sources
   readily activates race and gender stereotypes in voters' opinions of
   presidential primary candidates? We conduct an original content analysis
   of local newspaper coverage of Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama during
   the 2008 presidential primary season. We code 1,849 news articles in 11
   battleground and early primary states to evaluate how local news
   coverage frames issues of race and gender for each candidate. Then we
   utilize the 2008 Cooperative Campaign Analysis Project (CCAP) to match
   primary voters with their local news content. We find considerable
   variation in local news coverage of candidates' race and gender across
   states. While local news coverage frames Obama and Clinton in terms of
   race and gender issues, we find that race is covered more frequently. In
   addition, we find that as news coverage of gender issues increases,
   voters are not less likely to characterize Clinton as a strong leader.
   However, as local news focuses more readily on Obama's race, voters are
   less likely to consider him trustworthy. These findings illustrate the
   power of local news media to activate stereotypes related to race and
   gender.},

Abstract = {Pushing back against an extractive approach to research to center
   relationships, this paper draws from ethnographic sensibilities and
   community vignettes to discuss what academic-activists and political
   scientists can learn from communities' situated bodies of knowledge.
   Tensions emerge when those most directly affected by public policy
   decisions are excluded from the decision-making process. Consultation
   leaves many encountering a paradox: their lived experiences are
   discredited even when they are invited to participate. This paper offers
   an imaginative approach to the design of participatory policy processes
   and asks: how can decision-makers meaningfully engage affected parties
   in pursuit of environmentally just policy creation? In response, this
   paper argues that bodies generally, and guts specifically, are
   political. To do so, I flesh out how a sensing policy approach to public
   engagement and socially engaged research can assist those crafting
   policies - including, laws, programs and service-delivery - to address
   contentious multilayered environmental justice issues. These include
   concerns for more-than-human life. Reflecting on experiences of
   community-engagement with Indigenous communities in Canada and
   HawaiModified Letter Turned Commai, sensing policy builds from
   interpretive methods and intersectionality-based policy analysis to
   inform and potentially improve decision-making processes by taking
   seriously the experiences, knowledges and voices of those most affected
   by the government (in)decisions.},

Abstract = {Beginning with the economic crisis in 2008, a number of European
   societies witnessed the emergence of `new parties'. Most authors explain
   their electoral appeal by focusing on how the perceived state of the
   economy influences individuals' voting decisions. This article
   determines the extent to which political attitudes can also explain
   voting for new political parties born in the heat of the economic
   crisis. Specifically, it explores the link between populist attitudes,
   in contrast to pluralist and elitist attitudes, and voting for two new
   political parties in Spain (Ciudadanos; Podemos), which are noticeably
   different in their ideological positions, programmatic proposals and
   populist discourses. The results show that stronger populist attitudes
   increase the likelihood of voting for new parties as dissimilar as
   Podemos and Ciudadanos. Overall, the findings suggest that voting for
   new parties cannot be understood as a mere economic response. Rather,
   political factors, and especially populist attitudes, matter too.},

Abstract = {The widespread view that the refugee crisis has sparked unprecedented
   levels of European Union politicisation has rarely been backed by
   systematic empirical evidence. We investigate this claim using a novel
   dataset of several thousand user comments posted below articles of
   German regional media outlets on Facebook. Despite considerable European
   Union authority in the policy area, extensive media coverage of the
   crisis and the rise of a populist party in Germany, our results suggest
   that the politicisation of Europe remains low among social media users,
   especially when compared to national and subnational levels of
   governance. When talking about Europe, users hardly refer to European
   Union institutions or policies. Instead, other member states and notions
   of the geographic or cultural space dominate the debate.},

Abstract = {Despite the large number of studies on asylum burden-sharing, there is
   still no consensus on the most effective method for reducing
   cross-country inequalities. A benchmark model for equitable distribution
   could combine the Gini coefficient method with the `asylum
   multi-criteria index', based on the country's gross domestic product,
   population and territory. The method is implemented to measure the
   inequalities in the distribution of asylum-seekers among 30 European
   countries over a five-year period and solve an optimisation problem in
   2017. The findings show that the unequal distribution worsened with the
   increase in the number of asylum-seekers while the optimisation model
   led to an approximate 60\% reduction in the cross-country inequality in
   burden-sharing relative to the actual distribution. The results are
   compared with the burden-sharing formula proposed by the European
   Commission in 2015.},

Abstract = {This study examines the association between self-reported health and the
   propensity for supporting citizens' initiatives in Finland. Democratic
   innovations such as the citizens' initiative provide novel ways for
   citizens to express their preferences, but whether people in poor health
   make use of such possibilities remains unclear. The data come from the
   Finnish National Election Study (FNES2015), a cross-sectional
   representative sample of the Finnish population. The results suggest
   that self-reported health affects the propensity to sign citizens'
   initiatives, but the effect depends on age since it mobilizes young
   citizens in poor health, whereas the impact on older generations is
   negligible.},

Abstract = {In this article we propose to analyze the activity of a group of people,
   residents of a neighborhood in the south of the city of Buenos Aires,
   who make insecurity their area of intervention, exercise and ``work{''},
   whom we call alert neighbors. From a qualitative perspective based on
   in-depth interviews with those involved in the process studied, and
   participatory observation in the scenarios where they circulate, we
   describe the profiles of the alert neighbors, the repertoire of
   activities that they carry out, the relationships they establish among
   themselves and with other actors, the bonds of coordination and conflict
   that they establish in this course, as well as the situations of
   interaction in which this role comes into play. We find that there is a
   shared repertoire of activities performed by these actors, varied within
   certain limits. Also, that the role of alert neighbor is subject to
   constant negotiation and redefinition, in the instances of meeting with
   various institutional authorities in charge of security.},

Abstract = {The OSCE has until now been the only security organization which
   directly participated in the effort to de-escalate the war in Eastern
   Ukraine. As cultural approaches to strategic studies can be also applied
   to international organizations, this study argues that the OSCE was
   involved in the attempt to stabilize and resolve the situation partly
   due to its specific strategic culture. We identify the specific features
   of the strategic culture of the OSCE as an example of regional security
   governance between `non-allies' based on the discoursive analysis of
   OSCE documents and demonstrate how these identified features were
   reflected in the activities of the OSCE in the conflict in Ukraine.},

Title = {EU politicization beyond the Euro crisis: immigration crises and the
   politicization of free movement of people},
Journal = {COMPARATIVE EUROPEAN POLITICS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {17},
Number = {3},
Pages = {380-396},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {This article explores the applicability of democratic functionalism as a
   theoretical framework explaining mechanisms of European Union (EU)
   politicization during immigration crises. Since most existing studies on
   the politicization of EU crisis situations focus on the Euro crisis, it
   is unclear if and how the politicization of EU immigration crises
   differs. Drawing on a 2011 crisis with legislative implications for the
   free movement of people in the Schengen Area, the article illustrates
   that immigration crises are politicized along exclusionary identities
   rather than along pro-/anti-European lines-as expected by democratic
   functionalism. Moreover, unlike in the Euro crisis, the 2011 case
   illustrates how the media can be instrumentalized by governments during
   immigration crises, with little political mobilization from the public.
   This case is relevant given the widespread politicization of the 2015
   refugee crisis, which conversely attracted close media attention and
   caused serious public concern. As it stands, democratic functionalism is
   shown to lack a conceptualization of how much and for how long an issue
   needs to be contested in the European public sphere for the mechanisms
   of EU politicization described by the theory to hold.},

Title = {The Impact of Social Transfers on Poverty Reduction in EU Countries},
Journal = {BALTIC JOURNAL OF EUROPEAN STUDIES},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {9},
Number = {1},
Pages = {157-175},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Available studies indicate a strong negative correlation between poverty
   and social expenditures in EU countries. It means that the country's
   at-risk-of-poverty rate tends to erode with increasing social
   expenditure. However, the studies have demonstrated that the impact of
   government spending on poverty may vary according to the sector of
   spending, how well it is targeted, and the way in which it is financed.
   Some countries manage to achieve a rather significant poverty rate
   reduction even with relatively low, in the context of other Member
   States, social expenditure (percentage of GDP). This suggests that in
   order to reduce poverty rates, it is important to consider not only the
   amount allocated to social spending, but also the areas the social
   transfers are channelled to. The article aims to analyse how the
   composition and the extent of social spending/transfers may affect
   poverty reduction in EU countries. The analysis showed that social
   protection transfers reduce the percentage of people at-risk-of-poverty
   in all countries, however, to a very different extent. Regression
   analysis demonstrated that social exclusion and family/children
   expenditure was found to be the most important predictor for a relative
   antipoverty effect of social transfers: even a small percentage increase
   in such expenditure allows quite a signifi cant increase in the relative
   antipoverty effect of social transfers.},

Title = {The Relationship between Foreign Direct Investment and Inflation:
   Econometric Analysis and Forecasts in the Case of Sri Lanka},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF POLITICS AND LAW},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {12},
Number = {2},
Pages = {44-52},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {There are several reasons why the dynamic interaction between FDI and
   inflation must be studied. First, Foreign Direct Investment is found as
   one of the important determinants of the process of economic growth and
   development of Sri Lanka Therefore, the literature empirically examining
   the causal relationship between the inflation and FDI is significant
   because the rate of high inflation affects the inflows of FDI inflows
   into the economy of Sri Lanka and slows down the process of economic
   growth and development. The main objective of this study is to examine
   the linkages between FDI and inflation in Sri Lanka for the time periods
   from year 1978 to year 2017. The dependent variable of the model used in
   this study is Inflation and the independent variable of the model is FDI
   (Foreign Direct Investment). The data used in the model are the annual
   time series collected from Annual Report of Central Bank of Sri Lanka
   The tools to analyze the data are graphical representation, Johansen
   Co-integration test, simple regression model, Residual Analysis,
   Stability Test, and Granger Causality Test. A long run relationship is
   found between the variables. The dependent variable: INF - Inflation is
   inversely related with the independent variable: FDI - Foreign Direct
   Investment. One-way causal relationship from FDI to INF is ensured. The
   forecast sample is ranged from 2009 to 2017. The simple regression model
   affirms the significant impacts of the FDI - Foreign Direct Investment
   on the INF - Inflation. The forecasting model derived from the simple
   regression model is rather incompatible to forecast the value of
   dependent variable (Inflation).},

Abstract = {Employment-centered family policies enable parents to combine work and
   family, thereby improving work-life balance for individuals and families
   as well as increasing GDP. For these reasons, these policies constitute
   a central component of the social investment approach, a model for how
   to design social policies for contemporary societies. This study seeks
   to understand whether voters enable the expansion of these policies and
   therein promote social investment. The literature suggests that voters
   may reward governments that expand such policies for reducing work-life
   tensions at a relatively low cost. Yet support may wane if voters oppose
   mothers' employment or face few opportunities to take up such policies
   (e.g., due to barriers to labor market entry). Left parties are found to
   gain from expanding day care but lose votes for expanding leave schemes,
   a finding which partially explains the vote losses for leave expansion
   before the activation turn. Generous day care and leave schemes in the
   social democratic regime entail an electoral logic, whereby governments
   escape vote losses for the expansion of leave schemes and gain from
   expanding day care. The remaining results do not reach statistical
   significance and should be interpreted with care.},

Abstract = {Donald Trump's success in the 2016 presidential primary election
   prompted scrutiny for the role of news media in elections. Was Trump
   successful because news media publicized his campaign and crowded out
   coverage of other candidates? We examine the dynamic relationships
   between media coverage, public interest, and support for candidates in
   the time preceding the 2016 Republican presidential primary to determine
   (1) whether media coverage drives support for candidates at the polls
   and (2) whether this relationship was different for Trump than for other
   candidates. We find for all candidates that the quantity of media
   coverage had significant and long-lasting effects on public interest in
   that candidate. Most candidates do not perform better in the polls
   following increases in media coverage. Trump is an exception to this
   finding, receiving a modest polling bump following an increase in media
   coverage. These findings suggest that viability cues from news media
   contributed to Trump's success and can be influential in setting the
   stage in primary elections.},

Abstract = {The 2015-17 Parliament was the first time in history that the
   Conservatives were in government with no easily assembled majority in
   the House of Lords. This has fundamentally altered the role that Labour
   is able to play in the Lords and, conversely, that peers are able to
   play in the Labour party. Yet the political significance of this
   situation has not yet been fully appreciated by a party which remains
   culturally antagonistic and constitutionally wary of the Lords. In this
   paper, we draw on interviews with Labour peers, particularly the late
   Baroness Hollis of Heigham, who have been able to use the essentially
   conservative powers of the Lords for social democratic ends. We suggest
   that the Labour party needs to incorporate the second chamber into both
   its practical and symbolic politics, and to find ways to use this new
   source of constitutional power without accommodating to it.},

Abstract = {This article explores the repeated invocation of the spiritual by
   Vivekananda, Gandhi and Radhakrishnan. It attempts to understand the
   nature of the relationship they established between the spiritual and
   the secular domains while invoking the spiritual. The article argues
   that what was distinctive about frequent usage of the spiritual was its
   usage to articulate both the secular and the otherworldly goals in
   different ways. Moreover, none of them are strictly secular, if it means
   differentiation of the social and political domain from religion on the
   one hand and rise of `exclusive humanism' on the other. For them, the
   domain of secular is the domain of realizing the spiritual. They are not
   two separate domains but constituted an integral whole where the
   activities of secular were defined and redefined in the light of the
   quest for the spiritual and vice versa.},

Abstract = {Global mass migration has changed voting behaviour, party systems und
   party competition in Europe and Germany. In the wake of the refugee
   crisis of fall 2015, the right-wing populist party Alternative fur
   Deutschland (AfD) won representation not only in all German state
   parliaments, but also in the Bundestag in 2017. However, there are
   strong regional differences in terms of the AfD vote share. We study the
   effects of the location of refugee accommodations, the distance to the
   next country border and the socio-economic structure of cities and
   municipalities on the change in the AfD vote share between 2013 and
   2017. Our analysis is informed by the literature on the Halo effect,
   stereotype threat theory, retrospective voting and on the impact of
   spatial contextual factors on values and attitudes of citizens. By
   focusing on Bavariathe German state that directly experienced
   immigration across the Austrian border in fall 2015we show that refugee
   accommodations result in an increasing AfD vote share particularly in
   small, rural communities that are additionally characterized by economic
   hardship and the electoral success of anti-immigration parties in
   previous elections.},

Abstract = {This article draws on public opinion survey data from Morocco, Tunisia,
   Egypt, and Jordan to investigate first, whether a demand for democracy
   in the region exists; second, how to measure it; and third, how
   respondents understand it. The picture emerging from this analysis is
   complex, eluding the simple dichotomy between prima facie support and
   second order incongruence with democracy, which characterises current
   debates. Respondents have a more holistic understanding of democracy
   than is found in current scholarship or indeed pursued by Western or
   regional policymakers, valuing civil-political rights but prioritizing
   socio-economic rights. There is broad consensus behind principles of
   gender equality, but indirect questions reveal the continuing influence
   of conservative and patriarchal attitudes. Respondents value religion,
   but do not trust religious leaders or want them to meddle in elections
   or government. Moreover, while there is broad support for
   conventionally-understood pillars of liberal democracy (free elections,
   a parliamentary system), there is also a significant gap between those
   who support democracy as the best political system in principle and
   those who also believe it is actually suitable for their country.},

Abstract = {This article analyses the state of democracy in the world in 2018, and
   recent developments building on the 2019 release of the V-Dem dataset.
   First, the trend of autocratization continues and 24 countries are now
   affected by what is established as a ``third wave of
   autocratization{''}. Second, despite the global challenge of gradual
   autocratization, democratic regimes prevail in a majority of countries
   in the world (99 countries, 55\%) in 2018. Thus, the state of the world
   is unmistakably more democratic compared to any point during the last
   century. At the same time, the number of electoral authoritarian regimes
   had increased to 55, or 31\% of all countries. Third, the
   autocratization wave is disproportionally affecting democratic countries
   in Europe and the Americas, but also India's large population. Fourth,
   freedom of expression and the media, and the rule of law are the areas
   under attack in most countries undergoing autocratization, but toxic
   polarization of the public sphere is a threat to democracy spreading
   across regimes. Finally, we present the first model to predict
   autocratization ({''}adverse regime transitions{''}) pointing to the
   top-10 most at-risk countries in the world.},

Abstract = {Much of the scholarship seeking to understand why Donetsk and Luhansk
   succumbed to separatist takeovers in 2014, while other parts of eastern

   that these factors are insufficient to explain why the central state was
   able to maintain or reassert control everywhere except the Donbas
   region. This paper argues that the success or failure of separatist
   movements across eastern Ukraine is best understood with reference to
   the preferences and actions of local political and economic elites.},

Title = {Women are more likely than men to blame structural factors for women's
   political under-representation: Evidence from 27 countries},
Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL RESEARCH},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {58},

Abstract = {Over time, gender and politics research has made progress in identifying
   those factors that result in low numbers of women in political
   institutions and in making evidence-informed suggestions about how to
   ameliorate them. These factors include discrimination in party
   recruitment processes, male-dominated political culture and broader
   gender inequalities in society. In contrast, little is known about
   public opinion regarding these drivers of women's political
   under-representation, especially whether to who or what women assign
   blame for the under-representation of women in politics differs from
   men. This article provides the first discussion and analysis of blame
   assignment for women's numeric under-representation in politics. In
   doing so, it outlines and operationalises a framework that distinguishes
   between meritocratic explanations of women's under-representation,
   whereby the blame for women not holding political office in greater
   numbers is assigned to women themselves, and structural explanations,
   whereby social forces external to women are seen to result in their
   numeric under-representation. Cross-national data from 27 European
   countries is used to show that women are significantly more likely than
   men to assign blame for women's numeric under-representation to
   structural factors. The hierarchical nature of the dataset is exploited
   using multilevel models and significant differences in levels of
   structural blame assignment between countries is found as well as
   between-country variation in the probability of women assigning blame to
   structural explanations for women's under-representation. Finally, the
   category of structural explanations is disaggregated in order to assess
   their relative prominence and to provide strong corroborative evidence
   that women predominantly assign blame for women's under-representation
   to political culture over other structural blame factors. The article
   concludes with a discussion of the implications of the study's findings
   for policy makers contemplating the pursuit of gender equality policies
   aimed at increasing women's political representation and makes
   suggestions for the direction of future research in this area.},

Abstract = {How do social networks moderate the way political information influences
   electoral accountability? We propose a simple model in which incumbent
   malfeasance revelations can facilitate coordination around less
   malfeasant challenger parties in highly connected voter networks, even
   when voters update favorably about incumbent party malfeasance. We
   provide evidence from Mexico of this mechanism by leveraging a field
   experiment in a context where the provision of incumbent malfeasance
   information increased support for incumbent parties, despite voters
   continuing to believe that challengers were less malfeasant than
   incumbents. Combining this experiment with detailed family network data,
   we show that-consistent with the model-the increase in incumbent party
   vote share due to information provision was counteracted by coordination
   around less malfeasant challengers in precincts with greater network
   connectedness. Individual-level data further demonstrate that networks
   facilitated explicit and tacit coordination among voters. These findings
   suggest that networks can help voters coordinate around information to
   help remove poorly performing politicians.},

Abstract = {Gender bias in elections is both a source of debate in the political
   science literature and a prominent topic in U.S. political discourse. As
   a result, Americans are exposed to differing messages about the extent
   to which women face disadvantages in their campaigns for office. We
   argue that such messages can have differing effects-some of which
   benefit female candidates, but others that may perpetuate the gender gap
   in political ambition. Using a survey experiment administered on samples
   of the U.S. public, campaign donors, and college students, we show that
   messages portraying women as facing gender bias boosts female
   candidates' support and young people's willingness to engage in campaign
   activism on their behalf. Simultaneously, it does not affect female
   candidates' fundraising ability. But paradoxically, such messages also
   reduce young women's confidence in their own ability to run a political
   campaign. These results suggest important implications for women's
   underrepresentation.},

Abstract = {The use of the term atorrante began to be spread among locals after 1880
   and, a decade later, was already consolidated in the urban vocabulary:
   in popular language, the press and police narrative but also in the
   works of important intellectual referents. Because of the wide belief
   that Argentina was a country of job opportunities, the situations of
   absence of paid work used to be interpreted as voluntary marginality.
   The atorrante, who was associated with a young man, healthy and foreign,
   that is, the potential worker, synthesized that idea. In that same
   context, a sector of socialist with a marxist perspective, centered
   around the newspaper El Obrero, sought to impose a different
   interpretation of the atorrante. This article analyzes the way in wich
   the place occupied by the ``without work{''} was considered from that
   publication -particularly those identified as atorrantes- in the
   Argentine social structure and the role they could play in a working
   class formation. The aim of the article is to analyse the use of marxist
   categories in order of resignify that stigmatized figure and include it
   in the worker's sector to which they aspired to represent. This allows
   us to reflect on some of the less studied forms adopted by the fight for
   the constitution of a worker identity in this embryonic stage. In
   particular, the dispute over the definition of workers' problems and the
   demarcation of the limits of the category of ``worker{''} (and its
   reverse side).},

Abstract = {I study the effect of taste-based discrimination on the assimilation
   decisions of immigrant minorities. Do discriminated minority groups
   increase their assimilation efforts in order to avoid discrimination and
   public harassment or do they become alienated and retreat in their own
   communities? I exploit an exogenous shock to native attitudes,
   anti-Germanism in the United States during World War I, to empirically
   identify the reactions of German immigrants to increased native
   hostility. I use two measures of assimilation efforts: naming patterns
   and petitions for naturalization. In the face of increased
   discrimination, Germans increase their assimilation investments by
   Americanizing their own and their children's names and filing more
   petitions for US citizenship. These responses are stronger in states
   that registered higher levels of anti-German hostility, as measured by
   voting patterns and incidents of violence against Germans.},

Abstract = {It is commonly assumed that perceived threats from a rival state will
   make individuals more likely to ``rally-round-the-flag{''} and support
   military action. Previous studies have looked at how information about
   threats affects public support for military action. To date, however,
   there has been less attention to how information about the costs of
   conflict affects support for military action in response to threats. In
   this article, we present a survey experiment designed to evaluate how
   information about the likely military and economic costs of conflict
   influences support for military action. We provide Japanese respondents
   with information about relations with China, and probe how support for
   military action in the context of the ongoing territorial dispute
   changes with varying information on the military costs of conflict and
   its economic consequences. We find that information about trade ties and
   military capacity exerts a pacifying effect and strengthens opposition
   to military action. Consistent with our proposed mechanism, we show that
   greater awareness of military costs is associated with stronger
   opposition to military action. Our results indicate that even under the
   existence of external threats, greater awareness of the costs of
   conflict affects attitudes to military action and can increase support
   for peaceful solutions to territorial rivalries.},

Abstract = {The article studies whether and how negative campaigning is a successful
   strategy for attaining media attention. It combines extensive content
   analyses of party and news texts with public opinion surveys to study
   the success of individual press releases in making the news. The
   empirical analysis draws on 1496 party press releases and 6512 news
   reports in all national media outlets during the final 6 weeks of
   Austria's 2013 general election campaign. We find that negative
   campaigning is a successful strategy to attract the attention of
   journalists and editors. It is particularly relevant for rank-and-file
   politicians, who lack the intrinsic news value of high public or party
   office, and for messages that focus on a rival's best issues. These
   findings have broader implications for understanding party strategies
   and `negativity bias' in the news.},

Abstract = {Considering the risks involved in the hypothesis of a finished
   consummation of the capitalist crime, the ``lacanian left{''} of Jorge
   Aleman, guides us on the impossible at play in terms of the subject, its
   difference with subjectivity and there, the distinction between
   political and politics. This conceptual scaffolding will allow us to
   establish a dialogue with developments of political philosophy in order
   to neoliberalism and its production of subjectivity, to think about the
   segregative ravages of the current epoch and, particularly, the
   insistent question about what is inappropriate for the pseudo-capitalist
   discourse in its neoliberal version. Based on what we call the policy of
   the remains, we will think about the case of the struggles for human
   rights in Argentina and the mobilizations aroused before the Supreme
   Court's definition of applying Law 24,390-known as ``2x1{''}-.},

Abstract = {An international court's ruling is expected to influence public opinion
   because of the perception of its legality and the subsequent costs of
   noncompliance. However, there has been little direct empirical evidence
   to support this claim. To close this lacuna, I conducted a survey
   experiment to examine the power of a court's ruling in the context of a
   trade dispute. The experiment shows that citizens become less supportive
   of their government's noncompliance with GATT/WTO agreements when the
   World Trade Organization issues an adverse ruling, compared to when
   their government is verbally accused of a violation of the same
   agreements by a foreign country. However, the experiment also finds that
   the impact of a ruling is conditional upon the level of compliance of
   the winner of the dispute.},

Abstract = {This article argues that the concept of ``populism{''} is the result of
   a ``re-invention{''} accomplished by social sciences. First, the paper
   reconstructs the history of the concept, identifying five different
   stages: a) the Russian populism of the late nineteenth century; b) the
   People's Party in the United States; c) the Peron and Vargas regimes in
   Argentina and Brazil; d) the reformulation carried out by social
   sciences in the Fifties and Sixties; e) the subsequent extension of the
   concept to Western Europe. According to the article, the crucial turning
   point took place in the 1950s, when, due to the shock caused by the
   ``witch hunt{''}, social sciences ``assembled{''} in a single
   theoretical category the traits of heterogeneous movements. In
   particular, the concept was the subject of two processes of
   ``expansion{''} : first, the populism of the People's Party became a
   specific tradition of American political culture; secondly, the concept
   expanded geographically, because it coincided with a form of political
   extremism, characterized by anti-intellectualism, conspiracy obsessions,
   intolerance towards foreigners and elites.},

Title = {Elite Defection under Autocracy: Evidence from Russia},

Abstract = {Elite cohesion is a fundamental pillar of authoritarian stability.
   High-level defections can signal weakness, embolden the opposition, and
   sometimes, lead to regime collapse. Using a dataset of 4,291 ruling
   party candidates in Russia, this paper develops and tests hypotheses
   about the integrity of elite coalitions under autocracy. Our theory
   predicts that ruling elites defect when there is greater uncertainty
   about the regime's willingness to provide spoils. Regimes that share
   power with the opposition, limit access to spoils, and lack formal
   institutions see more defections. Co-opting the opposition assuages
   outside threats but leaves regime insiders disgruntled and prone to
   defection. Those with personal followings and business connections are
   the most likely to defect, since they can pursue their political goals

Abstract = {Prospects for democracy in multi-ethnic societies are generally more
   promising if elections are not mere ethnic censuses, in which people
   vote predominantly for co-ethnic parties and candidates. But what
   institutions facilitate or hinder ethnic voting? Unlike past studies,
   this article explores ethnic voting by conducting a natural experiment
   (rather than surveys or laboratory experiments). It examines the case of
   Fribourg, a bilingual (French/German) Swiss canton where elections at
   different levels of government, within the same electoral district, are
   held under both majoritarian and proportional systems. Coupled with the
   high territorial homogeneity of the linguistic groups, this unique
   setting allows us to conduct a robust empirical analysis of voter
   behaviour. We find that cross-ethnic voting is significantly more
   frequent in multi-member majoritarian elections than in list-PR
   elections or in two-member majoritarian elections. Our results yield
   qualified support to the centripetalist approach to electoral design in
   multi-ethnic societies, that favours majoritarian systems, rather than
   to the consociational school that advocates proportional representation.},

Abstract = {How do radical right populist parties influence government policies in
   their core issue of immigration? This article provides a systematic
   analysis of the direct and indirect effects of radical right
   anti-immigration parties on migration policy reforms in 17 West European
   countries from 1990 to 2014. Insights from migration policy theory serve
   to explain variations in the migration policy success of the radical
   right. While previous studies mostly treat migration policy as uniform,
   it is argued that this approach neglects the distinct political logics
   of immigration and integration policy. This article reveals significant
   variations in policy success by policy area. While immigration policies
   have become more liberal despite the electoral success of the radical
   right, when the radical right is in government office it enacts more
   restrictions in integration policies. Accordingly, anti-immigrant
   mobilisation is more likely to influence immigrants' rights than their
   actual numbers.},

Abstract = {The main objective of this article is to propose an ideational approach
   to democratisation in Sub-Saharan Africa in response to existing
   democratisation literature that typically measures democratic success
   and failure in the region against Western-modelled constitutional
   democracy. The article argues that this ideational approach both
   explains the under-performance of democratic institutions in Sub-Saharan
   Africa and offers a tenable solution for remedying this situation.
   First, we discuss the underlying theoretical framework before presenting
   our methodological approach and case selection. Second, we draw on
   empirical literature from three groups in Botswana, Zambia, and
   Zimbabwe, after which we present some antithetical arguments about the
   relevance of traditional African leadership to contemporary democracy.
   We conclude with a detailed discussion that formulates a three-step
   approach to better ground African democracies in traditional ideas and
   institutions.},

Abstract = {To what extent do political parties in South Africa politicise
   immigration? We systematically analyse the party manifestos of all major
   parties in post-apartheid South Africa, using two separate approaches of
   content analysis: coding all sentences about immigration individually,
   and coding the electoral manifesto overall using a checklist'. Although
   we can expect high politicisation of immigrants in new democracies, most
   party manifestos do not treat immigration at all. If parties in South
   Africa treat immigration in their manifestos, they tend to take
   relatively inclusive positions, focus on immigrant integration rather
   than immigration control, and use instrumental frames. It appears that
   the nation-building project of a post-apartheid South Africa has not led
   to an increased politicisation of immigration by political parties qua
   parties, although individual politicians certainly play a role.},

Abstract = {While the United Nations and NGOs are pushing for global judicialization
   of economic, social, and cultural rights (ESCRs), little is known of
   their consequences. We provide evidence of the effects of introducing
   three types of ESCRs into the constitution: the rights to education,
   health, and social security. Employing a large panel covering annual
   data from 160 countries in the period 1960-2010, we find no robust
   evidence of positive effects of ESCRs. We do, however, document adverse
   medium-term effects on education, inflation, and civil rights.},

Abstract = {Why do ethnically diverse elites share power in government coalitions? I
   argue that uncertainty about their societal support makes ethnic leaders
   frequently form oversized coalitions when their group does not represent
   an overwhelming majority. This uncertainty stems from crosscutting
   cleavage configurations, which enable coethnics to hold membership in
   multiple groups, and opens up the possibility of future defection to the
   opposition along shared identity markers. In response, elites prefer
   coalitions that internalize crosscutting cleavages, as they restrict
   defections to coalition partners and survive longer. To test these
   hypotheses, I collected new data on linguistic, religious, and racial
   intragroup divisions. Using conditional choice models on formation
   opportunities in 134 ethnically divided societies between 1946 and 2009,
   I find that, independent of institutional rules, ethnic elites
   frequently opt for oversized multiethnic coalitions that share as many
   ethnic markers as possible. These coalitions survive longer than more
   heterogeneous pacts.},

Abstract = {Which factors make it more likely that states militarily intervene in
   ongoing intrastate wars? We develop the argument that migrants, i.e.,
   (1) people coming from the civil-war state living in a potential
   intervener state (immigrants) and (2) those living in the country at war
   who stem from the third party (emigrants), influence the decision of
   external states to intervene in civil wars. Our theoretical framework is
   thus based on a joint focus on domestic-level determinants in a
   civil-war country and in foreign states. Primarily based on an
   accountability rationale, we also claim that the third-party's regime
   type has an intervening influence. Using quantitative methods, our
   empirical results generally support the theory, although there is only
   weak evidence for the intervening influence of a third party's level of
   democracy.},

Abstract = {This article follows on from an article written by Bob Deacon on the
   global politics of social solidarity. The article suggests that in an
   era characterized by social division and exclusion, global social policy
   has to pay more attention to concepts like community and solidarity. In
   doing so, policymakers and policy analysts should consider the impact
   for local social activism of decades of neoliberal influence on global
   and national social policy, for instance, sub-contracting social
   programmes and targeting low-income groups in service provision. Drawing
   on research conducted from 2004-2017 on grassroots social activism in
   the United Kingdom, I suggest that shifting practices of solidarity at a
   local level, particularly as a response to austerity, can provide
   practical examples and a conceptual framework for global social policy.
   Rather than assume the existence of identifiable communities susceptible
   to change through policy intervention, policies should acknowledge the
   fluidity of local collective identity, which after years of economic
   pressure and cuts to social welfare, is based on managing and
   redistributing resources and protecting individual rights. These trends
   can underpin reform of social policy, namely investing in collective
   action, especially across diverse ethnic and religious groups, to
   sustain values, overcome economic and social marginalization, and
   encourage cooperation over division.},

Abstract = {Understanding when individuals support government action is central to
   government responsiveness and democratic policy making. While previous
   research on political behavior has explored the influence of collective
   economic conditions, self-interested explanations have heavily swayed
   work on policy preferences. We bridge these two previously distinct
   literatures to articulate a theory of public policy preferences that
   highlights when both common and pocketbook factors influence preferences
   for social insurance. Using a cross-national sample of developed
   democracies from 1996 and 2006, we conclude that when personal economic
   conditions are dire, the pull of self-interest trumps both collective
   and policy concerns.},

Abstract = {This article examines Machiavelli's writings on fortresses as a new
   starting point for a genealogy of urban fortification. In contrast to
   theorists of Machiavelli who approach fortresses as defensive structures
   that preserve the present political order, this article considers
   fortresses as weapons to privatize civic life. It explores the
   significance of fortresses for democratic readings of Machiavelli,
   suggesting that Machiavelli offers a careful analysis of the spatial
   organization of power and its implications for popular self-government.
   This reconsideration of fortresses in Machiavelli brings his political
   thought into conversation with contemporary urban theorists critical of
   the enclosure of public space. The article argues that Machiavelli seeks
   to resignify notions of fortification and replace the construction of
   fortresses with practices of fortifying publics. Such practices find
   ways to strengthen public spaces and envision durable democracy.},

Abstract = {Since 2007, candidates for 50 of the most senior public appointments in
   the UK have been scrutinised by the relevant House of Commons Select
   Committee before ministers confirm their appointment. Committees regard
   pre-appointment scrutiny as a chore, but our research shows it has real
   impact. Candidates have not been appointed as a result, and others have
   been forced to resign. Since the Grimstone review in 2016 gave Ministers
   more scope for political patronage, parliamentary scrutiny is all the
   more important. Committees could be more effective if they were more
   selective, but also more systematic in their approach to pre-appointment
   scrutiny. They could range beyond the Cabinet Office list of the top 50'
   appointments; and they could use questionnaires to candidates to help
   decide the issues they wish to discuss, or whether to hold a hearing at
   all.},

Abstract = {Recently, election administration has been an important part of the
   national and global conversation about the results of elections. The
   important issue of election administration spending has not been
   examined extensively, and the influence of politics on election
   administration spending levels has not been examined in the United
   States. While theories of voter turnout and policy preference suggest
   that politics should influence election administration spending levels
   in the counties that administer elections, to our knowledge, there has
   been no evidence produced to support a partisan election administration
   expenditure effect. This research finds that Republican county
   commissions in North Carolina spend significantly less on election
   administration once the county electorate is a sufficient Republican
   majority. The article presents a novel model and method for estimating
   election administration spending and calls for additional research to
   examine the outcomes of these significant differences in spending on
   election administration.},

Abstract = {More than 60 years ago, Angus Campbell offered an explanation for why
   the president's party regularly loses congressional seats in midterm
   elections. He argued that peripheral voters ``surge{''} to the polls in
   presidential elections and support the president's congressional
   co-partisans but ``decline{''} to turn out in the midterm. In his
   turnout-based explanation for midterm loss, Campbell speculated that
   ``bad weather or an epidemic may affect the vote{''} but largely
   dismissed weather's utility to test his theory (Campbell 1960, 399). I
   revisit Campbell's speculation and employ a new identification strategy
   to investigate the ``surge and decline{''} account of midterm loss. I
   show that as the costs of voting increase-due to above-average rainfall
   on Election Day-the strength of the relationship between presidential
   and congressional voting weakens.},

   are favored (and disfavored) by these studies? Analysis shows that the
   US-based CP journals strongly favor research on the countries of Western
   Europe and North America. There may be several explanations for this,
   but the uneven distribution of research publications with respect to
   continents and countries may be a source of several biases that should

   includes four articles analyzing generational politics in Taiwan and

   differences between the young and the old in both places. As overall
   voter turnout has declined in Taiwan, youth turnout has declined even
   more. In particular, the ``China factor{''} is the main driving force to
   the younger generations' political activism. Youths in both Taiwan and
   Hong Kong exhibit a strong local identity that differentiates them from
   the Chinese. The stronger the identity is, the more politically active

   election},
Journal = {POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {70},

Pages = {240-252},
Abstract = {Indonesia's 2019 presidential election brings a rematch between
   incumbent Joko Widodo and Prabowo Subianto, though against a backdrop of
   increasingly active conservative Islamic movements. Analyses of this
   contest - as well as of contemporary Indonesian politics more generally
   - are often based on assumptions around which constituencies matter and
   which political factions they support. This paper examines those
   assumptions using an original dataset of fine-grained returns and census
   data, including a latent variable to capture the independent effect of
   Islamic conservatism. We find that conservative Muslim areas
   overwhelmingly supported Prabowo in 2014, but turned out in relatively
   low numbers. By contrast, rural poor areas turned out heavily for
   Widodo. This suggests that the conservative vote was under-mobilised and
   has a greater electoral potential than previously demonstrated. Given
   the recent mobilisation by conservative segments in society, observers
   should be prepared for significant shifts in the Indonesian electorate
   in 2019 and beyond.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this article is to discuss the rights of the accused
   person in the Sudanese legal system Similar with other criminal justice
   systems, the Sudanese law do provide rights for the accused person to
   enable him or her to defend him or herself. These rights are considered
   as the core idea behind the thinking of human rights in the criminal
   proceedings. However the problematic issue here is to what extent does
   Sudanese law provide and protect the accused right especially the
   privacy right. It is also pertinent to balance the law enforcement
   interest in evidence collection in criminal proceedings with the privacy
   right of the accused in the Sudanese legal system. We found that there
   are evidence of privacy right protection on the accused within the
   Sudanese legal system. The result of this research shows that in Sudan,
   the privacy right was provided for the first time at the constitutional
   level in the T1973 Constitution (Articles 42 and 43). It has later
   received recognition in the 1985 Transitional Constitution (Articles 24
   and 30), the 1998 Constitution (Article 29) and the 2005 Interim
   National Constitution (Article 37). At the statutory level, legislative
   protection is given to this right in the Penal Code 1991 (Section 166),
   the Code of Criminal Procedure 1991 (Sections 86 through 95) and the
   Informatic Offences (Combating) Act 2007 (Sections 16 and 6). The method
   adopted in this article is a qualitative content legal analysis of
   primary and secondary data obtained from legislation, case-law and
   various literature.},

Abstract = {Intergovernmental agreements between municipal and Indigenous
   governments are rapidly expanding in number and importance in Canada and
   the United States, yet they remain underexamined in the literature. This
   article considers how to measure the success of these agreements. It
   takes as a case study the port divestiture agreement between the City of
   Cornwall (Ontario, Canada), and a neighbouring Indigenous government,
   the Mohawk Council of Akwesasne. While the agreement represents a
   partial success and partial failure by conventional public policy and
   public administration metrics, these evaluations are different when
   measured against the Haudenosaunee (Iroquois) principle of
   ``one-mindedness.{''} Findings, which were generated using
   anthropological and qualitative political science methods, suggest that
   the use of both Indigenous and non-Indigenous frameworks are required to
   produce accurate and comprehensive evaluations of these agreements and
   the outcomes that are produced by them.},

Abstract = {This study analyzes American presidential campaign posters from 1828 to
   2012 using the Functional Theory of Political Campaign Discourse. It
   advances the theory by investigating a hitherto unexplored medium,
   posters; more importantly, visual elements (e.g., the bald eagle) were
   analyzed along with words. Acclaims were more frequent than attacks; no
   difference occurred in the functions of early and recent posters. Visual
   symbols used acclaims even more than verbal symbols. Character was a
   more frequent topic than policy; the relative proportion of these two
   topics did not change over time. Visual symbols discussed character even
   more than verbal symbols.},

Abstract = {Political scientists have identified protest voting - voting for an
   anti-establishment party as a protest against mainstream politics - as a
   consequence of dissatisfaction with traditional political options. Yet
   we know little about what motivates people to cast a protest vote or why
   voters select one such protest option over another. Taking as its
   empirical referent the 2015 General Election in Great Britain, this
   article assesses the `protest choice' in parliamentary democracies. We
   test three possible theoretical explanations for protest voting:
   ideology, mistrust of political elites and campaign effects. We find
   that the most important factors affecting protest choice are issue
   positions and campaign effects. The findings suggest that protest voting
   is a complex phenomenon that cannot be reduced to knee-jerk
   anti-politics reactions.},

Abstract = {The Brexit referendum was an unprecedented event in the context of
   British politics, but it was also a defining moment for the discipline
   of political science. Never before had political scientists in the UK
   faced such demand for public engagement against the backdrop of a highly
   polarised electoral campaign. This article assesses how scholars met
   this challenge by analysing online contributions to established academic
   websites in the 6 months prior to the vote. It highlights that
   high-profile political campaigns pose a distinct dilemma for political
   scientists: on the one hand, the reach of their contributions is far
   greater when they take a positional stance on an issue, yet the value of
   political science rests on its credibility, which can come under threat
   if the public perceives the discipline, and academics more generally, to
   represent partisan viewpoints.},

Abstract = {How should we study citizenship in authoritarian regimes? We propose
   studying how citizenship is performed using the ``public
   transcript{''}-communication between ordinary citizens and political
   authorities. The stakes of these strategic communications allow us to
   observe the roles citizens play to elicit assistance from authoritarian
   elites. We use this technique to study citizenship in contemporary
   China, analyzing evidence from an original database of over eight
   thousand appeals to local officials. These public transcripts reveal
   three ideal-type scripts of citizenship. First, we observe individuals
   performing subjecthood, positioning themselves as subalterns before
   benevolent rulers. We also identify an authoritarian legal citizenship
   that appeals to the formal legal commitments of the state. Finally, we
   find evidence for a socialist citizenship which appeals to the moral
   duties of officials to provide collective welfare. This approach eschews
   a classification scheme based on regime types, instead acknowledging
   that diverse performances of citizenship can coexist within a single
   state.},

Abstract = {Why are voters in advanced democracies turning away from established
   mass parties to take their electoral chances elsewhere? This article
   draws on concepts from marketing scholarship, specifically branding and
   brand equity, to apply a `consumer' lens that assesses the major parties
   in Australia as failing `brands' being left behind by disillusioned
   voters. An initial sample of 200 voters were asked what words or phrases
   came to mind when they thought of each of four Australian federal
   political parties. The strength of associations for each party, elicited
   from this sample, was then validated on a broader sample of 1015 voters,
   in addition to whether the association was considered positive, neutral
   or negative. Data revealed distinct brand associations for each party
   and the extent of penetration and brand equity across subgroups of
   voters. We find that Australian mass parties are caught in a downward
   spiral of negative brand associations and low brand penetration, leading
   to voter dissatisfaction.},

Abstract = {Local climate policy is influenced by many factors. However, previous
   studies have barely considered the impact of trans-local activities on
   the diffusion of innovative climate policies. The article systematically
   examines the influence of structural contextual factors and political
   entrepreneurs as well as trans-local activities of cities. The analysis
   is conducted by means of aqualitative-comparative research design
   applying atwo-stage crisp set QCA. The results of the study show that
   structural factors can only partially explain the extensiveness of
   climate protection measures in major cities. The inclusion of
   trans-local action and policy entrepreneurship provides additional
   explanatory power as these factors may strengthen favorable and, on some
   occasion, substitute unfavorable structural conditions.},

Abstract = {This article seeks to explain why some White Americans support
   affirmative action while others do not. Much of what has been written on
   White opinions on affirmative action is from an oppositional lens. This
   analysis seeks to add balance to the ways political science understands
   White opinions toward affirmative action. In so doing, this study
   identifies correlates of support for affirmative action not just
   rationales for opposition. Unlike most studies that examine White
   opinions by testing one or two theories, we examine the determinants of
   White opinions by testing several theories and hypotheses simultaneously
   (stereotypes, racial discrimination, racial resentment, and realistic
   group conflict theory). Using data taken from the 2004-2005 National
   Politics Study, we find that many Whites support affirmative action to
   combat racial discrimination experienced by racial minorities. However,
   we also find that many of them oppose affirmative action due to a sense
   of entitlement.},

Abstract = {This review essay highlights the limitations and possibilities of a
   global human rights order based on analysis of five recently published
   books about human rights. The main argument states that reform of the
   global human rights order requires not only a shift to a more
   emancipatory notion of human dignity but also an emphasis on global
   justice and material compensation within and between the Global North
   and Global South. Human dignity, in this essay, embraces all types of
   human rights claims, ranging from political rights to socio-economic
   rights, among many others. The essay proposes a three-pronged reform of
   international human rights: (1) a shift from Western human rights to the
   more inclusive and pluralist notion of human dignity; (2) the promotion
   of global justice by rewriting the rules of global economic governance;
   and (3) mandatory political education on human rights and human dignity.},

Abstract = {Despite the pivotal role of payroll staff within political parties'
   central offices, research on the staff expenses of parties remains
   scarce. In this article, we study the relative staff expenses of
   political parties, that is staff costs as a percentage of total annual
   expenses. We analyse which factors explain the differences between
   parties' relative staff expenses, based on a dataset of 590 individual
   observations representing 52 parties from seven European countries. The
   multivariate model shows that relative staff expenses are higher among
   left-oriented parties and that they increase with party age, party
   membership figures and the number of years a party has been in
   government, while they decrease with party income. Relative staff
   expenses also decrease with the effective number of parties in the party
   system, and they are lower in election years.},

Abstract = {This article adopts and reinvents the ethnographic approach to uncover
   what governing elites do, and how they respond to public disaffection.
   Although there is significant work on the citizens' attitudes to the
   governing elite (the demand side) there is little work on how elites
   interpret and respond to public disaffection (the supply side). It is
   argued here that ethnography is the best available research method for
   collecting data on the supply side. The article tackles longstanding
   stereotypes in political science about the ethnographic method and what
   it is good for, and highlights how the innovative and varied practices
   of contemporary ethnography are ideally suited to shedding light into
   the `black box' of elite politics. The potential pay-off is demonstrated
   with reference to important examples of elite ethnography from the
   margins of political science scholarship. The implications from these
   rich studies suggest a reorientation of how one understands the drivers
   of public disaffection and the role that political elites play in
   exacerbating cynicism and disappointment. The article concludes by
   pointing to the benefits to the discipline in embracing elite
   ethnography both to diversify the methodological toolkit in explaining
   the complex dynamics of disaffection, and to better enable engagement in
   renewed public debate about the political establishment.},

Abstract = {Recent societal conflicts over immigration, free trade and EU membership
   testify to the controversiality of globalization in Western societies.
   Brexit, Trump, the refugee crisis, and the debate around transatlantic
   trade and investment partnership (TTIP) are clear illustrations of the
   salience of globalization in politics. Many argue that neoliberal
   ideology supports and drives globalization. This raises the question
   whether opposition to globalization is also ideological, and how. This
   contribution investigates the existence of ideologies of globalization.
   It does so presenting a novel rigorous version of Freeden's analytical
   morphological approach to ideologies, with deductive conceptualization
   drawing on political philosophy combined with inductive correlational
   analysis at the level of individual arguments. It presents original
   representative claims analysis data on debates over climate change,
   human rights, migration, trade, and regional integration in the United
   States, Germany, Poland, Mexico, Turkey, the European Parliament, and
   the United Nations General Assembly between 2004 and 2011. It shows that
   we are witnessing the making of four ideologies of globalization:
   liberalism, cosmopolitanism, communitarianism, and statism. Each has its
   own distinctive grouping of concepts. Their emergence may solidify a
   globalization cleavage in Western societies, shape democratic politics
   for years to come, and affect the course of globalization itself.},

Pages = {79-89},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {A distinguished tradition of social science research has shown higher
   levels of U.S. Southern political participation in areas of black-white
   residential proximity, attributing this activism to the political threat
   perceived by white voters from having African Americans concentrated
   close-by. Here we examine whether elevated participation in the form of
   campaign contributions is also visible in areas of mixed settlement, and
   which party, if any, this activism has come to favor. The findings from
   contribution data show that the South remains a distinctive political
   region. Southern locations of joint black-white settlement are
   productive of intensified donor mobilization favoring Republican
   candidates. Republicans not only raise more money in these places, but
   also receive numerically more contributions than they do in Non-Southern
   locations that are otherwise similar. These differences remain even
   after introducing statistical controls for affluence, the aged
   population, the number of potential contributors, and the
   competitiveness of local campaigns.},

Abstract = {This article argues that the Universal Declaration of Human Rights
   (UDHR), by claiming certain inheritances from eighteenth-century
   American and French rights declarations, simultaneously disavowed
   others, reshaping the genre of the rights declaration in ways amenable
   to forms of imperial and racial domination. I begin by considering the
   rights declaration as genre, arguing that later participants can both
   inherit and disavow aspects of what came before. Then, drawing on
   original archival research, I consider the drafting of the UDHR, using
   as an entry point the reception of the NAACP's Appeal to the World
   petition, edited by W.E.B. DuBois. I reconstruct conversations within
   the drafting committee about the right to petition, self-determination,
   and the right to rebellion, and the separation of the Declaration from
   the rights covenants, to illustrate the allegiances between US racial
   politics and French imperial politics, and their legacies for our
   contemporary conceptions of human rights.},

Abstract = {In 1992, the Frankfurt scholar Ingeborg Maus launched a polemical attack
   against then current narratives of democratic protest, objecting to the
   languages of `resistance' or `civil disobedience' as defensive, servile
   and insufficiently transformative. This article explores in how far the
   language of constituent power can be adopted as an alternative
   justificatory strategy for civil disobedience in transnational protests.
   In contrast to current approaches that look at states as agents of
   international civil disobedience-as-constituent power, I suggest we look
   at political movements. I focus on the example of the Democracy in
   Europe Movement 2025 (DiEM25) which understands itself as a pan-European
   movement of civil disobedience, at the same time working towards an
   articulation and exercise of constituent power among the people(s) of
   Europe. In the final section, I sharpen the criteria for the invocation
   of constituent power in transnational protest in distinguishing between
   its articulation, activation and exercise.},

Abstract = {How should party governments make representative democracy? Much of the
   democracy representation literature assumes that voters prefer parties
   to fulfill the promises of their election campaigns, with higher
   preference for promise-keeping placed on the party a voter supports.
   That voters agree with these assumptions, however, remains largely
   unclear and this is the main hypothesis of this article. Within the
   context of Australia, this article investigates voter preferences
   regarding three ideal party representative styles: promise-keeping,
   focus on public opinion, and seeking the common good. Furthermore, it
   tests whether voters prefer their party over other parties to keep their
   promises. Based on novel and innovative survey data, this study finds
   that, generally, voters care least about parties keeping their promises
   and their preferences are unaffected by their party support. These
   results, if confirmed in other contexts, not only challenge the primacy
   of promise-keeping, but also the assumed ubiquitous party effect.},

Abstract = {Researchers have increasingly turned to online convenience samples as
   sources of survey responses that are easy and inexpensive to collect. As
   reliance on these sources has grown, so too have concerns about the use
   of convenience samples in general and Amazon's Mechanical Turk in
   particular. We distinguish between ``external validity{''} and
   theoretical relevance, with the latter being the more important
   justification for any data collection strategy. We explore an
   alternative source of online convenience samples, the Lucid Fulcrum
   Exchange, and assess its suitability for online survey experimental
   research. Our point of departure is the 2012 study by Berinsky, Huber,
   and Lenz that compares Amazon's Mechanical Turk to US national
   probability samples in terms of respondent characteristics and treatment
   effect estimates. We replicate these same analyses using a large sample
   of survey responses on the Lucid platform. Our results indicate that
   demographic and experimental findings on Lucid track well with US
   national benchmarks, with the exception of experimental treatments that
   aim to dispel the ``death panel{''} rumor regarding the Affordable Care
   Act. We conclude that subjects recruited from the Lucid platform
   constitute a sample that is suitable for evaluating many social
   scientific theories, and can serve as a drop-in replacement for many
   scholars currently conducting research on Mechanical Turk or other
   similar platforms.},

Abstract = {The Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) in Peru is usually cited
   as an example of how capture-recapture methods can help improve our
   understanding of mass violence from incomplete observed data. Using
   25,000 documented death records, the TRC estimated a total of 69,000
   killings, and that the Shining Path was the main perpetrator, in
   contrast with the raw data where the Peruvian State appears to be
   responsible for the most killings. One feature not often noticed is that
   the TRC applied an unusual indirect procedure, combining data on
   different perpetrators and lumping together missing perpetrator data in
   one group. I show that direct estimations with strict stratification by
   perpetrator and accounting for missing data do not support the results
   of the TRC's indirect approach. I estimate a total of 48,000 killings,
   substantially lower than the TRC estimate, and the Peruvian State
   accounts for a significantly larger share than the Shining Path. Rather
   than an example of correcting biases in the observed data through
   capture-recapture methods, the TRC actually introduced further
   distortion.},

Abstract = {Policy instruments research is an essential part of studying European
   Union governance. A growing interest in processes of (de-)legalisation
   and patterns of instrument choice requires a more process- and
   context-oriented analysis of the EU's instrument selection. Using a
   political sociology approach, the article analyses patterns of
   instrument choice in soft law policy programmes, by examining the life
   cycle of EU gender equality policy programmes from 1982 to the present
   day. Gender equality policy programmes offer an in-depth understanding
   of how the Commission upgrades and downgrades policy instruments. The
   analysis indicates that patterns of policy instrument choice are not
   necessarily inflexible once a policy instrument is selected. Instead,
   patterns vary while the instrument is (de-)legalised. Investigating
   gender equality policy programmes provides explanations for the shifts
   in the use of legislative instruments and their limitations.},

   argues that variation in the redistribution of power and resources
   between regions is introduced by demand. Yet these explanations are
   conditional on the presence of strong regionalist parties or territorial
   cleavages. This article proposes instead a theory that links the
   government's risk of future electoral defeat with heterogeneous
   decentralisation, and tests its effects using data from 15 European
   countries and 141 regions. The results provide evidence that parties in
   government protect themselves against the risk of electoral defeat by
   selectively targeting decentralisation towards regions in which they are
   politically strong. The findings challenge previous research that
   overestimates the importance of regionalist parties while overlooking
   differences between regions.},

Abstract = {From November 2018, for several months, French politics and media were
   dominated by the so-called ``gilets jaunes{''} {[}yellow vest] movement.
   Initially aimed at protesting against the rise in fuel prices, this
   social movement developed through roadblocks, the permanent occupation
   of roundabouts, and weekly demonstrations in major French cities.
   Through its atypical features, the gilets jaunes movement prompts us to
   further investigate the sociology of politicization, social movements,
   and how people ``learn{''} activism. The aim of this debate is to bring
   together researchers (Z. Bendali, R. Challier, M. Della Sudda, and O.
   Fillieule) who have conducted field surveys on the actions and
   organization of the movement. The data gathered help us to understand
   the practical ways in which collective action and politicization are
   learned in and through participation in the gilets jaunes movement.},

Abstract = {Since the failed dialogues of the Caguan between FARC-EP and the
   Colombian Government (1998-2002) until the signature and the referendum
   of the Havana Agreements (2016), Colombia experienced an intense
   international support in its search for a negotiated peace. During these
   years, statistical and documentary analysis have shown that the
   resources of international cooperation came, mostly, from the two most
   important partners of Colombia: the United States and the European
   Union. The first country, privileging a military component; the second
   actor, based solely on civil assistance. These two different, and
   sometimes opposed, policies of cooperation for peace reflect distinct
   interests in both donors (US and EU) and the petitioners (the Colombian
   State and its civil society). However, the two different cooperation
   policies converged around the Havana dialogues (2012-2016), and with the
   signing of the agreements, Colombia took a path towards a new and
   unprecedented scenario: the ``post-conflict{''}, better known as
   ``post-agreement{''}. It is precisely this convergence of the two major
   hegemonic approaches to international cooperation that makes Colombia a
   sui generis country when it comes to talking about scenarios of conflict
   and a transition towards postconflict contexts that could be
   representative for other geographical circumstances, feeding and
   fostering the debate between ``liberal peace{''} and ``post-liberal
   peace{''} for future specific research on this topic.},

Abstract = {This chapter discusses how movements and NGOs work for social change.
   We introduce different theories of social movements and show the
   value-added of the epistemic governance theory.
   The chapter shows that social movements tend to justify their moral
   goals by assuming an imagery of the social world as a spatially
   organized hierarchy and work on people's conceptions of what is right or
   desirable to do. In the process, they further rely on, and become
   themselves, moral authorities.
   The chapter illustrates the explanatory potential of epistemic
   governance by briefly studying the Occupy Wall Street movement and its
   aftermath.},

Abstract = {Despite numerous studies showing that emotions influence political
   decision making, there is scant literature giving a formal treatment to
   this phenomenon. This paper formalizes insights about how fear
   influences participation in risky collective action such as citizen
   revolt against an autocratic regime. To do so we build a global game and
   analyze the effects that fear may have on participation through
   increasing pessimism about the regime's strength, increasing pessimism
   about the participation of others in the revolution, and increasing risk
   aversion. The impact of the first two effects of fear is a clear
   reduction in the probability that people will mobilize. However, an
   increase in risk aversion may in some circumstances increase the
   probability with which citizens will mobilize. These results may help
   explain the unpredictable reactions of citizens to fear appeals,
   including the threat of repressive violence.},

Abstract = {The forest wealth of China was damaged badly during the World War II.
   Since the kite 1990s the Chinese government policy with regard to
   forests has changed radically. The forest -protection and forest
   -restoration measures are now being taken on the national scale. The PRC
   has become the world leader in the plantation afforestation. Being both
   a producer and a consumer of Limber and processed wood products, the
   country is the world's largest timber market participant now. Chinese
   imports of forestry products mainly consist of raw wood (round- and
   plank timber).
   The article examines general trends in China's imports of ``round
   timber{''} and lumber, as well as their species' composition, price
   parameters and geography of exporters. The changes in the species'
   composition of imported timber and their relationship with domestic
   economic trends in China are also analyzed.
   Of particular interest is the analysis of species' composition of the
   ``round timber{''}, imported by China, which, as the author shows, has
   been changing according to the needs of Chinese economy. So, till 1992
   the main part of the imports was represented by softwood species. But
   since 1992 the hardwood has become the priority. The share of coniferous
   ``round timber{''} dropped in 1996 to a minimum of 20.5 \% of all
   unprocessed wood imports. After 1998, due to measures of the Chinese
   government aimed to restrict felling of natural forests, the share of
   coniferous timber in the imports has grown rapidly. The growth of
   imports of coniferous ``round timber{''} is associated with active state
   financial policy and large-scale infrastructure and housing construction
   in China.
   Since 1997, there has been a steady growth trend in the Chinese lumber
   imports. In the last 5 years (2012-2017) the import of lumber grew
   faster than the import of ``round timber{''}: the average annual growth
   rate of imports of ``round timber{''} and lumber amounted to 12.7 \% and
   7 \%, respectively. As stated in the article, coniferous luniber
   dominates in Chinese imports. The geography of lumber sources has
   undergone significant changes in the last 10 years. In just a few years,
   Russia has managed to become the No. 1 exporter of lumber to the Chinese
   market. So, special attention in the article is given to Russian exports
   of raw timber to China and the changes that have occurred in this area
   in the last decade. Possible prospects of Russian timber exports to the
   Chinese market are also considered.},

Abstract = {This article reports on the effects of domestic election observers on
   electoral fraud and violence. Using an experimental research design and
   polling station data on fraud and violence during Ghana's 2012
   elections, it shows that observers reduced fraud and violence at the
   polling stations which they monitored. It is argued that local electoral
   competition shapes party activists' response to observers. As expected,
   in single-party dominant areas, parties used their local political
   networks to relocate fraud to polling stations without an election
   observer, and, in contrast, party activists relocated violence to
   stations without observers in competitive areas - a response that
   requires less local organizational capacity. This highlights how local
   party organization and electoral incentives can shape the manipulative
   electoral strategies employed by parties in democratic elections.},

Abstract = {In his new book, Luck Egalitarianism, Kasper Lippert-Rasmussen responds
   to challenges raised by social egalitarians against luck egalitarianism.
   Social egalitarianism is the view according to which a just society is
   one where people relate to each other as equals, while the basic premise
   of luck egalitarianism is that it is unfair if people are worse-off than
   others through no fault or choice of their own. Lippert-Rasmussen argues
   that the most important objections to luck egalitarianism made by social
   egalitarians can either be largely accommodated by luck egalitarians or
   lack the argumentative force that its proponents believe them to have.
   While Lippert-Rasmussen does offer a version of luck egalitarianism that
   seems to avoid some of the main lines of criticism, he mischaracterizes
   parts of both the form and the content of the disagreement, and thus
   ultimately misses the mark. In this paper, we provide a substantive, a
   methodological and a political defense of social egalitarianism by
   elaborating on this mischaracterization. More work must be done, we
   argue, if social egalitarianism is to be dismissed and its concerns
   genuinely incorporated in the luck egalitarian framework. Until this is
   done, the supposed theoretical superiority of luck egalitarianism
   remains contested.},

Journal = {POLITICS AND GOVERNANCE},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {7},
Number = {2},
Pages = {53-67},
Abstract = {In 2010, the G8 placed renewed focus on maternal health via the Muskoka
   Initiative by committing to spend an additional \$ 5 billion on
   maternal, newborn, and child health before 2015. Following the end of
   the Millennium Development Goals and the advent of the Sustainable
   Development Goals, maternal health issues have continued to feature
   prominently on the global health agenda. Despite these substantial
   investments of foreign aid over the past decade, there is limited
   evidence on the effectiveness of foreign aid in reducing maternal
   mortality in low-and middle-income countries (LMICs). Using data from
   the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, the World
   Development Indicators and the Institute of Health Metrics and
   Evaluation, this study analyzes the effects of aid on maternal health in
   a sample of 130 LMICs from 1996 through 2015. Our results show that the
   effects of total foreign aid on maternal mortality are limited, but that
   aid allocated to the reproductive health sector and directly at maternal
   health is associated with significant reductions in maternal mortality.
   Given these targeted effects, it is important to channel more donor
   assistance to the promotion of reproductive health and contraceptive use
   among women as it serves as a tool towards the reduction of maternal
   mortality.},

Abstract = {Scholars have pointed out the potential impact of different electoral
   systems on the incentives for representatives to cultivate personal
   versus party reputations. The mixed-member proportional system (MMP)
   allows us to examine the effects of electoral systems on legislators'
   incentives. Scholars have argued that MMP may be the `best of both
   worlds'; however, MMP may lead to competing demands on list
   representatives if they are also allowed to run as constituency
   candidates, as happens in the Scottish Parliament. I show that this
   leads to different levels of committee activity-which I use as a
   surrogate for party activity-from constituency Members of Scottish
   Parliament (MSPs), pure-list MSPs (who are elected via the party list
   and do not run in constituencies), and dual-candidate list MSPs (list
   MSPs who also run in constituencies), and that the proximity of
   elections also affects committee activity for those who run in
   constituencies.},

Journal = {POLITIX},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {32},
Number = {127},

Abstract = {The article proposes an analysis of crises in the Front national, the
   French extreme right party. From the perspective of political sociology
   and a historical study of all members of parliament elected under the
   party's label, the article investigates and offers explanations for the
   divisions in the party, which are not restricted to ideological
   differences. Divisions also depend on the articulation between the state
   of political competition and the system of positions it creates. The
   Front national is a product of the acceleration of political
   professionalization mechanisms since the 1970s. This process is based on
   the principle of differentiated trajectories among its ruling elites.
   Two dimensions are particularly influential on the party's internal
   competitions and conflicts: the time spent in politics and the structure
   of political capital.},

Abstract = {This article aims to analyse the impact of the two terrorist attacks
   that occurred in France in 2015 on the construction of French national
   identity. Drawing on critical discourse analysis, it discusses the
   nation-affirming strategies implemented by President Hollande and the
   role they play in restoring the authority of the state. It reveals how
   Hollande used the figure of the terrorist Other to recreate an imagined
   community based on an idealised Republican model and how he constructed
   an exclusionary discourse of sameness, which led to a closure of
   identity that risks alienating large sections of the population.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF POLITICAL POWER},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {12},
Number = {1},
Pages = {66-85},
Abstract = {This study of Volkswagen's national claim deals with the anomic
   dimension of globalization. Using Bourdieu's and Durkheim's framework of
   analysis, it examines the paradoxical promotion of national belonging by
   a transnational company. It makes three contributions: first, successful
   national narratives show the incompleteness of globalization which
   engenders anomie, the lasting divergence between people's habitus and
   their environment. Second, the national claim can be regarded as a
   reaction to globalization as well as to its pluralizing effect. Third,
   in reflexive terms, durable anomie is analyzed as reinforcing the place
   of the national level and the state in people's habitus.},

Title = {With a little help from my friends: ministerial alignment and public
   spending composition in parliamentary democracies},
Journal = {POLITICAL RESEARCH EXCHANGE},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {1},
Number = {1},
Abstract = {The determinants of public spending composition have been studied from
   three broad perspectives in the scholarly literature: functional
   economic pressures, institutional constraints and party-political
   determinants. This article engages with the third perspective by placing
   intra-governmental dynamics in the centre of the analysis. Building on
   the portfolio allocation approach in the coalition formation literature
   and the common pool perspective in public budgeting, I theorize that
   spending ministers with party-political backing from the prime minister
   or the finance minister are in a privileged position to obtain extra
   funding for their policy jurisdictions compared to their colleagues
   without such support or without any partisan affiliation (non-partisan
   ministers). Via a system of equations on six spending categories using
   seemingly unrelated regressions as well as Prais-Winsten panel
   regressions on a sample of 32 parliamentary democracies over two
   decades, I offer mixed evidence for the impact of party-political
   alignment. While the relative share of four of the six budget categories
   systematically increases under the party-political alignment of the
   prime minister, the impact of finance minister alignment is only
   significant for the economic budget.},

Abstract = {The subfield of civil-military relations has experienced a remarkable
   revitalization in recent years, yielding a wealth of intriguing
   insights. Yet, despite these auspicious developments, research remains
   unnecessarily divided across multiple dimensions: along the
   subdisciplinary boundaries of comparative, international, and American
   politics; within these subdisciplines by independent and dependent
   variables; by regional focus; by regime type analyzed (democratic,
   democratizing versus authoritarian); and by scholars' emphasis on
   normative versus positive analysis. This article aims to bridge existing
   divides and reduce fragmentation. It proposes several pathways forward,
   including proposing innovations in deductive theorizing, developing new
   analytical frameworks, and synthesizing and adjudicating empirical
   findings. It also suggests ways of bridging to research beyond the study
   of civil-military relations, such as that on the global phenomenon of
   democratic backsliding, the efficacy of nonviolent strategies of
   political struggle, military effectiveness, and the causes and outcomes
   of interstate war.},

Abstract = {From 2015-2019, the Polish government hugely restricted the independence
   of the judiciary. It brought the constitutional court to heel and placed
   the regular courts of law under the control of the executive. The third
   and final blow came at the end of 2019. The ``muzzle law{''} passed by
   the government majority is being used to discipline all judges who,
   invoking European law, still refuse to conform to the vertical power
   structure. Having already been smeared by the politicians, they also
   face the prospect, after the law has come into effect, of legal action
   by the judges of newly-created disciplinary chambers, who have been
   installed in office by the government.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF POLITICAL MARKETING},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {18},
Number = {3},
Pages = {179-195},
Abstract = {Scholars have generally found e-mail-based effects to be limited,
   despite suggestions from marketing consultants that techniques such as
   message personalization and emotion-based content make e-mail campaigns
   more successful. Key in e-mail personalization is the subject line. To
   my knowledge, however, no one has examined the direct effects of e-mail
   subject lines using a field experiment with unobtrusive behavioral
   measures (i.e., tracking e-mail open rates). To address this gap, I
   leverage a field experiment using 82,000 e-mail addresses from a
   state-based Planned Parenthood contact list to determine whether
   randomly assigned subject line content impacts e-mail open rates. My
   results show that subject line personalization has a limited effect on
   open rates, but that personalization-when combined with subject line
   reference to emotion-may affect downstream behavior among a small
   percentage of e-mail recipients.},

Abstract = {This second step of the context analysis is concerned with the shift
   from welfare to workfare in the function of social reproduction of
   modern capitalist political economies. The underlying aim is to
   investigate the middle-ranging implications of this shift for the
   specific conflict over Italy's 2012 labour market reform. To reform a
   system of relief, in fact, necessarily implies to regulate the labour
   market, i.e. first of all the labour flows at its lower reaches as well
   as the conditions for buying and selling low-wage work (Peck 2001, p.
   39). Against this background, the labour market is conceived here as a
   key `domain of power relationships' built on two principal asymmetries:
   first, a primary asymmetry between capital and labour; second, a series
   of secondary asymmetries characterizing different fractions of capital
   but also different segments within the workforce (Peck 1996, 2001).
   Because of the nexus between relief system and labour market regulation,
   different forms of relief provision exert a direct influence on these
   two power asymmetries (Peck 2001, p. 43). Consequently, the focus of
   this chapter on the changes in Italy's dimension of social reproduction
   draws on the crucial premise that no shift of the boundary between
   relief and work can ever be neutral. Rather, reforming welfare is seen
   `as a significant site of social struggle, framed by the shifting
   imperatives of the labor market, and not just some discrete arena of
   policy intervention' (ibid., pp. 49-50). The next sections address this
   heavily contested shift in the dimension of social reproduction in two
   main steps. In Sect. 5.1, the argument concerning a workfare-oriented
   shift in the area of social policy is discussed first of all from a
   general perspective, which builds on the ideal-typical move from the
   Keynesian welfare national state (KWNS) to the Schumpeterian workfare
   postnational regime (SWPR) presented in Chap. 4. Against this
   background, Sect. 5.2 is concerned with the investigation of these
   developments in the Italian context with a specific emphasis on the
   welfare-to-workfare shift in the area of labour market policy. Key
   findings are finally resumed in Sect. 5.3.},

Abstract = {In 1962, James Baldwin received a letter from Hannah Arendt in response
   to a recently published essay. It read: ``In politics, love is a
   stranger horizontal ellipsis . Hatred and love belong together
   horizontal ellipsis . You can afford them only in private and, as a
   people, only so long as you are not free.{''} I use this letter as a
   point of departure to examine the productive similarities and
   differences between these two important theorists of love's relationship
   to politics. Arendt provides crucial resources in understanding the
   dangers love can play in modern alienation. However, her alternative, a
   love of the world, is limited by her account of judgment. Baldwin's
   ideal of love shows equal concern for the public world, but it elevates
   the role of feeling in judgment. This account of feeling, and the type
   of imagination that activates it, helps to realize a more inclusive
   political world, one where black lives matter.},

Abstract = {Do men and women representatives hold different legislative priorities?
   Do these priorities align with citizens who share their gender? Whereas
   substantive representation theorists suggest legislators' priorities
   should align with their cogender constituents, Downsian-based theories
   suggest no role for gender. We test these differing expectations through
   a new originally collected survey data set of more than 800
   parliamentarians and data from more than 19,000 citizens from 17
   sub-Saharan African countries. We find that whereas parliamentarians
   prioritize similar issues as citizens in general, important gender
   differences also emerge. Women representatives and women citizens are
   significantly more likely to prioritize poverty reduction, health care,
   and women's rights, whereas men representatives and men citizens tend to
   prioritize infrastructure projects. Examining variation in congruence
   between countries, we find that parliamentarians' and cogender citizens'
   priorities are most similar where democratic institutions are strongest.
   These results provide robust new evidence and insight into how and when
   legislator identity affects the representative process.},

Abstract = {The impact of the constitutional judges' clerks in the construction of
   judicial sentences has been widely studied by the Anglo-Saxon
   literature. However, less is known about the profile and influence of
   the clerks in the Latin American Courts. This work builds a theoretical
   proposal on the role of the judges' collaborators in the Supreme Courts:
   they incorporate different perspectives on legal problems, reduce the
   learning costs of court's routines and they are sources of information
   that allow the dissemination of new legal ideas. From an original
   database on the features of 117 lawyers working in the Supreme Court of
   Justice (scJN) in Mexico, an exploration of the professional profile and
   recruitment mechanisms is presented.},

Title = {International Medical Knowledge Transfer as a Tool of Public Diplomacy:
   The Case of Croatia},
Journal = {POLITICKA MISAO-CROATIAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {56},
Number = {3-4},
Pages = {29-49},
Abstract = {The international dissemination of expertise in most transition
   countries is underdeveloped because of a number of developmental and
   practical challenges. Croatia's overall educational and innovatory
   potential for health knowledge transfer remains above average when
   compared to what has been achieved by other new EU Member States, and it
   is dominated by public sector research institutes and universities. This
   unrealized potential could be improved further by enhancing the
   international dissemination of Croatian medical expertise using public
   diplomacy.
   The aim of this paper is to address the way in which the international
   dissemination of medical expertise in transition countries can serve as
   a tool of public diplomacy to improve its scope and success, in addition
   to advancing the scope of the knowledge transfer itself. The case of
   Croatia is used as an example. An effective communication strategy is an
   important element of public diplomacy that, by influencing public
   opinion, provides the necessary precondition for active societal support
   of the willing participants in the transfer of knowledge. Hence, at the
   beginning of this paper we present the concept of international
   knowledge transfer in general, and then proceed to present the example
   of the transfer of Croatian medical knowledge.
   The second part of this paper addresses elements of public diplomacy and
   different communication mechanisms and the potential for the
   international dissemination of domestic medical expertise, with the
   primary emphasis on Croatia. Finally, we present an overall analysis and
   an algorithm of public diplomacy activities that each country in
   transition can adopt to overcome failures associated with the
   international dissemination of medical expertise.},

Title = {Food Sharing Initiatives and Food Democracy: Practice and Policy in
   Three European Cities},
Journal = {POLITICS AND GOVERNANCE},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {7},
Number = {4},
Pages = {8-20},
Abstract = {Calls for greater food democracy in Europe have emerged as the
   limitations of urban food systems dominated by commercial organisations
   are documented, but little attention has been paid to how policy
   arrangements affect attempts to transition to more democratic food
   futures. This article examines food sharing initiatives-increasingly
   facilitated by the use of information and communication technologies-as
   a potential means to enhance urban food democracy, and explores the role
   of policy in shaping those practices in three European capital cities:
   Berlin, London, and Dublin. We pose two related questions: To what
   extent are diverse food sharing initiatives exemplars of food democracy,
   and to what extent do policy arrangements affect food sharing practices
   and the nature of any food democracy they might embody? Our empirical
   evidence demonstrates where the goals and impacts of food sharing
   initiatives align with key dimensions of food democracy. We also
   consider how food sharing initiatives-and any food democracy dimensions
   that they support-are affected by the policy environment in which they
   operate. The food sharing initiatives examined revealed to be agents of
   pro-democratic change, at least within the boundaries of their spheres
   of influence, despite policies rarely having their activities and
   aspirations in mind.},

Abstract = {The aim of the article is to find the common ground of various
   cosmopolitan traditions. I propose that in the core of the various
   cosmopolitan arguments is the interpretation of all political entities
   as conventions. In this sense, the individual is taken to be a natural
   being, while the state is an agreement. I explored what I think is at
   the root of this distinction and then I confront it with some important
   criticisms. These criticisms are gathered around the political tradition
   known as communitarianism. Finally, I suggest that the Aristotelian
   concept of ``practical wisdom{''} can be seen as a way to solve
   difficulties of both cosmopolitanism and communitarianism.},

Abstract = {Many foreign aid donors brand development interventions. How do citizens
   in the donor country react to seeing this branding in action? We test
   the proposition that citizens will express higher levels of support for
   foreign aid when they see a branded foreign aid project relative to
   seeing the same project without branding. We present results from a
   survey-based laboratory experiment conducted in the United Kingdom where
   subjects learned about a typical foreign aid project and received a
   randomized UK branding treatment. Our results suggest that the branding
   treatments increase the likelihood that donor country respondents
   believe that aid recipients can identify the source of the foreign aid.
   Only among conservative respondents, however, does the evidence imply
   that branding increases support for foreign aid. ``UK aid{''} branding
   increases conservative opinion that aid dollars are well spent and
   increases support among this group for the expansion of foreign aid.},

Abstract = {Preferential trade agreements are now the dominant trend in the
   international trading regime. Unlike earlier `first generation'
   agreements, the new agreements became more comprehensive in their
   coverage, impinging on areas that are subject to subnational
   jurisdiction of federal systems. Given constitutionally-prescribed
   competences allocated to subnational governments, the diversity of
   interests and sensitivities of subnational entities bring deeply
   entrenched regulatory practices under scrutiny. Few studies have focused
   on whether the combination of economic liberalization and political
   fragmentation will push federal and sub-federal entities to address
   domestic market fragmentation. We examine whether international market
   liberalization fosters domestic regulatory and structural reforms to
   cross-border barriers to trade in Canada and the United States. We show
   that while the political incentives and functional pressures generated
   by free trade agreements have fostered attempts at addressing internal
   market restrictions in Canada, the US has not followed the same path due
   to weaker mechanisms of intergovernmental coordination.},

Abstract = {At the time of the disintegration of ``actually existing socialism{''}
   in the 1990s, it appeared that the inexorable flux of globalization was
   going to consume the nation-state. However, recent years have witnessed
   the increasing role of the states in both the Global North and South.
   The relationship between the state and capital is a frequently traversed
   subject, but what needs further illumination is the persistence of
   ``many states{''} and its relation to capitalism as both a national and
   global formation. While globalization of capital suggests a movement
   from multiplicity toward a dehistoricized abstraction, a global state
   has never been actualized. This implies that, unlike capital, the state
   cannot be dehistoricized or dedifferentiated; therefore, the only way to
   think about the state is to observe concrete, multiple states. In view
   of this difference and drawing on Nicos Poulantzas's and Kojin
   Karatani's inquiries into the states system, this article examines the
   multi-state system as an internal and external limit to Marxist thought.},

Abstract = {Procedural fairness theory posits that the way in which authoritative
   decisions are made strongly impacts people's willingness to accept them.
   This article challenges this claim by contending that democratic
   governments can achieve little in terms of acceptance of policy
   decisions by the procedural means at their disposal. Instead, outcome
   favorability is the dominant determinant of decision acceptance. The
   article explicates that while central parts of procedural fairness
   theory are true, outcome favorability is still overwhelmingly the
   strongest determinant of individuals' willingness to accept
   authoritative decisions. It improves on previous research by locating
   all key variables into one causal model and testing this model using
   appropriate data. Findings from a large number of experiments (both
   vignette and field) reproduce the expected relationships from previous
   research and support the additional predictions.},

Abstract = {This article examines the ways in which political ideas are spread and
   appropriated in the United Russia party, created in 2001 to support
   Vladimir Putin and has been the overwhelmingly dominant party for more
   than fifteen years at all levels of power. It shows how a think tank,
   the Center for Social-Conservative Policy, was put in charge of the work
   that led to the formulation of a second definition of conservatism used
   by United Russia representatives to define themselves. This definition
   differed from the first one, more consensual one that was formulated by
   experts and academics. Using content analysis and fieldwork involving
   semi participant observation at the Center, this article analyzes how
   the concern to make the notion of conservatism accessible to the
   population has encouraged the politicization of issues related to family
   and sexuality.},

Abstract = {Voluntary units were established in Ukraine in 2014. They supported the

   After the hot phase of the war had passed, several of their commanders
   took on roles in the parliaments and in the administration. However,
   they did not become an influential political force. The voluntary units

Abstract = {Literature can not be reduced, in its different narrative modalities, to
   its exclusive condition of artistic and creative product, since in it
   emerge, even without the author's intention, a deep political and
   ideological content that gives an account, in an open or overlapping
   manner , of the power relations that are woven in the time and space
   where this cultural product is conceived, as well as of the belief
   systems that identify a specific time or society, all under the veil of
   ``fictional literary discourse.{''} The objective of this article is to
   define the theoretical, epistemological and methodological bases that
   make possible the development of a research project that provides
   insights into the political and ideological content underlying loth
   century Latin American literature, to land (later) in the study of
   particular cases. Methodologically, the research used the descriptive
   method and documentary observation. It is concluded that literature,
   although it is not per se a primary source of historiographical value,
   means a privileged space to understand the political and ideological
   ideas that characterize the work of an author and, at the same time, the
   main concerns of the context in which Live or live as intellectual /
   creative.},

Abstract = {Committee chairs are key positions in legislatures. Their holders are
   vested with important formal and informal powers. In this article, we
   make a comparative appraisal of the politics of committee chair
   assignment in Ireland and Spain. Using an original dataset that covers
   the past two decades in both countries, we make a twofold contribution.
   Based on Cox and McCubbins's partisan theory of US Congress, we first
   develop a framework for parliamentary democracies by showing that party
   leadership assigns legislators with low electoral vulnerability to
   committee chairs to buy their loyalty to the party. Furthermore, results
   suggest that those legislators are assigned to committee chairs to
   heighten their willingness to work for partisan public goods. Secondly,
   our contribution leverages electoral systems variation to show how
   different institutional environments produce similar outcomes.},

Abstract = {Referendums campaigns are important and earlier research closely
   analysed their general functioning, effects on turnout, and the
   importance of media and information for voting behaviour. However, the
   role of referendum campaigns as such (with all its components) in
   shaping voting behaviour was widely neglected. This article seeks to
   partially fill this gap in the literature and argues that referendum
   campaign is an important predictor of the voting decision as long as
   people perceive it as informative and follow it. We investigate this
   effect in the context of three referendums organized in 2015-2016 in
   Bulgaria, Poland and Slovakia. The results indicate that these two
   variables explain the decision of citizens to support referendums across
   different settings. Their effects are consistent and significantly
   stronger than alternative explanations employed in the literature such
   as the limited effect of campaigns, second-order elections, partisan
   cues or amount of information received.},

Abstract = {It is impossible to understand modern Islamic (especially Arab)
   societies without taking into account the influence of Islamism as an
   ideology, cultural environment, mode of action, and lifestyle.
   Unfortunately, Islamism in many ways has remained a ``phenomenon lurking
   behind the surface.{''} In this article we will focus on the analysis of
   some political aspects of modern Islamism, showing how Islamism behaves
   when in opposition (where it feels more confident) and what happens when
   Islamists come to power in a legitimate way. We would like to show that
   Islamism is not something superficial, but the deepest and most
   comprehensive substance of Islamic societies. Therefore, it is extremely
   important to distinguish between radical and moderate substance of
   Islamic societies. Therefore, it is extremely important to distinguish
   between radical and moderate Islamism, relying on the latter to weaken
   the former, since moderate Islamism can grow to be a positive and
   promising part of the political spectrum of Islamic countries. We
   believe that it is impossible to reduce the danger of radical terrorist
   Islamism by force alone. We can hope that this will decline if it can be
   divided by moderate Islamism and make the latter more respectable, open,
   and involved in normal political life.},

Abstract = {Since its very origins, the importance and desired impacts of
   international organizations are among the prominent issues of the
   International Relations discipline. Although much has been written on
   their contribution to governance in various fields of international
   politics, including human rights, the individual participation, motives
   and efforts of states and their transformative effects still remain
   understudied. Inter alia, this is also true for the elected mandates of
   states in the United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC), which not
   only affect the international community but also the states themselves.
   To fill in the gap, the article first attempts to combine the existing
   tools used for the analysis of the impacts of a state's engagement
   within this body on its external and domestic policies into a more
   comprehensive analytical framework. In the empirical sections, the
   activities of the Czech Republic during its UNHRC mandate in the period
   of 2011-2014 are examined. The analysis draws primarily on the data from
   the Reports of the UNHRC on its regular and special sessions during that
   period. In addition, a comparison is also employed of the key foreign
   policy documents with the voluntary pledges and commitments adopted as
   an integral part of the candidacy to the UNHRC. The article concludes
   that the Czech Republic used the mandate primarily for the fulfilment of
   its foreign policy goals. Opportunities for changes in the national
   legislation, as well as for the extension of Czech human rights foreign
   policy with some aspects of economic and social rights, were missed.},

Abstract = {The contributions in this volume discuss legitimacy as an ``essentially
   contested concept.{''} The empirical study of legitimacy raises numerous
   theoretical, conceptual and methodological questions. Three axes of
   theoretical-conceptual considerations can be identified: the
   relationship between normative-theoretical and empirical-analytical
   oriented parts and approaches in the field of legitimacy research; the
   question whether legitimacy should be studied as a state or legitimacy
   as a process; and the relationship between three components of
   legitimacy and legitimation processes: Input, Throughput, and Output.
   These axes of conceptualization of legitimacy are taken up in the
   contributions to the volume in relation to different fields and methods,
   for established democracies, autocracies, and the European Union, and
   for quantitative, qualitative, and mixed-methods approaches.},

Pages = {51+},
Abstract = {In the spring of 2014, numerous irregular battalions were created in
   Ukraine. They went to the Donbas, where the police and the army had
   failed to defeat the separatist movement and the intervention of Russia.
   These battalions have rather different histories, but they have all been
   supported by the government. Now, most of them are subordinate to the
   Ministry of Internal Affairs and the Ministry of Defence. However, some
   militias of a more right-wing origin remain opposed to these ministries
   even today. While the extremist parties with which they are associated
   are being met with little political support, the battalions hit the
   headlines on a regular basis.},

Abstract = {As for a tentative conception of a Brazilian legal thought, the paper
   heightens the contribution and the conceptual efforts of one of its
   utmost important jurists: Hermes Lima. The article unfolds some
   bibliographical research, out of primary sources, and presents
   substantial data regarding the main character of the study. Chosen a
   starting point, his most acknowledged book, an introduction to the study
   of law, the paper intends to highlight his core ideas. In the main, it
   explores his conception of law as a social fact, irrespective to its
   metaphysical foundations and concepts, as well as the preponderance of
   the socioeconomic structure. The paper forwards some contribution
   regarding the study of Lima's ideas, in the context of the relevant
   roles Lima played in the Brazilian legal and political realm, as a Law
   Professor, as a Secretary of State and as a Justice of the Federal
   Supreme Court.},

   activities of sub-state governments and embracing to a lesser or greater
   extent the elements defining foreign policy, gains an interest of
   experts from various academic disciplines. Yet, over the recent years,
   with some exceptions, the academic literature has been more preoccupied
   with investigation of economic dimensions of paradiplomacy when compared
   with investigation of normative-oriented issues. The objective of this
   article is to analyse the potential of the sub-national actors
   paradiplomatic activities in the field of development assistance. The
   articles adopts an exploratory research design and it based
   theoretically on the studies on paradiplomacy. It looks at the
   particular examples of sub-state governments from the EU countries. The
   results show that despite little attention concerning the problem, the
   local governments go through the process of an ongoing
   institutionalization of their activities in development assistance as
   they have launched their own development aid programmes, manage local
   budgets for development aid, and established administrative bodies in
   charge of conducting development aid programmes. Due to such
   institutionalization of development assistance policy, sub-state
   governments are capable of establishing and developing bilateral and
   multilateral relations with third parties, both state and non-state
   actors, confirming that they are politically and economically adequately
   resourced.},

   in the feedback loop between the problem of creating the region, the
   means of solving this problem, the associated theories, concepts,
   documents and events, has been approbated. The applied aspect of the
   futurological complex has been noted. The definition of the geostrategic
   region has been offered, and assumptions about its functional role under
   the conditions of the fourth industrial revolution, during which regions
   appear as mutagens of the international environment, have been made.},

Journal = {POLIS-POLITICHESKIYE ISSLEDOVANIYA},
Year = {2019},
Number = {6},
Pages = {128-144},
Abstract = {The article examines the theoretical and methodological foundations of
   forecasting the transformation of the modern political world order, and
   analyzes alternative scenarios of overcoming the modern crisis of global
   controllability. Particular attention is paid to identifying latent
   opportunities for evolutionary self-transformation of the modern world
   and the conditions for their actualization and activation. Among the
   priorities of the author's analysis are the nature of the modern state
   and the evolutionary changes that its basic national-territorial model
   has undergone over the past century, and at the same time, the features
   of new systemic practices of modern state building that go beyond the
   previously universally recognized regulatory institutional framework.
   The essence of the modern crisis, according to the author, is reduced to
   overcoming the unipolar dysfunction that arose as a result of the
   collapse of the bipolar system and, paradoxically, became the crown of
   development of a pluralistic international system of democratic
   nation-states. A striking manifestation of this dysfunction is, on the
   one hand, the growing discrepancy between the capabilities of the
   national-territorial model of statehood and the development needs of the
   communities of the modern world, and on the other, the insurmountable
   problem of translating global leadership: this problem diagnoses the
   fundamental inadequacy of the hierarchical principle of world order in
   relation to today's global governance tasks. The ineffectiveness of
   previously practiced techniques and the lack of new effective
   development strategies, acceptable to all the main subjects of world
   politics, forms the situation of global interlude, expectations and
   delayed action for the foreseeable future.},

Abstract = {Does the wide distribution of political power in democracies, relative
   to other modes of government, result in better decisions? Specifically,
   do we have any reason to believe that they are better qualitatively -
   more reasoned, better supported by the available evidence, more
   deserving of support - than those which have been made by other means?
   In order to answer this question, we examine the recent effort by
   Talisse and Misak to show that democracy is epistemically justified.
   Highlighting the strengths and weaknesses of their arguments, we
   conclude that the differences between an epistemic conception of
   democracy and an epistemic justification of democracy are fundamental to
   determining the relative attractions of different arguments for
   democracy, and their implications for actual forms of government.},

Abstract = {Addressing honors education and undergraduate research at the community
   college level is a question that is becoming more prevalent in the
   teaching landscape. Undergraduate research is encouraged as literature
   supports the role it plays in developing engaged students who are
   interested in the field of political science and academia in general.
   Applying this concept to the community college level requires shifting
   in understanding regarding the types of students that are mentored and
   the expectations assigned to the research. Upper-level students have the
   advantage of more years in school and a connection to the discipline by
   majoring in the field; expanding on this approach at the community
   college level requires a shift by the professor or mentor to meet
   academic standards. This reflective essay recounts the implementation of
   mandatory original methodology research in a general education state
   government course within a community college honors program. Experience
   working with students at this level in political science has revealed a
   need to be flexible and challenging regarding curriculum and level of
   methods training if community college undergraduate research in the
   discipline is to be successful.},

Abstract = {The article is devoted to the analysis of the practice of forming and
   articulating the official historical narrative in contemporary Russia on
   the basis of three cases that make it possible to trace the interactions
   between various groups involved in constructing the narrative. The study
   of the thematic repertoire of the commemorative speeches allows to trace
   in the speeches of the head of state the result of the collective work
   of the Presidential Administration. The author shows that the formation
   of the memory infrastructure supporting the official narrative of the
   thousand-year Russia became more or less systematic only under Putin's
   third presidential term. The 100th anniversary of the Russian Revolution
   of 1917 provides an interesting platform for studying the discussions
   within the ruling elite. The analysis of the preparation process for the
   commemoration reveals a certain competition of opinions at the
   decision-making stage and the Presidential Administration's desire to
   balance them. Given the weak consistency of the official historical
   narrative, this pattern might be typical for the events, the
   interpretation of which has not taken shape and/or is not subject to
   securitization. The transcripts of the meetings of Presidents Putin and
   Medvedev with the ``historical community{''} - scientists and teachers -
   give an idea of the nature of the interaction between the authorities
   and the academic community. The study of these transcripts indicates
   that the recent years witnessed the development of stable practices of
   interaction between the state and the historical establishment about the
   official narrative.},

Journal = {NEW POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {41},
Number = {1},
Pages = {98-121},
Abstract = {In 1776, a group of political outsiders in Pennsylvania seized control
   of the convention and drafting process to create a robustly democratic
   and class-conscious state constitution. These commoners believed
   governments upheld and extended social and political privilege, serving
   primarily the interests of wealthy and powerful citizens. They tried to
   reverse these oligarchic tendencies, particularly through a ``common
   benefits clause{''}: here the social contract prioritized the whole
   community and instituted a more horizontal form of equality among
   citizens. Ultimately, the short-lived Pennsylvania constitution of 1776
   left a powerful legacy, largely forgotten but useful to remember. Today,
   in a broad ``new progressive federalist{''} movement, democratic
   political action is rising up from city, state, and local governments to
   interrupt and counteract the oligarchic tendencies of the national
   government under the Trump administration. This paper shows how common
   benefit and equal privilege clauses, still on the books in many states,
   can inspire and inform this movement.},

   suffering a serious process of internal erosion and, in some cases, a

   States. The European Union is also the preferred target of direct
   attacks by populist and anti-European movements. In fact, in these
   moments, some essential values of the integration process, such as
   democracy and rule of law, are being put into question in some Member
   States. Given that the Union is a ``community of values{''}
   (Wertegemeinschaft) and that the values of Article 2 TEU possess a
   normative value and are actionable, the Commission have brought several
   infringement proceedings before the ECJagainst Poland and Hungary, for
   the violation of those same values. Likewise, for the first time since
   its institution in the constitutive treaties, the mechanism of Article
   7(1) TEU has been activated against Poland. We are, therefore, in
   uncharted territory, whose final outcome is uncertain and could
   represent a serious threat against the European integration process

Abstract = {China is in the process of becoming an Atlantic naval power, Ryan D
   Martinson argues. Since 2014, the activities of the Chinese navy in the
   South Atlantic have evolved from port visits and largely symbolic joint
   exercises to independent operations at sea. This helps the Chinese navy
   to gain familiarity with the operating environment, so that it can
   effectively respond when called on by civilian leaders to protect
   China's growing interests in the region. China's increased naval
   presence in the South Atlantic may also reflect a shift in Beijing's
   strategy for countering perceived threats from the US military in the
   Western Pacific.},

Abstract = {This paper aims to analyze legal ways of countering an act of the Head
   of State as a representative of Brazil in an international body. To
   guide the analysis, the veto of the Brazilian State at the Human Rights
   Council of the United Nations will be focused. This veto represented a
   refusal of the Brazilian State in relation to a proposed of the Council
   to monitor the implementation of human rights in associated States, thus
   violating the principle expressed in Article 4, II, of the Federal
   Constitution. In order to make such an analysis, it will be discussed
   whether the Head of State (President) can be held accountable for this
   refusal or whether the act is subject to constitutional control. It will
   be stated, however, that none of solution prospects are applicable in
   this case. Therefore, there occurs a technical gap. Finally, in the last
   topic, a possible solution to the existing gap is pointed out.},

Title = {WEIMAR AMERICA: A POLITICAL DISCUSSION ON THE CAUSES OF THE DECLINE OF
   ONE GREAT DEMOCRACY},

Abstract = {The dramatic change in the political climate in the United States after
   the victory of Donald Trump in the 2016 presidential elections sparked a
   heated debate in the intellectual circles about the nature, historical
   foundations and the future of the American democracy. The discussion
   centers on the topic of a ``suicide of democracy{''}, with the collapse
   of the Weimar Republic in Germany being its classic example, and the
   prospects for the Weimar scenario in the United States.
   From the Political Science viewpoint, the content of this discussion is
   of interest in at least three respects. First, it captures the truly
   significant changes in the American political system, indicating
   qualitative, if not irreversible, shifts. Second, it poses a
   methodological problem of measuring the degree of deformation of the
   democratic institutions. Third, it allows one to look at the United
   States in a comparative perspective, drawing on the experience of other
   countries.
   The article analyzes why the image of Weimar America is relevant for the
   political agenda of the United States, considers various interpretations
   of the meaning of the current changes, contours and basic parameters of
   the erosion of democracy and the system of separation of powers, polar
   assessments of the phenomenon of trumpism, as well as the ideas about
   the possibility of overcoming the political contradictions faced by one
   of the oldest democracies in the world. In the conclusion, the author
   examines the question of the Weimar paradigm of the collapse of
   democracies and demonstrates the extent to which the above discussed
   problems are specific to the United States, and to which extent they
   reflect global trends and can be integrated into the general theory of
   stability of democratic regimes.},

Journal = {CRITICAL REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL SOCIAL AND POLITICAL PHILOSOPHY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {22},
Number = {3, SI},
Pages = {318-334},
Abstract = {Some luck egalitarians argue that justice is just one value among others
   and is thus not necessarily what we should strive for in order to make
   the world better. Yet, by focusing on only one dimension of what matters
   - luck equality - it proves very difficult to draw political
   implications in cases where several values are in tension. We believe
   that normative political philosophy must have the ambitionto guide
   political action. Hence, in this paper we make a negative and a positive
   point. Negatively, we argue that the inability to offer recommendations
   on what to strive for potentially weakens Kasper Lippert-Rasmussen's
   account of luck egalitarianism. In order not to be irrelevant for
   political practice, a more serviceable version of luck egalitarianism
   that would allow for all-things-considered judgments is needed.
   Positively, we examine two possible routes toward such a view. One would
   be to stick to pluralism, but to discuss possible clashes and find a
   rule of regulation in each case. Another would consist in giving up
   value pluralism by identifying an over-arching value or principle that
   would arbitrate between different values. We suggest that
   Lippert-Rasmussen's foundation of equality carries the potential for
   such an overarching principle.},

Abstract = {In this paper I intend to analyze two films made by the catalan director
   Isabel Coixet, as they reflect the thesis that points to a contradictory
   nature of the human being. This contradictory nature includes both
   individuality, self-sufficiency and justice, as well as socialization,
   compassion and care. In this way, from the margins of the system that
   favors artistic reflection, Coixet gives an account of what the official
   conception of the subject of rights and Law lacks, especially in
   relation to love or affection. In this way, she points towards a
   relational conception of human beings, which generates a debate on the
   importance of family relationships, on alienating work and the necessary
   work-life balance, and on life in the private sphere as a sphere that
   transcends the public one.},

Journal = {POLITICA Y SOCIEDAD},

Abstract = {Based on a Mexico City ethnographic study involving medical personnel at
   assisted-reproduction clinics as well as both male and female in-vitro
   fertilization users, the study explores the framework of relationships
   surrounding cryogenically-preserved and vitrified embryos. It postulates
   that by creating morally and legally unclassifiable life-forms,
   biotechnologies upset the equilibrium within preexisting categories as
   they give rise to others. It explains how legal, religious and political
   frameworks that were considered valid in Mexico between 2015-17
   determined that products of those technologies could be considered
   ``unborn{''} or ``conceived{''} ``children{''} or ``babies,{''} among
   other names. The fertilized ovule therefore appears both in discourse
   and in spoken language under terms that evoke subjective and relational
   aspects. The embryo's final end (i.e., its conservation, donation to
   scientific research, adoption or discard) not only depends on its
   recognition under one of those terms, but as well -as studies (Giraud,
   2014; Collard and Kashmeri, 2009 Cromer, 2018) carried out in other
   countries posit- other parameters such as age, sex, financial
   circumstances and parent/owner health also intervene. The present study
   goes on to suggest that embryos' place in genealogy as well as
   parents'/owners' previous experience in IVF cycles are definitive
   factors in the personification of the embryo and of establishing
   parenting bonds with it.},

Abstract = {The 2017 parliamentary elections saw dozens of political novices enter
   France's National Assembly, individuals who had never before been
   politically active. This arrival of novices was all the more remarkable
   at it was both a large-scale and rare phenomenon. Over the previous
   decades, the French political field had become even more closed in on
   itself, making this influx statistically unlikely. This article focuses
   on these newcomers, but instead of a conventional exploration of the way
   they learn their craft, the role they create for themselves, or even the
   discrimination they experience in accessing power, I use this mass entry
   situation to investigate what I term the ``contemporary political
   condition.{''} An immersive ethnography carried out at the French
   Parliament during the first year reveals three prominent
   characteristics: novice MPs expressed surprise at the irregular pace of
   work, at the unexpected (and often unwanted) publicity surrounding their
   entry into the public sphere, and also at the agonistic way in which
   politics is ``done,{''} even with a vastly renewed legislature.},

Abstract = {In this paper I compare the psychopolitical account given by Byung-Chul
   Han and Stiegler with the Foucauldian biopolitical framework. Taking
   into account Deleuze's and Baudrillard's remarks on the new society,
   Stiegler proposes to use the term psycho-power to complete Foucault's
   model. Byung-Chul Han has suggested that we are in a psychopolitical age
   that goes far beyond the biopolitical account. This analysis is linked
   to Bauman's work on liquid modernity, and to a reconceptualization of
   power.},

Abstract = {One of the most relevant changes in the way international migration and
   in particular border immigration is understood and addressed in the
   context of migration policies in Argentina is the adoption of
   humanitarian discourses, practices and policies by which migrants are
   re-constructed as a security-related issue. Subjects considered as
   victims or vulnerable that need to be protected and their human rights
   guaranteed increasingly become common images that coexist with
   understanding migration as a threat or security risk. This article seeks
   to understand the nexus between migration, security and human rights
   that has developed in the field of migration policies in Argentina in
   the period from 1990 to 2015 through the analysis of the discourses and
   practices of relevant actors.},

Abstract = {This paper aims to indicate the key issues yielding to explain why a
   regulatory framework and correct policy responses are needed for what
   here we define as a platform `society' and to identify its key
   `collective' features. These include the respect of workers' fundamental
   rights (i.e. collective bargaining and representation) as well as they
   include the role of the state and public policy. These reflections are
   developed in the light of an in-depth examinations of the social
   implications of the gig-economy for work and employment.},

Abstract = {Three Russophone groups live in Germany: Russian-speaking Jews, Russian
   Germans and Russians. They arrived to the Federal Republic from Russia
   and other former Soviet states for a number of different reasons, and
   their legal status also differs. Yet how strong is the contact between
   Russian-speaking Jews, Russian Germans and Russians within the
   respective groups and between the members of the three groups? This
   explorative study based on qualitative interviews illustrates with
   reference to this particular case that while a common language may be a
   binding factor, the social and cultural differences mean that there is
   little intercommunication, even when the groups are geographically
   close.},

Journal = {CRITICAL REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL SOCIAL AND POLITICAL PHILOSOPHY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {22},
Number = {1, SI},
Pages = {55-70},
Abstract = {Contemporary `realists' attack the Kantian influence on political
   philosophy. A main charge is that Kantians fail to understand the
   specificity of politics and neglect to develop a `distinctively
   political thought' that differs from moral philosophy. Instead, the
   critics say, Kantians are guilty of an `ethics-first approach to
   politics,' in which political theory is a mere application of moral
   principles. But what does this ethics-first approach have to do with
   Kant himself? Very little. This article shows how Kant's approach to
   political theory at a fundamental level includes political institutions,
   power, and coercion as well as disagreement, security, and coordination
   problems. In contrast to realists, Kant has a fundamental principle,
   which can explain why and guide how we ought to approach the political
   question, namely the norm of equal freedom. Yet, Kant's theory does not
   take the form of a moralistic ought addressed to the isolated
   individual, but concerns a problem that we share as interdependent
   beings and that requires common institutions. The fruitfulness of the
   Kantian approach, then, is that it can take the political question
   seriously without being uncritical of actual politics and power, and
   that it can be normative without being moralistic.},

Title = {BETWEEN SUBSTANCE AND PROCEDURE: TWO TRADITIONS IN DELIBERATIVE
   DEMOCRATIC THEORY},
Journal = {POLIS-POLITICHESKIYE ISSLEDOVANIYA},
Year = {2019},
Number = {4},
Pages = {26-39},
Abstract = {There is growing criticism of deliberative democracy from agonistic
   positions, which makes it relevant to revitalize Rawls and Habermas'
   debate on the concept of the political. Habermas' position has become
   dominant in deliberative democracy: the majority of both empirical and
   theoretical studies rely on the proceduralist, rather than on
   substantionalist tradition. In contrast with Rawls, Habermas simply
   states that political process is not limited by the political system and
   does not articulate the idea of the political. This paper promotes the
   concept that substantialist tradition is more promising for political
   theory due to the idea of the political. To justify this idea we briefly
   discuss both projects, sum up the Rawls-Habermas debate, and then
   scrutinize the concept of politics in both approaches. The paper shows
   that political liberalism focuses on the conditions of deliberation,
   rather than on philosophical construction of the deliberation rules as
   Habermas does. Rawls differentiates the metaphysical and the political
   as autonomous modes of thinking, acknowledging that the latter contains
   its own epistemic and normative claims. At the same time Rawls' concept
   of the political needs to be partly reconsidered. Political liberalism
   should acknowledge the dyadic nature of politics. One the one side,
   legitimate doctrines politically subordinate illegitimate doctrines. On
   the other side, political tensions are permanently produced by the
   co-existence of various legitimate doctrines. This correction
   strengthens Rawls' arguments in his debate with Habermas and enriches
   deliberative democracy by the topics of violence, power and freedom,
   which are central to political theory.},

Journal = {POLITICKE VEDY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {22},
Number = {3},
Pages = {164-191},
Abstract = {Current situation in Sahel is today one of the most important topics in
   study of Africa. Sahel or Sahara poses interesting area to study
   sub-state actors. As this area is hardly to controle it could poses the
   unpredictable factor both in internal or international politics.
   Therefore, it is also important for the study of reasons behind
   interventions in the area. This article deals with an analysis of
   reasons which led to the Nigerien participation in the intervention in
   the internal conflict in Mali. The main aim of the paper is to indicate
   how specific actors and permeable borders caused a safety threat to
   Niger during the conflict in Mali. The author discusses the roles of the
   Tuaregs and the Sahel/Sahara in the Niger's decision to support and
   actively participate in the Malian conflict. Using the concept of
   heterarchy it is presented how local actors perform significant roles in
   the Sahara's and Sahelian area. Viewed this way, the Sahara is not an
   obstacle but it connects the people, social groups and states. This
   space together with different groups that operate there, poses a
   security threat considering the fact that it is an armed group operation
   area, which can lead to a conflict contagion.},

Journal = {POLIS-POLITICHESKIYE ISSLEDOVANIYA},
Year = {2019},
Number = {6},
Pages = {145-158},
Abstract = {The term `staging', which appeared in the 1920s and 1930s as part of the
   theatrical vocabulary, acquired a new meaning with the advent of new
   media. Today, this concept reflects the invasion of dramaturgical
   principles, both in the everyday life of each person, and in global
   political processes. Using methodologies developed by the classics of
   political sociology and communication science (Baudrillard, Habermas,
   McLuhan) and modern researchers (Fischer-Lichte, Meyer, Schicha), the
   author shows how, as a result of the staging, the border between the
   real and the imagined is blurred. This can later be used for
   manipulating public opinion. The article discusses historical examples
   of the `dramatization of reality' and its features at the present stage,
   and also analyzes the processes that create conditions for the
   popularization and widespread use of dramatization as well as its
   covered mechanisms. The author concludes that, amidst the growth of
   irrationality and uncertainty in society and the increasing role of the
   masses in shaping the information agenda, it is they, and not individual
   actors and ruling elites, who become the main `customer' of the staged
   reality. At the same time, it becomes more and more difficult to
   neutralize the negative effects of the staging, since it has more than a
   single source and avoids control under current conditions.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF ELECTIONS PUBLIC OPINION AND PARTIES},

Volume = {29},

Abstract = {There has been much work done investigating the adoption of online
   campaigns in UK general election campaigns. Although some research has
   focussed on the candidate-level (Gibson, R., W. Lusoli, and S. Ward.
   2008. ``Nationalizing and Normalizing the Local? A Comparative Analysis
   of Online Candidate Campaigning in Australia and Britain.{''} Journal of

   Journal of Information Technology \& Politics 12 (1): 1-17), this is an
   under-researched area. This is despite early web-campaign scholars
   (Margolis, M., and D. Resnick. 2000. Politics as Usual: The Cyberspace
   Revolution. Sage) maintaining that e-campaigning could provide the most
   important advantages to campaigns at the candidate level. In light of
   this, the paper aims to provide the most comprehensive study of
   candidate-level online campaigning carried out in the UK to date. This
   paper employs original data, measuring website and social media use by
   candidates during the 2015 UK general election campaign. These data
   allow for a detailed explanation of the normalization thesis, one of the
   leading theories in the field of e-campaigns. The findings here are
   significant as there are several instances where normalization does not
   hold, suggesting that online tools are contributing to campaign change.
   Green Party candidates subverted normalization to a significant degree,
   particularly on social media. Assessing the campaign content, a quarter
   of candidates adopted more than one interactive feature on their website
   and furthermore, interactive use of Twitter was the most common type of
   Twitter use.},

Abstract = {Shimon Stein, Israel's former ambassador to Germany, admits that by now,
   Germans and Israelis expect very little from each other, regards
   illiberal tendencies in Israel as being a further symptom of the erosion
   of the liberal order that can also be observed in the west, and analyses
   the differences between the interests of Israel and Russia in the Middle
   East. He also claims that there is no political will in Moscow to become
   involved in building a post-war Syria, and that Russia is incapable of
   presenting itself as an influential major power in the Middle East. He
   demands more political engagement from Germany and the EU, and contends

Abstract = {This symposium explores the value of Poststructuralist (or Political)
   Discourse Theory (PDT) for the analysis of world politics. PDT was
   originally developed by the late Argentine political theorist Ernesto
   Laclau, in early works together with Chantal Mouffe, and has entered the
   margins of International Relations (IR) in recent years, mainly by
   bringing in poststructuralist concepts that had previously been ignored
   by the more critical strands of theorizing. Against this background, the
   introduction (1) discusses the disconnect between PDT and research on
   world politics, primarily in IR, as well as PDT's potential
   contribution, (2) provides an overview of PDT's central theoretical
   tenets, in particular with respect to its social ontology and its
   theoretical concept of change, and (3) introduces the contributions to
   the symposium.},

Abstract = {Transparency has been used as a metaphor for direct social perception
   since antiquity. This essay studies variations in transparency rhetoric
   as ideological elements of broader social changes. In the eighteenth
   century, an individualist form of transparency language emerged with the
   spread of commodity production. In the mid twentieth century,
   bureaucratization associated ``transparency{''} with a planned
   individualization that worked to mask, legitimize, and facilitate
   undemocratic bureaucratic control. This essay argues that Marxists
   should learn to recognize and avoid such misleading connotations and
   outline their own theory of transparency.},

Abstract = {The article is devoted to the current status of the trade war between
   the US and China and its probable consequences for the economies of the
   two countries and for the world economy as a whole.
   In May 2019, took place another escalation of the conflict, when
   President Trump accused China of trying to revise the terms of the
   tradeagreement reached during several rounds of negotiations, as well as
   of the desire to postpone the signing of the agreement. As a result,
   additional duties on Chinese goods worth 200 billion USD were raised
   from 10 \% to 25 \%. Since June I, China's response measures began to
   operate. Thus, at the moment, trade and economic relations between China
   and the United States have reached the highest level of tension since
   the establishment of diplomatic relations between the two countries.
   The article focuses on the role of the WfO in Chinese-American
   relations, provides a brief retrospective review of the process of
   China's accession to this organization, when the Clinton administration
   contributed to this accession in the hope of increasing American exports
   to China. It also characterizes disputes between China and the United
   States within the WTO.
   Both the US and China are suffering multi -billion dollar losses because
   of the trade war. Its main impact on the American economy covered
   industries that fell under retaliatory ``trade war{''} measures of
   China: agriculture, aircraft, automotive, oil industry. The trade war
   has a negative influence on the growth rate of the Chinese economy. To
   increase activity in the domestic market and thus weaken the impact of
   the trade conflict, Beijing has taken additional measures to liberalize
   Chinese economy: the tax burden and import. duties have been reduced,
   serious restrictions on the work of foreign companies have been removed.
   Moreover, the article provides a forecast of the probable consequences
   of the trade conflict for the American and Chinese economies, for
   international tradeand for the WfO itself.},

   The analysis is based on three axes: first, the publication site is
   presented in its various contexts; Secondly, we analyze how humor was
   used to promote a binary vision of politics: third, the question of
   social change from the political and humoristic perspective of the
   magazine. It is proposed that the study of the humoristic guidelines of
   the journal is a worthy point to capture a topic not covered by the
   bibliography on liberal-conservatism in these years: humor as a
   political tool.},

   point for the analysis of political regimes in recent years. However,
   the concept is difficult to operationalize and measure - especially in
   countries where legitimacy seems to be a particularly important resource
   (cases of political transformation and high state fragility). This
   chapter provides an overview of the state of research. Four dimensions
   of measurement are distinguished, based on a dialogic understanding of
   legitimacy. On the one hand, legitimation, i.e. the strategic
   acquisition of legitimacy, is understood as a process in which the
   legitimacy expectations of political subjects are linked to the
   performance of the political regime. On the other hand, the legitimacy
   claims of the rulers meet observable behavioral patterns of the ruled.
   The literature review makes clear that the dialogical character of
   legitimacy is not always taken into account. As a result, existing
   approaches often measure only individual aspects of legitimacy or even
   miss the core of the concept altogether.},

Abstract = {Present empirical research on the connection between elections and civil
   war often treats causality as a one-way effect because it focuses
   exclusively on either the onset or the consequence of civil war. What is
   omitted in the literature is the endogenous nature of the
   election-conflict nexus throughout a civil war. This article dedicates
   itself to filling that gap. Treating administrative units in conflict as
   part of a rebellion network, we apply a stochastic actor-oriented model
   (SAOM) to the case of Sri Lanka. We find that, on the one hand,
   rebellion is less likely to occur in Tamil regions if national winners
   in presidential elections enjoy high local approval ratings (selection
   effect). On the other hand, regions involved in the rebellion network
   converge in terms of their local support for the national winner of the
   presidency (influence effect). Overall, our model-based simulation
   analysis shows that the influence effect has a larger impact on the
   endogenous relationship than the selection effect.},

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL CRITICAL THOUGHT},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {9},
Number = {4},
Pages = {562-580},
Abstract = {Marxism originated in Western Europe, where capitalism first emerged,
   but after being disseminated in the East achieved success in China. The
   reasons lie first of all in the character of Marxism as truth; in the
   compatibility of Marxism both with the spirit of Chinese tradition and
   with conditions at specific times; and with the successful sinicization
   of Marxism, that reflects the inheriting and developing of Marxism by
   the Chinese communists. The strategy of proletarian revolution that was
   formulated by Marx and Engels on the basis of historical developments in
   Western Europe was of great significance for guiding action in Germany
   at a time when the bourgeois revolution had been only partially
   successful, as well as in Russia and China, that were yet to experience
   a bourgeois revolution as such. This was because the strategy accorded
   well with the national conditions of these countries. The stance,
   viewpoints and methodology of Marxism are also compatible in many
   respects with the traditional Chinese spirit; this has made it possible
   for the Chinese people to understand and accept Marxism, and helps
   account for the more successful application of Marxism in the concrete
   national conditions of China. Together, the establishing of the People's
   Republic of China and the development of socialism with Chinese
   characteristics fully demonstrate the truth of Marxism and the
   inevitability of the victory of socialism over capitalism.},

Abstract = {We conduct a multilevel examination of the relationship between
   religiosity and democratic citizenship norms and behaviors using
   International Social Survey Program data. We analyze how democratic
   engagement varies according to individual and national average religious
   involvement in 28 predominantly-Christian democracies. We find that (1)
   individual-level religious attendance is positively linked to both what
   people say (norms) and what they do (participation); (2) nations with
   higher aggregate national attendance participate less politically; and
   (3) the relationship between individual-level religious engagement and
   citizenship varies by national religious context. More specifically,
   individual religious attendance matters more where it is more
   distinctive (i.e., in more secular countries). Individual-level
   religious participation is generally conducive to citizenship, but its
   impact is context-dependent.},

Abstract = {The literature on political business cycles focuses on elected
   incumbents and neglects the incentives of appointed officials. We
   present evidence of rate hikes before elections when the chair of the US
   Federal Reserve is from a different party than the incumbent president.
   This finding contrasts with the traditional belief that an inappropriate
   policy-rate bias implies a more expansive pre-election policy stance. We
   also find weak evidence that rates are lowered when the chair and
   president are from the same party. The evidence that ideological
   preferences of the chair matter remains even when we control for career
   motives.},

   from Marx's Manuscript of 1867-68, which was published for the first
   time in German in 2012 in the MEGA, Volume II/4.3. This excerpt is
   Marx's first and only attempt to incorporate unequal turnover times
   across industries into his theory of the equalisation of the profit rate
   and prices of production. The excerpt considers three cases: unequal
   turnover times across industries, unequal compositions of capital across
   industries, and both of these inequalities together. It also emphasises
   two concepts of the rate of profit: rate of profit on capital advanced
   and rate of profit on the cost price (capital consumed).},

Abstract = {Islamic finance has been surprisingly undertheorized in the
   international relations literature. In this paper, I fill this gap by
   investigating the dynamics of mainstreaming within the Islamic finance
   regime in global markets. Using the norm diffusion literature, I argue
   that the development and diffusion of Islamic economics, and the
   corresponding expertise, have followed three distinct steps. First,
   Islamic economics initially was a critique of capitalism and world
   markets; second, it was ``nationalized{''} by the political leaders of
   major Muslim-majority countries; and third, it became an integral part
   of world markets. By tracing the development of Islamic finance as part
   of global politics, I situate it within a theoretical framework and show
   the wider implications of this economic framework for global politics.},

Abstract = {Confronted by a number of home-grown Islamic terrorist attacks, many
   Americans incorrectly assume that Muslim religiosity correlates with
   anti-American values and that the American mosque is the center of
   radical socialization efforts. This paper examines the nature of the
   relationship between mosque involvement and political engagement. It
   finds that mosque attendance is positively associated with political
   engagement only when the attendance engages congregants in ways beyond
   religious ritual. Attending mosque to pray does not significantly impact
   political identities or engagement like following politics, registering
   to vote, voting, or party membership, while participation in other
   social or religious activities at a mosque is associated with an
   increased probability of engagement. These results suggest that not all
   mosque involvement is equally beneficial for promoting political
   engagement and that religious participation must proactively engage with
   the social lives of the congregants to have a substantive political
   effect.},

Abstract = {This article examines John Simmons' Lockean theory of territorial rights
   and defends the superiority of the rival nationalist theory that he
   rejects. It begins by arguing that all philosophical accounts of
   territory need to be supplemented by nonideal theory to address
   real-world territorial conflicts. Turning to the Lockean theory, it
   points out that if territorial rights are to emerge from individual
   property rights in land, such rights must be robust. But on Simmons'
   account, individuals only have natural property rights in material
   things involved in their ongoing purposive activities. Thus, a state
   founded on such rights would be vulnerable to having neglected parts of
   its territory expropriated by outsiders. It might also have to downsize
   in response to population increases elsewhere. Nationalist theories base
   territorial rights on the collective occupation and transformation of
   land by groups with shared identities. Three charges against such
   theories are rebutted: (1) The idea of cohesive national cultures is a
   myth, in the face of internal cultural diversity. (2) Despite their
   appeal to history, nationalist theories privilege current possessors of
   land at the expense of the dispossessed. (3) Such theories cannot solve
   the problem of `trapped minorities' who don't share the national
   identity of the majority.},

Abstract = {Research suggests that ostracism could promote endorsement of partisan
   falsehoods. Socially excluded individuals are uniquely attentive to
   distinctions between in-groups and out-groups, and act in ways intended
   to promote group belonging, potentially including a greater willingness
   to accept claims made by other group members. We test this assertion
   with a 2 (ostracism) X 2 (anonymity) X 2 (topic) mixed factorial design
   using the Ostracism Online paradigm with a demographically diverse
   online sample of Americans (N =?413). Results suggest that when
   ostracized, both Democrats and Republicans are more likely to endorse
   party-line falsehoods about the 2016 U.S. Presidential election. These
   effects are contingent on several individual-level differences,
   including strength of ideological commitment, cognitive reflection, and
   faith in intuition for facts. These patterns failed to replicate with
   fracking, a politically charged science topic.},

Abstract = {We present the approach to comparative economic development of Why
   Nations Fail. Economic prosperity requires inclusive economic
   institutionsthose which create broad based incentives and opportunities
   in society. Extractive economic institutions, which lack these
   properties, create poverty. Variation in economic institutions is
   created by differences in political institutions. Inclusive economic
   institutions are the result of political choices which arise under
   inclusive political institutions: a strong state and a broad
   distribution of power in society. When either of these conditions fails
   one has extractive political institutions that lead to extractive
   economic institutions. We relate our analysis to Tullock's notion of
   rent seeking'.},

Abstract = {Objective Research on political socialization has shown that political
   and civic experiences during high school can impact later political
   engagement. However, political scientists are increasingly realizing
   that nonpolitical experiences, dispositions, and attributes in childhood
   and adolescence can play a role in shaping political participation.
   Building on recent studies in developmental psychology, we examine
   whether and how student characteristics and behaviors in adolescence are
   related to political engagement in adulthood. Methods Using data from
   the Project Talent study, a national longitudinal study of a
   representative sample of high school students in the United States, we
   find that several behaviors and attributes related to one's high school
   experience have long-term effects on voter turnout. Results Responsible
   students and those with high levels of interest in school are more
   likely than their counterparts to vote when they reach adulthood.
   Conclusion The effects of the school-related measures we examine (1)
   persist for more than a decade after high school ends, (2) are similar
   in magnitude to the effects of classic predictors of political
   engagement such as parental political activism, and (3) hold even in the
   presence of controls for general personality traits, cognitive ability,
   resources such as parental socioeconomic status, socialization
   experiences, and demographic variables. Our results have implications
   for how to increase political participation.},

Abstract = {Objective This article develops an empirical model that tests whether in
   post-communist Russia prior membership in a civil society organization
   (CSO) motivates civic activism. Revisiting Tocquevillian notions of a
   nurturing effect by formal civil society organizations of civic
   activism, we aim to help explain recent research findings showing that
   civic activism is sustainable and vital in Russia. Methods To test the
   main hypothesis of the study, we use the cross-sectional survey of
   Russians aged 18 and older in the fall of 2014 (N = 1,500) representing
   43 regions conducted by the Russian Civil Society Monitoring Survey of
   the Higher School of Economics' Centre for Studies of Civil Society and
   the Nonprofit Sector (2006-). We use the propensity score matching (PSM)
   technique to estimate the main effects. We also show that the effect of
   unobserved factors on our PSM estimates is limited using Rosenbaum
   bounds analysis. Results The PSM analysis suggests that for all four
   indicators of civic activism, that is, willingness to integrate with
   other members of society, participation in tenant meetings, engagement
   in charity activities, and engagement in home improvement, CSO
   participation positively impacts civic activism. The impact varies from
   a 7.2 to 15.8 percent higher propensity of civic activism for CSO
   participants. Conclusion We conclude that prior participation in a CSO
   can have a motivating influence on civic activism such as charity work,
   residential home improvement, willingness to integrate with other
   members of the society, and participation in tenant meetings.},

Abstract = {This study proposes the interventionist and the detached orientations to
   watchdog journalism through the conceptual lens of journalistic role
   performance. Based on a content analysis of 33,640 news stories from
   sixty-four media outlets in eighteen countries, we measure and compare
   both orientations across different countries using three performative
   aspects of monitoring: intensity of scrutiny, voice of the scrutiny, and
   source of the event. Our findings show that the interventionist approach
   of watchdog journalism is more likely to be found in democracies with
   traditionally partisan and opinion-oriented journalistic cultures or
   experiencing sociopolitical crises. In turn, the detached orientation
   predominates in democracies with journalistic traditions associated to
   objectivity. Although both orientations have a lower presence in
   transitional democracies, the detached watchdog prevails, while in
   non-democratic countries the watchdog role is almost absent. Our results
   also reveal that structural contexts of undemocratic political regimes
   and restricted press freedom are key definers of watchdog role
   performance overall. However, the type of political regime is actually
   more important-and in fact the most important predictor-for detached
   than for interventionist reporting.},

Abstract = {Objective. In this article, we reexamine how the entry and success of
   women state legislative candidates is affected by local political
   context. Methods. We use evidence from state legislative elections from
   2001 to 2010 to test our hypotheses. Results. We find that female
   candidates' emergence and success are affected by the district's context
   relative to both all districts nationally and all districts within that
   state. Intrastate comparisons are particularly influential in districts
   that are less women friendly using a national comparison. Conclusions.
   Our findings underscore the importance of considering multiple
   dimensions of political context as scholars attempt to understand the
   variation in political representation of women state legislators.},

Abstract = {Objectives Ranked-choice voting (RCV) is relatively complex compared to
   plurality voting. We test if some voters find it more challenging.
   Methods We conducted surveys in RCV cities and plurality cities to
   assess how voters reported understanding voting instructions, and how
   they reported understanding election systems. Results Fewer voters
   reported instructions were easy to understand in RCV cities. Within RCV
   cities, we found little evidence of race/ethnic differences in reported
   understanding, but older voters reported less understanding of
   instructions in RCV cities and less understanding of RCV elections.
   Across all cities, Asians and women reported less understanding of
   elections generally, and education correlated with greater reported
   understanding. Conclusions Our evidence is not consistent with concerns
   about a racial/ethnic bias specific to RCV, but suggests a need for
   additional voter education.},

Abstract = {Objective Corporations spend significant resources lobbying for billions
   of dollars in federal procurement contracts, yet this important
   opportunity to assess the political influence of business has gone
   unstudied by scholars of business politics. We study it here. Methods We
   approach it by analyzing the influence of direct lobbying of five
   federal departments, along with data on the lobbying of, and campaign
   contributions to, members of Congress on patterns of contract awards
   broken out by congressional districts. Results Our analysis reveals that
   while there are many reasons to expect lobbying Congress to produce
   valuable contracts, we instead find that it is the direct lobbying of
   executive branch agencies that is most likely to bring big rewards.
   Conclusion These results highlight the importance of studying corporate
   political power outside of the legislative branch, suggesting that it is
   the long-term relationships that lobbyists build with bureaucrats that
   yield the most lucrative contracts.},

Abstract = {The flagging of false news has been one of the ways suggested to
   discourage people from sharing deceiving news stories on social media,
   and recent years have seen a growing number of initiatives focused on
   providing credibility labels for news online. Using an experimental
   design, this study assesses the effectiveness of such labels designed to
   reduce the sharing of false news. Specifically, it examines the impact
   of warning labels on Facebook users' intentions to share false news
   stories, drawing on a sample of 501 participants from across the
   political spectrum. The study also explores users' perceptions of the
   likelihood that other people would share false news even after seeing a
   warning label. We find that the flagging of false news may indeed have
   an effect on reducing false news sharing intentions by diminishing the
   credibility of misleading information. Furthermore, we find that users
   may be prone to believing that others are more likely to share false
   news than themselves, confirming the third-person effect. This study
   shows that flagging of false news on social media platforms like
   Facebook may indeed help the current efforts to combat sharing of
   deceiving information on social media.},

Abstract = {Diversification is touted as a desirable policy objective for oil-rich
   nations because it reduces exposure to volatility. However, the
   empirical relationship between petroleum and diversification is not well
   understood. Here, we test the effect of giant oil discoveries on
   diversification using a panel dataset of 136 countries observed over the
   period from 1962 to 2012. We notice non-oil sector export concentration
   8 years after a discovery. However, we do not observe any effect on the
   structure of employment in non-resource and manufacturing sectors.
   Democratic political institutions moderate the export and employment
   concentration effects of petroleum discovery.},

Abstract = {How much regulation exists? Can short- and long-term growth trends in
   regulation be identified? Which agencies produce the most regulation?
   Are some sectors of the economy more regulated than others, and how big
   are the differences? RegData 2.2, a recent panel dataset from the
   RegData Project at George Mason University's Mercatus Center, offers
   answers to these questions and more. RegData 2.2 quantifies various
   aspects of US federal regulations by industry, by agency, and over time.
   The resulting datasets include metrics on volumes, restrictiveness, and
   relevance of federal regulations to different economic sectors and
   industries. RegData datasets are publicly released at We explain the
   features of and methodology underlying RegData 2.2.},

Title = {Reapplying behavioral symmetry: public choice and choice architecture},
Journal = {PUBLIC CHOICE},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {180},
Number = {1-2, SI},
Pages = {11-25},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {New justifications for government intervention based on behavioral
   psychology rely on a behavioral asymmetry between expert policymakers
   and market participants. Public choice theory applied the behavioral
   symmetry assumption to policy making in order to illustrate how special
   interests corrupt the suppositions of benevolence on the part of policy
   makers. Cognitive problems associated with market choices have been used
   to argue for even more intervention. If behavioral symmetry is applied
   to the experts and not just to market participants, problems with this
   approach to public policy formation become clear. Manipulation,
   cognitive capture, and expert bias are among the problems associated
   with a behavioral theory of market failure. The application of
   behavioral symmetry to the expanding role of choice architecture will
   help to limit the bias in behavioral policy. Since experts are also
   subject to cognitive failures, policy must include an evaluation of
   expert error. Like the rent-seeking literature before it, a theory of
   cognitive capture points out the systematic problems with a theory of
   asymmetry between policy experts and citizens when it comes to policy
   making.},

Abstract = {This essay studies the behavior of political elite at the most critical
   time for the constitutional regime during Isabella II's reign, between
   1863 and 1864. It analyzes governmental and parliamentary stability,
   cooperation amongst political parties, representation, and the party
   system after the disruption and failure of the Union Liberal. The regime
   was based upon the principle of double trust, of the Crown and the
   Parliament, but the first was useless if those elites deliberately
   obstructed the regular functioning of the system, opposed roundly in the
   Cortes to bring down governments, rejected or vetoed coalition
   governments, prioritized party interests over depurating the electoral
   system and other laws, nurtured division within their own party, and
   rejected or impeded political integration. The objective of the work is
   to verify if the behavior of the elite impeded the stability of the
   system and forced an exercise of the royal designation beyond the logic
   of a constitutional monarchy.},

Abstract = {The political party of elected officials can affect the happiness of the
   voting public through several different channels. Partisan voters will
   be happier whenever a member of their party controls political office
   regardless of the policies implemented. It is hypothesized that
   congruence between individual party identity and state politician
   affiliations should have a greater impact on citizen happiness than
   congruence with politicians at the national level due to results from
   the literature on Tiebout sorting. It is further hypothesized that
   individuals with extreme ideological views may report greater happiness
   as their ideology fulfills basic psychological needs for certainty and
   structure. Using data from the Generalized Social Survey the effect of
   party congruence of individuals with national and state politicians on
   happiness is estimated. The effect of extreme ideological political
   views on happiness is also estimated. Results find that congruence with
   presidential party affiliation has a much greater impact on happiness
   than congruence with national legislative affiliation, gubernatorial, or
   state legislative affiliation contradicting the hypothesis. Those who
   possess extreme political views are also found to report higher levels
   of happiness.},

Abstract = {ObjectivesScholarship on the U.S. Senate has demonstrated the pivotal
   role the presiding officer can play when asked to interpret the
   chamber's rules and precedents. Therefore, our objective is to broadly
   evaluate how questions of order are arbitrated in the U.S. Senate.
   MethodsUsing a multinomial logistic regression, we estimate the effect
   of partisanship on adjudicating questions of order in the Senate before
   and after the institutionalization of the parliamentarian.
   ResultsOur results indicate that while short-term partisan interests
   play an important role in determining how presiding officers interpret
   rules and precedents, the emergence of the Senate parliamentarian in the
   1920s served to reduce uncertainty regarding procedural matters in the
   chamber.
   ConclusionsThis change has led to fewer instances of partisan rulings on
   questions of order and raised the costs of executing a drastic change in
   Senate procedure via unorthodox procedures. However, the introduction of
   the parliamentarian has not reduced the likelihood a ruling is
   overturned. As such, more narrow procedural changes have been used to
   support majorities over time.},

Abstract = {In contemporary democracies, a political party typically needs good
   press to attract voters. A glum scenario for a party would be that news
   media systematically stigmatize it. To what extent does stigmatization
   lower its electoral support? This article examines voters' reactions to
   news media coverage of the Dutch party PVV. Using a media content
   analysis linked to a 2014 panel survey of a sample representative of the
   Dutch electorate, we find that, among voters who held anti-immigrant
   attitudes, exposure to stigmatization lowered these voters' perceived
   legitimacy of the PVV. This, in turn, decreased their propensity to vote
   for that party. This suggests that stigmatization can be a strong tool
   in the hands of those who intend to damage a party.},

Abstract = {ObjectivesWe advance hypotheses on the extent to which the three main
   aspects of globalizationeconomic, political, and socialfuel mass protest
   and delineate how these effects can be especially instrumental in
   understanding collective mass mobilization among a historically
   disadvantaged group, women.
   MethodsWe use new and updated data on anti-government protest to examine
   the covariates of protest intensity cross-nationally over time.
   ResultsResults from the data analysis indicate that while political
   globalization is associated with reduced women's protest, social
   globalization is associated with increased women's and non-women's
   protest. Further, economic globalization has somewhat divergent effects
   on women's and non-women's protest.
   ConclusionsResults from our thorough analysis of the three main aspects
   of globalization highlight the varying effects that different dimensions
   of globalization have on political protest. Our study offers a unique
   analysis of the factors associated with protest by women and compares it
   to other types of protest.},

Abstract = {ObjectiveIn this article, we test whether emotions mediate the effect of
   international development appeals on cosmopolitanism and donation
   behavior.
   MethodsWe design and conduct a lab experiment to test the impact of
   representations of global poverty on participants' cosmopolitan
   sentiments and their likelihood to donate to development charities. We
   use multiple mediation analysis to test the intervening role of six
   emotional responsesanger, guilt, solidarity, hope, repulsion, and pityas
   causal pathways to our two outcomes of interest: cosmopolitanism and
   donations.
   ResultsHope is the most consistent and powerful pathway through which
   appeals affect respondents' sense of cosmopolitanism and willingness to
   donate. Negative imagery and text erode people's sense of hope, but
   drive donations, particularly via guilt.
   ConclusionsOur findings suggest we should move away from a mono-causal
   view of emotional responses to disaster and development imagery, and
   provide a cautionary tale for practitioners: using negative imagery can
   undermine the public's sense of hope and cosmopolitanism.},

Abstract = {Two main explanations of tactical choice among social movements are
   repertoires of contention and characteristics of collective actors.
   Feminist theorizing suggests another dimension of tactical choice: the
   role of gender beliefs. This paper examines the relationship between
   these three explanations by drawing on a qualitative study that explored
   how activist groups in Sweden selected the `Take Back the Night' (TBTN)
   march as a tactic. Begun in the 1970s, the TBTN march has been performed
   around the world, usually on central city streets at nighttime, to
   protest gender violence in spaces presumed to be gender neutral and safe
   for women. Our findings resulted in three themes that captured how
   activist groups selected it as a tactic: a routine performance in
   publicly visible urban settings, alignment with preferred forms of
   feminist organizing, and refusal of normalized fear and violence in the
   seemingly safe city. Each theme corresponded to one of the three
   explanations and shed light on a different dimension of tactical choice.
   We propose three heuristic tools for identifying these dimensions:
   making claims, enacting claims and reclaiming spaces. The different
   dimensions relate to distinct conceptions of power: centralized
   authority, movement agency and gender power relations respectively.},

Abstract = {The use of social media has risen exponentially in Asia in the past
   decade, but there have been few comparative studies examining social
   media news engagement in the region. We use online survey data to
   examine the relationships among political social networks, internal
   political efficacy, and social media news engagement in six countries
   (Taiwan, Japan, Korea, Hong Kong, Malaysia, and Singapore). Findings
   across the samples showed that individuals in political social networks
   comprising cross-cutting and like-minded political views engage in
   social media news more, and internal political efficacy accentuated the
   relationships between cross-cutting/like-minded political social
   networks and engagement. Implications for the findings are discussed in
   relation to current debates on the potential for social media news
   engagement to engender a more deliberative democracy; or lead to greater
   ideological segregation and echo chambers in social media spaces.},

Abstract = {Objective Survey questions regarding immigration have been frequently
   used to compare how mass publics think about nativism, but it remains
   unclear whether the resulting nativism measures are comparable across
   countries. In this article, we empirically examine whether nativism
   achieves scalar invariance-an important measurement feature for valid
   instrumentation-across very different country contexts. Method We
   examine measurement invariance of a nativism scale using survey data
   from 22 countries representing 16,096 individual respondents. To test
   for invariance, we utilize multigroup confirmatory factor analysis
   (MG-CFA). Results While the nativism scale fails to achieve full scalar
   invariance, we are able to establish partial scalar invariance,
   indicating the nativism scale is valid across many national contexts.
   Though highly correlated, the means of the latent nativist variable also
   provide different rankings than the means of an additive scale.
   Conclusions With a few limitations, nativist sentiments can be
   meaningfully measured across political contexts. Across 19 of the 22
   countries, respondents answered survey items on nativism in ways that
   suggest their answers reflect the same underlying latent construct.},

Title = {What affects media commentators' views of protest actions? Evidence from
   the Portuguese wave of anti-austerity contention},

Abstract = {Media attention is crucial for social movements in pursuing their goals.
   Opinion makers in the press, in particular, can be expected to influence
   how mass audiences perceive protests. Yet we still have a poor
   understanding of the factors that explain the level of legitimacy that
   media commentators award to different protest actions. To address this
   gap, this paper compares 45 opinion articles written by press
   commentators in main-interest Portuguese newspapers about two of the
   prominent anti-austerity demonstrations in the country: the Geracao a
   Rasca demonstration on 12 March 2011, and the Que se Lixe a Troika
   demonstration on 15 September 2012. Content analysis of this corpus of
   articles suggests that there were important differences in the level of
   legitimacy that commentators awarded to each of the protests. An
   analysis of the way commentators framed each protest suggests the use of
   a similar set of frames related to the characteristics of the protest
   events (e.g. claims, strategy), but differential deployment of these
   frames across the cases. For example, the same frames were sometimes
   used to legitimize one protest event, and delegitimize the other, and
   hence could not explain the differences in commentators' views. It was
   rather the different context of the protests (e.g. social, economic and
   political), and the way that media commentators framed that context,
   that explains the level of legitimacy awarded to the two protests.
   Because the QSLT demonstration of 15 September 2012 was a protest
   directed against a measure that commentators framed as unfair and
   unnecessary (raising the single social tax), they regarded the
   demonstration as being more legitimate. In turn, because the Geracao a
   Rasca demonstration occurred in a context where austerity was framed as
   necessary and unavoidable, it was regarded as less legitimate.},

Title = {Do treaties matter? Climate change, water variability, and cooperation
   along transboundary river basins},
Journal = {POLITICAL GEOGRAPHY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {69},
Pages = {162-172},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Annual and seasonal water variability is predicted to intensify due to
   climate change. River basins lacking institutional capacity, such as
   treaties, to deal with environmental change may experience political
   tensions. Using the 1948-2008 country dyads event data from the Basins
   at Risk project, this paper investigates whether basins governed by
   treaties witness less tensions and/or more cooperation over shared water
   relative to those basins not governed by treaties. It also evaluates
   basins pre- and post-treaty enactment. The results provide only limited
   support for the claim that the presence of a treaty does in fact promote
   cooperation, but provide stronger support for the claim that the number
   of agreements between riparians enhances cooperation particularly when
   taking into consideration water variability. This variable is
   significantly and positively correlated with increased cooperation - a
   finding that is robust across different specifications controlling for a
   broad set of climatic, geographic, political, and economic variables.
   This may indicate that successive treaties successfully address some of
   the shortcomings of their predecessors. Importantly, when disaggregating
   conflictive and cooperative events, the research does not find support
   for the claim that treaties or number of treaties reduce conflict. This
   may highlight the importance of the need to treat conflict and
   cooperation individually and not simply as opposite poles of a single
   spectrum.},

Abstract = {Since the mid-196os, the carceral population in the US has increased
   around 900\%. This article analyses that increase from a Marxist
   framework. After interrogating the theories of Michelle Alexander and
   Loic Wacquant, I lay out a theoretical framework for a Marxist theory of
   mass incarceration. I then offer a historical analysis of mass
   incarceration in keeping with this theoretical framework, emphasising
   the carceral system's relationship to the class struggle and the
   large-scale economic dislocations of post-Fordism. Finally, I emphasise
   how private prison companies, increasingly central to the story of mass
   incarceration, are influencing current efforts to reform the prison
   system and shift to `alternatives to incarceration'.},

Abstract = {Income inequality has risen throughout advanced rich democracies. Why
   does the public not demand more redistribution? This article builds on
   the literature of social justice norms, which shows that besides
   individual financial motives also socially engrained beliefs about
   poverty influence opinions about redistribution. Based on a multilevel
   analysis of public opinion data from 33 countries, the article shows
   that lower levels of support for redistribution are not driven by
   political polarization between the rich and the poor, but it is rooted
   in deeply seated societal norms among all income groups. The unfortunate
   implication of this finding is that simple, short-run policy is
   unlikely, which could mitigate existing economic imbalances.},

Title = {Making the `man-eater': Tiger conservation as necropolitics},
Journal = {POLITICAL GEOGRAPHY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {69},
Pages = {150-161},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {In this article I analyze the practice and politics of classifying a
   tiger as a `man-eater' in South India to explore what doing so reveals
   more broadly about the relations between animal life and the kinds of
   human life marked as expendable by the state. I draw on Achille Mbembe's
   theory of necropolitics in order to analyze how the Indian State
   attempts to manage human-wildlife relations in a contested plantation
   landscape of high priority for wildlife conservation. While there is a
   large literature theorizing wildlife and biodiversity conservation as
   the practice of biopolitics, I argue conservation, as both a typology of
   space and set of ideologically malleable practices, remains
   under-theorized as a form of necropolitics, the politics mediating
   death. I examine how the Indian State goes about reclassifying tigers
   from a strictly protected endangered species to killable-the process of
   making the `man-eater'-in relation to how the state both values and
   devalues human and non-human life as a process rooted in colonial
   histories of accumulation by dispossession. This article responds to
   calls across political ecology and political geography to better
   theorize the role of non-human animals as essential subjects of inquiry
   in political contestations. It does so through exploring the spatial
   contours of deadly encounter between plantation workers and tigers in
   the plantation-conservation necropolis.},

Abstract = {Resource nationalism has become a fashionable approach to resource
   governance in many countries across the world. Motivated by the desire
   to make resource governance deliver to socio-economic development,
   governments in resource-rich countries have exploited resource
   nationalism to achieve their populist socio-economic goals. In 2017, the
   government of Tanzania instituted a strong resource nationalist
   governance regime. This paper examines Tanzania's re-adoption of
   resource nationalism to understand how the government was able to
   institutionalise the reforms. The paper draws on secondary scholarly
   sources and primary materials such as President Magufuli's speeches
   during his presidential campaigns in 2015 and afterwards during his
   government clampdown on Acacia. Like studies on neo-extractivism in
   Latin America have shown, President Magufuli used resource nationalism
   as a political strategy to both secure a stronghold in party and
   national politics and legitimise his economic policy. Faced with a
   strengthening opposition politics and competitive elections, President
   Magufuli exploited public dissatisfaction with a liberal resource
   governance approach and a popular appeal of socialist policies to
   re-introduce resource nationalism as a strategy not only to
   re-legitimise extractivism but also to delegitimise the opposition and
   multinational corporations.},

Abstract = {Considering the differences between public and non-public beneficiaries,
   the main aim of this paper is to evaluate the relationship between the
   disadvantage of Czech regions and the spatial distribution of EU
   structural funds in the programming period 2007-2013. The empirical
   results reveal negative and significant influence of socioeconomic
   disadvantage of regions on the amount of structural funds obtained by
   public beneficiaries. On the contrary, agglomeration economies are the
   statistically significant determinant of the amount of structural funds
   obtained by non-public beneficiaries. These conclusions are related to
   different absorption capacity of regions, regarding the number and size
   of projects. Overall, structural funds do not compensate for the
   disadvantage of regions, neither for public nor for non-public
   beneficiaries.},

Abstract = {Recently, several theorists have argued that John Rawls's political
   liberalism, with its notion of public reason, is based on
   presuppositions so idealistic and moralistic, that it cannot provide a
   relevant standard of argumentation in real political circumstances,
   where disagreements concerning matters of justice may run deep. The
   question raised in this contribution is: which notion of reasonableness,
   if any, could be used as a standard with which to distinguish between
   reasonable and unreasonable political positions in such circumstances of
   radical pluralism? I examine here whether contemporary realists may find
   helpful Jurgen Habermas's notion of public opinion or Aristotle's idea
   of reputable things or ta endoxa. It is argued here that realists may
   find the latter particularly useful in developing a realist notion of
   public reason.},

Abstract = {The proliferation of environmental alternative action organization
   (EAAOs) is a defining feature of present-day environmentalism. The
   literature on sustainable materialism has celebrated this as an
   appropriate, effective, and above all, political strategy. By contrast,
   drawing on post-political and post-ecologist critiques, some have argued
   that this shift signifies the de-politicisation of environmentalism
   because it leaves the status quo unchallenged. In this article, we argue
   that these opposing views can be reconciled first by considering that
   `the political' has at least three different dimensions, and second by
   taking account of how activists reflexively navigate the different
   challenges posed by each of these dimensions in their strategizing.
   Based on an ethnographic case study of two organizations in Manchester
   (UK), we show that while EAAOs developing environmental alternatives may
   indeed be motivated by radical ideas - as suggested in literature on
   sustainable materialism - the contradictory demands of diffusion and
   agonism limit their expression through contentious action. We argue that
   the post-political context in which these groups operate thus has some
   depoliticizing impact, yet that activists consciously navigate these
   challenges to maximize their political impact.},

Abstract = {Endorsements by retired flag and general officers are now a fixture of
   the presidential election cycle. However, their motivations are unclear.
   Retired flag officers might endorse with material, purposive, or
   solidarity motives. We evaluate these motivations with a new data set of
   1,340 endorsements by 1,041 endorsers between 2004 and 2016 matched with
   campaign contributions. We find that campaign contributions, service in
   the Navy, and retiring as a higher ranked officer are all associated
   with an increased likelihood of endorsing. We conclude that about 10
   retired flag officers participate to improve their material situation,
   193 seek to advance their ideological preferences, and the remainder
   participate to demonstrate solidarity with their peers or acquaintances.
   These findings provide new insight into endorser motivations and
   civil-military relations.},

Abstract = {We examine the extent to which government ideology has influenced
   monetary policy in OECD countries since the 1970s. In line with
   important changes in the global economy and differences across
   countries, regression results yield heterogeneous inferences depending
   on the time period and the exchange rate regime/central bank dependence
   of the countries in the sample. Over the 1972-2010 period, Taylor rule
   specifications do not suggest a relationship between government ideology
   and monetary policy as measured by the short-term nominal interest rate
   or the rate of monetary expansion minus GDP trend growth. Monetary
   policy was, however, associated with government ideology in the 1990s:
   short-term nominal interest rates were lower under leftwing than
   rightwing governments when central banks depended on the directives of
   the government and exchange rates were flexible. Very independent
   central banks, however, raised interest rates when leftwing governments
   were in office. We describe the historical evidence for several
   individual countries.},

Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL ECONOMY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {60},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Despite widespread belief that accession process and formal membership
   to the World Trade Organization (WTO) improve the quality of governance
   within a country, there is no convincing empirical evidence to
   substantiate this thought. Here, I investigate whether the WTO status of
   a country has a causal effect on firm-level reports of political
   corruption using a nonparametric partial identification approach to
   bound the average treatment effects (ATEs). I also analyze conditional
   ATEs to explore various sources of potential heterogeneity. Contrary to
   popular belief, I find that WTO membership is likely to have no causal
   effect on domestic corruption overall. And if anything, it is likely to
   increase corrupt practices, particularly among firms that are
   established post WTO membership and those that are government owned.},
