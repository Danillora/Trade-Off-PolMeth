Abstract = {Recent commentary has sounded the alarm about the effects of emerging
   technologies on strategic stability, yet the topic has received
   relatively little systematic scholarly attention. Will emerging
   technologies such as cyber, autonomous weapons, additive manufacturing,
   hypersonic vehicles, and remote sensing make the world more dangerous?
   Or is pessimism unwarranted? In this volume, we leverage international
   relations scholarship, historical data, and a variety of methodological
   approaches to discern the future implications of new technologies for
   international security. The findings suggest that new technologies can
   have multiple, conditional, and even contradictory effects on different
   aspects of strategic stability, and raise a host of important questions
   for future research.},

Abstract = {This article is part of the special cluster titled Conceptualizations of
   the Holocaust in Germany, Lithuania, Poland, and Ukraine since the
   1990s, guest edited by Grzegorz Rossolinski-Liebe.The article addresses
   sources for understanding the complexion of the Shoah in Poland, through
   a focus on the Lublin District and Jewish forced labor there. From the
   opening story of the wedding of Shamai Grajer and Mina Fiszman in Lublin
   on April 17, 1942, the article extrapolates several central themes: two
   constants in Nazi policies and Jewish experience-forced population
   movements and forced labor, the behavior of the various actors involved
   in the story, and sources. The main individuals involved in the opening
   story highlight these subjects. Fiszman was a refugee deported in
   February 1940 from Stettin. Grajer, Fiszman, and Rabbi Zvi Elimelech
   Talmud, who performed the wedding, had all been selected as forced
   laborers when the majority of the Jewish community was murdered during
   the previous month, and they hoped that their labor would help them
   survive. The behavior of the main German actors in the story, Harry
   Sturm and Hermann Worthoff, was not uniformly evil, and the behavior of
   the Jewish actors was not uniformly ``heroic.{''} The Bel(z) over dotec
   forced labor complex in 1940 highlights the brutality and murderousness
   of much of the early forced labor in Poland. Yet, during the
   deportations to death in 1942 the Jews needed to ``unlearn{''} the
   lessons of avoiding such labor if they were now to have a hope of
   surviving. Among the varied sources for this and the subsequent subjects
   addressed in the article, the Jewish sources provide a sense of what
   actually happened in these camps and situations.},

Abstract = {Afghanistan faces significant challenges as it seeks to emerge from
   thirty years of civil war and insurgent violence and promote lasting
   peace and security. Terrorist incidents, which have increased
   dramatically since 2004, continue to pose a major threat to security,
   destabilizing governance and fracturing state initiatives to guarantee
   rule of law to citizens. An urgent priority for the government, as part
   of its development of counterterrorism policy, is to ensure that the
   formal criminal justice system responds effectively to the threat of
   terrorism by creating mechanisms and procedures that support the rights
   and needs of victims in accordance with international human rights
   standards. To date, examining victimhood in Afghanistan and accurately
   understanding the assistance and support that victims of terrorism
   receive and to which they are entitled during criminal justice processes
   have avoided academic scrutiny. Informed by empirical evidence and
   qualitative interviews with justice officials in Afghanistan, this
   article aims to fill this important gap in scholarship. It does so by
   drawing on an international framework for good practices outlined in the
   Global Counterterrorism Forum's Madrid Memorandum to shed new light on
   gaps in existing national law. In doing so, it makes important
   recommendations for both institutional and legislative reform designed
   to strengthen protections and assistance for victims of terrorism and
   inform contemporary reviews of criminal procedural law being undertaken
   by justice ministries in Afghanistan.},

Abstract = {This article presents a typology of armed non-state actors in hybrid
   warfare: proxy, auxiliary, surrogate and affiliated forces. By focusing
   on the kinetic domain of hybrid warfare, the article offers a corrective
   to a debate that has so far ignored variation in roles and functions of
   non-state actors and their relationships with states and their regular
   forces. As a denominator, `hybrid' identifies a combination of
   battlespaces, types of operations-military or non-kinetic-and a blurring
   of actors with the scope of achieving strategic objectives by creating
   exploitable ambiguity. However, there has been a disproportionate focus
   on what hybrid war supposedly combines across battlespaces and domains
   (socio-political, economic, informational), at the expense of who and
   how. Using the Ukrainian crisis as a theory-building exercise, the
   article suggests a four-category schema that identifies non-state actor
   functions as a tool to better represent the complex franchise of
   violence that is found nested next to non-military operations in hybrid
   activity. In so doing, the article speaks to a call for better
   conceptualization the role of non-state violent actors in civil war, in
   general, and in hybrid warfare, in particular.},

Abstract = {The imperative to ``link knowledge and action{''} is widely invoked as a
   defining characteristic of sustainability research. The complexities of
   sustainability challenges such as climate change and biodiversity loss
   mean that linear models of knowledge and action, where knowledge is
   produced first (by researchers) then ``applied to{''} action (by policy
   actors), are considered insufficient. Researchers have developed more
   dynamic, open-ended and collaborative forms of policy engagement such as
   transdisciplinary and co-production research. Although promising these
   approaches often remain captive to linear assumptions that hinder their
   transformative potential. We contribute by providing a relational model
   of knowledge and action rooted in contemporary practice theory. A
   practice-based approach suggests the primary task of participants in
   transdisciplinary interventions is to find workable solutions to
   situations of dynamic complexity that are fundamentally indeterminate
   and unpredictable. Knowledge is not ``applied to{''} action, but drawn
   upon, produced and used from within the situation at hand, allowing
   researchers and policy actors alike to better harness the emergent
   character of situational developments and outcomes. A practice-based
   approach provides a conceptual language that captures the experienced
   complexities of intervening for sustainability, reconfigures the nature
   of ``actionable knowledge,{''} and identifies appropriate modes of
   evaluation for transdisciplinary and co-produced research.},

Abstract = {This article shows how the network structure of economic expertise can
   influence the diffusion of ideas in economic policymaking. Applying
   social network analysis, we analyse the networks of economic policy
   advice in the United States and Germany around the Council of Economic
   Advisors and the Sachverstandigenrat. With the help of co-publication
   and institutional affiliation data, we argue that the more fragmented
   structure of academic expertise in Germany hindered the diffusion of new
   ideas and fostered continuity in the austerity paradigm. In contrast,
   the more connected structure of economic expertise in the United States
   facilitated the diffusion of ideas and changes in dominant ideas about
   economic intervention.},

Journal = {STUDIES IN CONFLICT \& TERRORISM},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {42},

Abstract = {The 2016 Peace Agreement between the Colombian government and the
   Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia-People's Army (the FARC-EP or
   FARC) commits to reforming political participation, especially of
   traditionally marginalized sectors throughout the country to consolidate
   Colombian democracy. While the Peace Agreement provides implementation
   mechanisms that support the insurgency's transition from armed group to
   political party, it also complements the FARC's political strategy that
   has traditionally maintained consistency. This article argues that the
   2016 Peace Agreement has the potential to enhance democratic, political,
   and societal participation by engaging with FARC in two key ways-by
   attempting to reconcile key FARC grievances and containing specific
   mechanisms that increase participation of traditionally marginalized
   groups in Colombia. This article argues that the Agreement has impacted
   positively on FARC's political participation and given it incentives to
   pursue its political strategy democratically. Likewise, the Agreement
   has provided a positive-sum outcome for the Colombian government to
   strengthen its democratic legitimacy by placing emphasis on structural
   reform.},

Abstract = {For the least developed countries (LDCs) facing supply-side constraints,
   the SDGs target of doubling the share of their global exports by 2020 is
   a chimera. Various mechanisms have been put in place to help LDCs to
   enhance their trade capacity, of which WTO Aid for Trade (AfT) is a
   notable one. Although the Enhanced Integrated Framework (EIF) pre-dates
   the AFT initiative, the EIF's focus on evidence based needs assessment,
   institutional and policy support and productive capacity building
   support have helped a number of LDCs overcome their binding constraints
   to trade expansion. Besides, country ownership principle, partnership
   approach and targeted nature of AfT support means that the chances of
   achieving success is much higher than other development interventions.},

Title = {Leading Digital Technologies for Coproduction: the Case of ``Visit
   Once{''} Administrative Service Reform in Zhejiang Province, China},

Volume = {24},

Abstract = {Research on coproduction of public services has grown significantly
   within the politics and public administration field during the last
   decade. The existing literature mostly assumes that coproduction
   requires additional costs from the public. This article explores whether
   and how digital technologies, which arguably have the ability to reframe
   public participation, might influence coproduction between the
   government and the public. A revised theoretical framework for
   coproduction in the era of digital governance is illustrated through a
   case study of the ``Visit Once{''} administrative service reform in
   Zhejiang Province, China. This study reveals a new possibility for
   coproduction through digital technologies, in which citizens are
   involved in service improvement when using public services without
   costing them extra time or effort. Thus, the assumption of the necessity

Abstract = {What are the mechanisms of legitimation in non-democratic and
   linguistically divided states? How do regimes in these states use and
   manipulate the ideology and nation-building for the purposes of regime
   legitimation? The article focuses on the concept of compartmentalized
   ideology in non-democratic regimes with substantial divisions in the
   so-called titular and minority group where socio-linguistic divide
   allows regimes to construct diverse audiences and even political
   communities with their own distinct narratives and discourses about the
   nation, state and the regime. The compartmentalized ideology is only
   sustainable under the conditions of the regime's power to control and
   facilitate these discourses through the system of authoritative
   presidential addresses to the nation and/or other forms of regime's
   communication with the polity. The shifting of these discourses and
   themes contribute to the regime stability but also may constitute its
   relegitimation. (C) 2019 The Regents of the University of California.

Abstract = {More than 3,000 international investment agreements (IIAs) provide
   foreign investors with substantive protections in host states and access
   to binding investor-state dispute settlement (ISDS). In recent years,
   states increasingly have sought to change their treaty commitments
   through the practices of renegotiation and termination, so far affecting
   about 300 IIAs. The received wisdom is that this development reflects a
   ``backlash{''} against the regime and an attempt by governments to
   reclaim sovereignty, consistent with broader antiglobalization trends.
   Using new data on the degree to which IIA provisions restrict state
   regulatory space (SRS), we provide the first systematic investigation
   into the effect of ISDS experiences on state decisions to adjust their
   treaties. The empirical analysis indicates that exposure to investment
   claims leads either to the renegotiation of IIAs in the direction of
   greater SRS or to their termination. This effect varies, however, with
   the nature of involvement in ISDS and with respect to different treaty
   provisions.},

Abstract = {The multiple principal problem refers to multiple collective action
   problems that organizations face when they must balance (competing)
   interests of multiple stakeholders under joint service delivery. It
   negatively affects different types of organization, yet we know little
   about how organizations (can) mitigate it. We expand a framework based
   on principal-agent theory, review the literature, and consider
   implications for effective governance of joint service delivery in the
   public sector. We observe that joint service delivery can lead to
   free-riding and duplication in monitoring, lobbying by principals, and
   increased autonomy for agents, leading to inefficiency. We build a
   research agenda and tentatively suggest, based on the literature, that
   an interface approach, where an elected unitary actor is placed in a
   middle tier between politics and service delivery, might best mitigate
   the multiple principal problem, which is currently not dealt with
   effectively in public management.},

Abstract = {The article analyses the solidarity discourse in the Euro crisis and
   Europe's migration crisis and examines how meanings of solidarity are
   framed and which political parties participate in these debates. The
   discourse coalition and coalition magnet approaches are combined to
   study the two discourse dynamics of demanding solidarity (migration
   crisis) or being criticised for not showing solidarity (Euro crisis) in
   the German media discourse. By applying the discourse network
   methodology, the interdependence of framing and actor visibility is
   analysed. It is demonstrated that solidarity is linked to austerity by a
   conservative party discourse coalition in the Euro crisis. The migration
   crisis discourse is shaped by one large discourse coalition, arguing for
   political solidarity. In 2015, political solidarity is challenged by
   security and demarcation claims in the migration crisis. The study
   contributes to the ideational research framework and demonstrates the
   different trajectories of solidarity in Europe in hard times.},

Abstract = {The large-scale infrastructure projects being implemented in the East
   African Community (EAC) region portray signs of postmodernism especially
   as a reaction to and disenchantment with the development models adopted
   by African countries till the 1980s. Whereas the past model of high
   modernism focused on transforming national economies through
   implementation of large-scale infrastructure projects, the current
   thinking in the EAC focuses on fast tracking not only national
   development but also regional integration and realizing Pan-African
   continental connectivity for sustainable development. The projects,
   however, manifest a competitive race amongst the partner states and
   subscribe to the African Renaissance mantra but push countries into debt
   entrapment and protracted dependency. Postmodern Pan-Africanism ought to
   incorporate `African content' in the whole process of infrastructure
   development. The region's transport corridors host infrastructure
   projects that show signs of a paradigm shift from the historical
   structure of exchange to an integrated regional mode of social and
   economic exchange. Infrastructure development is contextualized from a
   historical perspective that locates the viability of the Central,
   Northern and LAPSSET (Lamu Port-South Sudan-Ethiopia-Transport)
   Corridors in Pan-African connectivity, sustainable development and
   self-reliance.},

Abstract = {The inability of the Conservative Government led by Prime Minister
   Theresa May to deliver a Brexit deal by 29 March 2019 was a policy
   fiasco, condemned widely by Remainers and Leavers alike. The entire
   process was a unique combination of chaos, day-by-day unravelling of new
   proposals and gridlock. This article examines three main explanations
   for the fiasco that are prevalent in contemporary political discourse.
   Analysis is underpinned by conceptual literature straddling policy
   fiascos and policy studies. It examines three explanations (i) Brexit as
   an impossible policy challenge (ii) ineffectual leadership by Theresa
   May who took poor decisions and avoided plausible alternatives and (iii)
   Westminster as a partisan-fuelled institution incapable of reaching
   agreement on such a bi-partisan issue. The article concludes by
   considering whether any single explanation is sufficiently plausible,
   situating this analysis within long-standing debates on the nature of UK
   politics.},

Abstract = {We theoretically argue for and empirically examine, for the first time,
   a triangular relationship between concern among citizens about the
   environment, media attention to environmental issues, and policy output.
   Previous work has studied these relationships, but analyzed the
   respective links rather in isolation from each other. This research has
   significant implications for the understanding of environmental
   policymaking and, more generally, informs the debate on whether
   politicians respond to what voters want and under what circumstances
   this occurs.},

Abstract = {This article argues that conceptualising the ethical/moral possibilities
   of international society can be enhanced by utilising the distinction
   between positive and negative duties rather than order versus justice.
   The main argument of the article targets the traditional pluralist
   account and claims that within this account far greater moves towards
   justice are possible, which can be seen through the lens of order versus
   justice. More specifically, it argues that a pluralist international
   society need not be indifferent to global injustices such as poverty, if
   the range of negative duties is expanded.},

Abstract = {If dangerous climate change is to be avoided, the majority of the
   world's fossil fuel supplies cannot be burned. Exporting countries will,
   therefore, lose out on a significant source of revenue - among them some
   of the world's poorest countries. Might they have a claim to assistance
   from the international community if these losses come to pass? If so, on
   what basis? I examine two distinct arguments for assistance. The first
   is based on the claim that when our expectations are thwarted by public
   policy, compensation for those affected may be morally required. The
   second is premised upon the right to development - a right which is
   potentially jeopardised when some fossil fuel assets must go
   unexploited. I argue that the second argument enjoys better prospects. I
   also discuss several mechanisms which would allow the international
   community to assist countries incurring losses arising from the need to
   stabilise our global climate.},

   of research focuses on micro-level dynamics to explain how some groups
   are more vulnerable to rumors than others. This article applies framing
   theory to examine a rumor that led to violence that killed Farkhunda
   Malikzada in Afghanistan in March 2015 and three separate protests
   against the incident. Focusing on how different groups understand and
   reinterpret rumors, the article makes a distinction between rumor as an
   informational shortcut and an instrument of deliberate manipulation of

Abstract = {How does civil war shape the prospects of lasting peace between formerly
   opposing ethnic groups after the end of violence? This article addresses
   the complex relationship between war experience, interethnic attitudes,
   interethnic forgiveness, and the willingness to permit basic civil
   liberties to former enemies in the context of postwar Sri Lanka. Despite
   the end of the 26-year-long civil war in 2009, social and political
   tensions between the two largest ethnic groups, the Sinhalese and the
   Sri Lankan Tamils, still prevail. Political tolerance is in the
   literature considered a crucial micro-level condition for peaceful
   coexistence, yet, its determinants, in particular the role of war
   experiences, have not received sufficient attention. Using new and
   unique all-island representative survey data (N = 1,420), we examine the
   mutual permission of civil liberties of these two ethnic groups. Our
   analyses reveal two important findings: first, the likelihood of
   granting civil liberties varies by civil liberty and ethnic group.
   Whereas most members of both ethnic groups are willing to grant the
   right to vote, to hold a speech, and to hold a government position, the
   right to demonstrate is highly contested, with only low shares of both
   Tamils and Sinhalese being willing to grant the other group this right.
   Second, the structural equation models reveal that the direct impact of
   war exposure is less powerful than expected and depends on the political
   right in question. Not forgiving the other ethnic group, partly driven
   by war experience and ethnic prejudice, appears to be a more consistent
   predictor of intolerance. These results imply that postwar efforts to
   further forgiveness are important to promote political tolerance and
   thereby long-lasting peace.},

Abstract = {In addition to its successful mobilization in stigmatization and
   norm-setting processes on anti-personnel landmines and cluster
   munitions, the principle of distinction as enshrined in International
   Humanitarian Law also figures prominently in the debate on lethal
   autonomous weapons systems (LAWS). Proponents of a ban on LAWS frame
   these as indiscriminate, that is, unable to distinguish between
   civilians and combatants, and thus as inherently unlawful. The flip side
   of this particular legal argument is, however, that LAWS become
   acceptable when considered capable of distinguishing between combatants
   and civilians. We thus argue, first, that this particular legal basis
   for the call for a ban on LAWS might be rendered obsolete by
   technological progress increasing discriminatory weapon capabilities.
   Second, we argue that the argument is normatively troubling as it
   suggests that, as long as civilians remain unharmed, attacking
   combatants with LAWS is acceptable. Consequently, we find that the legal
   principle of distinction is not the overall strongest argument to
   mobilize when trying to stigmatize and ban LAWS. A more fundamental,
   ethical argument within the debate about LAWS - and one less susceptible
   to `technological fixes' - should be emphasized instead, namely that
   life and death decisions on the battlefield should always and in
   principle be made by humans only.},

Abstract = {This article critically chronicles the ascendancy and apparent decline
   of a business conglomerate, Metals and Engineering Corporation (METEC),
   in post-1991 Ethiopia. Informed by `developmental state' ideology, the
   political elites managed to create METEC, entrusting it to the military
   for their use in leading the industrialisation of the country. With a
   sober analysis of the conglomerate's engagement in mega-projects in the
   context of civil-military relations, this article shows that the
   `developmental role' of METEC has been characterised by extreme delays
   in projects, with symptoms of financial embezzlement which have led the
   party-state to reconsider the military's role in the economy. The
   article relies primarily on documents, informal discussions and media
   content analysis.},

Abstract = {Narrative stories are crucial to policy change, as they decisively
   contribute to how policy problems and policies are defined. While this
   seems to apply for social policy in particular, narrative stories have
   remained under-researched and not systematically compared for this area.
   In this article, we theorise on narratives in social policy by focusing
   on how similarities and differences between narratives in old- and
   new-social-risks policy reforms can be conceptualised, taking into
   account expansion and retrenchment. To systematically link those types
   of social policy reform with narrative elements, we rely on stories of
   control and helplessness, as well as the deservingness or
   undeservingness associated with different target populations. Thereby,
   distinct types of social policy reform narratives are identified:
   stories of giving-to-give, giving-to-shape, taking-to-take,
   taking-to-control, and taking-out-of-helplessness. The article concludes
   with empirical illustrations of those narrative types, which stem from
   the case studies presented in this Special Issue.},

Abstract = {How do firms protect themselves against infringements of their property
   rights by their own government? The authors develop a theory based on
   international law and joint asset ownership with foreign firms.
   Investment agreements protect the assets of foreign firms but are not
   available to domestic firms. This segmentation of the property rights
   environment creates a rationale for international financial
   relationships between firms. By forming financial relationships with
   foreign firms, domestic firms gain indirect coverage from the property
   rights available to foreign firms under investment agreements. If a
   government is less likely to violate the property rights of covered
   foreign firms, it is also less likely to violate property rights for
   assets held jointly by domestic and foreign firms. This article presents
   systematic evidence from data on the activities of firms in countries
   that have investment agreements with the United States. International
   financial relationships between firms, through mergers and acquisitions
   as well as through bond and equity issues, are more common where
   property rights are weak. The theory suggests a political logic to the
   fragmentation of firm-ownership stakes across jurisdictions, offers an
   institutional explanation of international financial flows, and
   identifies new distributional consequences of international law.},

Abstract = {Scholars have found it difficult to identify the impact of austerity on
   policy outputs. This difficulty may have arisen because studies tend to
   focus on the content of national and EU legislation, or budgetary
   responses to fiscal constraint, rather than taking a holistic view of
   `policy'. Drawing on fieldwork in two English cities, we show how
   `dismantling by arena shifting' - exemplified by reductions in
   `back-office' environmental policy capacity at the subnational level -
   can provide a more nuanced understanding of national-local interaction
   and policy change. We propose that such approaches may be common,
   because they allow policymakers to protect electorally popular
   `frontline' services and more visible aspects of public goods provision,
   thereby avoiding blame for potentially unpopular decisions. However,
   dismantling by arena-shifting may have significant impacts over the
   medium-term, because reductions in `back-office' functions may make it
   more difficult for subnational actors to develop, implement and enforce
   effective policy in future.},

Abstract = {The large gatherings of youths from impoverished urban peripheries in
   the shopping malls of Sao Paulo and Rio, known as rolezinhos (little
   strolls), in the first two months of 2014 and their disputed relation to
   the wave of political protests in Brazilian cities since June 2013
   became the topic of heated debates among intellectuals and journalists
   in Brazil. Historical parallels ranging from nineteenth-century Paris to
   colonial Korea help situate the rolezinho phenomenon in a transnational
   history of urban strolling and to problematize its ambiguous
   politicality between ostentatious consumerism and revolutionary
   practice.},

   possibly the largest illegal lottery game in the world, examines the
   mechanisms that have fostered the lottery's notable growth outside the

   combine costly signals and selective incentives to induce cooperation

Abstract = {The austerity policies that EU policymakers adopted in response to the
   Eurozone crisis are often criticized as the product of institutionalized
   neoliberal ideas. This critique has merits, but tends to overlook
   institutional changes that do not neatly conform to well demarcated
   neoliberal ideas considered as ``switchmen,{''} ``paradigms,{''} or
   ``blueprints.{''} This article offers an alternative reading of the
   Eurozone's institutional evolution that bridges pragmatist scholarship
   with cognitive and social psychology. The Eurozone crisis saw the
   emergence of a new and contested repertoire of governance. Policymakers
   agreed that ``stronger governance{''} was necessary, but they struggled
   over how to perform that repertoire. This contest ultimately produced
   institutional changes that typically mixed austerity and unconventional
   policies. The advantage of thinking about ideas in terms of repertoires
   that actors perform is to afford a more granular view of institutions as
   sites of individual cognition, collective innovation, and political
   contestation.},

Abstract = {Based on actual patient complaints, we have assessed the suitability of
   measurable elementary criteria for the selected patient complaint
   indicator aggregate. These indicators enable, as evidenced by the study,
   the monitoring and reporting of recorded patient rights violations. The
   data acquired from processed patient rights violations were obtained
   through a quantitative study via an electronic complaint form, which
   constitutes an integral part of the prototype interactive software
   solution. This solution was used for submitting and monitoring of
   patients' complaints on violation of their rights. Based on the data
   acquired from anonymised cases (71 complaints) and study findings, it
   was established that the recorded requests for the processing of patient
   rights violations occur as a result of: (1) inadequate attitude of
   healthcare professionals (n = 38.03\%), (2) inadequate actions by
   healthcare professionals (n = 57.75\%), and (3) later consequences of
   violations (n = 4.22\%). The proposed set of patient complaint
   indicators can lead to a significant contribution to national patient
   rights protection policies, to improvement of healthcare quality
   indicators, and to implementation of measures for better healthcare
   quality.},

Abstract = {This article studies the effects of traditional chiefs-a common type of
   broker-on voters' ability to extract state resources from politicians.
   Using original data from Northern Ghana, the author shows that
   chieftaincy positions invented by colonial authorities are especially
   prone to capture, leaving voters worse off compared both to more
   accountable chiefs whose authority dates to the precolonial period and
   to voters who lack formal chiefs who can serve as brokers. The latter
   comparison exploits exogenous assignment of ethnic groups to the
   colonial invention of chieftaincy in the late nineteenth century. The
   findings suggest that whether voters benefit from brokers amidst
   clientelistic electoral competition depends on the accountability
   relationship between brokers and their clients.},

Abstract = {This article draws on qualitative case study research in Murewa, a rural
   district town in Zimbabwe, to extend the use of the concept of `social
   navigation' from conflict-affected settings to repressive regime
   contexts. Through the concept of `the everyday', it analyses how youth
   experience political violence and repression, and the tactics they use
   to access paid work and secure self-employment. The findings show that
   youth accept existing forms of political violence and repression as
   normal, and that the historical construction of politicized youth
   matters for how they understand their room for manoeuvre within it.
   Since partisan actors control many of the economic opportunities, social
   navigation is about the need to assess the political affiliation of
   actors that offer any economic opportunity, and the potential
   implications of being associated with a particular `side' in the
   political landscape. Contrary to dominant discourses that portray youth
   as violent, this study shows that many will avoid relationships through
   which they risk being mobilized into violence.},

Abstract = {Community-based tourism is advocated by indigenous organizations and
   leftist actors throughout Latin America as a tool for furthering their
   political and cultural agenda. The ideological biases and structural
   weaknesses of this model become apparent in a case study of the fishing
   village of Prainha do Canto Verde, Brazil. The communitarian agenda
   currently being implemented by means of the community-based tourism
   project in Prainha is based upon an ideological construct and being
   imposed through political engineering upon what is simply a local
   segment of Brazilian rural society. As a result, it is encountering
   strong resistance. There is also structural tension between the
   inevitable sociocultural change caused by the development of tourism and
   the rigidity and essentialism of a community-based tourism model
   offering a ``traditional way of life{''} as a touristic product. The
   model is ultimately conflictual and unstable, and there is serious doubt
   about its long-term sustainability.},

Abstract = {Studying Mexico's foreign policy towards Africa is not an easy task. The
   difficulties of obtaining qualitative information are compounded by the
   notable absence of that continent from the foreign policy agenda and in
   public opinion. Between ignorance, disinterest, and racist prejudices,
   the essential feature of foreign policy towards Africa is one of
   continuity. In the first years of the period studied (2012-2018), that
   continent appeared as just another title in official Mexican documents,
   with little content. In the latter years of the administration a
   relatively greater activism in foreign economic policy was deployed, in
   what would seem to be an attempt to emulate the behavior of other
   emerging economies, such as China, India, and Turkey, but with limited
   capabilities.},

Abstract = {The objective of this article is to evaluate the foreign policy of
   Mexico during the Enrique Pena Nieto administration. The main argument
   is that this activity was deeply conditioned by internal and external
   factors in different stages of the term. The first part identifies the
   main foreign policy goals of the Pena administration. The second one
   divides the term into four stages: from 2012 to 2014, which develops the
   structural reforms that impacted Mexico's foreign policy; from 2014 to
   2016 that analyzes domestic issues; from 2016 to mid-2018 when Donald
   Trump appeared on the political scene; and from mid-2018 until the end
   of the administration. The last part evaluates the fulfillment of the
   objectives set at the beginning of the administration.},

Abstract = {Researchers today have access to an unprecedented amount of
   geo-referenced, disaggregated data on political conflict. Because these
   new data sources use disparate event typologies and units of analysis,
   findings are rarely comparable across studies. As a result, we are
   unable to answer basic questions like `what does conflict A tell us
   about conflict B?' This article introduces xSub - a `database of
   databases' for disaggregated research on political conflict (). xSub
   reduces barriers to comparative subnational research, by empowering
   researchers to quickly construct custom, analysis-ready datasets. xSub
   currently features subnational data on conflict in 156 countries, from
   21 sources, including large data collections and data from individual
   scholars. To facilitate comparisons across countries and sources, xSub
   organizes these data into consistent event categories, actors, spatial
   units (country, province, district, grid cell, electoral constituency),
   and time units (year, month, week, and day). This article introduces
   xSub and illustrates its potential, by investigating the impact of
   repression on dissent across thousands of subnational datasets.},

Abstract = {The theorization of borderland environmental justice is expanded by
   examining the specificities of fragmented governance and accountability
   and how this affects environmental injustice in the region. I argue that
   borderland environmental justice is distinct from U.S.-based
   environmental justice because of the congruence of three elements:
   socio-economic and ecological integration, the core-periphery
   relationship between the U.S. and Mexico, and the fragmented governance
   in the region. These elements are both a source of environmental
   injustices and also provide apertures for community activists to access
   international forums in order to meet their movement goals.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this article is to analyse how the seemingly natural fit
   between Japan and the soft power concept has been possible despite the
   notorious vagueness of the concept and what the consequences of soft
   power's reification are. By building on recent scholarship on concepts,
   expert knowledge and narratives, the article suggests that reification
   processes are best conceptualized as driven by concept coalitions. The
   article finds that soft power was narrated and nurtured into Japan's
   cultural diplomacy, Japan's relationship with the United States (US) and
   its security policy. The article, moreover, shows that the more soft
   power was understood, framed and accepted as benign and necessary, the
   more persuasive arguments about what Japan should do or be in order to
   wield soft power became. This has legitimized narratives that suggest
   that Japan's `proactive contribution to peace' as a responsible ally of
   the US constitutes an inevitable source of soft power.},

Abstract = {Drawing on literature on world society and polity, we investigate the
   factors that drive the formation of global biodiversity governance.
   Using an event history analysis, we examine local and trans-local
   factors that influence how long it takes for countries to ratify the
   United Nation Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD). Three factors
   are positively correlated with CBD ratification rates: local
   environmentalism, the local orientation toward global governance, and
   trans-local peer pressure. The effects of peer pressure vary. Regional
   peers appear to influence countries to ratify the CBD more quickly,
   whereas global peers do not. The robust effect of regional peers is
   unique to biodiversity, contrary to what is known for other areas like
   climate change. We contribute to the literature of global environmental
   governance by providing an issue-area-specific model for biodiversity,
   and provide a reference point for future research on global biodiversity
   governance, including two protocols after the CBD.},

Abstract = {Purpose The purpose of this paper is to develop a conceptual framework
   for assessing what are the possibilities and pitfalls of using
   algorithmic systems of news personalization - i.e. the tailoring of
   individualized news feeds based on users' information preferences - for
   constructive conflict coverage in the context of peace journalism, a
   journalistic paradigm calling for more diversified and creative war
   reporting. Design/methodology/approach The paper provides a critical
   review of existing research on peace journalism and algorithmic news
   personalization, and analyzes the intersections between the two
   concepts. Specifically, it identifies recurring pitfalls of peace
   journalism based on empirical research on constructive conflict coverage
   and then introduces a conceptual framework for analyzing to what degree
   these pitfalls can be mediated - or worsened - through algorithmic
   system design. Findings The findings suggest that AI-driven distribution
   technologies can facilitate constructive war reporting, in particular by
   countering the effects of journalists' self-censorship and by
   diversifying conflict coverage. The implementation of these goals,
   however, depends on multiple system design solutions, thus resonating
   with current calls for more responsible and value-sensitive algorithmic
   design in the domain of news media. Additionally, our observations
   emphasize the importance of developing new algorithmic literacies among
   journalists both to realize the positive potential of AI for promoting
   peace and to increase the awareness of possible negative impacts of new
   systems of content distribution. Originality/value The article particle
   is the first to provide a comprehensive conceptualization of the impact
   of new content distribution techniques on constructive conflict coverage
   in the context of peace journalism. It also offers a novel conceptual
   framing for assessing the impact of algorithmic news personalization on
   reporting traumatic and polarizing events, such as wars and violence.},

Abstract = {This article examines the relationship between leadership and public
   value, which is particularly challenging in a context of explicit
   contest and conflict. The theoretical framework is illustrated through a
   case study of policing rural crime. The study reveals that the police
   worked with multiple and competing publics rather than a single
   homogeneous public, and that part of their leadership role was to create
   and convene a public space in which different voices and divergent views
   could be expressed. The study notes that research needs to pay attention
   to the loss and displacement of public value, not solely its creation
   and recognition. The need to convene multiple publics required the
   police to lead, as part of a leadership constellation, and with
   political astuteness. The findings have wider relevance for other public
   services, and for studies of leadership and public value at the
   intersection between the state and civil society.},

Abstract = {The nonstate actors of interest in this article are territorial
   contenders: political entities that control populated territory,
   function like sovereign states but are not recognized as sovereign
   states by other members of the international system. Sometimes they are
   de facto states, sometimes they are rebel groups, sometimes they are
   neither of these, instead existing in control of territory with neither
   conflict against the sovereign state within whose borders they exist nor
   claims to a state of their own. New data about territorial contenders
   permit me to evaluate arguments about changing rules and norms in the
   international system. I find support for claims about the consequences
   of changing rules about which actors are recognized as sovereign states
   but not for claims about a norm against conquest after World War II. In
   the discussion section, I consider implications of these findings for
   future research.},

Abstract = {Norm scholars tend to treat norm contestation and acceptance as binary
   categories. This obscures variation in how much states agree over how to
   apply international law to specific situations. I distinguish between
   disagreements over norm frames (justifications) and claims (actions) and
   thus highlight four different outcomes of norm contestation. These
   differ in their effects on the clarity and strength of the contested
   norms, as well as on subsequent debate over them. Specifically, I argue
   that frame agreement limits the range of actions that actors can
   legitimately pursue and thus involves norm recognition. In contrast, if
   states only agree on the action that should be taken, but not on the
   norm that applies, we see norm neglect. Both outcomes structure
   subsequent debates, but norm neglect is the more volatile outcome:
   because of the lack of normative commitment, states can justify the
   agreed-upon action as exceptional compromise and later revert back to a
   norm impasse (frame and claim disagreement). However, the joint action
   may also trigger socialization processes that lead to agreement on both
   frames and claims-that is, produce norm clarification. Hence, this
   typology builds a bridge between understandings of contestation as a
   never-ending debate and as an avenue toward agreement; it helps improve
   our understanding of compliance mechanisms and of contestation.},

Abstract = {The current literature on politicization can be separated into three
   groups: politicization within national political systems, of the EU, and
   of international institutions. In spite of speaking about a similar
   phenomenon based on a common definition, these three strands of
   literature do not interact with each other and display, beyond the
   definitional consensus, significant differences. The focus on different
   political levels also leads to various assessments. This contribution
   compares these three strands of literature with the goal of showing that
   it is necessary to simultaneously look at all three levels to understand
   the dynamics of politicization and de-politicization. There is a
   significant potential of analyzing different (de-)politicization
   processes in an integrative framework to provide fresh insights for each
   of the fields. In fact, some of the differences between the three kinds
   of literature can be resolved only by looking at the three levels in
   parallel.},

Abstract = {Experts argue that the internet has provided expanded opportunities for
   violent extremist groups to propagandize and recruit. The Islamic State
   of Iraq and Syria, or ISIS, is an exemplar in that it has heavily
   invested in an online presence and uses online communities and social
   media to attract and retain supporters. Does ISIS's online presence
   translate into a higher probability that individuals in its target
   audience will become supporters? In this study we analyze over 6,000
   individuals in six Arab countries to find if those that use the internet
   to follow political news or to express political views are more likely
   to support ISIS. We find that respondents who get their news online are
   significantly more likely to support ISIS than those who follow the news
   on television or print media. Moreover, those who use online fora for
   political expression are also more likely to express support for ISIS.
   Indeed, individuals who engage in online political discussion are more
   likely to support ISIS than those who engage in conventional political
   activity, though less than those who engage in contentious political
   behaviors such as attending a political protest. We conclude with a
   brief discussion of the academic and policy implications of these
   findings.},

Abstract = {At a time when most national parties in Europe are losing members,
   parties at the European level, or Europarties, have introduced
   membership for individuals. This article is the first to investigate,
   compare, and explain the individual membership of Europarties. It
   focuses on the rights of the individual members to participate in the
   formulation of policies and the selection of leadership candidates. For
   this purpose, the article develops an index that charts the
   participatory rights. In doing so, it highlights a high degree of
   variation between the Europarties. It argues that these differences can
   be explained through a combination of four factors: the Europarties'
   electoral successes; the attitudes of the national member parties
   towards individual membership; the motivation and activism of the
   individual members; and Europarty funding rules. The article argues that
   if Europarties want to be seen as `real' parties, they should grant
   their grassroots members real participatory powers.},

Abstract = {This article shows that the quasi-fiscal nature of the ECB's
   unconventional monetary policy measures and its troika membership
   created three mutually reinforcing threats to its political
   independence. First, it led to a rising level of public distrust in the
   ECB. Second, it triggered an elite dissensus on whether political
   independence of central banks was still the appropriate solution to the
   time inconsistency problem. Third, it created institutional
   overburdening with negative repercussions for the central bank's output
   legitimacy. Faced with this diverse set of challenges in creditor and
   debtor countries, the ECB exploited EMU's democratic deficit by relying
   on visits to national parliaments to preserve its independence.},

Abstract = {This note makes the case for a research agenda that addresses the
   politicization of EU external relations. There is reason to think that,
   as it is happening on the related issues of globalization and European
   integration, the role of the EU in the world is becoming more
   contentious. The EU, an alleged norm exporter, might be turning more
   divided about the appropriateness of the norms that underpin EU external
   relations. The article argues that variation in the character of this
   politicization will depend on the degree of authority transferred to the
   EU and to international institutions. Such transfers will lead to
   different blends of two basic models of conflict over EU external
   relations. One has been described by the literature on the
   politicization of the EU and the other by the literature on normative
   processes that see international norms as the object of both promotion
   and dissent.},

Abstract = {Policy feedback refers to the variety of ways in which existing policies
   can shape key aspects of politics and policymaking. Originating in
   historical institutionalism, the study of policy feedback has expanded
   to address resource and interpretative effects on target populations and
   mass publics, the roles of policy elites, and how feedback effects are
   conditioned by policy designs and larger institutional contexts.
   Recently, more attention has also been paid to feedback effects that are
   not self-reinforcing in nature. This introduction provides a
   nonexhaustive review of the existing historical institutionalist
   literature on policy feedback as well as introducing the contributions
   to the special issue. The diversity of policy feedback scholarship is
   reflected in manuscripts building from the social constructions
   framework and the thermostatic model. Advances in research are captured
   in contributions empirically testing different forms of feedback, varied
   strategies of policy elites to shape feedback, and how context may
   suppress feedback effects. The special issue emphasizes critical,
   understudied dimensions shaping feedback processes, such as race, and
   the role of organizations. A major lacuna in policy feedback
   scholarship, the overwhelming emphasis on the United States, must be
   addressed through more comparative and international research including
   closer dialogs between U.S.-based and non-U.S. scholars.},

Title = {Claiming the Shipyard, the Cowboy Hat, and the Anchor for Women: Polish
   Feminism's Dialogue and Struggle with National Symbolism},

Abstract = {This article examines the evolving role of national symbolism in Polish
   feminist discourses and activist practices since 1989. Three case
   studies involving symbolic appropriation are presented; in each,
   cultural signs of great importance to the national imaginary are put to
   work for women's equality in acts of resistance to nationalist rhetoric.
   The first case is the graffiti reportedly seen on the wall of the Gdansk
   Shipyard during the 1980 Solidarity strike: ``Women, do not disturb us,
   we are fighting for Poland.{''} The sign and the story behind it came to
   play an important role in feminist debates about national belonging and
   exclusion. The second example is the 1989 election poster featuring Gary
   Cooper, twice transformed by feminists. Finally, the article examines
   the struggle between nationalists and feminists over the ``fighting
   Poland{''} sign associated with the Warsaw Uprising of 1944. The Black
   Protest of 2016 creatively transformed this symbol, which led to much
   public debate and several court cases. This article argues that Polish
   feminism is engaged in contestation of the dominant understanding of
   nationhood imposed by right-wing, male-centered forces and the Catholic
   Church. Responses to the post-1989 resurgence of nationalism have
   constituted key dividing lines between strands of feminist activism and
   thinking in Poland. The two competing strategies have been pathos and
   irony. The Black Protest seems to mark a new stage in these
   developments-one that corresponds to Victor Turner's communitas, with
   its characteristic turmoil and symbolic intensity.},

Abstract = {This sketch narrates an account of the author's abundant years of
   fieldwork, delving into the Holocaust and memory thereof in the Polish
   countryside. The region selected is highly representative in a
   phenomenological sense: much of the destiny met by Polish Jews in rural
   areas played itself out in these lands. Born and raised in this
   vicinity, the author of the text at hand was able to obtain otherwise
   inaccessible information about the fate of local Jews, culled from
   conversations with current and former inhabitants. Moreover, this
   inquiry was accompanied by engagement: a complementary goal was to
   reintroduce Polish Jews and the Shoah into the memory of a community
   and, by the same token, to demonstrate that the rebuilding of memory is
   possible in contemporary Poland. In consequence, a memory that includes
   the Jews who used to live in this area is gradually returning to the
   region under investigation. Among other things, a monument now stands in
   the village, playing a central role for the community-a wall
   commemorating murdered local Jews as well as local non-Jewish Poles
   recognized as Righteous Among the Nations. This provincial society has
   thus also been prepared to face knowledge about local persecutors and
   perpetrators of Holocaust crimes against local Jews.},

Title = {It Comes with the Territory: Why States Negotiate with Ethno-Political
   Organizations},
Journal = {STUDIES IN CONFLICT \& TERRORISM},
Year = {2019},

Abstract = {Given that minority ethno-political organizations are generally weaker
   than states yet seek to change their policies or remove the ruling
   regime from power, why would negotiation occur? States prefer to ignore
   or repress such organizations, which typically have little to offer in
   return amidst negotiations that can legitimize them while delegitimizing
   the state. When a challenging organization establishes governing
   structures and controls movement in part of a state's territory,
   however, it can easily inflict significant economic and political costs
   on the state while also possessing a valuable asset to exchange for
   concessions. An organization with territorial control cannot be ignored,
   while the state will have a strong incentive to negotiate before the
   state loses more face, the group gains more legitimacy, neighboring
   states are more likely to invade, and the international community is
   more likely to formally recognize any facts on the ground as a new
   status quo. Our analysis of 118 organizations in the Middle East and
   North Africa from 1980-2004 reveals that territorial control is the most
   important determinant of intrastate negotiation. In regards to existing
   scholarship, this suggests that a certain type of successful violence
   works-not all violence and not only nonviolence-while certain types of
   strong organizations-those that control territory-are more likely to
   reach negotiations with the state than weak ones.},

Abstract = {The quality of studies drawing primary data from terrorists and violent
   extremist respondents varies substantially, with this body of literature
   exhibiting a variety of repeating methodological issues. For instance,
   researchers often uncritically accept interviewee responses at face
   value, overlook key theoretical insights, downplay or neglect
   potentially important explanatory variables, fail to offer sufficient
   information about their sampling methods, and deliver findings with
   inferences beyond what their sample allows. Indeed, certain studies
   demonstrate a number of these flaws, including the United Nations
   Development Programme's recently published Journey to Extremism in
   Africa report. Within this context, the dual purposes of this article
   are (a) to discuss ways to overcome these specific methodological
   problems, and (b) to provide broader guidance for face-to-face research
   with such respondents.},

Abstract = {The European Union became more politically salient and contested from
   the early 1990s onwards. Analysis of the impact of politicisation on the
   Union's directly elected Parliament has not been a central focus on the
   literature on politicisation. The objective of thee concluding
   reflections is to explore the interaction between the politicisation of
   European integration and the development of the European Parliament
   (EP). The reflections focus on three inter-related facets of how the EP
   addressed the emerging challenges to the Union's political system.
   First, it looks at the 2014 EP elections and reviews the EP party
   groups' deliberate attempt to introduce political choice in the
   Spitzenkandidaten process. Second, it analyses the outcome of the 2014
   EP elections and the emergence of a fractured parliament with the
   political success of far-right parties. Third, it assesses how the
   arrival of far-right governments undermining the Union's normative order
   challenges the EP political groups.},

Abstract = {Criminologists and terrorism specialists alike have conducted research
   on the deterrent effect of policies; however, to date, only
   criminologists have thoroughly examined the associated displacement of
   crime and diffusion of benefits. Using data from the Eco-Incidents
   Database, this study first examines the deterrent effect of government
   efforts targeting animal rights and environmental terrorism over several
   years. Next, it extends this application by examining nonterrorist
   actions by both terrorist groups and nonterrorist groups to see if
   deterrent actions have any unintended consequences. Results show no
   evidence of displacement, but rather that several government actions
   evidenced a diffusion of benefits.},

   adopted by local governments in social strategy development in Turkey.
   Data for case study research of the Bagcilar, Esenler and Besiktas
   municipalities were collected from literature, observations and
   semi-structured interviews with municipal officials. A thematic analysis
   of the interviews was used to inform analysis on social strategy and
   innovation practices, and based on the analysis, the study proposes a
   functional model for a local solution centre aimed at facilitating
   social innovation and strategic public relations elements that can be
   applied by local governments in Turkey.},

Abstract = {Institutions are useful for advancing methodologies within disciplines.
   Through required coursework, doctoral students are indoctrinated into
   basic guidelines and frameworks that provide a common foundation for
   scholars to interact with one another. Lacking such forums in many of
   our doctoral granting institutions (Stout 2013), the field of public
   management continues to struggle with an ambivalence toward qualitative
   approaches. Lack of shared understanding concerning basic tenets of
   qualitative methodology abounds. This article is intended for
   qualitative consumers, those not formally trained in qualitative methods
   but who serve as peer reviewers, content experts, and advisors in arenas
   where qualitative methods are encountered. Adopting a postpositivistic
   stance dominant in the field, we seek to offer a pragmatic perspective
   on qualitative methods with regards to some basic tenets of rigor
   appropriate (and inappropriate) for assessing the contribution of
   qualitative research. We argue that the first step in this effort is to
   stop conflating data type (qualitative versus quantitative) with
   inductive versus deductive modes of inquiry. Using deductive modes as
   the basis for comparison, we discuss both common, as well as, diverging
   criteria of quality and rigor for inductive modes of inquiry. We
   conclude with a discussion of rigor in emerging methods which utilize
   qualitative data but from within a deductive, mixed, or hybrid mode of
   inquiry.},

Abstract = {Journalistic reports and case study evidence suggest that governments
   have made policy and institutional reforms to achieve or maintain
   eligibility for assistance from the Millennium Challenge Corporation
   (MCC). However, the empirical scope of the ``MCC Effect{''}-across
   countries, policy domains, and time-remains a subject of speculation and
   debate. There is also little rigorous evidence about the conditions
   under which the MCC eligibility standards have influenced the reform
   efforts of developing country governments. To address this challenge, we
   construct an original data set that measures whether, when, and how
   governments in low-income and lower-middle-income countries responded to
   the eligibility requirements for MCC assistance between 2004 and 2010.
   Our econometric analysis of the data set calls attention to an
   underappreciated factor that shapes the adoption and implementation of
   externally influenced reforms: the presence of a technocratic reform
   team with executive authority to introduce disruptive changes to the
   status quo.},

Abstract = {While interest groups are often seen as transmission belts of public
   preferences, little is known as to how they might transmit such
   preferences. This paper argues that the provision of information is one
   mechanism through which advocates represent their constituents'
   interests and analyses who informs policymakers about these preferences
   and when actors are more likely to do so. The study relies on a new
   dataset containing information on the arguments advocates made in public
   hearings that were held on 34 specific policy issues in Germany. The
   results reveal that the amount of information on public preferences an
   actor provides is determined by actor type, its public support and
   position on the issue. Interestingly, information on public preferences
   is predominantly used by status-quo defenders. This paper contributes to
   our understanding of interest groups as transmission belts and their
   potential to enhance governments' ability to respond to public
   preferences.},

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL STUDIES QUARTERLY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {63},
Number = {1},

Abstract = {How does the anticipation of external support affect dictators domestic
   political behavior? We lack a convincing explanation for why
   authoritarian leaders often attempt to consolidate power in ways that
   heighten the risk of violence and endanger the regime. Adapting the
   moral hazard framework from the alliance literature, I argue that the
   anticipation of military support from allies lowers the potential costs
   of regime purges. This reduces the incentives for dictators to govern
   inclusively, encouraging more aggressive coup-proofing actions and
   generating a higher risk of retaliatory violence. Using new data on
   elite purges in authoritarian regimes, I find that defensive alliances
   increase the propensity of dictators to aggressively consolidate power.
   In addition, these types of alliances lead to purges of more powerful
   elites, which, in turn, increase the likelihood of post-purge
   large-scale violence. By contrast, forms of external support that entail
   less commitment by the patron do not have these effects. I provide an
   overview of the origins of the 19981999 civil war in Guinea-Bissau to
   complement the novel empirical results and to illustrate the causal
   logic of the argument in the context of West African alliance politics.},

Abstract = {The study of soft power in international relations suffers from a
   liberal democratic bias. Throughout the literature, liberal concepts and
   values are assumed to be universal in their appeal. This bias has led
   scholars to underestimate Russian soft power by instrumentalising it,
   that is, to see it purely as the effect of government-sponsored
   programmes, and to focus primarily on the cultural pillar of soft power.
   This paper argues, alternatively, that Russia's conservative values and
   illiberal governance models generate admiration and followership, even
   outside of what Russia claims to be its post-Soviet sphere of influence.
   Crucially, this admiration and followership perform the traditional
   function of soft power: generating support for controversial Russian
   foreign policy decisions. Admitting that soft power can be based on
   conservative values is necessary not only to understand Russia's foreign
   policy potential, but also the ability of non-Western states to
   challenge successfully the Western liberal order.},

Abstract = {With the ratification of its new constitution in 2009, Bolivia was
   transformed into a ``plurinational state{''} associated with
   ecologically oriented values, yet resource extraction has expanded ever
   since. Fieldwork conducted in communities in highland Bolivia shows how
   resource extraction sustains and is sustained by ``revolutionary
   narratives{''} in which the state-led by President Evo Morales-is
   configured as the protagonist of the plurinational era. Examination of
   the challenges presented by Bolivia's indigenous communities and mining
   cooperatives to this revolutionary narrative during the 2014 adoption of
   new mining legislation suggests that shifting critical focus away from
   revolutionary change toward what David Scott calls the ``politics of the
   present{''} might be a more fruitful way to think about the relationship
   between resource extraction and Bolivia's plurinationalism.},

Abstract = {From armed-building occupations to fisticuffs between protesters and
   police at otherwise peaceful demonstrations, protest violence is an
   essential part of the politics of protest. In this article, I argue that
   state capacity is central to understanding why some protests are
   violent. In particular, this article explores two facets of state
   capacity-coercive capacity and state authority-arguing that where the
   state is treated as a relevant authority, the likelihood that protesters
   will employ violent tactics decreases. Using original data on Mexican
   protest events, I demonstrate that higher levels of state authority
   reduce violent protest but that increased coercive capacity, especially
   where state authority is weak, is associated with a greater likelihood
   of protest violence. This article contributes to our understanding of
   the influence of state capacity on protest violence and suggests that
   attentiveness to subnational variations in state capacity can help us
   better understand the violence.},

Abstract = {China's increased participation in the world market and its consequent
   demand for energy has contributed to exacerbating the vulnerability of
   many externally oriented resource-rich countries. As a consequence,
   since the early 2000s the relationship between China and Venezuela has
   gone far beyond trade to an ``energy cooperation{''} model with joint
   ventures and development funds not only in oil but also in nonresource
   sectors of the Venezuelan economy. Despite massive increases in social
   expenditure, Latin American theorists arguing from a neo-dependency
   perspective have questioned the long-term benefits of this so-called
   cooperation. They have characterized the relationship as
   ``neoextractivist{''} in reference to the historically dependent
   relationship between Latin America and countries in the Global North.
   Whether the relationship is seen as based on South-South cooperation or
   on rearticulated global political and economic inequalities depends on
   whether the focus is on the behavior of the Chinese state and Chinese
   companies or on bilateral agreements between the two states. Although
   politically the relationship is based on cooperation, economically it
   displays many of the structural problems that Venezuela has faced since
   the discovery of oil.},

Abstract = {This article aims at understanding the challenges of tackling complex
   policy problems in multilevel governance. In order to better grasp the
   multilevel regulation of complex policy problems, it is needed to
   understand how uncertainty and scientific expertise are dealt with. We
   investigate this via the regulation of pandemics by the EU and the WHO,
   with the H1N1 pandemic of 2009 as critical case. The analysis of the
   multilevel practice reveals that the attitude toward uncertainty
   fundamentally differed between the global (WHO) and the European level.
   At the global level a classic speaking truth to power approach involved
   the denial of uncertainty, while at the EU level the assigned role of
   providing scientific expertise was interpreted as a necessity to openly
   communicate about uncertainty. While the global approach was heavily
   criticized, the uncertainty communication at the European level was much
   appreciated.
   La regulacion multinivel de problemas politicos complejos: La
   incertidumbre y la pandemia de gripe porcina Este articulo busca
   comprender los desafios de abordar problemas politicos complejos en la
   gobernanza multinivel. Para comprender mejor la regulacion multinivel de
   los problemas politicos complejos, es necesario comprender como se
   aborda la incertidumbre y la experiencia cientifica. Investigamos esto a
   traves de la regulacion de pandemias por parte de la UE y la OMS, con la
   pandemia H1N1 de 2009 como un caso critico. El analisis de las practicas
   multinivel revela que la actitud hacia la incertidumbre era
   fundamentalmente diferente entre el nivel global (OMS) y el nivel
   europeo. A nivel global un metodo de ``decir la verdad al poder{''}
   incluia la negacion de la incertidumbre, mientras que a nivel europeo el
   papel asignado de proporcionar experiencia cientifica se interpreto como
   algo necesario para comunicarse abiertamente acerca de la incertidumbre.
   Aunque la aproximacion global fue fuertemente criticada, la comunicacion
   de la incertidumbre a nivel europeo fue muy valorada.

Abstract = {Policy evaluation has grown significantly in the EU environmental sector
   since the 1990s. In identifying and exploring the putative drivers
   behind its rise - a desire to learn, a quest for greater accountability,
   and a wish to manipulate political opportunity structures - new ground
   is broken by examining how and why the existing literatures on these
   drivers have largely studied them in isolation. The complementarities
   and potential tensions between the three drivers are then addressed in
   order to advance existing research, drawing on emerging empirical
   examples in climate policy, a very dynamic area of evaluation activity
   in the EU. The conclusions suggest that future studies should explore
   the interactions between the three drivers to open up new and exciting
   research opportunities in order to comprehend contemporary environmental
   policy and politics in the EU.},

Abstract = {The growth of collaborative approaches to governance has resulted in
   increasingly complex policy and management landscapes, where actors are
   presented with ever-increasing numbers of decision-making venues they
   can participate in and actors they can collaborate with. Given that
   actors face constraints on their capacity to manage actor and venue
   relationships in such polycentric governance systems, we assume the
   marginal benefit of yet another relationship should begin to diminish at
   some level of engagement. Furthermore, we hypothesize that such capacity
   limitations are not static, but decrease as actors learn, develop
   skills, and formulate strategies for how to navigate complex polycentric
   systems more effectively. Drawing on the Ecology of Games framework,
   this article investigates two Swedish collaborative governance
   initiatives where a multitude of actors came together to address a range
   of different, but interrelated, policy issues and management tasks. The
   empirical findings suggest that actors' capacities to successfully
   navigate polycentric governance arrangements increase as they gain
   experience and develop their networking skills. Our findings imply there
   is a need to balance increased complexity in polycentric systems with
   increased capacity, otherwise the overall effect of an ever-increasing
   number of venues and actors could be collaborative fatigue and decreased
   abilities to address diverse governance challenges.},

Abstract = {Do different types of inequality spur violence with different targets?
   This article explores whom violent movements choose to target when they
   take to arms, by comparing civil conflicts, which target the state, to
   communal conflicts, which target other ethnic groups. Different types of
   ethnic group disadvantage relate to conflict through different
   mechanisms. Political exclusion is expected to promote the choice to
   target the central government rather than other ethnic groups, while
   economic disadvantages should increase the risk of both civil and
   communal conflicts. The different expectations stem from two important
   differences between political and economic horizontal inequalities: only
   the government has the authority to change the political distribution,
   while there can be many avenues to economic redistribution; and blame is
   more straightforwardly assigned to the government for political than for
   economic disadvantages. Statistical analysis of 155 politically relevant
   ethnic groups in Africa (1991-2009) provides support for both
   propositions.},

Abstract = {Scholars have found that terrorism can influence political behavior in
   democracies by affecting citizens' emotions such as anxiety and fear.
   However, researchers have yet to examine how terrorism affects vote
   choice cross-nationally. The few studies that have investigated
   terrorism's effect on vote choice have only examined single states
   through case study analysis. While informative, researchers lack an
   understanding regarding how terrorism influences vote choice
   cross-nationally based on the nature of terrorist attacks and the
   ideology of political parties. Thus, using a unique dataset that
   incorporates political party ideology, this study examines the effect
   the number and severity of terrorist attacks have on vote choice in
   legislative elections in 56 democracies from multiple regions and levels
   of development from 1975 to 2014. Preliminary results indicate that
   terrorist attacks are critical events that significantly affect vote
   choice in the democratic states included in this analysis.},

Abstract = {This article offers a method for systematically grading the quality of
   Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) videos based on technical
   production criteria. Using this method revealed moments when ISIS
   production capacity was severely debilitated (Fall 2015) and when they
   began to rebuild (Spring 2016), which the article details. Uses for this
   method include evaluating propaganda video output across time and across
   groups, and the ability to assess kinetic actions against propaganda
   organizations. This capacity will be critical as Islamic State media
   production teams will be pushed out of its territory as the State
   collapses.},

Title = {Polish Intelligentsia Totems in Elites' Struggles for Legitimization:
   The Case of Jerzy Giedroyc and Poland's Eastern Policy},
Journal = {EAST EUROPEAN POLITICS AND SOCIETIES},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {33},
Number = {1},
Pages = {66-88},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Jerzy Giedroyc-the founder and editor of the journal Kultura-has played
   an important symbolic role in Polish public debates, especially as an
   architect of post-communist Poland's policy toward its Eastern
   neighbors. At the same time, scholars and experts differ substantially
   in their assessments as to both the shape and influence of ``Giedroyc's
   line.{''} This article argues that in order to solve this puzzle,
   Giedroyc should be seen as an ``intelligentsia totem{''}-an instrument
   for the reproduction of Polish intelligentsia hegemony, and a source of
   legitimization for which various factions within the elite compete.
   Taking into account this distinctive role allows for a new assessment of
   the influence of Giedroyc's line on Poland's eastern policy. By
   integrating the totemic interpretation with an analysis of the changing
   shape of the Polish field of power and changing interpretations of what
   Giedroyc's line entailed, I argue that only some postulates of Giedroyc
   were implemented after 1989. Despite this, because of Giedroyc's
   legitimizing function as Kultura's editor, his role as an
   ``architect{''} of the eastern policy was seldom questioned. Only when
   the reconfiguration of the Polish field of power brought an end to
   consensus in the foreign policy realm did new diverging interpretations
   of Giedroyc's line emerge, legitimizing competing visions for Polish
   foreign policy. This article delivers a more nuanced view of the role
   Giedroyc played in post-communist Poland, thus explaining his criticism
   toward its foreign policy. It also sheds light on the legitimization
   mechanisms at work within the Polish elite.},

Abstract = {This paper reviews the various connections that can exist between the
   design of participatory processes and the different kind of results that
   they can entail. It details how effective participatory processes can be
   designed, whatever are the results that participation is deemed to
   elicit. It shows the main trends pertaining to design choicesand
   considers how to classify different arrangements in order to choose from
   among them. Then the paper deals with the main dilemmas that tend to
   arise when designing participatory processes. Thanks to this review, the
   paper argues that participatory processes tend to display a certain
   degree of ambivalence that cannot be completely overcome through the
   design choices.},

Abstract = {The Advocacy Coalition Framework (ACF) theorizes the causal mechanisms
   behind policy change, with a fundamental acknowledgement that such
   change cannot occur without advocates' skillful strategic actions.
   However, the framework does not fully explain what is needed for
   `boundedly rational' advocates to take skillful strategic actions within
   the context of their belief systems. This article proposes extricating
   the currently implicit concepts of process-oriented beliefs, learning,
   and information (i.e., what advocates believe, learn, and know about the
   policymaking process itself) to help fill this theoretical gap in the
   ACF. These concepts are investigated using a comparative case study of
   policy and process changes imposed by the European Union - via the
   Habitats Directive - onto rural actors in France and Sweden. The success
   of forestry advocates' strategic responses can be understood when using
   the ACF's implicit concepts of process beliefs, learning, and
   information.},

Abstract = {The porous external border around the Schengen member states of the
   European Union (EU) became a colossal political problem in 2015 and 2016
   as the migrant and Refugee Crisis unfolded. In Beetham's seminal
   terminology, there was a crisis between the EU's power and legitimacy on
   all three dimensions hereof: The Dublin regime was not followed, there
   was a gap between the beliefs of the governing and the subordinate
   peoples, and there were increasingly critical views among citizens and
   politicians alike (even from mainstream parties) against the inflow of
   refugees and migrants outside of the normal asylum system. The behaviour
   of the EU actors since then can be interpreted as an attempt at
   containing this crisis as regards Beetham's legitimacy dimensions.},

Abstract = {This article explores the development of shared understanding in the
   field of environmental sustainability in higher education-a field that
   began with social movement pressure surrounding contentious issues and
   evolved over decades into a settled field. The study defines and traces
   two distinct elements of shared understanding in this field: discursive
   coherence and discursive agreement. Discursive coherence is a shared
   understanding of which issues matter to a field. Discursive agreement
   concerns how much agreement there is among field actors regarding those
   issues. To trace these indicators, we utilize topic modeling alongside
   qualitative coding of a sample of messages from an online forum of
   conversations focused on the nascent field. We find that discursive
   coherence increases over time, but that coherent issues are also more
   likely to exhibit disagreement, indicating that more coherent issues are
   seen as more consequential, and therefore more `worthy of debate' in the
   nascent field.},

Abstract = {France was a great power, but that assertion should be explained through
   a story that must be grasped in all its complexity. First, France was a
   power at a time when that notion was still imbued with its full meaning.
   There is a certain synchrony between the central role played by this
   country since the end of the Middle Ages and the rise of the notion of
   power as an organizing principle of the international system. It is
   clear, however, that at the end of the First World War there was a break
   in France's international relations and its place in the concert of
   nations. This final chapter will discuss the notions of power and
   grandeur, European leadership, Gaullism, postcolonialism and the
   dilemmas and options of a mid-level power. The author then explores
   France's turnaround and neoconservatism, before questioning the
   country's capacity to step outside of itself and look beyond November
   13th.},

Abstract = {Two global voting trends are noted in the electoral studies literature:
   the exclusion of resident noncitizens and the inclusion of non-resident
   citizens in national elections. These two research streams are rarely
   studied together. By analysing both of these trends in the Commonwealth
   Caribbean, the article reveals how the assumed relationship between
   citizenship and the right to vote does not always hold. Citizenship is
   neither necessary nor sufficient to exercise full political rights. The
   Commonwealth Caribbean thus diverges from global voting trends and
   illustrates the complexities and changing shape of the relationship
   between citizenship and the right to vote.},

Abstract = {Public-private partnerships (PPPs) have become an essential vehicle for
   infrastructure development worldwide. Theoretical arguments primarily
   focus on build-operate-transfer (BOT) agreements as a canonical form of
   PPP, though they rarely discuss the political underpinnings of
   governments decisions to enter such agreements. How does a governments
   longevity, stability, and its capacity to raise revenue make BOTs more
   attractive than other types of partnerships? Extending recent
   theoretical advances through concepts of control rights and veto players
   and statistically analyzing a database of more than 4,300 PPP agreements
   for new construction of infrastructure in 83 developing economies
   between 1990 and 2014, I provide the first large-scale quantitative
   evidence of the influence of political institutions on government
   choices to adopt BOTs. I find that BOTs are less attractive as the
   tenure of the longest-serving veto player increases, when veto players
   are more frequently replaced, and when governments can generate more tax
   revenue, but more likely when that revenue is above a countrys historic
   average. My findings contribute to literatures on distributive public
   policy, hybrid governance, complex project management, and to the policy
   debate about the role of PPPs in economic development.},

Abstract = {This article examines the current crossroads facing MERCOSUR and the
   consequences of the recent political changes in Brazil, in terms of a
   shift from the integrationist paradigm to the adoption of a more
   ``commercial-liberalist{''} profile. Two research questions are posed in
   the article. To what extent do the most recent directions taken by the
   MERCOSUR bloc imply a real change to its integrationist model? How much
   has the political change effected since 2016 in Brazil affected the
   course of the regional bloc? To answer these questions, the article
   undertakes the following analysis: 1) an engagement with the most recent
   academic discussions on both subjects; 2) a necessarily brief and
   provisional examination of the turn taken by Brazil's foreign policy in
   recent years; 3) an evaluation of the consequences of these changes in
   Brazil for the evolution of the MERCOSUR process in the short and medium
   terms.},

Abstract = {This study examines the Argentine worker-recuperated businesses movement
   during the economic crisis of the late 1990s and early 2000s-wherein
   workers preserved their jobs by taking control of failed businesses and
   managing them cooperatively-to understand how social movement activism
   spills over to work organizations. It is proposed that the cultural
   frames and tactics produced by other collective action campaigns
   provided the cultural tools that facilitated the recuperation of failed
   businesses by employees; time-series analyses test for the effect of
   collective action legacies (e.g. past labor protests involving workers'
   occupation of businesses) and contemporaneous movement spillover (e.g.
   state-oriented `piquetero' activism among unemployed workers) on yearly
   counts of worker-recuperated businesses. The findings carry implications
   for understanding the pathways by which social movement activism
   influences mobilizations within work organizations.},

Title = {Complaints on abortuses handling: policy recommendations for Hong Kong},
Journal = {PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION AND POLICY-AN ASIA-PACIFIC JOURNAL},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {22},
Number = {1},
Pages = {71-81},
Abstract = {Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to review cases about complaints
   of abortuses handling in Hong Kong, and to further propose policy
   recommendations to help comfort parents with respect and dignity toward
   abortuses.
   Design/methodology/approach - There is a systematic review of
   articles/newspapers related to the practice and regulation of abortuses
   handling in Hong Kong and overseas countries. Also, point of views among
   stakeholders are selected from: newspapers, patients' groups, Hong Kong
   SAR Government's websites, radio programmes' interviews, related
   organizations' websites, blogs from legislative councilors and lawyers.
   Findings - Since parents suffered from miscarriage before 24 weeks'
   pregnancy are increasingly willing to share their experiences and
   struggled for arranging a legal funeral for their children, Hong Kong
   SAR Government is able to understand these parents' needs and hence set
   up more ``Angel Garden{''} in both the public and the private
   cemeteries. Yet, the provision of funeral and cremation services are
   still not comprehensive. Existing measures from Mainland China and
   overseas countries to handle abortuses and to provide support for
   parents are analyzed. More critically, ethical concern on handling
   abortuses as one of the clinical wastes is further included in the
   discussion.
   Originality/value - Although all less than 24 weeks' fetuses cannot be
   given any Certificate of Stillbirth, respect and dignity can still be
   presented toward their parents by flexible regulation. After discussing
   the related measures on handling abortuses from other countries, some of
   their humane regulations are feasible to be applied to Hong Kong.},

Abstract = {Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to identify and understand the
   dynamics among perceptual gap of work environment between a supervisor
   and subordinates; personal psychological capital; self-directed behavior
   in a non-Western manufacturing work context.
   Design/methodology/approach - This study investigated 288 dyadic
   relationships between supervisors and subordinates from 43 technical
   teams that came from six different large automotive part manufacturing
   companies in South Korea. Sobel test technique was mainly used to
   examine the effects of the perceptual difference of work environment.
   Findings - The results indicated that the supervisor's perceptual gap of
   work environment from subordinates had a negative association with their
   self-directed behavior, B = 0.233, SE = 0.103, p = 0.023. On the other
   hand, the negative effect of supervisor's perceptual gap showed the
   competitive mediation effect through an indirect path to the positive
   psychological capital (PsyCap), Sobel B = 0.126, SE = 0.061, p = 0.037.
   This finding showed that providing a high level of autonomous work
   environment is not sufficient to get employees to show a high level of
   self-directed behavior if the perceptual gap is not well managed.
   Originality/value - Adding to the existing research that studies
   self-directed behavior or proactive behavior in the Western high-tech or
   service work context, this study extended our understanding about the
   impact of the perceptual gap of work environment in the hierarchical and
   highly standardized non-Western manufacturing context.},

Abstract = {After Rafael Correa's 2006 presidential election in Ecuador the
   governing party of Correa's Citizens' Revolution, Alianza PAIS,
   consolidated political power by undertaking an unprecedented process of
   state building in the country's chronically fragmented polity. An
   analysis of the political and economic strategies it employed emphasizes
   their mutually reinforcing dynamic. The Alianza PAIS was a
   ``big-tent{''} party with a vanguard of figures from the traditional
   political left that relied on brokerage with traditional political
   bosses at the regional and local levels to achieve political party
   nationalization. The Correa government was able to consolidate political
   power because it upheld its initial electoral commitment to abandon
   orthodox neoliberalism, rebuild the state, and advance social
   citizenship. The division between Correa and Lenin Moreno after the
   April 2017 elections and the subsequent implosion of Alianza PAIS put
   the legacy of the Citizens' Revolution at risk.},

Abstract = {The governments of Hugo Chavez and Nicolas Maduro responded to the
   opposition's attempts at regime change by implementing pragmatic
   policies favoring businesspeople who refused to participate in
   destabilization actions, as well as populist social measures benefiting
   the nonprivileged. Both sets of policies have to be placed in political
   context. The characterization of allegedly pro-government businesspeople
   as a new ruling elite referred to as the boliburguesia fails to take
   into account the sharp tensions between them and the Chavista
   leadership. The primary importance of social programs in the Chavista
   political triumphs over an extended period of time and of the periodic
   initiatives that sparked life into individual programs implicitly rules
   out claims regarding the government's failure to alleviate poverty or
   achieve other social objectives. The Chavista governments failed to take
   full advantage of favorable periods and junctures when the opposition
   was demoralized following defeats in order to correct the negative side
   effects of pragmatic and populist class policies, such as
   bureaucratization and crony capitalism.},

Journal = {GLOBAL POLICY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {10},
Number = {1, SI},
Pages = {83-95},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {This paper examines the processes of formulation of UN Sustainable
   Development Goal 12 (SDG 12) - `Ensure Sustainable Consumption and
   Production Patterns' - and its targets and indicators. We argue that
   business interests have steered its narrative of sustainable growth. The
   outcome of the SDG 12 negotiations reflects a production- and
   design-centered perspective that emerged in the 1990s and has a
   business-friendly regulatory approach and faith in solutions through new
   technologies. We show how the targets and indicators emerged in debates
   between national governments, UN agencies, civil society and private
   sector organizations - and how they reflect both the political process
   and technical and practical considerations in translation of a broad
   concept into the SDG format. While the emergence of SDG 12 as a
   standalone goal stems from a push by developing countries to build
   pressure on developed countries, and its presence may open space for
   attention to this area in the future, many of its targets were watered
   down and left vague. The indicators to measure progress on the targets
   further narrow the scope and ambition of Goal 12, whose current content
   does not adequately reflect earlier more transformative
   conceptualizations of Sustainable Consumption and Production.},

Abstract = {Dale K. Van Kley's oeuvre has established that Jansenism's fragmented
   legacies still constituted a major political force in the
   pre-Revolutionary crisis of 1786-1789 and, during the Revolution itself,
   in the making of the Civil Constitution of the Clergy. This essay argues
   that, in one crucial respect, the influence of parlementary-Jansenist
   constitutionalism as a separate ideological front in the ``Revolutionary
   synthesis{''} was more significant in the pre-Revolutionary ideological
   conflict than even Van Kley has supposed. This essay further argues that
   Jansenists invented a distinctly Jansenist version of the ``general
   will{''} that, with Rousseau's and other variants, was integral to
   Revolutionary political culture.},

Abstract = {Interregionalism has been increasingly used to advance cooperation on
   regional and global security challenges. This study examines three
   interregional dialogues comprising East Asia, Europe, and Latin America.
   Each interregional security agenda reflects specific concerns and
   different evolving paths. Insights from `multilateral security
   governance' approaches can reinforce the analysis of how security
   agendas emerge and change, and how their related norms and practices
   evolve.},

Journal = {POLICY STUDIES},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {40},
Number = {3-4, SI},
Pages = {287-302},
Abstract = {The policy advice literature has paid little attention to the role of
   international organizations in policy advisory systems. This article
   offers a systematic analysis of policy advice provided by the
   International Monetary Fund (IMF) in the framework of the IMF's regular
   Article IV consultations. The article argues that the content of IMF
   advice differs according to the income of the advised countries. Content
   analyses of the Article IV consultation reports of 18 countries show
   correlations between the gross national income (GNI) of the advised
   countries and the function of advice in the policy cycle, the
   specificity of advice, the recommended policy instruments and the
   targeted policy issues. Results show that the IMF rather points to
   policy problems, advices on policy goals and focuses on improving
   implementation when advising lower income countries. When advising
   higher income countries, the IMF's advice focuses on means and specific
   policy tools.},

   multinational military operations},
Journal = {CONTEMPORARY SECURITY POLICY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {40},
Number = {1},
Pages = {70-84},
Abstract = {There is a growing consensus that multinational military operations are
   often less effective than the theoretical sum of their constitutive
   parts. Multiple chains of command, restriction on intelligence sharing,
   and capability aggregation problems can reduce fighting power. However,
   partners may be necessary to provide legitimacy to an intervention. As
   such, most studies assume that the state leading a coalition (usually
   the United States) has to accept a degree of operational ineffectiveness
   in order to gain political benefits from the participation of junior
   partners to a multinational military operation. However, such analysis
   puts all junior partners under the same category, without taking into
   account the differentiated contributions of those junior partners based
   on their relative military power and international status. This article
   explores variation between the junior partners' contributions and their
   impact on coalition political and military dynamics. It teases out the
   implications of adopting a fine-grained analysis of junior partners.},

Pages = {91-107},
Abstract = {The premise of this article is that when comparing governance systems, a
   greater focus on the complexity of the environment facing nation states
   would provide a step forward. National regimes should not be compared in
   a vacuum but rather with respect to the governance challenges they are
   likely to face in an unpredictable world. It is necessary to recognize
   the adaptive complexity of the systems generating those challenges and
   yet how they also providing the ingredients for emergent solutions. It
   is argued that exploring interactive capacity rather than formal
   structures will provide a stronger indication of whether governance
   challenges are likely to be met. It is concluded that different types of
   national regimes could, in principle, deliver effective interactive
   governance capacity in different ways, but each can generate tipping
   points that could lead to failure.},

   are constructed and performed. Within this analysis, the article puts
   focus on the performative aspect of these narratives. These narratives
   alongside the citation of Qur'anic verses (ayahs) and hadiths create a

Abstract = {This essay uncovers the history of the anti-Jesuit ordinances of 1828 by
   looking at the ways in which Jansenist writers employed arguments that
   divided the conservative coalition in Restoration France. Jansenists
   constructed histories of the Jesuits that implicated them in the causes
   of the Revolution and in so doing invented an anti-Jesuit narrative that
   appealed to conservative sensibilities. Their arguments and the
   reactions against them within other strands of the conservative
   coalition reveal how nineteenth-century conservatism comprised a diverse
   spectrum of religious and political positions each with its own
   historical memories and agendas. Much like the Catholic Church of the
   eighteenth century, the nineteenth-century conservative alliance
   contained certain internal tensions that ignited most violently in
   issues of religious politics.},

Abstract = {The genocide perpetrated by the Khmer Rouge between 1975 and 1979
   appears as one of the most totalitarian manifestations of political
   violence in the 20th century. This article explores the ideological
   framework constructed by the Khmer Rouge, and looks into whether and how
   this influences and motivates individual low-level cadres in their
   participation. Our findings show that toxification as a genocidal
   ideology was present in the Khmer Rouge discourse, and provided a lens
   of legitimacy for individuals to engage in acts of violence. But such a
   genocidal ideology was not a motivating factor for individual
   perpetrators in the Cambodian genocide. This research forwards the
   comparative investigation of the Khmer Rouge genocide in Cambodia as an
   important case of genocide, both at the societal and individual levels,
   as well as the general study of toxification as a genocidal ideology.},

   campaigns on the topic of immigration policy. Concerns and fears
   regarding national security got loaded onto the topic of immigration.
   This issue was Donald Trump's featured platform on the campaign trail.
   This chapter examines the policy issues of immigration and national
   security as they got entrenched in the politics of fear and xenophobia,
   but operationalized in very different ways. The survey questions
   pertaining to military and security pivoted away from Iraq and
   Afghanistan to focus on Southeast Asia and China. The analysis here
   looks at voters' candidate affect response toward both Donald Trump and
   Hillary Clinton and how it affected appraisals of immigration and
   national security in 2016.},

Abstract = {Unionism, an allied, albeit subordinate, force in the
   neodevelopmentalist political front of the governments of Lula da Silva
   and Dilma Rousseff, was relatively absent from the mobilizations against
   or in favor of Dilma's impeachment compared with other social movements
   and sought to resist and, in a way, realign itself to counter the
   counterreforms of Michel Temer's government. Although union and popular
   demonstrations have multiplied, the absence of a unified strategy in the
   face of the coup and the reforms have weakened the possibilities of
   union resistance, and losses for workers have accumulated. O
   sindicalismo foi uma forca aliada, ainda que subordinada, na frente
   politica neodesenvolvimentista dos governos de Lula da Silva e Dilma
   Rousseff, foi uma forca politica relativamente ausente nas mobilizacoes
   contra ou a favor do impeachment de Dilma, se comparado a outros
   movimentos sociais e tem procurado resistir e, de certo modo, se
   realinhar, para enfrentar as contrarreformas do governo de Michel Temer.
   No entanto, apesar de as manifestacoes sindicais e populares terem se
   multiplicado, a ausencia de uma estrategia unificada diante do golpe e
   das reformas fragilizou as possibilidades de resistencia sindical e as
   perdas para os trabalhadores tem se acumulado.},

Abstract = {Central and Eastern Europe is the last world region to transition
   towards democracy. Today, it shows alarming signs of de-consolidation,
   most prominently in Hungary, Poland, and Serbia. This article assesses
   whether these observations form part of a systematic pattern across the
   region. It relies on newly-updated objective data from the Democracy
   Barometer for the period between 1990 and 2016. It revisits evidence for
   the three most prominent explanations of democratic backsliding in the
   region: the rise of populist parties, the incapacity of the European
   Union to secure democracy once pre-accession incentives weaken, and the
   global financial crisis.},

Abstract = {Systemist international relations (SIR) is put forward as a potential
   solution to short- and long-term problems faced by the discipline of
   international relations (IR). SIR responds to the immediate difficulties
   that stem from an impasse between advocates of analytic eclecticism and
   skeptics who prefer paradigmatic research. The more sustained challenges
   posed by the size and complexity of IR also can be met through
   implementation of SIR, which entails a graphic turn. Along those lines,
   the Visual International Relations Project (VIRP) is creating an archive
   of one-page graphic summaries for cause and effect as conveyed in
   respective publications. The VIRP aims toward an improved state of
   communication in the field based on such visual representations.},

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL POLITICS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {57},
Number = {6, SI},
Pages = {1012-1029},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {This article contributes to the growing scholarship on the relationship
   between political memory and foreign policy by analyzing how physical
   sites of traumatic memory serve as locations of foreign policy
   construction. Specifically, I explore how physical sites (such as
   concentration camps, killing sites, or memorials) serve to construct
   foreign policy through the enduring meaning they have as material
   reminders of collective trauma. I illustrate the argument with a case
   study of Jasenovac, the commemorative site of the largest concentration
   camp administered by the Independent State of Croatia during World War
   II. The Jasenovac site is a particularly useful case for my argument
   because it is a site of contested memory and conflicting national
   narratives. Most significantly, it is the site of production of three
   distinct foreign policies-of Serbia, Croatia, and Bosnia's Republika
   Srpska-which all use the Jasenovac site to pursue very different and
   mutually exclusive foreign policy claims.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS AND DEVELOPMENT},

Number = {1},
Pages = {27-50},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Global surveys indicate that massive disillusionment with economic
   globalisation, upheld by the liberal order, which is ignored by
   governments in European, Asian and Latin American countries, has paved
   the way for the ascent of nationalist forces. This trend is also visible
   in Indonesia. President Joko Widodo (Jokowi) has consolidated power
   against opponents who exploit nationalist, populist and religious
   causes. On the international front, Jakarta has been actively engaged
   within a variety of multilateral organisations where liberal
   institutionalist agendas are enforced. Therefore, it is worthwhile
   considering the influence of internal and external environments on
   Jokowi's economic policy which is getting increasingly nationalistic.
   This article argues that nationalist economic practices have emerged as
   the Jokowi government's response to domestic and international
   challenges which can have an impact on its perceived legitimacy. The
   discussion proceeds in five steps. To begin, this article presents a
   comparative perspective to understand the position of Indonesia in the
   developing international political economic context. This is followed by
   an overview of the definition of economic nationalism and its
   connections to domestic politics and foreign relations. The third
   section is about the Indonesian government's efforts to put economic
   nationalism into effect. The next two parts investigate how the inside
   and outside dynamics generate Jokowi's inward-looking policies. The
   conclusion emphasises what can be learnt from the Indonesian case.},

Abstract = {Although just under half of all coup d'etat attempts involve fatalities,
   there has been surprisingly little attention to the conditions under
   which coups turn violent. Existing research emphasizes the incentives
   coup plotters have to avoid bloodshed but does not explain the
   conditions under which violence nonetheless occurs. This article
   develops a theoretical framework that predicts that the extent of
   violence that occurs during coup attempts will vary systematically with
   central features of incumbent regimes and coup plotters. It then tests
   these predictions using new data on the fatalities associated with 377
   coup attempts between 1950 and 2017. Coups against military regimes are
   found to be less violent than those against civilian dictatorships. This
   is because military rulers are better able to estimate the likelihood of
   the coup succeeding and more sensitive to the costs associated with
   using violence to suppress a coup. Since their post-coup fates tend to
   be better than those of other authoritarian leaders, they also have
   fewer incentives to hang on to power at any cost. The analysis also
   demonstrates that coups led by senior officers involve less bloodshed
   than those by junior officers and enlisted men. However, coups against
   rulers that counterbalance their militaries are no more violent than
   those against rulers that do not. The results shed new light on the
   dynamics of coup attempts.},

Abstract = {In the early stage of the United Nations, Pengchun Chang (P. C. Chang),
   the outstanding Chinese representative, participated in the drafting of
   the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) and made prominent
   contributions in global governance. This article attempts to use
   triangulations to analyze and discuss the significant role played by
   Chang in constructing the international human rights system by employing
   literature studies, empirical studies and a case study. It is believed
   that it was not accidental for Chang to make such contributions to
   international human rights, and his cleverness and wisdom benefited from
   both the excellent traditional Chinese culture and the Western
   philosophies and essentials of his Western education.},

Abstract = {Do finite time horizons constrain a legislature's ability to control the
   bureaucracy? I argue that legislators subject to legislative term limits
   enact legislation with less statutory discretion today to ensure that
   their preferences are implemented by the bureaucracy tomorrow since most
   legislators will not be around to monitor the bureaucracy over the long
   term. Although past works suggest that legislative term limits decrease
   legislatures' rate of bureaucratic oversight, I find that term-limited
   legislatures use ex ante means of bureaucratic control to a greater
   extent by granting less statutory discretion to the bureaucracy.},

   sovereignty games},
Journal = {COOPERATION AND CONFLICT},
Year = {2020},

Abstract = {Greenland representatives successfully use the renewed international
   geostrategic interest in the Arctic to enhance Greenland's foreign
   policy sovereignty. This is facilitated by Denmark's dependence on
   Greenland's geographic location and continuous membership of the Danish
   Realm for maintaining the status of an Arctic state, which recently has
   become one of the five most important security and foreign policy
   priorities. The dependency gives Greenland an `Arctic advantage' in
   negotiations with Denmark, while turning circumpolar events into
   strategic arenas for sovereignty games in the aim to move the boundary
   of what Greenland may do internationally without Danish involvement.
   This article analyzes how these games unfold in the Arctic Council, at
   the high-level Ilulissat meetings and at circumpolar conferences where
   Greenland representatives articulate, act and appear more foreign policy
   sovereignty through outspoken discontent, tacit gestures and symbolic
   alterations. Altogether, this contributes to the expanding of
   Greenland's foreign policy room for maneuver within the current legal
   frameworks, while enhancing Greenland's international status and
   attracting external investments, important in their striving towards
   becoming a state with full formal Westphalian sovereignty.},

Abstract = {Drawing on forty in-depth interviews with program managers in nineteen
   Western international human rights organizations, this article examines
   how human rights organizations make decisions about how to allocate
   resources and how to manage their commitments to specific causes,
   specific people, and specific areas. It argues that organizational
   routines shape the allocation of resources relatively independently of
   other factors and it pays particular attention to the role played by
   intra-organizational ``units{''} of work and planning. Units of work and
   planning function as candidates for the allocation of resources within
   organizations. Resources are not allocated directly to issues or causes
   but rather are distributed on the one hand among a set of range of
   practices, such as reports and campaigns, and ways of responding, which
   are considered legitimate, and on the other hand among the thematic and
   geographical units, which structure human rights organizations. The
   article concludes by discussing some factors that play a role in the
   selection among these units. As human rights workers consider where
   their organizations can make a difference, other organizations and
   conditions for their work come into view, levers matter, and the way
   making a difference can be demonstrated plays a role.},

Abstract = {This article explores the extent to which Moscow?s modus operandi during
   the military campaign in Syria demonstrates change or continuity in
   Russian strategic culture. It discusses five main characteristics of the
   Russian conduct and argues that these traits demonstrate more continuity
   than change in the Russian style of war. However, it suggests that
   change possibly might be evolving on the tactical-operational level ?
   the emergence of a mission command culture. The article offers competing
   explanations for this eventuality, which the Syrian campaign has
   highlighted, and advances a conceptual debate in IR on the shifts in
   strategic culture.},

Abstract = {The literature has found that regulatory networks foster exchange of
   information between regulators, but failed to specify the mechanism
   whereby regulators network for expertise. This paper posits that
   informal networks constitute a compensatory mechanism for lacking
   resources. The hypothesis guiding analysis is that lower resources
   (operationalised as staff resources) are associated with higher network
   activism (operationalised as a higher proportion of outgoing ties),
   particularly for regulators with intermediate levels of resources, for
   whom the benefits of networking are most likely to outweigh the costs. I
   test this hypothesis in the empirical case of European national energy
   regulators, using recent and original data on their bilateral
   collaboration ties. The results of the statistical analysis lend support
   to the hypothesis. The results suggest that the interdependence
   engendered by the European Union improves European regulatory governance
   by improving national regulatory practice, more than would be possible
   on the basis of national resources alone.},

Abstract = {This paper sheds light on the issue of political representation in an
   authoritarian context, taking China as a case study. In the academic
   literature, the concept of political representation is primarily related
   to mechanisms of representation in a democratic setting, used in a
   rather technical or normative sense and concerned with institutionalized
   representation in legislatures and parliaments, with a strong focus on
   elections by which citizens express their political will. The conviction
   prevails that only persons elected in a competitive electoral procedure
   can be conceived as legitimate representatives. Widely lacking in the
   scholarly literature are approaches which explain the nature of
   political representation in a non-democratic setting. To date, patterns
   of formal and informal representation in an authoritarian context
   constitute a `black hole' in the literature on representation. This
   article tries to answer two research questions: (1) How does
   representation in an authoritarian system work? (2) What can we conclude
   from the Chinese case with regard to representation in an authoritarian
   setting? The article first conceptualizes representation in an
   authoritarian setting. Second, it examines which mechanisms of
   representation and representative claims exist in China. Third, it
   distinguishes between five mechanisms of political representation:
   formal, informal, symbolic, traditional and digital. It is argued that
   informal patterns of representation are crucial since formal ones are
   more strictly controlled. A new and specific role is played by `digital
   representation': a vigorous form of representation via the cyberspace,
   spawning new and innovative modes of formal, informal and symbolic
   political representation. In the conclusions, the author considers what
   his findings regarding the Chinese case mean for the concept of
   representation in authoritarian states. He also explains why
   representation in an autocratic context can produce political output and
   exhibit legitimacy among the represented.},

Abstract = {Modern clientelist exchange is typically carried out by
   intermediaries-party activists, employers, local strongmen, traditional
   leaders, and the like. Politicians use such brokers to mobilize voters,
   yet little about their relative effectiveness is known. The authors
   argue that broker effectiveness depends on their leverage over clients
   and their ability to monitor voters. They apply their theoretical
   framework to compare two of the most common brokers worldwide, party
   activists and employers, arguing the latter enjoy numerous advantages
   along both dimensions. Using survey-based framing experiments in
   Venezuela and Russia, the authors find voters respond more strongly to
   turnout appeals from employers than from party activists. To demonstrate
   mechanisms, the article shows that vulnerability to job loss and
   embeddedness in workplace social networks make voters more responsive to
   clientelist mobilization by their bosses. The results shed light on the
   conditions most conducive to effective clientelism and highlight broker
   type as important for understanding why clientelism is prevalent in some
   countries but not others.},

Title = {Strategic Communication and the Integrative Complexity-Ideology
   Relationship: Meta-Analytic Findings Reveal Differences Between Public

Abstract = {Research on the relationship between political conservatism and
   integrative complexity has yielded contradictory results, and little
   effort has been made to place these mixed results in a theoretical
   context. The present article considers this issue through a strategic
   model of language that suggests different psychological processes apply
   to public politicians versus private citizens. We use a methodologically
   precise meta-analytic test of the relationship between political
   ideology and integrative complexity to examine the degree that
   conservative simplicity can be understood as a function of public versus
   private samples. Across 35 studies, findings revealed that conservatives
   are significantly less complex than liberals overall; however, while
   this effect was significant for public politicians, no relationship
   emerged for private citizens. Consistent with a strategic model,
   conservative simplicity was particularly in evidence for elected
   officials. This theoretical analysis has many consequences for our
   understanding of psychological theories that help explain the
   consequences of political ideology.},

Abstract = {The paper analyzes the constitutional and legal foundations of local
   self-government in Serbia. The long-awaited reform of local
   self-government had two aspects: the correction of technical errors and
   alignment with the amendments to other laws, as well as the adoption of
   amendments related to the essence of local self-government. The second
   aspect mainly covered four issues: the competencies of local
   self-government, local self-government bodies, the position of the local
   community and the cooperation between units of local self-government.
   This reform, however, did not meet expectations, as it did not
   adequately solve any of the five key problems of local self-government
   in Serbia.},

Abstract = {Local elections are elections of local self-government authorities
   established on the basis of exercise of the universal right to vote. The
   right to vote as a fundamental political right must be provided with
   relevant legal protection. Applicable to both national and local
   elections, voters' confidence in fairness of the electoral process and
   authenticity of election results are the foundation of the legitimacy of
   elections. A common requirement for electoral dispute system in
   countries, enforcing the rule of law, is that is supports credibility of
   the election process. This article looks into the legal nature of local
   electoral disputes in the Republic of Slovenia and investigates whether
   local electoral disputes are in their legal nature constitutional,
   administrative or sui generis court disputes. The characteristics of
   local electoral disputes are analysed on the basis of the following
   methods of scientific knowledge: logical (analysis, synthesis,
   induction, deduction), historical, systemic, and formally dogmatic. The
   author establishes the hypothesis of not one, but multiple forms of
   local electoral dispute, all of which differ significantly, their legal
   nature being essentially different as well. The article also, in this
   regard, considers constitutionality of Slovenian legal arrangement of
   individual forms of local electoral dispute.},

Abstract = {As a subregion with huge unmet needs for physical infrastructure, South
   Asian countries welcomed the establishment of the Asian Infrastructure
   Investment Bank (AIIB) as a new multilateral development bank (MDB) to
   help close some of their financing gaps. Not only were the South Asian
   countries among the founding members of the new bank, they have also
   emerged as its important borrowers. Starting operations in January 2016,
   AIIB has had only three years of operations. Three years is not a long
   time for evolution of an MDB from scratch, but it can give an indication
   of the shape of things to come. This note briefly reviews AIIB's
   operations in South Asia, a subregion facing some of the widest gaps in
   providing sustainable and resilient infrastructure to all its people as
   enunciated in the 2030 Agenda on Sustainable Development.},

Abstract = {Regional organisations in Africa have not managed to form coherent
   coalitions while negotiating about Economic Partnership Agreements
   (EPAs) with the European Union (EU). Either the membership of EPA groups
   is not congruent with the membership of existing regional organisations,
   or crucial member states refuse to sign the EPAs and put their regions'
   unity at risk. We argue that these problems are due to the
   differentiated trade rules of the EU, which privilege some trade
   partners and some commodity exports over others. Large African
   countries, which enjoy privileged access to the European market, do not
   have incentives to implement the unpopular EPAs, which are based on
   reciprocal trade liberalisation. As a result, they obstruct the
   negotiation process or refuse to implement the EPAs. This mechanism is
   illustrated at the examples of the East African Community (EAC), the
   Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) and the Southern
   African Development Community (SADC).},

Abstract = {This article argues that political competition determines how and when
   elected politicians can reduce police autonomy. While bureaucratic
   autonomy is generally lauded in developed democracies, it can result in
   serious malfeasance in contexts of institutional weakness. Political
   incumbents may reduce police autonomy through different means and for
   various purposes. While some politicians seek to professionalize police
   forces and align them with the rule of law, others aspire to politicize
   police to appropriate its rents from corruption. This article shows that
   lack of rotation in office (low political turnover) increases
   politicians' control of police, while under low turnover, fragmentation
   in cabinets and the legislature influences whether politicians seek to
   professionalize or politicize the force. The article illustrates this
   theory with a subnational comparison of Rio de Janeiro (Brazil) and
   Santa Fe (Argentina), relying on 80 interviews with police and
   politicians.},

Volume = {54},
Number = {3},

Abstract = {The regional roles external actors play, such as `China's role in
   Africa' or `the US role in East Asia', have long been popular subjects
   of analysis in the international relations literature. Yet, the
   emergence and evolution of these roles remains remarkably
   under-theorized. While some `new regionalist' scholars have discussed
   the dynamics of an external actor's regional involvement by referring to
   the concepts of `penetration' and `socialization', neither concept, this
   article argues, is sufficiently equipped to capture how external actors
   come to aspire and realize their regional roles. To address this
   shortcoming, the article employs an interactionist role theory
   perspective, which draws on the work of social psychologist George
   Herbert Mead. In following this perspective, the article argues that
   external actors develop regional role aspirations as they draw on their
   creativity and reflexivity to overcome experienced uncertainties. To
   realize these aspirations, the article suggests, external actors seek to
   cast significant others into corresponding roles. Alter-casting, the
   article argues in this context, is critical for understanding the
   (re)constitution of an external actor's regional role, and thus a
   region's social structure.},

Abstract = {How do hierarchical cores or metropoles legitimate their influence or
   rule? How do their approaches to legitimation inform resistance? This
   theory note rethinks how legitimation operates in hierarchies, with a
   focus on variation in cores' legitimation strategies. I argue that
   varying claims to hierarchical legitimacy shape both action at the core
   and resistance at the periphery. I develop a four-part typology of
   legitimation strategies, differentiated along two axes. On the first,
   cores may be universalist, recognizing no legitimate equals, or
   competitive, recognizing other cores as peer rivals. On the second, they
   may chiefly innovate legitimacy claims internally, drawing them from
   their own political traditions, or externally, borrowing the claims of
   others. These strategies shape available options for revisionism by
   rivals and resistance by hierarchical subordinates. I illustrate with
   historical examples.},

Title = {What Political Settings Promote Renewable Energy Investments by Energy
   Utilities?-A Qualitative Comparative Analysis in Swiss Cantons},

Abstract = {Investment decisions by power utilities significantly shape sustainable
   energy systems. While it is known that different political factors
   influence investment decisions, the interaction of these factors remains
   unclear. Using a fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis of 22 cases
   in 19 Swiss cantons, this study analyses which combinations of political
   conditions promote investment decisions by utilities in renewable
   energies. The analysis reveals the significance of different
   combinations of political conditions. High investments in renewable
   energies can be explained above all by political settings in which high
   administrative capacity is linked to ambitious policy goals, to the
   considerable power of a parliamentary pro-ecology coalition or to
   non-privatized utilities. The results support other findings on the
   importance of complex governance settings with hierarchical elements.
   They raise further questions about the precise mechanisms that mediate
   between political conditions and investment decisions of energy
   utilities, and the role of public administrations in this respect.

   Que entornos politicos promueven inversiones en energia renovable por
   parte de los servicios publicos de energia? Las decisiones de inversion
   de las empresas de energia dan forma a los sistemas de energia
   sostenible. Si bien se sabe que diferentes factores politicos influyen
   en las decisiones de inversion, la interaccion de estos factores sigue
   sin estar clara. Utilizando un analisis comparativo cualitativo de
   conjuntos difusos de 22 casos en 19 cantones suizos, este estudio
   analiza que combinaciones de condiciones politicas promueven las
   decisiones de inversion de las empresas de servicios publicos en
   energias renovables. El analisis revela la importancia de diferentes
   combinaciones de condiciones politicas. Las altas inversiones en
   energias renovables pueden explicarse sobre todo por entornos politicos
   en los que una alta capacidad administrativa esta vinculada a objetivos
   politicos ambiciosos, al considerable poder de una coalicion
   parlamentaria pro-ecologia o a empresas de servicios publicos no
   privatizadas. Los resultados apoyan otros hallazgos acerca de la
   importancia de entornos politicos complejos con elementos jerarquicos.
   Plantean mas preguntas sobre los mecanismos precisos que median entre
   las condiciones politicas y las decisiones de inversion de las empresas
   de energia, y el papel de las administraciones publicas frente a este
   tema.},

Abstract = {This study explores the impact of the configuration of performance
   information on citizens' perceptions regarding the impact of the
   information on their lives and the reliability they assign to it. We
   conducted a survey experiment among a representative sample of the
   Israeli population. The treatment included the object being measured,
   the identity of those who manage the performance management mechanism,
   and the trend of the results. We also compared the education and police
   sectors. Our findings indicate that, overall, citizens feel that
   performance information has only a low-to-medium effect on their lives,
   and assign a similar level of reliability to that information. The
   configuration of performance information helps explain this perceived
   impact only to a limited extent. These findings question the usefulness
   of performance reporting mechanisms as a major tool for strengthening
   accountability and raise serious doubts about the possible ways to
   improve these mechanisms and make them more effective.},

Abstract = {This article evaluates the political dynamics of the 2014 presidential
   election to explore the sense of nationhood that could have formed in
   post-2001 Afghanistan and to gauge its strength. It examines frontrunner
   candidates - Mohammad Ashraf Ghani and Abdullah Abdullah's - campaign
   rhetoric and processes they utilized to manipulate ethnic identities for
   political ends. Ethnic identities sharpened by ideological and political
   polarisation during the civil war (1978-2001), continue to play a
   critical part in the political economy dynamics of post-2001 era. With
   the popular patriotic idea of citizenship remaining weak, the abundance
   of ethnic identities provides a paradigm around which power contenders
   articulate messages that easily feed into popular perceptions of
   ``us{''} and ``other{''}. The article contextualizes representative and
   consociational democracy exploring whether these models of democracy
   offer any solution to social cleavages in Afghanistan. It argues that
   elites' manipulation of ethnic identities and distribution of resources
   through ethnic shares (Bonn Conference 2001, National Unity Government
   (NUG) 2014) might reinforce ethnic boundaries, leading to deeper
   consolidation of ethnic divisions.},

Abstract = {This article unveils the policy agenda of the European Central Bank
   (ECB) Governing Council as found in the speeches that Governing Council
   Members gave between 1999 and 2018. Using a dynamic topic-modeling
   approached based on non-negative matrix factorization, we demonstrate
   how the issues discussed by ECB Governing Council members have evolved
   over time, and how the general punctuation hypothesis (Jones, B. D. \&
   Baumgartner, F. R. (2005). The politics of attention: How government
   prioritizes problems. University of Chicago Press) sheds light on what
   drives this process. We find that unlike policy outputs from many other
   policymaking systems, ECB communications evolve in a proportional
   manner. We attribute this finding to the information-processing
   capacities of the bank. Our findings speak to the literatures on central
   bank communications, the evolution of policy agendas, and the
   application of topic models to speech texts.},

Abstract = {The divergent outcomes in respect of political integration of the
   several crises that the EU has confronted during the last decade present
   a challenge for most grand theories' of European integration. There has
   been more political disintegration than some of the historically most
   influential, optimistic' theories would have anticipated, but less than
   more recently-developed and more pessimistic' theories, notably
   postfunctionalism, would have expected. Compared with these contrasting
   theories, a hegemonic-stability-theoretical approach to the EU's crises
   provides a more convincing explanation of recent patterns of political
   integration and disintegration.},

Title = {Ideological Biases Weaken the Impact of Social Trust on Ethnic Outgroup
   Threat},
Journal = {POLITICAL STUDIES},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {68},
Number = {2},
Pages = {523-540},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Previous studies have not examined whether (personal) political ideology
   influences how trusters perceive of immigrants and refugees as a threat.
   Our contribution to the literature builds on theories of motivated
   reasoning and hypothesizes that political ideology weakens the ability
   of social trust to reduce perceived (ethnic) outgroup threat. Indeed,
   analyses show that the relationship between social trust and perceived
   outgroup threat is considerably weaker among rightists than among
   leftists. Although social trust does relate negatively to perceived
   outgroup threat across the ideological divide, political ideology has a
   constraining influence that cannot be ignored. Social trust is also a
   political phenomenon. We apply a fixed-effects regression, and analyses
   are based on the 2014-European Social Survey, including 21 countries and
   32,175 individuals. In the concluding section, we discuss the full
   implications of our findings for theories of social trust in an era of
   increasing flows of immigrants and refugees that go beyond the usual
   gateway nations.},

Abstract = {In light of the recent terrorist attacks in Paris and Brussels, the aim
   of the current set of studies was to examine if attitudes towards
   terrorists and-by extension-uninvolved outgroups (i.e., Muslims,
   refugees, and immigrants) changed before vs. after these attacks. In a
   Belgian student sample (Study 1a), we investigated the impact of the
   Paris attacks on various facets of outgroup attitudes: feelings towards
   terrorists, Muslims, and refugees, immigrant trust, immigrant threat,
   and immigrant prejudice. The impact of the Brussels attacks was studied
   in a Belgian convenience sample (Study 1b), specifically focusing on
   feelings towards refugees, refugee trust, refugee threat, and avoidance
   of contact with refugees. Results from frequentist and Bayesian analyses
   in both samples revealed no significant short- and long-term
   longitudinal changes in outgroup attitudes after both the Paris (Study
   1a) and Brussels (Study 1b) attacks. We discuss these findings and
   connect them to the alleged refugee crisis; another recent event that
   polarized European societies.},

Abstract = {This article looks at the linkages between export to the European Union
   (EU), export to china and human rights policies. The article argues that
   countries that export to the EU at high rates are more likely to
   converge towards its policies than countries that don't export to the
   EU. The article also argues that the rise of China as a significant
   economic actor does not undermine this process. The article tests these
   arguments by analysing the links between human rights protection in the
   EU and in China, and export to the EU and to China, on the one hand, and
   human rights protection in all the countries for which there are data,
   on the other. The results indicate that countries' human rights policies
   are positively associated with the EU's human rights policies and this
   association is conditioned by countries' levels of export to the EU. The
   results further indicate that export to China does not undermine this
   pattern. The article draws conceptual and policy implications.},

Abstract = {The European Commission has the legal right of initiative to propose
   both legislative and non-legislative actions, including in areas where
   competence is shared with the member states such as development policy.
   This article uses the case of ACP-EU relations to show the trade-offs
   between the Commission?s right of initiative to promote the European
   interest, and its own interests in the field of development policy. It
   presents detailed empirical observations of Commission-Presidency
   dynamics during the preparation of the Union?s negotiating mandate for
   ACP-EU relations after the expiration of the Cotonou agreement in 2020.
   In this process, the Commission had considerable control over the
   calendar and on the substance of Council Working Group exchanges, while
   the rotating Council Presidency had comparatively little influence on
   the process. Developments during the first half of 2018 increased
   political uncertainty and raise questions marks as to the longer-term
   effectiveness of the Commission?s post-Cotonou strategy.},

Abstract = {Orthodox copyright scholarship frames piracy in `developing' countries
   as a detrimental and illegal practice that results from these countries'
   lack of economic, social and cultural development. It argues that piracy
   needs to be discouraged, regulated, and finally overcome for legitimate
   business to flourish. In this article, the authors challenge this
   viewpoint and question whether the implementation of international
   copyright instruments in legislation across Africa really promotes those
   local economies or if it merely exposes them to neo-colonial
   exploitation. While the early international treaties on intellectual
   property rights (IPR) were formulated by European states and implemented
   in most parts of Africa through colonial laws, more recent legislation
   has been globally implemented through institutions such as the United
   Nations or the World Trade Organization, which remain dominated by
   Western interests. Through a structured overview of the adoption of IPR
   treaties in African countries, the authors advance a political economy
   perspective of intellectual property rights as a (neo-)colonial regime.},

Abstract = {This article describes the human rights-oriented foreign policy deployed
   during the administration of Enrique Pella Nieto (2012-2018). To do
   this, it traces both the actions of the Mexican government that sought
   to influence external processes, and those aimed at containing
   international influences on the internal dynamics of the country. From
   an analytical perspective, the article explores trends of continuity or
   change and concludes that the period is characterized by both tensions
   and contradictions. On the one hand, activism in multilateral forums and
   the policy of opening up to international scrutiny have been maintained,
   while on the other hand there have been signs that suggest attempts to
   return to an approach based on sovereignty and non-intervention.},

   policy advantages. We develop and test a account of beneficial
   inefficiencies. Our account reasons that the costs of inefficient
   intraorganizational processes and practices associated with enhanced
   engagement with members are beneficial as they generate crucial ``access
   goods{''}-specifically encompassing positions-that in turn receive
   enhanced policy benefits. The costs of intraorganizational practices
   allowing members to engage more thoroughly in decision making are thus
   beneficial inefficiencies. We test this proposition using data on the
   Australian interest group system. Using the tools of cluster analysis,
   we identify three forms, each varying in respect of the inefficiencies
   they embody. Our multivariate analysis finds strong support for the
   account of beneficial inefficiencies: groups with the most inefficient
   organizational model receiving the greatest policy access.},

Abstract = {Although administrative reorganization has been a major political
   instrument in many democracies, there has been limited research on its
   effects. Aiming to address this gap, this study examines the
   reorganization of Korean government ministries, specifically, the impact
   of reorganization in the form of a merger of ministries performing
   interrelated but dissimilar functions. Examining the salience of policy
   issues expressed in official government press releases during the
   12-year period from 2001 to 2012, we found that administrative
   reorganization in the form of a merger has a significant impact on the
   relative salience of government policy agendas. Specifically, the
   interrupted time series estimates indicate that the salience of science
   and technology policy issues (in relation to education policy issues)
   decreased by approximately 12\% to 17\% following the dissolution of the
   Ministry of Science and Technology. We explain this finding based on the
   bounded rationality view of bureaucratic information processing.},

Abstract = {The Nordic countries pursue ambitious energy transition goals through
   national energy policies and in the framework of Nordic cooperation. We
   propose that the transition is realistic only if it involves the public,
   private, and nongovernmental organization sectors as regulators,
   innovators, and advocates of relevant policies and solutions
   representing the multitude of interests involved. We examine these
   interests through Q methodological experiments, where 43 expert
   stakeholders' rank-order statements concerning their preferred policy
   measures vis-a-vis the electric energy system. Factor analysis of these
   subjectively held views produces three distinct views. The first two
   enjoy strong inter-Nordic support. The first view prioritizes market and
   grid development, and the second view prioritizes electric transport,
   and solar and wind power. The third, ``Finnish{''} view seeks to enhance
   security of supply, also via microgrids, and prioritizes biofuels over
   electric transport. Examining the common ground among the three views,
   we find that enhanced cooperation requires reinforced stakeholder
   interaction and policy coordination.},

Abstract = {The law-making process is one of the extremely important forms of local
   self-government activities. By means of law-making, local
   self-government regulates the conditions of life and behaviour of the
   local community living in a particular area of local self-government.
   Through law-making, therefore, local self-government can significantly
   interfere with an individual's life. The paper is focused on the
   analysis of the current legal regulation of the local self-government
   law-making process in the Slovak Republic and the identification of its
   weak points. The authors examine the results of control activities of
   authorities performing the review of constitutionality and legality of
   local law-making On this basis, we submit a number of suggestions and
   incentives for changing the current legal regulation of law-making
   competence of local self-government.},

Abstract = {At the beginning of his term, President Enrique Pena Nieto declared that
   foreign policy would be based on a principle of international
   cooperation for development (ICD). The objective of this article is to
   analyze the most salient institutional and factual characteristics of
   ICD as exercised during this administration, emphasizing the role of
   Amexcid as the entity responsible for coordinating this activity. The
   article concludes that, in the respective national and international
   contexts -understood as structural factors of the ICD-which ranged from
   favorable to turbulent, the ICD of the 2012-2018 administration was
   characterized by encouraging progress, but also by a lack of robustness
   which made it difficult for it to become a foreign policy asset, in line
   with the expectations aroused.},

Abstract = {Citizen engagement is seen as a way to address a range of societal
   challenges, fiscal constraints, as welt as wicked problems, and
   increasing public participation in political decisions could help to
   address low levels of trust in politicians and decreasing satisfaction
   with political parties. This paper examines the perceived impacts of an
   experiment by the Austrian People's Party which, in response to reaching
   a historic low in the polls, opened up its manifesto process to public
   participation via digital technology. Analysis of survey data from
   participants found that self-efficacy is positively associated with
   participation intensity but negatively related to satisfaction. In
   contrast, collective efficacy is related to positive perceptions of
   public participation in party politics but does not influence levels of
   individual participation. Future research is needed to explore the
   outcomes of political innovations that use digital technologies to
   enable public participation on voting behaviour, party membership and
   attitudes to representative democracy.},

Abstract = {Self-driving cars (also known as driverless cars, autonomous vehicles,
   and highly automated vehicles {[}HAVs]) will change the regulatory,
   political, and ethical frameworks surrounding motor vehicles. At the
   highest levels of automation, HAVs are operated by independent machine
   agents, making decisions without the direct intervention of humans. The
   current transportation system assumes human intervention though,
   including legal and moral responsibilities of human operators. Has the
   development of these artificial intelligence (AI) and autonomous system
   (AS) technologies outpaced the ethical and political conversations? This
   paper examines discussions of HAVs, driver responsibility, and
   technology failure to highlight the differences between how the
   policy-making institutions in the United States (Congress and the Public
   Administration) and technology and transportation experts are or are not
   speaking about responsibility in the context of autonomous systems
   technologies. We report findings from a big data analysis of
   corpus-level documents to find that enthusiasm for HAVs has outpaced
   other discussions of the technology.},

Abstract = {The article attempts to assess the impact of selected economic and
   social factors on the fiscal sustainability of 241 urban municipalities
   in Poland in 2004-2016. The article uses the econometric modelling of
   panel data. The analysis revealed that most of the variables had a
   negative impact on local fiscal performance. The main reason for this is
   the low fiscal autonomy of Polish cities and the strong dependency on
   grants from the central budget, as well as the high share of unfunded
   mandates. This situation means that cities are particularly sensitive to
   the external environment, while at the same time are deprived of fiscal
   stabilisation instruments allowing them to counteract this problem. It
   can be an important obstacle to achieving sustainable economic
   development.},

Abstract = {The present article aims to expand scholarship on the political role of
   social media by focusing on the case of Facebook and the
   self-determination claims of Turkish Cypriots vis-a-vis Turkey. Drawing
   upon a virtual ethnography of relevant Facebook sites and groups, this
   article scrutinises whether social media offer an innovative public
   platform for the politics of self-determination or on-line claims are in
   reality formed and negotiated in the same manner as the offline ones.
   The article concludes that Turkish Cypriots' Facebook activism may very
   well be for strengthening their community, shielding their distinct
   characteristics from mainland Turkey and raising their self-esteem,
   rather than indicating demands for complete autonomy in the traditional
   political sense of the word and/or statehood.},

Abstract = {Purpose The media, private citizens and other stakeholders regularly
   appraise political negotiations, but the character of these negotiations
   and the reasons for outcomes are little understood. The purpose of this
   conceptual paper is to discuss this character and explore its
   implications. Design/methodology/approach This is a conceptual paper.
   The author carried out a literature review and used his experiences in
   supervising political negotiation simulations. Findings The author
   argues that political negotiations have several specific characteristics
   that distinguish them from other kinds of negotiations. Political
   negotiations, for instance, tend to address often rather fuzzy public
   interests, involve value conflicts or are simultaneously performed ``on
   stage{''} and ``behind the scenes.{''} These characteristics may matter,
   as they can provide structural disincentives to negotiators, who might
   be tempted to focus on selling outcomes rather than on improving them
   ({''}saleability-oriented negotiating{''}). Hence, the author argues
   that political negotiators and their stakeholders face the challenge
   that political contexts may foster weak negotiation performances.
   Practical implications - The author proposes an approach to political
   negotiations' training that takes the findings of this paper into
   consideration.
   Originality/value This paper is the first, to the best of the author's
   knowledge, to provide a detailed characterization of political
   negotiations and to discuss related implications.},

Abstract = {What organisational attributes enhance a military's ability to
   effectively adapt on the battlefield? Upon the outbreak of war in July
   2014 between Israel and the Palestinian militant group Hamas, the Israel
   Defense Forces (IDF) encountered an expansive network of tunnels from
   which Hamas was launching large-scale assaults into Israel. This article
   illustrates that the IDF's ability to successfully adapt `under fire' to
   this battlefield surprise was facilitated by several important
   attributes related to its organisational learning capacity: a dynamic,
   action-oriented organisational culture, a flexible leadership and
   command style, specialised commando units which acted as `incubators'
   for learning and innovation, and a formal system to institutionalise and
   disseminate lessons learned.},

Title = {Rousing the Partisan Combatant: Elite Incivility, Anger, and
   Antideliberative Attitudes},
Journal = {POLITICAL PSYCHOLOGY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {40},
Number = {3},
Pages = {637-655},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {The claim that elite political incivility can rouse partisan,
   antideliberative attitudes has many adherents, but the empirical record
   demonstrating a relationship is surprisingly limited. Yet the extant
   research suggests that incivility can stimulate aversive feelings, of
   the sort that discrete and dimensional theories of emotion predict
   should induce a partisan, antideliberative mode of citizenship among
   those exposed. Leveraging two online experiments, I address the
   questions of whether elite incivility provokes anger, rather than
   enthusiasm and anxiety, and whether the affective reactions induced by
   incivility yield the changes in deliberative attitudes that theories of
   emotion predict. I find that elite incivility, when counterattitudinal,
   rouses anger, which in turn can provoke an active and combative form of
   partisan citizenship. Despite claims to the contrary, the link between
   proattitudinal incivility, anger, and antideliberative attitudes is less
   clear. The results provide insight into the dynamics of discourse in the
   digital age, when affective polarization is the norm and elites commonly
   employ uncivil rhetoric.},

Abstract = {This document presents the result of an analysis on the elaboration of
   the Regional Tourism Policy of Arica and Parinacota 2012-2016 (in Chile)
   focused on the participation of relevant actors during technical, social
   and political validation instances. An epistemological implication is
   described based on a set of obstacles, conflicts, resistance and
   adversities found in making this policy, chosen as a case study for
   ``policy network{''}, to allow its understanding and importance as one
   of the first experiences of decentralization of sectoral decisions in
   the region. Through the analysis of its content and semi-structured
   interviews, the work approached the causes -often the defense of

Abstract = {Notions of anarchy and an artificial state-centric system underpin much
   of modern political and IR theory. However, the primacy of cultural
   association over anarchy and artifice has once again come to the fore,
   notably in constructivist and `culturalist' approaches. The paper argues
   that these approaches make a valuable contribution to our understanding
   of the international but rest on a secular ontology that brackets
   religion and transcendent notions of morality and justice out of the
   equation. By contrast, the work of Edmund Burke offers an alternative
   conception of the international. Contrary to constructivism, Burke
   considers association not as socially constructed but as reflecting a
   natural order governed by customs and traditions. Such an order gives
   rise to `commonwealths of culture' governed by a transcendent morality
   that for Burke is God-given. And contrary to `culturalist' approaches,
   Burke conceptualises identity not in essentialist terms but rather as an
   organically evolving reality that is shaped by both ideas and material
   forcesnotions of common humanity and universal standards of justice,
   which are mediated through history and embodied in particular practices.
   For Burke, the international requires `obligations written in the
   heart', which are more fundamental than the formal standards of `papers
   and seals'.},

Abstract = {The article deals with the Russian media coverage of sexual assaults
   against women during the 2016 New Year's Eve celebrations in Cologne.
   The authors examine it in the frame of discourse of ``Gayropa{''} that
   represents the EU via changes in gender order of the West European
   societies. The pro-Kremlin media coverage of the ``Rape of Europe{''}
   contributes to positioning Russia in the world, maintaining power
   legitimacy in the country, and supporting gender order in Russian
   society. The media discourse treats it as an evidence of decline of the
   European civilization. (C) 2019 The Regents of the University of

Abstract = {Much of the literature on affirmative action is normative. Further, in
   scholarship that takes an empirical approach to examine this topic, the
   object of inquiry is typically the ramifications of such provisions -
   most notably the extent to which they foster social transformation. Yet,
   we know surprisingly little about the antecedents of affirmative action.
   This work examines what variables systematically predict affirmative
   action. We focus on the policy feedback literature and compensatory
   justice frameworks to examine the effects of democracy, modernisation
   and globalisation on affirmative action programmes. Time-series
   cross-sectional analyses of data for hundreds of groups from all over
   the globe for the period 1985-2003 confirm our hypotheses. This is the
   first work to examine affirmative action programmes in a large-N
   framework of such scale. We find that such programmes systematically
   correlate with democracy, modernisation and globalisation.},

Abstract = {The problem-solving capacity and problem-generating potential of
   multilevel systems entail the need for the delegation of authority. When
   the problem concerned is about how to put an abstract policy concept
   into a practicable policy tool, the choice of the respective delegation
   trajectory depends on the policy models or the policy-relevant knowledge
   that the respective political levels can supply. When regarding the
   European Union (EU) level as the starting point of knowledge creation
   and delegation trajectories, and concentrating on transaction costs,
   policy knowledge and models generated at the international level provide
   the most cost-effective solution. Only when the international level is
   not able to provide further policy knowledge and innovation does the EU
   delegate its definitional authority, first downward to the member states
   and then sideways to EU agencies. We illustrate the plausibility of our
   dynamic understanding of multilevel governance by using Environmental
   Policy Integration as an example.},

Abstract = {Can we speak of a joined up European Union (EU) Grand Strategy in the
   world? Strategy-based policy-making in the EU is a shared enterprise
   between the EU and its member state governments. The EU and its member
   states focus in the EUGS (Shared vision, common action: a stronger
   Europe: a Global Strategy for the European Union's Foreign and Security
   Policy, Brussels,
   http://www.eeas.europa.eu/archives/docs/top\_stories/pdf/eugs\_review\_w
   eb.pdf, 2016) on the EU homeland as a priority and not the Neighbourhood
   or the global level of diplomacy as was the case previously in the ESS
   (A secure Europe in a better world,
   http://www.consilium.europa.eu/uedocs/cmsUpload/78367.pdf, 2003). This
   is partly as a result of changing EU foreign policy priorities and
   partly as a result of the reassertion of national interests into the
   EU's transnational foreign policy. EU Grand Strategy has shifted focus
   from the global to the regional level reflecting the new pragmatic turn
   in EU foreign policy. The new strategy is more regional, more pragmatic,
   and less ambitious in furthering the EU as a global actor as a result.},

Abstract = {Food cultivation, preparation and consumption are important references
   for shaping national identity. Food is a crystallization of the history
   of a national or ethnic group, of its traditions, mentality, and
   religious adherence and of very pragmatic material elements reflecting
   the way of life of the group, for instance, climatic conditions and
   socio-economic levels. All elements of the history of a group are
   transmitted and experienced in daily rituals relating to food. Food has
   strong symbolic, quasi-sacred associations in many cultures: for Slavic
   peoples bread is a very important symbol, and in Belarus potatoes are
   known as ``the second bread{''}.
   The role played by banal everyday identity rituals is very important in
   complex political contexts, where identity building processes aimed at
   the transformation of a community into a nation-state with common
   identification denominators are not endorsed by political elite. Belarus
   is an extremely difficult case from the point of view of identity
   building: a country without a history (Zaprudnik, 1993), without a
   nation (Marples, 1999), without an identity (Bekus, 2010). In the
   Belarusian context, food - especially food which is cheap, rustic and
   simple to cultivate, such as potatoes - is an important identity marker.

Abstract = {Water governance is central to the crisis of the Anthropocene as climate
   change, population growth and changing demands for water are predicted
   to exacerbate threats to food, water and energy security and river
   functioning. Since 2000 the major policy setting in Europe for the
   governance of water has been the European Water Framework Directive
   (WFD). Empirically grounded post-positivist water governance research
   strongly anchored in interpretivist and constructivist systems'
   traditions akin to deliberative policy analysis (DPA) is reported. The
   case is made, based on the UK (England), that an opportunity to
   transform water governance has been lost because WFD implementation has
   been prescriptive, top-down and fails to engage with dynamic complexity.
   Some changes have emerged from the adoption of a Catchment-Based
   Approach (CaBA), partly triggered by threat to government of a judicial
   review, but governance praxis and trajectory remain contested. The paper
   reports on new pathways and options for change emerging from a systemic
   co-inquiry, a deliberative instrument, which emphasises the importance
   of institutionalising community action at catchment scale and re-framing
   the enactment of the Directive as part of an iterative social learning
   system for water governance. In the light of our findings, implications
   for future DPA scholarship are explored.},

Abstract = {This article addresses what is increasingly perceived as a crisis of
   human rights. While contemporary critiques of human rights address a
   diverse set of challenges and issues, this article focuses specifically
   on the ``populist{''} demagogic challenge to human rights within those
   notionally liberal-democratic societies in which human rights have been
   typically considered most secure. While agreeing with those who have
   argued that human rights is in crisis, in part, because of its
   relationship with neoliberalisrn, this article goes beyond this argument
   and outlines a way of understanding that relationship through
   identifying what I term the ``gentrification of human rights.{''} This
   article outlines the concept of the gentrification of human rights,
   while also seeking to demonstrate how gentrification restricts the
   ability of human rights to engage robustly with rising deprivation,
   inequality, and marginalization within affluent,
   ``liberal-democratic{''} societies. It also presents some of the key
   challenges that confront human rights.},

Abstract = {Solar geoengineering (SG) is considered a promising, albeit
   controversial, climate engineering technology to help reduce predicted
   global warming. However, the complexity of SG raises serious doubts
   about its political practicability. The objective of this article is to
   investigate this technology's feasibility, a fundamental dimension of
   said practicability. Feasibility is here understood as a political
   property: the higher the feasibility of a state of affairs ranks, the
   greater its eventual political practicability. According to this
   perspective, the less SG clashes with economic, institutional, and moral
   soft constraints, the more feasible it becomes, and hence the greater
   its political practicability. An analysis of economic and institutional
   soft constraints points to a high degree of SG feasibility. This
   feasibility is, however, limited by the perceived non-bearable moral
   costs which SG involves. Given the greater weight of moral soft
   constraints, SG's overall feasibility is therefore low. Based on these
   indications, the article offers suggestions for lessening SG's friction
   with soft constraints, especially with the highly sensitive moral ones,
   with the aim of increasing this technology's feasibility. On the basis
   of this heightened feasibility, the paper concludes with policy
   recommendations which improves the practicability of SG.},

Abstract = {Public policy scholars argue that in highly tangible policies, such as
   tobacco control, the public learns from the direct experience of the
   beneficial effects of the policy. Empirical evidence supports this
   argument, suggesting that in the United States the introduction of
   tobacco control measures makes people more inclined to further
   regulation. By relying on a set of cases which allows testing the
   effects of the introduction of tobacco control measures across European
   countries on a series of relevant variables, this study confirms that
   the introduction of tobacco control measures makes the public more
   inclined to further regulation. Yet, when the effects of these policies
   are disaggregated between smokers and nonsmokers, results show that
   these positive effects are driven by smokers. This puzzle suggests that
   different effects than mass attitudinal policy feedback effects, driven
   by learning from direct experience, might explain the positive reaction
   to tobacco control. This study puts forward a behavioral theory of
   policy feedback, which suggests that smokers react positively to the
   introduction of tobacco control measures because they see these measures
   as commitment devices, which can help them quit smoking. Evidence for
   this argument is found by demonstrating that the introduction of tobacco
   control measures increases smokers' welfare.},

Abstract = {In this article, I offer a reading of the pirate in Carl Schmitt
   inspired by Reinhart Koselleck's study on asymmetric counterconcepts. I
   argue that the pirate in Schmitt marks a negative asymmetric
   counterconceptual position associated with a space of exception in
   relation to which one may also identify the outlaw enemy of humanity. In
   displacing the political and mapping the pirate's position within
   Schmitt's conceptual order, the significance of this article's main
   contribution is to draw attention to a specific asymmetric
   counterconceptual structuring that marks the limits of `our'
   international political world with the dehumanized negativity of its
   constitutive outsider. Rereading Koselleck's methodological
   qualification on the structural iterability of asymmetric
   counterconcepts, the article suggests that the spectre of the pirate
   lives on, haunting the outer limits of the international and
   legitimizing abject forms of violence.},

Abstract = {This article studies the formation process of China's belt and road
   initiative (BRI) - the most important Chinese foreign policy initiative
   under Xi Jinping. It argues that the BRI was put forward as a broad
   policy idea that was subsequently developed with relatively concrete
   content. During this process, the shifting international landscapes have
   gradually driven the BRI from a periphery strategy into a global
   initiative. By examining the case of Jiangsu Province, this article also
   shows how Chinese local governments have actively deployed their
   preferred narratives to influence and (re-)interpret the BRI guidelines
   of the central government in order to advance their own interests. As a
   result, this produces a variety of competing, ambiguous and
   contradictory policy narratives of the BRI within China, which
   undermines the Chinese central government's monopoly on the BRI
   narratives. This leaves the BRI as a very vague and broad policy slogan
   that is subject to change and open to interpretation. In this regard,
   the existing analyses - that consider the BRI as Beijing's masterplan to
   achieve its geopolitical goals - pay insufficient attention to the BRI's
   domestic contestation and overstate the BRI's geopolitical implications.},

Abstract = {This article contends that contemporary resistance in the mining sector
   in Zimbabwe is grounded in everyday acts of resistance and is directed
   towards power relationships exercised at work. Overt forms of resistance
   have been waning in Zimbabwe because of various pieces of draconian
   legislation, and subterranean forms of resistance have been gaining
   traction and deserve to be studied. Drawing on in-depth interviews and
   participant observations at Zimplats, the article employs Scott's
   concept of the `weapons of the weak', which posits that covert forms of
   resistance are favourable when open and collective resistance seems
   dangerous, as a means to understand some of the current dynamics of
   worker struggles in Zimbabwe.},

Abstract = {What happens when similar measures are being introduced in different
   national contexts? This article studies the ways in which patient choice
   has been articulated in public and official reports on health care in
   the two contexts of Sweden and the UK, whose welfare systems are
   typically comprehended as different. Specific interest is directed
   towards the construction of patient positions, and policy documents are
   analyzed using discourse theory. The results show many similarities
   between the national contexts; choice is primarily articulated with
   individuality, autonomy, consumption, and responsibility, as well as
   with support from state agencies, and patient choice is relentlessly
   normalized as the way forward. But there are also important differences
   that reveal that the presuppositions differ, for example, when
   pinpointing the stakeholders of patient choice reforms and how the
   different policies work to take the well-known edges off of patient
   choice ideology.},

Abstract = {One of the consequences of the transition from British to Chinese rule
   in Hong Kong has been the development of parallel social service
   delivery systems. On the one hand, the welfare bureaucracy is
   characterised by contractual relationships between the government and
   nonprofit organisations and is shaped by western ideas associated with
   new public management. On the other hand, the political machine is
   composed of locally elected representatives, community-based
   organisations (CBOs) and local residents and reflects traits of Chinese
   communism. This article investigates the interactions and strategies
   adopted by actors in these two systems in their attempt to control the
   delivery of social services. Crucially, it explores how these two
   systems interact and the impact on policy implementation. Evidence shows
   that CBOs provide a critical brokering role between elected political
   officials, the public and nonprofit organisations that is critical to
   maintaining the functionality of Hong Kong's parallel social service
   delivery systems.},

Abstract = {The 2012 crisis in Mali, where the state collapsed and terrorist groups
   took over the north, came as a surprise to many. Mali had been
   considered a poster-child for democracy and was judged as considerably
   more stable than its neighbors by leading quantitative indices of state
   fragility. This article explores how quantitative risk and qualitative
   threat approaches led to incomplete analyses, and how bureaucratic
   processes stifled a holistic diagnosis of the situation in Mali. French
   and Dutch government views are analyzed, adding new empirical
   information on how ministries and embassies were unwilling to call out
   disconcerting developments in Mali.},

Title = {Still Unjust, Just in Different Ways: How Targeted Sanctions Fall Short
   of Just War Theory's Principles},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL STUDIES REVIEW},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {21},
Number = {1},
Pages = {57-80},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Economic sanctions have faced substantial criticism for being blunt
   coercive instruments that inflict a broad array of harms upon innocent
   populations. In response to this, the targeted sanctions movement has
   sought to limit the form, function, and scope of sanctioning efforts to
   minimize their adverse effects on average citizens who have no direct
   role in influencing the objectionable policies sanctions' senders
   senders want changed. We seek to take stock of whether targeted
   sanctions are truly more ethical coercive policies. We argue that
   targeted sanctions strategies, as practiced by the international
   community, tend to make tradeoffs amongst just war theory principles and
   at the cost of sanctions' utility. Rather than representing an ethical
   form of coercion, targeted sanctions often just differ from more
   comprehensive sanctions in how they violate just war principles. We
   demonstrate this by showing that although targeted sanctions are
   arguably more consistent with the principle of discrimination's
   prohibition of deliberately targeting civilians, they nevertheless
   conflict with other norms, such as proportionality and reasonable
   probability of success. Moreover, targeted sanctions have these adverse
   effects despite an appearance of precision that may make it easier to
   employ coercion.},

Abstract = {The continued influence of traditional governance in sub-Saharan Africa
   has sparked increasing attention among scholars exploring the role of
   non-state and quasi-state forms of governance in the modern state.
   However, little attention has been given to cross-country and over-time
   variation in the interaction between state and traditional governance
   structures, particularly in regard to its implications for intrastate
   peace. This study examines the conditions under which traditional
   governance contributes to state capacity to maintain peace. The article
   argues that the type of institutional interaction between the state and
   traditional authority structures influences a country's overall
   governance dynamics and its capacity to maintain peace. By combining new
   data on state-traditional authorities' interaction in sub-Saharan Africa
   from 1989 to 2012 with intrastate armed conflict data, I conduct a
   systematic comparative analysis of whether concordant state-traditional
   authorities' interaction strengthens peace. The empirical results
   support the argument that integrating traditional authorities into the
   public administration lowers the risk of armed conflict in comparison to
   when they remain unrecognized by the state. Moreover, the analysis
   suggests that the added value of this type of interaction is conditional
   on the colonial history of a country.},

Abstract = {What are the subnational variations of violence against voters? This
   article studies the effect of land concentration on electoral violence
   in the context of armed conflict in Colombia. My central argument is
   that electoral violence tends to be higher in municipalities where
   landowners are a relevant social actor. More concretely, in areas where
   violent groups dispute territorial control, higher levels of land
   inequality - a proxy for landowner prominence - have a positive effect
   on electoral violence. However, actors do not make the simple choice
   between violence or no violence but may also resort to fraudulent
   tactics. Because electoral fraud requires greater cooperation and
   coordination with the state, I argue that violent groups with stronger
   links to state officials and political elites are more likely to engage
   in fraudulent tactics compared to anti-government actors. To estimate
   the effect of land inequality on electoral coercion and fraud, I exploit
   the levels of soil quality as an instrumental variable for land
   concentration in Colombia between 2002 and 2011. This article
   contributes to the literature on the politics of land inequality;
   elections and electoral manipulation; and the use of violence in
   democratic settings.},

Abstract = {Most theories of government growth place nearly exclusive attention on
   real changes in public sector activity. Yet, much nominal post-WWII
   government spending growth was not in the form of the public sector
   doing more relative to the general economy (real growth), but in the
   form of government activities becoming relatively more expensive (cost
   growth). Baumol's (1967) ``cost disease{''} model is our best guide to
   understanding cost growth, but over time, Baumol has offered conflicting
   hypotheses about how cost growth bears on real growth. Using 1947-2012
   U.S. data, we test these hypotheses, along with a more novel
   expectation, by modifying Berry and Lowery's (1987b) econometric models
   of real growth in public purchases and transfers to consider the
   influence of government cost growth on real public domestic spending.},

Abstract = {Public sector employees are expected to perform well in a work
   environment that is characterized by a variety of challenges. This
   Symposium aims to shed light on how environmental changes impact the
   shared identity, attitudes and behaviour of public sector employees; how
   public sector employees take charge of continuous change and deal with
   challenges in their work environment; and how organizations can help
   employees to tackle such work-related challenges. We identify four
   specific gaps in literaturesome methodological and some more substantive
   in natureand explain how this Symposium helps to address these gaps.},

Abstract = {This article asks how domestic elites contest and localise global norms
   in contentious post-war contexts. Engaging with critical norm research,
   it develops a `two-step localisation' framework in order to explain how
   seemingly technical security governance programmes depend on active
   congruence making with constitutive state-society narratives both by
   international practitioners and domestic elites. The first step consists
   of the adaptation that practitioners working in the field make in order
   to tune their message to local contexts, and the second step constitutes
   the locally driven processes of contestation through narrative
   construction. The article thus brings in deeply political negotiations
   over state-society narratives in order to unpack how local agents
   contest and reframe global norms. Applying the two-step localisation
   framework to a comparative case study of Small Arms and Light Weapons
   Control programmes in Kosovo and Cambodia, the article illustrates how
   the relationship between arms and state-society narratives is key to
   understanding the outcome of security governance processes.},

Abstract = {The United States has repeatedly intervened militarily in situations
   where tactical success on the battlefield did not translate into
   meaningful political resolution of the issues triggering the
   introduction of military force. Although US military interventions are
   hardly a recent phenomenon, a series of systemic, political and
   institutional developments over the past several decades have been
   particularly conducive to the limited use of force as a policy option.
   These factors have reduced the costs and risks of military intervention,
   incentivising the use of force in situations when it may not be the
   optimal policy response.},

Abstract = {Internal political efficacy has long been associated with news use and
   political discussion. Yet, as more people are inadvertently exposed to
   news and political discussion online, it remains unclear whether
   incidental news exposure also has a discursive effect on political
   efficacy. In a two-wave panel study, we applied the O-S-R-O-R model of
   communication effects to test these relationships. We found that
   political discussion with weak ties, but not strong ties, is a mediator
   between incidental news exposure and internal political efficacy.},

Abstract = {Governments have turned to public deliberation as a way to engage
   citizens in governance with the goal of rebuilding faith in government
   institutions and authority as well as to provide quality inputs into
   governance. This article offers a systematic analysis of the literature
   on the effects of deliberative events on participants' political
   efficacy and trust. The systematic review contextualizes the results
   from a 6-day deliberative event. This case study is distinctive in
   highlighting the long-term impacts on participants' political trust and
   efficacy as key outcomes of the deliberative process unfold, that is,
   City Council receives then responds to the participants' recommendations
   report. Using four-wave panel data spanning 2.5 years and three public
   opinion polls (control groups), the study demonstrates that participants
   in deliberative events are more efficacious and trusting prior to and
   after the deliberative event. Despite the case study's evidence and the
   systematic review of existing literature, questions remain about whether
   enhanced opportunities for citizen engagement in governance can
   ameliorate low levels of political trust and efficacy observed in
   Western democracies.},

Abstract = {Interest groups take an active stance on US human rights policy, with
   implications for countries around the world. Today, publicly traded
   companies are responsible for the majority of all lobbying dollars spent
   on the issue. This article leverages a unique dataset on congressional
   lobbying between 2007 and 2010 to map and explain variation in corporate
   lobbying on US human rights-related legislation. We substantiate and
   explain why large oil, defense, and technology companies have greater
   representation in terms of dollars spent trying to influence the US
   approach to managing human rights around the globe than any other
   lobbying group. Rarely do these companies publicly explain their
   interests or intentions when lobbying a policy. Moreover, congressional
   efforts to link human rights to other areas of legislation (such as
   trade) has incentivized certain firms-some likely without any direct
   interests in human rights-to weigh in on the human rights policymaking
   process. Whether this is good or bad news for the promotion of human
   rights around the world is an open-and pressing-question.},

Abstract = {In this paper I argue that strategic culture is shaped by the ideology
   of a political party and is carried through elites' practices. A state's
   decision to become a nuclear power is often explained by rational choice
   theories. These theories assume states as rational actors and explain
   their behavior by cost-benefit calculation, keeping in mind the material
   cost involved in such decisions. The problem with such approaches is
   that they usually underemphasize the impact of other influences like
   culture. One such variable is the role of a political party's ideology
   that influences the identities of state elites and helps shape their
   strategic behavior. Therefore, strategic culture is appropriately
   explained by looking at intervening variable of elite socialization that
   stems from the persuasive power of socially constructed norms of
   political parties.},

Abstract = {The 2014 protests and plenums in Bosnia-Herzegovina were widely noted
   for their insertion of economic and social justice topics into the stale
   public discourse of ethnocracy. They also signified a potential to break
   with an anemic civil society shaped by international intervention,
   technocratic ``project logic{''} and apolitical service provision. This
   article argues for treating these struggles in reference to the dual
   nature of the hegemony created by both local ethnonationalists and
   international liberal intervenors. It applies a Gramscian perspective to
   the processes by which hegemony is created and (re)produced via
   consensus in civil society. The challenge to dual hegemony can be seen
   in the central focus of contestation on social justice in economic
   arrangements as well as in the alternative logics of engagement and
   organizational forms in society. We describe the tensions arising from
   this dual challenge in terms of the degree to which they contest or
   reproduce the predominant anti-politics, a stance of distancing from
   dialogue or even contact with political actors and institutions. We
   conclude that the events during and since 2014 have strengthened the
   means to build an alternative third bloc via a ``local first{''}
   approach, containing heterogeneous forms of local-scale action with
   explicitly political strategies.},

   1964-2015},
Journal = {POLITICAL STUDIES},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {67},
Number = {1},
Pages = {63-82},

Abstract = {Political parties often appeal to groups. Yet, existing work does not
   consider how such group-based appeals are used, presumably because they
   are thought to have grown ineffective. Contrary to this, I argue that
   group-based appeals are central to party electoral strategy, and that
   time has only strengthened the incentive to use them. Using original
   data on 10,000 group-based appeals found in sentence-by-sentence coding
   of British election manifestos, I demonstrate an increasing use of
   group-based appeals from 1964 to 2015. Furthermore, I show that the
   range of groups emphasized, the concentration of group emphasis, and the
   specific group categories targeted also follow the electoral incentives
   prevalent over this 50-year period. These findings shed new light on how
   political parties appeal for votes and suggest that we view group-based
   appeals as a distinctive feature of party electoral strategy. I discuss
   the implications for our broader understanding of electoral competition.},

   This article looks into Arabic statements by Jabhat al-Nusra, Islamic
   State and jihadist forum administrators and online activists to argue
   that, beside the easier use of social media and disruption and
   infiltration of the forums, the conflict between the jihadist groups
   accelerated the migration to social media and the building of a presence
   on Twitter that provided relative resilience to suspensions.},

Abstract = {We investigate public attitudes toward the fiscal union: a policy
   advocated in official European Union documents and designed to address
   asynchronous economic fluctuations in the eurozone. We employ survey
   questions and conjoint analyses embedded in population-based panel
   surveys in Italy, and draw expectations from theories of
   tax-and-transfer schemes, public insurance, ideology, diffuse support,
   identity and trust. High-income right-wing individuals with weak
   European identity and negative assessment of EU membership are more
   likely to oppose the measure. However, high-income respondents display
   greater willingness to pay, especially in order to keep the euro,
   whereas lower-income participants are readier to ditch the currency if
   the monetary union does not deliver good economic performance. The
   political feasibility of this policy seems therefore to rest on the
   willingness to contribute by the core constituency supporting the euro.
   We also investigate the preferences for the institutional design of the
   policy.},

   transformation?},
Journal = {CAMBRIDGE REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {32},
Number = {1},
Pages = {43-60},
Month = {JAN 2},
Abstract = {The political science and international relations literature has
   extensively analysed the role of norm entrepreneurs, states, and
   international institutions as relevant actors generating norm
   transformation. However, although social movements' reliance on courts
   to address core social problems has become a significant phenomenon, the
   role of the litigation process of social movements in norm
   transformation is understudied. Social movements have an ambiguous
   relationship with litigation. On the one hand, social movements perceive
   litigation to be the tool of the powerful, reproducing the status quo;
   on the other hand, it is argued that even when social movements lose
   their cases before the courts in the short term, legal mobilization can
   provide longer-term achievements. This article constructs a theory about
   the process through which the litigation of social movements impacts
   norm transformation. It proposes four mechanisms through which
   litigation plays a role in norm transformation: legal framing, legal
   interpretation, precedent setting and public attention. Through the
   examination of the Sardar Sarovar Dam as a case study, the analysis
   reveals that the role of the litigation process of social movements in
   norm transformation depends on how litigation mechanisms impact norm
   transformation in specific cases.},

Abstract = {Recent moves to (re)incorporate the registers of affect and emotion into
   the discipline of International Relations have been spearheaded within
   the study of security. Across airports, borders, and urban spaces, we
   have seen the lines of control by which certain affects and emotions are
   orientated and manipulated, in order to (dis)aggregate and discipline
   bodies. However, while there is a concerted effort to imagine and
   foreground theoretically how bodies have the dual capacity to affect and
   to be affected, thus, playing back into forms of control, a clear
   delineation on method is, so far, absent. In other words, how exactly
   can we juggle uncovering the ways in which affect and emotion are always
   simultaneously obedient and deviant? Therefore, this article will set
   out a methodological framework that enables research to stay attuned to,
   and cognisant of, the competing layers of these registers that both play
   into and rupture mechanisms of control in security. I argue that
   imagining fieldwork and research on affect and emotion as liminal sites,
   through three layers, allows for the translation of the control of and
   by affect, while simultaneously embracing the liveliness, disruption,
   and tensions that affect and emotion create.},

Abstract = {Many commentators have pointed to the 1993 International Monetary Fund
   (IMF) loan, which occurred on the eve of South Africa's democratic
   elections, as a key factor in explaining the shift in African National
   Congress (ANC) economic policy in the 1990s. This argument is now
   invariably taken for granted. Little understanding of the nature of the
   Compensatory and Contingency Financing Facility (CCFF) is displayed, nor
   has any hard evidence been produced to back this argument. Drawing upon
   previously unseen data and reports from both the National Treasury and
   the IMF, we show that the IMF loan could not have had such an impact on
   ANC economic policy thinking.},

Abstract = {In talking about the Cold War, the term ``bipolarity{''} is frequently
   used, including in the very definition of the underlying notion of
   ``polarity.{''} If we are to put things in perspective with a subject
   that is more complex than it seems, we must first consider that polarity
   is an exception in the international history, and then learn to
   distinguish between power polarity and group polarity, two major
   realities that are often confused. The former describes competition
   among states that may claim power status, in other words that have the
   objective resources to do so and are perceived as such by others. What
   is the use of being objectively powerful if others fail to acknowledge
   that capacity? This chapter will first consider issues of nuclear
   reality and ideological antagonism before questioning the transition
   from antagonism to diarchy. It will examine the erosion of the bipolar
   system stemming from the South and from so-called peripheral conflicts,
   the contentious legacy of non-alignment and the fleeting illusion of
   unipolarity. Finally, the author stresses what an ``apolar{''} world may
   be and how it may have finally caused the return of the oligarchic club.},

Abstract = {Since the end of the 1960s, there has been a high degree of public
   support for Norwegian membership in NATO. In the late 1940s and well
   into the 1950s, however, several public opinion surveys showed that
   approximately 50\% of the population ideally would have preferred
   Norwegian non-alignment. This article analyses how (soon to be) allies,
   as well as NATOs own information agency sought to influence Norwegian
   public opinion in the years just before and after 1949, often in
   cooperation with Norwegian individuals or organisations. These efforts
   aimed at increasing public attention to and knowledge of the Alliance,
   and sought to secure public support for the Norwegian Government's
   Atlantic policies.},

Abstract = {What role does horizontal social inequality play for political protest
   in middle-income countries? We argue that public social service
   provision is an important driver of state perceptions. When a state
   fails to deliver services in an equitable manner, trust in institutions
   erodes and protest becomes more likely. We use a mixed methods design to
   investigate this argument in South Africa. First, we combine police
   event records with census data to estimate correlations between service
   inequality and protests. Second, we draw on an opinion survey with
   27,000 respondents to investigate the suggested mechanism linking social
   inequality to protest through political attitudes. Third, we focus on
   qualitative protest accounts in two areas identified by a matching
   approach to assess the plausibility of our quantitative findings.
   Throughout these analyses, we document a robust association between
   horizontal social inequality and protest.},

Journal = {INTERNASJONAL POLITIKK},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {77},
Number = {1},
Pages = {84-94},
Abstract = {Norway's security policy has been firmly anchored in its NATO membership
   and close bilateral relationship with the US since the 1950s. In
   parallell, the EU has regularly popped up on the Norwegian security
   political agenda. The balancing between the transatlantic and European
   pillar has created tensions in Norway's security policy over the years,
   and especially with the strengthening of the EU's common security and
   defence policy and shifting US foreign policy. The article also
   discusses how today's more unpredictable and uncertain security
   environment, the decline in Western hegemony and global power shift
   towards Asia, geopolitical rivalry, and anti-liberal and anti-EU
   sentiments challenge established institutions and cooperation patterns
   that Norway has relied on for security and what the effects of these
   developments might be.},

Abstract = {This chapter invokes car-driving in the UAE in order to analyze how
   notions of national difference are restabilized in a globalizing
   materiality of the everyday. It thus connects the study of everyday
   nationhood to what Georg Simmel understood by modernity: the dualism of
   living through social forms as they unfold between stabilizations and
   transgressions of the national. It firstly builds the mobilities
   paradigm with its Simmelian foundation into a framework for making sense
   of the everyday subject as both a nationalized and globalized way of
   being on the move. Through everyday car-driving in the UAE, it then
   empirically illustrates how this is so.},

Abstract = {Latin America is one of the most violent sub-regions in the world,
   although nowadays, only Colombia experienced armed conflict. This double
   condition (extreme violence/without war), takes place against a backdrop
   of the social reproduction of violences. A multiplicity of actors
   reproduce violence through the mediations that regulate exchanges in
   social life. This text proposes to assess this phenomenon of social
   reproduction through three lenses: the social insertion of criminality,
   the role of the drugs trade and extreme inequality. By focusing on the
   significance of violences, the article aims to shine a new light on what
   it might mean to build peace in Latin America. The aim is to show how
   the conceptualisation of peace and its implementation needs to take
   account of the violences outside of war. Because non-war violences are
   not recognised in the legal global architecture, it is difficult to
   develop practical, violence reducing global responses.},

Title = {Explaining Turkey's Reaction to the September 2017 Independence
   Referendum in the KRG: Final Divorce or Relationship Reset?},
Journal = {ETHNOPOLITICS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {18},
Number = {1, SI},
Pages = {46-60},
Abstract = {In the years preceding the independence referendum held in the KRG in
   September 2017, the relationship between Ankara and Erbil had blossomed,
   based on commerce, energy exports, a shared antipathy towards Baghdad
   and towards the PKK, and interlocking interests between the families and
   business circles surrounding Turkish president Erdogan and KRG president
   Barzani. Ankara had even appeared relaxed in the face of Barzani's
   repeated insistence that an independence referendum would be held.
   Ankara's fierce reaction to the holding of the referendum, and in
   particular to its extension to the disputed territory of Kirkuk, took
   Erbil by surprise. This article will seek to explain Ankara's reaction,
   and Erbil's failure to anticipate it. It will explore Ankara's
   aspirations in northern Iraq, its unease both with developments in
   Rojava and with the PKK/YPG presence in northern Iraq, its commitment to
   the Turkmen of Kirkuk, its growing dissatisfaction with Erbil, and
   shifts in power and perspective in Ankara. It will also seek to unpick
   Barzani's decision to go ahead with a referendum. It will then speculate
   on possible outcomes for the KRG in Iraq, on whether Baghdad can emerge
   as a viable longer-term partner for Turkey, and on the extent to which
   Turkey might be prepared to sustain the economic and political losses
   that could result from a more permanent and substantive loosening of its
   ties with Erbil.},

Title = {Ethnic exclusion and civil resistance campaigns: Opting for nonviolent
   or violent tactics?},
Journal = {TERRORISM AND POLITICAL VIOLENCE},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {31},
Number = {3},
Pages = {475-493},
Abstract = {Previous research has argued that political inequality between ethnic
   groups increases the likelihood of both nonviolent and violent protest.
   In this study, I focus on civil resistance campaigns and argue that the
   probability that these large-scale, organized movements will take
   violent over nonviolent forms increases with the share of a country's
   population that is excluded from political power on the basis of ethnic
   affiliation. I expect this to be so because ethnically exclusive regimes
   are more likely to counter political demands with violent repression,
   which increases the cost and decreases the anticipated success of
   nonviolent relative to violent resistance. I test this proposition in a
   global sample of countries for the period 1950-2006 and find, first,
   that high levels of ethnic exclusion make civil resistance campaigns
   more likely to occur violently than nonviolently. Next, to assess the
   mechanism at play, I conduct a mediation analysis and show that almost
   half of the effect of ethnic exclusion on violent campaign onset is
   mediated by the latent level of violent repression in a country. This
   result suggests that political authorities' repressive strategies are
   key to explaining why regime opponents do not always opt for nonviolent
   forms of civil resistance.},

Volume = {47},

Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {The governance paradigm has provided a dominant way of thinking about
   how to govern and found reflection in practice with the increased use of
   partnerships, networks and markets to deliver public services and
   programmes. The emergence of populism as a political force, however,
   calls into question the thinking behind the governance paradigm and some
   of its favoured tools for governing. Populism sees the task of governing
   in very different terms to that of the advocates and practitioners of
   governance. This article explores the populist challenge to governance.
   It shows that gaps in its analysis of a changed environment left the
   governance paradigm potentially open to populist attack. It explores how
   the governance paradigm might adapt to survive by developing either a
   more technical or a political dynamic to its presentation.},

Abstract = {This article applies the social-ecological model to children's
   mobilization into two violent groups-Central American gangs and
   terrorist organizations. While these two groups clearly differ in
   important ways, there are contextual similarities that frame a child's
   involvement in each. For example, both flourish in low-resource settings
   where governmental structures may have been weakened or disrupted. Does
   it follow, therefore, that similar processes are at play in relation to
   children engaging in violent groups? This paper seeks to answer this
   question, reviewing available literature on the social-ecological
   factors that promote engagement in each group. Points of convergence and
   divergence between the groups are identified, and implications for
   prevention and intervention efforts are explored.},

Abstract = {Despite efforts to increase gender diversity and equality worldwide,
   women are still underrepresented in leadership positions in public
   bureaucracies. This article speaks to the debate on how organizational
   context, more specifically organizational decline, may influence gender
   representation in such leadership positions. Based on role congruity
   theory and glass cliff theory this article empirically examines whether
   and how excessive workforce reductions are associated with changes in
   the representation of women in leadership positions in Dutch civil
   service organizations. Panel analyses on administrative data show that
   women's representation in leadership positions varies over time, but is
   not significantly affected by excessive workforce reductions. Overall,
   the analyses do not provide evidence for a glass cliff for women in
   Dutch civil service organizations. Implications for theory and future
   research are discussed.},

Abstract = {y Bureaucracies with field operations that cannot be easily supervised
   and monitored by managers are caught between two sources of dysfunction
   that may harm performance. The first source of dysfunction is
   straightforward: field workers can use operating slack and asymmetric
   information to their own advantage, thwarting an organization's
   objectives. The second source of dysfunction is often overlooked:
   attempts to limit workers' autonomy may have deleterious effects,
   curbing agents' ability to respond efficaciously to the environment. I
   find that the parliaments and executive boards to whom International
   Development Organizations (IDOs) are accountable differentially
   constrain IDO organizational autonomy, which in turn affects
   management's control of field agents. Tight management control of field
   agents has negative effects, particularly in more unpredictable
   environments. Attempts by politicians to constrain organizations in an
   effort to improve performance can sometimes be self-undermining, having
   net effects opposite those intended.},

Abstract = {When do nonviolent protests escalate into violence? Existing literature
   has focused primarily on campaign-level escalations and only recently
   has work begun to examine protest event-level escalations. We build on
   this emerging literature and develop an argument for why some protests
   escalate to violence. We use statistical analysis and find that violent
   escalations are more likely to occur following recent repression and
   when protests are unorganized. Our results offer insight into the
   conditions in which protests remain peaceful and offer citizens a
   channel to pursue their goals as well as the conditions in which
   protests become violent and destabilizing.},

Abstract = {It is a central assumption of our research that threats to a fragile
   security and violence can continue during postconflict peacebuilding and
   that these threats are driven by many of the same sociopolitical
   dynamics that initially led to war. We examine a critical but much less
   queried area of postwar societal instability-violence directed at
   segments of the population who may still be targets for those seeking
   dominance. Using a survey of 300 individuals who testified before the
   International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY), we
   seek to explain violence, threats of violence, and other forms of
   intimidation directed at those who witnessed human rights violations
   during the wars in the former Yugoslavia. Our theory of postwar violence
   emphasizes the vulnerability of the (potential) victims of postwar
   violence. We argue that victims are selectively chosen because of their
   vulnerability. We develop and test an alternative explanation for this
   selective targeting that emphasizes the level of exposure an individual
   may have because of testifying at the ICTY. The results demonstrate
   quite convincingly, however, that it is vulnerability rather than
   exposure risk that predicts who is most likely to be targeted with human
   security threats.},

Abstract = {The emergence of an EU counter-radicalisation (CR) strategy has
   challenged the usual reluctance of European institutions to tackle
   value-loaded issues. This article examines whether this new policy
   alters EU policy-making and especially its approach to religion. It
   illuminates, first, the triggers of such a CR strategy (traumatic
   events, popular expectations and international influences). It then
   shows how the shift of CR from foreign to domestic EU affairs leads to
   the acknowledgement of religion as a multi-dimensional phenomenon and to
   the involvement of a greater number of political, bureaucratic and civil
   society actors. Still, usual patterns of EU public action apply to
   reduce the controversial potential of CR: circumscription to a legal and
   bureaucratic logic, institutional burden-sharing, delegation to member
   states and civil society, hollowing of the normative content of
   religion. In conclusion, CR has sparked a new EU policy field but has
   not radically shaken the routine of European politics.},

Abstract = {Designing a regime regulating supranational lobbying is a contentious
   topic in the EU interinstitutional dialogue. Recently, the Commission
   drafted a proposal for an Interinstitutional Agreement on a Mandatory
   Transparency Register, and during this formulation process it consulted
   broadly with stakeholders. A key question is to which stakeholders has
   the Commission aligned itself with when designing this proposal? I argue
   the Commission acted as a legitimacy maximizer aiming to bolster its
   leverage in interinstitutional negotiations. To enhance input
   legitimacy, it had to build a reputation for being a responsive and
   representative policy initiator. To enhance output legitimacy, it needed
   a reputation for being a competent regulator. The analyses show the
   Commission prioritized input over output legitimacy and building a
   reputation for regulating lobbying in line with preferences of
   stakeholders representing the public interest. In politicized contexts,
   the Commission trades long-standing policy networks for a realignment
   with stakeholders that serve its legitimacy needs.},

   analysis of eight Western European economies},

Abstract = {While digital change already creates pressures for policy change, it
   remains a marginal issue at elections. It is thus risky for parties to
   signal commitment to this emerging topic while other issues still
   dominate. Nevertheless, in recent elections several parties have given
   more space in their manifestos to digitization. To answer the question
   why this is the case, this paper stresses the role of costs and
   programmatic spill-overs in issue competition. It posits that parties
   emphasize digitization more in their manifestos if their costs for
   claiming competence on the issue are reduced due to a policy record in
   government; if parties have relatively more to lose from the status quo;
   and if digitization is compatible with their programmatic orientation.
   Evidence from an analysis of a select sample of eight Western European
   countries between 2010 and 2018 supports these expectations and sheds
   light on why parties invest into an emerging topic.},

Title = {Inside international environmental organizations. Negotiating the

Abstract = {From the late 1960s and early 1970s onwards, environmental politics were
   not only put increasingly on domestic agendas, but also dealt with in
   international regimes and organizations (IOs). The rise of environmental
   IOs has led to the expectation of a greening of international politics
   and a corresponding contribution to improved environmental standards
   around the globe. This paper opens the black box of environmental
   negotiations in IOs and examines how active the various IO member states
   participate in the process of deciding upon international environmental
   rules and norms. This reveals two interesting empirical puzzles that the
   paper examines in a theory-guided methodological sound manner. First,
   many states joined environmental IOs and contribute to them through
   membership fees, but nevertheless often fail to make use of their formal
   right to voice positions in international environmental negotiations.
   Second, some states are considerably more outspoken than others,
   although articulating one's position is important for the chances to
   influence international environmental policies. The paper argues that
   the former is due to lack of capabilities, while the latter is due to
   differences in the saliency of environmental topics across states.},

Abstract = {Does the experience of crime lead to individual disenchantment from
   politics or can it even stir political activism? We study how crime
   victimization affects the intention to vote with survey data from Latin
   America and the Caribbean. Research on non-electoral political behavior
   reveals that crime victims become politically more engaged. In contrast,
   findings from psychological research suggest that victimization
   increases apathy due to loss of self-esteem and social cohesion.
   Building a cognitive foundation of political activism, we propose that
   it is the level of distress which increases-in the case of non-violent
   crime-or decreases-in the case of violent crime experience-the
   likelihood of voting. The results support the hypothesis on victims of
   non-violent crime. The probability of turnout does, however, not change
   for victims of criminal violence. We subsequently test for a possible
   anti-right-wing incumbent effect, to explain the mobilization of victims
   of non-violent crime, but only find evidence for an anti-center
   incumbent tendency.},

Title = {Selecting Ministers in Times of Crisis: A Historical Analysis of the
   Role of Intra-Party Politics and Union Background in Swedish Cabinet

Abstract = {In this article, we connect intra-party politics to macro events by
   asking what types of ministers are selected in times of fiscal crisis.
   Drawing on the previous literature we present two alternative hypotheses
   about the role of the union background in cabinet selection: (1)
   ministers with union background are less likely to be appointed during
   crises, since they are likely to oppose necessary spending cuts and (2)
   ministers with union background are more likely to be appointed during
   crises, since there is a need to appease union factions within the
   party. We evaluate these hypotheses using a unique historical dataset on
   the background of ministers in Sweden between 1917 and 2014. Overall, we
   find strong support for the hypothesis that fiscal crises increase the
   likelihood that ministers will have a union background, suggesting that
   ministers are appointed to appease the union faction within the party in
   times of fiscal crisis.},

Abstract = {Corporatist Nordic welfare states are largely thought to have exemplary
   environmental policies. Finland, however, was labeled ``a failing
   ecostate{''} by a recent study owing to its weak climate change policy.
   Why is Finland different? We use data from a survey of organizations
   belonging to the Finnish climate change policy network to investigate
   two alternative explanations related to policy networks. According to
   the Cooptation Thesis, inclusive corporatist polities, where
   environmental NGOs (ENGOs) have support from and access to the state,
   formulate less ambitious policies because environmentalists moderate
   their views to secure state funding and political access. Second,
   according to the Treadmill of Production Theory, the decisive feature of
   Nordic corporatism with regard to environmental policy is the tripartite
   system linking business interests, labor unions, and the state in a
   coalition that prioritizes economic over ecological values. The results
   indicate that the ENGO Coalition is the least influential, least
   resourceful, smallest, least linked to the others, and not particularly
   moderate. The Treadmill Coalition is the most influential, most
   resourceful, second largest, well linked to the state, and least
   ecological in its beliefs. Thus, of the two policy network explanations,
   the dominance of the Treadmill Coalition rather than cooptation of ENGOs
   gets support.},

Abstract = {Regressive regimes are on the rise, implementing laws and policies
   designed to have a chilling effect on their opposition. They focus much
   of their ire on women and immigrants, creating fear-based narratives to
   justify militarizing the interior, fortifying the border, reducing civil
   liberties in the name of national security, and, less overtly,
   perpetuating patriarchal systems of power. Controlling women and
   immigrants is central to nativist political agendas. The focus on
   immigrants and women is purposeful, designed to provide the latitude
   that the Constitution arid international law may grant to political
   leaders allegedly operating within the arenas of sovereign authority and
   foreign affairs.},

Title = {Police integration and support for anti-government violence in divided

Abstract = {How does the demographic makeup of the police affect violent conflict in
   divided societies? I argue that following a shift in relative group
   power, integrating the police rank-and-file addresses incentives to
   rebel by solving a commitment problem between the powerful state and a
   weaker group. I test this argument using a survey experiment of 800
   Baghdad residents. Providing Sunni (minority) respondents with an
   informational prime that the police are integrated reduces support for
   anti-government violence. Consistent with the commitment mechanism,
   Sunnis, but not Shias, who receive the prime are less fearful of future
   repression by the government. The key mechanism is the way in which
   officers are distributed. It is more difficult for the state to renege
   on inclusion when minority officers serve in mixed units rather than
   being isolated in minority-only units. Patrol-level heterogeneity makes
   it difficult for the government to withhold equipment or information
   from officers on the basis of group identity, and makes the state
   reliant on officers from all groups to serve all parts of the country.
   Among survey respondents in Baghdad, I find that those who perceive the
   police as mixed between Sunnis and Shias, but not those who perceive
   officers to be primarily members of their own sect, are less expectant
   that the government will try to harm them. This article contributes to
   research on institutions in divided societies by identifying a form of
   inclusion which is self-enforcing, improving long-term prospects for
   peace by resolving underlying insecurities in the shadow of historical
   conflict.},

Abstract = {``Local culture{''} has been the focus of anthropological endeavour
   since the discipline's beginnings, and the concept has a long history of
   re-defining and re-framing on all levels (spatial, political, and so
   on). One particularly useful definition of ``culture{''} put forward by
   Bourdieu is that which is ``taken for granted{''}-what people do without
   necessarily being aware of it. Culture is, therefore, similar to
   ideology, and not unlike Foucault's notion of discourse, in that its
   workings are not explicit and visible to those who form part of that
   culture. Yet, is it really possible to distinguish the notion of ``local
   culture{''} as practice from discourses around that particular
   ``culture{''}? Houses of culture-institutions built in eastern Europe
   and the USSR during the socialist period used to host, represent, and
   change ``local culture{''}-can raise questions around the practice and
   performance of culture more generally.},

Volume = {57},
Number = {2},

Abstract = {Do international economic sanctions backfire politically, resulting in
   increased rather than decreased domestic support for targeted state
   leaders? Backfire arguments are common, but researchers have only
   recently begun systematically studying sanctions' impact on target-state
   public opinion, not yet fully unpacking different possible backfire
   mechanisms. We formulate backfire logic explicitly, distinguishing
   between `scapegoating' and `rallying' mechanisms and considering the
   special case of `smart sanctions' aimed at crony elites rather than the
   masses. We test five resulting hypotheses using an experimental design
   and pooled survey data spanning the imposition of sanctions in one of
   the most substantively important cases where the backfire argument has
   been prominent: Western sanctions on Russia in 2014. We find no evidence
   of broad sanctions backfire. Instead, sanctions have forced Russia's
   president to pay a political price. But this price has been low compared
   to the massive political benefits we document arising from the
   sanctions-triggering event, the Crimea annexation. Moreover, hidden by
   aggregate figures are signs of a `backlash of the better-off' by which
   `smart' sanctions turn economic well-being from a predictor of
   opposition into a predictor of regime support.},

Abstract = {This paper investigates states? commitment to human rights, democracy
   and rule of law through ratifying Council of Europe treaties. We present
   a first comprehensive analysis of ratifications of all 221 Council of
   Europe treaties that opened for ratification since 1949 among the 47
   current member states. Applying a multilevel Cox regression, we observe
   a strong influence of external sources for states? commitment and find
   evidence for both coercion and emulation mechanisms. First, upcoming EU
   membership is strongly and positively associated with treaty
   ratification, corroborating the relevance of accession conditionality in
   making countries to commit to human rights and democracy. Second, states
   are much more likely to ratify if a neighbouring country has ratified at
   the same time, which confirms a strong pattern of regional diffusion of
   rights acceptance in Europe. However, we find that this pattern of
   regional diffusion is stronger among states with lower levels of
   democracy, suggesting that emulation proceeds through mimicry. Finally,
   our analysis shows that Council of Europe treaty ratification is
   especially strong during the first years after treaty opening,
   suggesting that ratification reflects concerted efforts by states
   involved in the negotiation of regional treaties.},

Abstract = {What explains a patron's decision to publicly condone, condemn, or forgo
   commenting on its client's unilateral provocations? We present a new
   theoretical framework that identifies a patron's two strategic
   considerations - maximizing its sphere of influence and avoiding
   entanglement - and factors that affect them. We claim that whenever a
   patron faces a great power rivalry or a vulnerable client, it is more
   likely to condone its client's provocations in order to safeguard its
   sphere of influence. On the other hand, when the risk of escalation
   looms large, the patron is more likely to condemn its client's
   provocations in order to avoid entanglement. Focusing on the Sino-North
   Korean patron-client relationship, we test our theory on an original
   dataset that tracks China's official reactions to provocations initiated
   by North Korea. We find that China tends to condone North Korea's
   provocations when the USA criticizes them, and refrains from condemning
   when North Korea is domestically fragile. We also find that China is
   more likely to condemn its client's provocations in the period after
   North Korea became a nuclear state. In addition, we draw on examples
   from the USA-Pakistan and the USA-Israel patron-client relationships to
   illustrate our causal logic. This article offers new insights on how a
   patron manages its client's unruly behavior, and provides the first
   large-N evidence on China's responses to North Korean provocations from
   1981 to 2016.},

Abstract = {Face-to-face encounters are well embedded in reconciliation processes
   and are meant to break down stereotypes and misconceptions and to
   ``re-humanize the Other{''}, facilitating a transformation that would
   have a ``healing{''} effect for entire communities. Based on
   ``face-to-face encounters{''} in Israel/Palestine and in the Western
   Balkans (Serbia, Bosnia-Herzegovina and Croatia), I demonstrate that
   what happens is quite the opposite. Instead of blurring ethnic/religious
   identities, these structured encounters ossify historical narratives
   that serve to ethnically homogenise, polarise and essentialize the
   participant' understanding of selfhood, stratifying them according to
   their ethnic belonging. As a result, these encounters result in
   enforcing ethnic identities.},

Title = {`Representation' and Daibiao: a comparative study of the notions

Journal = {JOURNAL OF CHINESE GOVERNANCE},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {4},
Number = {4, SI},
Pages = {362-389},

Abstract = {By scrutinizing the semantics of words and going beyond a nominalist
   approach, this article compares the theoretical, linguistic and
   discursive evolution of the notion of representation in France and
   China, from its ancient origins to its contemporary interpretations. We
   argue that the word ``representation{''} in English and ``daibiao{''} in
   Chinese are not interchangeable synonymous, because ``representation{''}
   includes a symbolic dimension that is absent in daibiao, and because the
   latter is rarely used when informal representation is concerned. We also
   argue that both Chinese and Anglo-American political science research
   overemphasizes mandated representation and underestimates symbolic
   representation. Furthermore, our empirical research in three provinces
   of China and two regions of France demonstrates that in both countries,
   local officials and elected politicians serve a similar role of
   political intermediaries, who embody state power and respond to
   citizens' demands simultaneously, thus enabling a de-facto
   representative loop. Such argument refutes the current understanding of
   representation as a ``one-way authorization{''} that is supposed to come
   either from below (i.e. from the people) in the electoral democracies or
   from above (i.e. from the state authority) in authoritarian regimes and
   thus challenges the over-simplistic dichotomy of democratic and
   authoritarian regimes in representative studies.},

Title = {The Transparency and Accountability Learning of the Spanish

Journal = {REVISTA DEL CLAD REFORMA Y DEMOCRACIA},

Abstract = {This article studies the instrumental development of transparency in the
   Spanish municipalities' websites between 2011-2017, under two different
   regulations on transparency and good governance. The research method
   consists of the study of 41 indicators, later expanded to 52 to adjust
   it to the reform of the legislation on transparency and access to public
   information, approved in 2013. The general objective is the
   investigation of the resources, the traits and the practices of public
   communication that the municipalities carry out through the web. The
   particular goal is the identification of these resources on the
   websites, as well as the possible structural and message deficiencies.
   The indicators are published and updated in successive waves into the
   Map Infoparticip@ platform (http://www.mapainfoparticipa.com). The
   research work has a universe of 2,930 municipalities, although the
   sample used for this article is reduced to 400 cities that have more
   than 20,001 registered inhabitants. This sample allows a qualitative
   analysis that include what variations have been observed, what type of
   treatment is offered or what citizen services have appeared in the
   period. The result of this paper announces that the regulation on
   transparency, access to public information and good governance does not
   ensure better results in the publication of information on municipal
   websites. The indicators analyzed offer worse results, regardless the
   size of the municipality or the change in ownership and political
   orientation of the mayor's office. It advocates, on the other hand, for
   a culture of broader transparency that involves civil society and
   encourages citizen participation. The legal approach to transparency
   issues reduces its positive effect on the public management of
   municipalities.},

Abstract = {How do legacies of conflict affect choices between state and nonstate
   legal institutions? This article studies this question in Chechnya,
   where state law coexists with Sharia and customary law. The author
   focuses on the effect of conflict-induced disruption of gender
   hierarchies because the dominant interpretations of religious and
   customary norms are discriminatory against women. The author finds that
   women in Chechnya are more likely than men to rely on state law and that
   this gender gap in legal preferences and behavior is especially large in
   more-victimized communities. The author infers from this finding that
   the conflict created the conditions for women in Chechnya to pursue
   their interests through state law-albeit not without resistance. Women's
   legal mobilization has generated a backlash from the Chechen government,
   which has attempted to reinstate a patriarchal order. The author
   concludes that conflict may induce legal mobilization among the weak and
   that gender may become a central cleavage during state-building
   processes in postconflict environments.},

Abstract = {Pressure from the media affects the daily work of bureaucrats and
   induces `media stress', with potentially critical effects on the quality
   of public policy. This article analyses how bureaucrats' daily work has
   been adapted to the media ('mediatised') and which groups of bureaucrats
   experience the most media-stress. Reporting the results of an original
   and large-scale survey (N=4,655) this article demonstrates that levels
   of media-stress vary among different groups of civil servants. In turn,
   its analysis suggests that media-stress is more pronounced in the
   Netherlands than in Norway, is more concentrated in the lower rungs of
   administrative hierarchies and is related to media pressures on
   organisations. By untangling the underlying logic of mediatisation and
   the dynamics of media-stress, this article makes an important
   contribution to extant scholarship and also provides a series of
   practical recommendations.},

Abstract = {The delegation of authority to private companies in the security domain
   has certain advantages for states. It optimizes security, lowers costs
   and eschews accountability. The aim of this article is to examine the
   implications of the increasing role of private security companies
   within, at and beyond the borders of state sovereignty. This article
   argues that the growing power of private security companies in the
   prevention and the regulation of unauthorized flows of people and goods
   produces contradictory tendencies for state sovereignty. As private
   security companies fulfil roles that were previously under the exclusive
   authority of state actors, states have lost their exclusivity with
   respect to their coercive and performative roles. Yet, the privatization
   of security is the result of the calculated decisions of state actors to
   increase their coercive power against unauthorized border crossers. Even
   though states' sovereign exclusivity is being weakened with the
   privatization of the security domain, both state and private actors work
   towards strengthening states' sovereign authority by excluding and
   deterring unauthorized movements of people and goods.},

Abstract = {Armed drones are now a key component of military strategy; however,
   little empirical research has explored the phenomenon in terms of
   psychological processes. Previous research has emphasized the importance
   of basic human values for structuring understandings of and opinions
   towards foreign policy issues. Using a social representations approach,
   we used a multilevel modeling approach to explore the link between
   values and support for the use of armed drones in the United Kingdom,
   the United States, and Turkey. In line with our predictions, high
   priority of self-transcendence values negatively predicted, and high
   priority of conservation values positively predicted, support for armed
   drones. Furthermore, given our theoretical framework, we specified that
   values should be conceptualized as prioritized or devalued within a
   particular context, and when values were specified as country-level, as
   well as individual predictors, this led to an increase in model fit.
   These findings are discussed in light of a developing line of research
   on meta-representations and their consequences for political opinion,
   and directions for future research are advanced.},

Abstract = {In this article, we examine the dynamics of the Kurdish-Turkish peace
   process that collapsed in the summer of 2015. The negotiations began
   when the conflict reached a certain level of ripeness, one that made it
   possible for both sides to entertain the possibility of compromise on
   various taboo issues. However, in the face of both domestic and
   international developments, the process came to an abrupt halt. This
   article argues that the main reason the process stalled was because it
   was built from the start around the idea of ``resolution{''} rather than
   ``transformation,{''} a concept better suited to responding to highly
   fluid asymmetric conflicts.},

Abstract = {Why is there variation in the level of overfishing in European Union
   member states? The Common Fisheries Policy sets politically-negotiated
   quotas for fishing, but different states break the quotas at different
   levels. One answer for this variation lies within the domestic
   institutions of the member states themselves, in particular the
   incentives created by various electoral rules. Electoral rules which add
   more political parties to the decisionmaking process result in greater
   amounts of overfishing because smaller and smaller blocks of voters are
   more important in such instances. Evidence in favor of this theory comes
   from a unique window into fisheries compliance: the `scorecards'
   produced by the European Commission from 2001 to 2004.},

Abstract = {Over the past three decades, along with the expansion of the phenomenon
   of global jihad, we have witnessed a growing trend of converts to Islam
   integrating into global jihad organizations. Some of these converts
   constitute an important element in the terrorist infrastructure,
   globally, and particularly in the West. Some are recruited as foreign
   fighters into the ranks of the Islamic State or other Islamic extremist
   organizations. Global jihad organizations have identified the potential
   of new converts (knowledge of the local culture, the difficulty in
   tracking them faced by intelligence organizations), and they are
   investing efforts in every possible arena (physical and digital) to
   recruit them for terrorist activity. The converts, for their part, are
   more vulnerable to recruitment for terrorist purposes. The aim of the
   article is to illuminate the existing phenomenon of radicalization among
   new converts to Islam and expand the current knowledge base with regard
   to the variables that affect the growth of this phenomenon and the
   background and preconditions for such growth. Moreover, this article
   will attempt to use the above in order to design and develop effective

Abstract = {The restructuring process of sovereign debt is not yet managed under
   common global rules; public debt stabilisation is an explicit policy
   goal in the EU, but cannot be achieved if local public authorities do
   not control their liabilities and connected risks. EU local
   administrations' debt soared due to the economic downturn, reduced
   resources transferred from the central state and increasing expenses.
   After 2000, French and Italian local authorities extensively underwrote
   complex financial instruments, such as over the counter (OTC) interest
   rate and exchange rate derivatives and structured loans (i.e. loans with
   embedded derivatives) to manage their growing liabilities; the
   proliferation of derivatives among European public administrations has
   been favoured by the absence of proper disclosure and of monitoring
   procedures. Losses due to structured loans accumulated and in 2017
   French local authorities asked for state rescue; similarly, some Italian
   regions and municipalities reported relevant losses. The reduction of
   financial risks can be achieved by improving information and
   transparency, by reducing moral hazard, and limiting `revolving doors'.},

Title = {Intimidating voters with violence and mobilizing them with clientelism},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF PEACE RESEARCH},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {56},
Number = {5},
Pages = {682-696},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Recent research suggests that intimidating voters and electoral
   clientelism are two strategies on the menu of manipulation, often used
   in conjunction. We do not know much, however, about who is targeted with
   which of these illicit electoral strategies. This article devises and
   tests a theoretical argument on the targeting of clientelism and
   intimidation across different voters. We argue that in contexts where
   violence can be used to influence elections, parties may choose to
   demobilize swing and opposition voters, which frees up resources to
   mobilize their likely supporters with clientelism. While past research
   on this subject has either been purely theoretical or confined to single
   country studies, we offer a first systematic cross-national and
   multilevel analysis of clientelism and voter intimidation in seven
   African countries. We analyze which voters most fear being intimidated
   with violence and which get targeted with clientelistic benefits,
   combining new regional-level election data with Afrobarometer survey
   data. In a multilevel analysis, we model the likelihood of voters being
   targeted with either strategy as a function of both past election
   results of the region they live in and their partisan status. We find
   that voters living in incumbent strongholds are most likely to report
   having being bribed in elections, whereas those living in opposition
   strongholds are most fearful of violent intimidation. We further provide
   suggestive evidence of a difference between incumbent supporters and
   other voters. We find support that incumbent supporters are more likely
   to report being targeted with clientelism, and mixed support for the
   idea that they are less fearful of intimidation. Our findings allow us
   to define potential hot spots of intimidation. They also provide an
   explanation for why parties in young democracies concentrate more
   positive inducements on their own supporters than the swing voter model
   of campaigning would lead us to expect.},

Abstract = {This article examines the relationship between local participatory
   policies and their market in France. The study stems from long-term
   field research drawing on a variety of materials: qualitative interviews
   with citizen participation professionals (consultants or civil
   servants), questionnaires, and an analysis of public procurement. This
   study depicts the way both the industry and the policies of citizen
   participation are structured in France. It also explores how French
   participatory policies are coproduced through mechanisms of
   competition-collusion between clients (mainly local public authorities)
   and providers (consultants). Finally, the study questions the effects of
   this market on local policies, showing that the market cannot be
   interpreted as an unequivocal sign of a decline in actors along with
   political stakes in public policies.},

Abstract = {The public sector is under pressure to provide new public services with
   increasingly scarce resources. In response, practitioners and academics
   have called for more innovation in the public sector. Our understanding
   of sources of innovation within public sector organizations, however, is
   inadequate. Motivated by this gap, we develop a conceptual model of how
   push and pull sources enable innovation within public sector
   organizations. Key to our theory is that push and pull sources of
   innovation are enabled by innovation capabilities. Five hypotheses are
   tested using cross-country survey data from European public sector
   organizations. Empirical analysis offers strong support for the central
   role played by innovation capability in enabling push and pull sources
   of innovation within public sector organizations. This article advances
   knowledge of the sources of innovation in the public sector and extends
   theorizing on push and pull mechanisms by examining their relevance to
   innovation in a public sector context.},

Abstract = {Building upon existing literature, we offer a particular model of
   network policy diffusion-which we call sustained organizational
   influence. Sustained organizational influence necessitates an
   institutional focus across a broad range of issues and across a long
   period of time. Sustaining organizations are well-financed, and exert
   their influence on legislators through benefits, shared ideological
   interests, and time-saving opportunities. Sustaining organizations'
   centralized nature makes legislators' jobs easier by providing
   legislators with ready-made model legislation. We argue that sustaining
   organizations uniquely contribute to policy diffusion in the U.S.
   states. We evaluate this model with a case study of state-level
   immigration sanctuary policy making and the role that the American
   Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC) played in disseminating model
   legislation. Through quantitative text analysis and several negative
   binomial state-level regression models, we demonstrate that ALEC has
   exerted an overwhelming influence on the introduction of anti-sanctuary
   legislative proposals in the U.S. states over the past 7 years
   consistent with our particular model of network policy diffusion.
   Implications are discussed.},

Abstract = {Diversity management has received considerable attention in public
   management research. Most existing research, however, analyses the
   effects rather than the determinants of diversity management. Using
   panel data on American hospitals from 2008 to 2011, we probe how market
   competition, inter-organizational collaboration and clientele diversity
   affect diversity management adoption. We find that all three
   environmental factors increase diversity management adoption. Hospitals
   in competitive markets are more likely to adopt diversity management
   strategies when they engage in extensive service collaboration and serve
   a diverse population. Monopolies in less collaborative environments lag
   behind in adopting diversity management, especially when they serve
   ethnically homogenous populations. Our findings broaden understandings
   about what drives diversity management practices and add to the
   literature on the external contingency of managerial practice.},

Abstract = {How does combat affect insurgent violence against civilians? Existing
   studies emphasize the role of combat outcomes, but have not explored the
   direct effects of various combat events. This article argues that one
   such event, government attacks on the rebels, has a positive effect on
   insurgent violence that stems from the logic of guerrilla warfare. In
   guerrilla wars, government forces tend to rely on informants in finding
   the insurgents. Their attacks therefore often evince civilian
   denunciation. To deter future denunciations, the rebels have incentives
   to subsequently punish the suspected or known denunciator. This argument
   is probed using detailed original data from Nepal's Maoist insurgency. A
   panel analysis shows that government attacks were positively associated
   with rebel violence against civilians, and especially with violence
   against suspected informants. Process-tracing evidence further supports
   the argument, suggesting that the rebels used violence strategically to
   prevent information leaks and government attacks.},

Abstract = {Although class relations are situated within workplaces, research on
   class income shares has neither examined firm-level mechanisms nor
   distinguished between managerial and non-managerial workers within the
   class of labor. This article analyzes the effects of union power on the
   distribution of shares of income between capital, top managers, and
   non-managerial workers at the firm-level during the neoliberal era.
   Using data on US airlines from 1977 to 2005 I find that strikes are
   central to shaping the firm-level distribution of income shares, but in
   an unexpected way. Strikes redistribute income away from non-managerial
   workers, without affecting either profit or top managerial income
   shares. These results suggest that analyses of income distribution
   across classes must incorporate a more detailed class schema as well as
   observe effects of deunionization at the firm level. Moreover, the
   findings provide further evidence that firm-level mechanisms are shaped
   by the institutional context in which firms operate.},

Abstract = {Scholars have argued that government agencies face a complex web of
   reputational concerns regarding how they are perceived by multiple
   audiences who prioritise different dimensions of their work. Drawing on
   social identity theory, we argue that civil servants are concerned about
   the reputation of the agency for which they work, but also about other
   actors in the political-administrative system. Focusing on hierarchy,
   socialisation, and independence, we hypothesised six possible
   relationships, which we tested via a multilevel analysis of a survey of
   more than 2,000 Norwegian agency employees. This reveals that
   bureaucratic reputation depends not only on how external audiences
   perceive the agency, but also on how agency employees perceive
   themselves, particularly in terms of their professional background and
   organisational affinity. This article therefore highlights the multiple
   identities of civil servants and the multifaceted aspects of
   reputational concern; and argues that future research should pay
   attention to these hitherto neglected intersections of reputation.},

Abstract = {This article aims to share a framework composed of key practices put in
   place to enhance stakeholder engagement in participatory governance
   processes. The experience was gained through the authors' involvement in
   three Portuguese practice-based cases on participatory local strategic
   planning where the framework was successfully applied in overcoming the
   major risks of these participatory processes identified in the
   literature. A preliminary evaluation of the applied framework's
   strengths and weaknesses is provided, envisioned to support similar
   initiatives. The quality and diversity of the stakeholders involved,
   together with the group dynamics applied, were recognized as the main
   strengths, since they promote equal participation, knowledge sharing,
   new ideas and consensus reaching, with stakeholders being highly
   committed with the planned objectives and actions. In two cases, the
   plans supported successful applications to 2014-2020 European Structural
   Funds' policy instruments, resulting in the allocation of important
   funds to local entities, vital for territorial development.},

   Press, xiv, 16) advanced a conception of policy analysis -
   ``Deliberative Policy Analysis{''} - that ``rests on three pillars:
   interpretation, practice and deliberation.{''} This form of policy
   analysis, they argued, supports ``more direct, participatory forms of
   democracy{''} involving ``democratic deliberation on concrete issues{''}
   (xv, 29). Since their writing, empirical research on such initiatives -
   ``democratic innovations,{''} for short - has blossomed. However, while
   deliberative policy analysis is itself post-positivist in orientation,
   many researchers bring a (quasi-) positivist orientation to their work
   on democratic innovations. A key challenge for deliberative policy
   analysts is, then, how to participate in this field of inquiry while
   maintaining a post-positivist orientation. Pragmatist philosophy, I
   submit, can help them to meet this challenge. Pragmatism rejects a
   number of positivist assumptions about the nature of empirical inquiry.
   Relatedly, it supports the claim that policy analysis should be
   interpretive, practice-oriented, and deliberative. Indeed, it suggests
   that policy analysis cannot avoid being so. By way of illustration, I
   indicate how pragmatism points to an approach to case study research
   that rests on the three pillars.},

Abstract = {Business interest groups numerically dominate the European Union (EU)
   interest group communities. However, scholars note that the relative
   proportion of business interests varies by either the institutional
   venue or the policy issue. Exchange-theoretical approaches emphasize the
   distinct informational needs of policy-makers at different venues,
   hereby favoring business actors to a varying degree. Other scholars
   emphasize the importance of conflict and argue that containment or
   expansion of conflict on concrete policy issues shapes the relative
   presence of business interest representatives. We simultaneously test
   both hypotheses comparing interest group activities on seventy issues
   observed in the European Parliament, the European Commission and in the
   EU media. We find little differences between the EU venues in terms of
   the interests represented. Rather, the salience and scope of issues seem
   more important denominators for variation in business lobby activity.},

Abstract = {This paper contributes to theory development about the politics of
   overlapping organizations. It explains how organizational overlap can
   affect the execution of organizational mandates. Within the universe of
   intergovernmental overlapping organizations, I argue that we need to
   study institutional positions in conjunction with governmental
   preferences. Based on these two variables, member-states have different
   strategies at their disposal: hostage-taking, forum-shopping, and
   brokering. These strategies affect the formulation and implementation of
   multilateral commitments. Taking the EU-NATO overlap as an example, I
   show how these strategies can lead to compromised organizational
   mandates, where hostage-taking leads to long delays in sending troops,
   operational uncertainties and wasted resources and brokers are left with
   innovating informal solutions.},

   knowledge production in attractiveness and image-building. While the
   existing literature focuses on China's media cooperation from the
   perspective of establishing Chinese media outlets in Africa, this
   article identifies an understudied aspect of China's strategy in
   Africa-that of investing in human resource development and professional
   training programmes for African journalists. The study constructs its
   analysis based on a series of in-depth interviews and official document
   analysis. The findings suggest that Chinese-sponsored professional
   development programmes for African journalists are an opportunity for
   African trainees to be socialised in Chinese values, norms, and expert
   knowledge. These trainings contribute to build a positive image of China
   in Africa and are far more successful than material approaches including
   establishing Chinese media outlets across Africa.},

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL STUDIES QUARTERLY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {63},
Number = {2},
Pages = {259-269},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {In May 2017, the Tunisian military allowed protesters to storm and shut
   down an oil valve in Tataouine, in contravention of a direct order from
   President Essebsi to defend the production site. While scholars have
   recently examined military defection during mass uprisings, these
   protests were small and localized. Why did the military disobey
   President Essebsi in Tataouine? Drawing upon a survey of military
   officers conducted six months prior to the defection, I show that the
   military's composition and corporate interests, rather than its
   professionalism, likely prompted its defection. The majority of the
   military hails from impoverished regions in Tunisia's neglected interior
   and identifies with the demands of protesters in these regions. The
   military also saw the curtailment of its material and political
   interests in early 2017, giving it little incentive to repress
   protesters on the regime's behalf. Methodologically, this study provides
   some of the first survey data of military officers' attitudes toward
   defection.},

Title = {Putting the EU Global Security Strategy to test: `cooperative orders'
   and othering in EU-Russia relations},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL POLITICS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {56},
Number = {3},
Pages = {304-320},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {This paper examines the notion of othering and its role in the
   development of cooperative regional orders, prioritised by the EU Global
   Security Strategy. It argues that the conceptual underpinnings of the
   relationship between the inside and the outside, the established Self
   and the emergent Other, are too often taken for granted and in a
   fragmenting global order require urgent re-conceptualisation. Drawing on
   post-structuralist and Freudian work, the paper contends that while
   living in an increasingly complex and contested world, it is imperative
   to develop a more nuanced understanding of a changing global order as
   relational and interdependent. This would require a new
   conceptualisation of othering as a reciprocal nexus (rather than an
   opposition or even juxtaposition) between the Self and the Other, to
   ensure that cooperative orders would form and become sustainable.},

Abstract = {The literature on public value creation has grown significantly in
   recent years. However, how such generation of public value is linked to
   the interaction between individual and organizational capabilities, and
   the role played by leadership in such interaction, is still
   underexplored. This analysis of the congestion charge zone (Area C)
   implemented by the Municipality of Milan in Italy explores this issue
   and highlights the role played by the knowledge orchestrator who, by
   assuming different leadership roles at different times, strives to
   create value through knowledge mobilization. Leveraging from existing
   resources, the knowledge orchestrator captures knowledge from the
   external environment and promotes collaboration among individuals and
   institutions, so as to generate a new reconfigured stock of knowledge.
   These activities nurture the capacity of public organizations to
   collaborate, produce innovations, and more broadly contribute to public
   value creation.},

Abstract = {The Eurozone and migration crises have reconfigured sovereignty in the
   European Union. The Eurozone has moved from an outright prohibition to a
   conditional acceptance of bailouts, and the Schengen regime has extended
   into the long sacrosanct national turf of border control. Building on
   recent scholarship on sovereignty practices, we argue that EU leaders
   worked out crisis responses that shifted broad understandings of how
   sovereignty was practiced. Our main claim is that politicization, in
   situations of crisis, can accelerate the reconfiguration of fragile
   sovereignty practices. After a crisis reveals the vulnerability of
   existing sovereignty practices, EU leaders search for integrationist
   remedies, incorporate sovereignty concerns as key reform ingredients,
   and coalesce to marginalize sovereignty claims that threaten
   integration. This logic calls into question the widespread view that
   politicization necessarily carries dismal prospects for integration.},

   completely ignore the role of human rights education, HRE. Whether it is
   Samuel Moyn and Stephen Hopgood declaring the demise of what they also

   none explore the effect HRE is having or can have. This article argues
   that those who neglect to recognize the substantial and substantive
   conversation going on in our institutions of higher education cannot
   provide a complete picture of the human rights project. It will
   demonstrate which of the naysayers Moyn and Hopgood's arguments are
   weakened by ignoring HRE and argue that Sikkink's recommendations for
   human rights efforts can be strengthened by HRE. Also explored is what
   HRE should learn from the critiques of these three scholars and how
   university HRE can be improved.},

Abstract = {This paper starts from the premise that the politicization of Europe is
   indicative of a new structuring conflict that involves a set of
   processes which put the national political community under strain. This
   structuring conflict has been emerging long before the Euro and refugee
   crises. However, these crises may have reinforced and potentially
   reshaped public conflicts within and across countries. Therefore, the
   paper traces the politicization of Europe during national election
   campaigns in fifteen countries from the early 2000s up to 2017. The
   analysis focuses on the way the multiple crises have affected the level
   of politicization, its driving forces, and the location of European
   issues in the political space. Overall, the results indicate a
   substantive increase in politicization, but they also point to strong
   region and crisis-specific varieties which should be considered in
   scholarly discussions on the relative impact of domestic conflicts on
   the future course of European integration.},

Abstract = {A `dually open' free movement system has evolved in the European Union
   (EU), granting EU citizens the right to free movement within the Union
   as well as cross-border welfare rights. Some scholarly literature and
   public debates have characterised the system as corrosive to the
   nationally organised welfare state, which will become a `magnet' for the
   European poor. This paper examines how the German and Danish welfare
   states have responded to the `dual open' system and its outcomes in
   terms of EU citizens' take-up rate of non-contributory benefits between
   2007 and 2015. We show that the domestic responses were mostly
   restrictive and that outcomes remained rather stable. Our findings do
   not support the welfare magnet thesis but instead identify a tendency to
   a bifurcated social protection system for EU citizens in Germany.},

Abstract = {Gender differences regarding the perception of and behaviour toward
   environmental problems are well documented: across countries, women
   express higher concern about the environment and are more likely to act
   pro-environmentally than men. Investigations of an environmental gender
   gap at elite level are, however, limited. To fill this void and to
   inquire whether female representatives are more likely to hold
   pro-environmental attitudes than their male colleagues and adjust their
   legislative behaviour accordingly, survey and roll call vote data of the
   sixth and seventh European Parliament are analysed. Male and female
   legislators expressed similar concern for the environment, yet women
   were significantly more likely to support environmental legislation than
   men - even after controlling for political ideology and nationality. In
   light of the continuing underrepresentation of women across
   legislatures, these results indicate that environmental policies are
   disproportionally shaped by men's preferences.},

Title = {An Examination of the Structural Properties of the Extremism Risk
   Guidelines (ERG22+): A Structured Formulation Tool for Extremist
   Offenders},
Journal = {TERRORISM AND POLITICAL VIOLENCE},
Year = {2019},
Month = {2019 MAY 2},
Abstract = {This paper explores the construct validity and structural properties of
   the ERG22+ formulation tool, used in the assessment of risk and need in
   extremist offenders. The ERG22+ was developed from a clinical
   perspective, and was based on the small number of case studies and
   limited research evidence that were available at the time. It suggests
   three domains relevant to risk, namely Engagement, Intent, and
   Capability. These were originally offered as a guide to risk formulation
   within a functional analysis framework, but were not empirically
   derived. The items within the ERG22+ are scored on ordinal ratings which
   offers the possibility to develop subscales within the tool, but the
   conceptual overlap across the domains offered suggests that these would
   not be empirically reproduced. In this paper the structural properties
   of the ERG22+ were examined through factor analysis and multidimensional
   scaling (MDS) to inform the development of measurement scales. The
   ERG22+ shows promise as a risk and need formulation tool, which could be
   developed further in light of the findings from this study. Issues of
   content validity and areas for further development are discussed.},

Abstract = {The world going low carbon is believed to put an end to petrostates, and
   to force incumbent oil producers to diversify their economies away from
   fossil fuels. This article challenges this assumption. Whether
   petrostates are in for the long game or end up with a `panic and pump'
   strategy, it is argued, is a function of the lifting costs and the
   social costs of producing oil. What is more, the low-carbon energy
   transition may well throw petrostates an additional lifeline, as fast
   decarbonizing OECD countries will shed some of their most
   energy-intensive sectors, including refineries and petrochemicals, which
   opens up new export opportunities. Particularly for Middle Eastern
   petrostates it may therefore be very rational to further specialize in
   the high-carbon segment. The policy challenge, therefore, will be
   twofold: managing a rapidly changing energy system in order to secure
   the transformation dividends it will bring, for human security and
   economic welfare; and balancing the (geo) political after pains of the
   incumbent fuels leaving the system.},

Abstract = {This article examines two competing theories explaining the effects of
   political satire on citizens in an authoritarian context. The
   ``activism{''} proposition argues that political satire works as a form
   of resistance to erode people's support for the regime and encourages
   collective action. The ``cynicism{''} proposition argues that while
   satire discourages regime support, it also discourages political
   participation. Our online survey experiment on young Chinese Internet
   users provides evidence supporting the cynicism proposition. Satire
   consumption reduces audiences' political trust, deflates their political
   efficacy, and discourages them from participating in politics, as it
   reduces the perceived severity of political problems and implies that
   audience participation is useless. We conclude that the dissemination of
   political satire may stabilize the authoritarian regime temporarily but
   induces it to become erosive in the long run.},

Abstract = {The European Parliament is one of the most studied legislatures in the
   world. The general consensus in most of these analyses is that the power
   of the EP in the legislative processes of the EU has increased
   precipitously, since the introduction of the co-decisionprocedure. One
   continuing perceived weakness of the EP, however, is its inability to
   introduce new legislation. While the EP can request that the Commission
   initiate a proposal, it lacks the power to introduce bills itself. This
   research looks at the indirect agenda power of the EP through an
   analysis of EP own initiative resolutions and their impact on the policy
   agenda of the EU. The research introduces anew dataset on all EP
   resolutions between 2000 and 2015 and compares the pre- and post-2009
   period to assess the impact of formal treaty changes to the legislative
   role of the EP have had on its agenda-settingcapacity.},

Abstract = {This article assesses the role of the Directorates Generals (DGs) led by
   the Commissioners in the EU legislative decision-making by testing two
   perspectives: `the Watchdog' and `the Mandarin' of the EU principals.
   The former suggests that a conflict of preferences between the DGs will
   notify the EU principals of prospective bureaucratic drift, leading to
   more restrictive discretionary limits imposed on the Commission in the
   implementation stage. However, if the lead DG acts as the Mandarin,
   proximity of its preference to the EU principals should result in more
   executive leeway as its policy preference is more beneficial for the EU
   legislators. To tests the conjunctions, this study focuses on two
   dimensions of EU political space: Left-Right (LR) and Pro/Anti-EU. The
   results suggest that the legislators will indulge the Commission with
   more leeway for the implementation when their preferences are more
   congruent with the position of the lead DG on the LR dimension, thus
   supporting `the Mandarin' perspective.},

Abstract = {This article investigates two ways in which state involvement in
   religion-minority and majority restriction-generates terrorism. Using a
   time-series, cross-national negative binomial analysis of 174 countries
   from 1991-2009, this study finds that when religiously devout people
   find themselves marginalized through either form of religious
   restriction, they are more likely to pursue their aims through violence.
   The article concludes with recommendations for policymakers.},

Abstract = {Why do intergovernmental organizations (IGOs) that espouse democratic
   commitments suspend the membership of some states that backslide on
   those commitments, while leaving that of others intact? We argue that a
   combination of geopolitical factors and institutional rules help explain
   this inconsistent pattern. Remaining member states insulate
   geopolitically important statesuparticularly those with large endowments
   of oil resourcesufrom suspension. Institutional factors, such as voting
   rules and the size of the IGO, create veto points that reduce
   suspensions. Using an original global data set of IGO suspensions and
   charter commitments from 1980 to 2010, we find strong support for our
   argument. We test a key assumption of existing scholarship that claims
   IGOs serve as credible-commitment devices for political reform and
   democratization. We show that once a state becomes an IGO member, it can
   often remain in the IGO even after violating its democratic commitments.},

Title = {Crime and punishment: A realistic group conflict approach to racial
   discrimination in hiring convicted felons},

Abstract = {Purpose A surprisingly large proportion of the working population of the
   USA consists of individuals with felony convictions. Moreover, the issue
   of employability of these individuals is compounded for minorities. This
   paper aims to present two experimental studies investigating whether
   minorities with felony backgrounds have a more difficult time being
   selected for employment than identically situated white applicants. The
   authors ground the paper in realistic group conflict theory. Results
   indicate discrimination is more acute against minorities with felony
   backgrounds than whites with the same background and shed light on the
   mechanisms leading to this discrimination. Theoretical and practical
   implications are discussed.
   Design/methodology/approach This paper involves two experimental studies
   involving working adults engaging with realistic survey situations using
   mTurk.
   Findings Results of both studies indicate discrimination is more acute
   against minorities with felony backgrounds than whites with the same
   background, and shed light on the mechanisms leading to this
   discrimination.
   Research limitations/implications One limitation of the methodology is
   that the authors used fictional candidates and jobs. This may have led
   to understating the effects of discrimination on minorities because it
   allowed applicants to answer in socially desirable ways (e.g. absent of
   racial bias) without suffering any of the anticipated negative
   consequences of actually hiring individuals about whom they hold
   negative stereotypes.
   Practical implications This research has several important implications
   for practice. First, organizations should be keenly aware of the
   potential for subtle and unconscious bias to affect the job application
   process even among well-intentioned hiring managers. Second, as the bias
   is often triggered by threats, organizations should share with their
   employees the nature of the threat involved with former felons.
   Social implications Organizations should deliberately address issues
   associated with the use of criminal background checks. For many
   organizations, a felony conviction in an applicant's background
   automatically eliminates that person from employment. However, a
   substantial amount of the workforce now has a felony in their
   background. Indeed, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (2012)
   has issued guidelines that detail important factors that organizations
   should consider on a case-by-case basis when considering employment for
   former felons. Organizations may consider updating any blanket
   exclusions regarding the hiring of ex-felons - not only because it makes
   good policy but also because it may help the organization hire the best
   people.
   Originality/value This research studies an important - and growing -
   societal problem related to the hiring of convicted felons, and the
   related issue of racial discrimination that affects black convicted
   felons particularly hard. There has been very little work in the
   management area on this topic. Moreover, there has been very little work
   in all areas that includes experimental methods. The use of such methods
   is particularly useful to eliminate confounds found in field data.},

Abstract = {This paper aims to analyze the importance of a management system against
   bribery based on the ISO 37001 standard, designed to raise a culture
   against corruption and implement accurate controls within an
   organization, in a way that increases effectiveness to detect corruption
   and reduce its incidence. This system could be independent or integrated
   to a global management system. The payment of bribes is a latent problem
   within the State and in the private and non-profit sectors, carried out
   both by or against an organization and its personnel as well as through
   or by a third party.},

Abstract = {What determines the incentives of governments and businesses to invest
   in skills needed for higher value-added activities? While many factors
   matter, this article focuses on the motivations and the role of
   political parties in government. A policy analysis in Poland and Romania
   between 1989 and 2015, shows how governments can determine a change in
   the supply of skills even in relatively new democracies. We tackle the
   variation in the supply of sophisticated skills in the two countries and
   find that, unlike governments dominated by national-conservative
   parties, governments dominated by liberal parties have strategically
   steered the supply of skills in the economy. They have simultaneously
   identified and incentivized three key actors to invest in higher added
   value activities: (1) They have steered their higher education
   institutions towards offering degrees conducive to research and
   development; (2) they have incentivized students through scholarships or
   through secure employment by fostering links with enterprises; and (3)
   they have bargained with multinational companies to attract
   sophisticated activities. The article suggests that political parties
   should figure more prominently in political economy scholarship focusing
   on CEE. Moreover, this work speaks to a broader debate about the role of
   political parties in skill formation and in institutional change more
   generally.},

Abstract = {Some scholars consider that European Union agencies (EAs) were created
   as independent bodies in order to enhance the credibility of the
   European Union decision-making process. Scholars have typically focused
   on analysing the relationship that these agencies have with politicians.
   However, relatively little attention has been paid to their relationship
   with stakeholders. This study examines the professional trajectory of EA
   board members, identifying their career ties with politicians and
   stakeholders. Using an original dataset on the career trajectories of
   338 top officials in 33 EAs, the findings provide evidence that the type
   of appointing body matters: on the one hand, the European Parliament is
   more likely - than the Commission - to appoint individuals having career
   ties to politicians; on the other hand, multiple veto players are less
   likely to designate board members linked to political players.
   Additionally, the findings suggest that agencies performing regulatory
   tasks seem to be more inclined to have lower levels of de facto
   independence from politicians.},

Abstract = {The article compares how secessionist elites in Scotland and Catalonia
   discursely and legally constituted the people that is the subject of
   their claim of self-determination in relation to immigrant and emigrant
   populations during their recent bid for independence (2012-2017). The
   results point to important similarities between the two cases, which
   privileged the territorial inclusion of immigrants over the
   ethnocultural inclusion of emigrants and embraced the principle of
   multiple nationality. The outcome is interpreted as a sub-set of a
   broader `independence lite' strategy, serving the aim of reducing the
   prospective cost of independence in the eye of the population they seek
   support from, and of the international community of states they seek
   recognition from.},

Title = {Good governance as a precondition for subsidiarity: human rights
   litigation in Nigeria and ECOWAS},
Journal = {COMMONWEALTH \& COMPARATIVE POLITICS},

Volume = {57},
Number = {2, SI},
Pages = {242-259},
Abstract = {Similar to the European Union, the Economic Community of West African
   States (ECOWAS) evolved gradually from little more than a customs union
   to a supranational organisation with sophisticated governance
   arrangements. As a consequence, subsidiarity has become an inevitable
   adjustment mechanism to align individual member state policies with
   objectives of the Community as a whole. In particular, since the
   inclusion of a protocol on good governance and democracy in 2001 an
   increasing number of policy areas require a delineation of competencies
   between state and Community organs. Moreover, the ECOWAS Community Court
   of Justice confines itself to the vertical application of human rights
   law and does not accept human rights claims against private persons
   since the extension of its mandate in 2005. Many cases involving the
   Federal Republic of Nigeria illustrate well a double procedural effect
   of the principle of subsidiarity in the human rights litigation within
   the ECOWAS legal order.},

Title = {Avoiding cultural trauma: climate change and social inertia},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL POLITICS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {28},
Number = {5},
Pages = {886-908},
Abstract = {The failure of societies to respond in a concerted, meaningful way to
   climate change is a core concern of the social science climate
   literature. Existing explanations of social inertia display little
   coherence. Here, a theoretical approach is suggested that integrates
   disparate perspectives on social inertia regarding climate change.
   Climate change constitutes a potential cultural trauma. The threat of
   cultural trauma is met with resistance and attempts to restore and
   maintain the status quo. Thus, efforts to avoid large-scale social
   changes associated with climate change constitute an effort to avoid
   cultural trauma, and result in social inertia regarding climate change
   at individual, institutional, and societal levels. Existing approaches
   to social inertia are reviewed. An intellectual framework utilizing the
   work of Pierre Bourdieu is proposed to integrate these different levels
   of social interaction. Social processes that maintain social order and
   thus avoid cultural trauma create social inertia regarding climate
   change.},

Abstract = {Design thinking has become a popular approach for governments around the
   world seeking to address complex governance challenges. It offers novel
   techniques and speaks to broader questions of who governs, how they
   govern, and the limits of rational instrumentalism in policy making.
   Juxtaposing design thinking with an older tradition of policy design,
   this article offers the first critical analysis of the application of
   design thinking to policy making. It argues that design thinking does
   not sufficiently account for the political and organizational contexts
   of policy work. Design thinking also errs in universally privileging one
   particular policy style over others, and fails to account for the
   reality of policy mixes. Despite these deficiencies, it is argued that
   design thinking can inform and enrich governance by helping policy
   designers produce more adaptable designs, better appreciate the
   behavioral dynamics of public sector design, and leverage networked
   approaches to social problem solving.},

Abstract = {In spite of the shared high profile of recent Islamist attacks on
   civilians in sub-Saharan Africa, patterns of anti-civilian violence
   differ across and within violent Islamist groups, and the countries in
   which they are active. This research seeks to explain this variation by
   situating Islamist violence within the sub-national spaces in which such
   groups operate, and the wider conflict environment in which they choose
   to use, or limit the use of, anti-civilian violence. Drawing on data
   from the Armed Conflict Location \& Event Dataset, the research finds
   that violent Islamist groups are more likely to target civilians where
   they are the most active conflict agent, even when other conflict agents
   are active in the same spaces; but less likely to do so when they are
   relatively weak and in competition with other non-state armed groups.
   Anti-civilian violence is thus deployed strategically by violent
   Islamist groups, while its function as a signalling or retributive
   policing tool depends on the relative strength of groups in relation to
   actors in the wider conflict arena.},

Abstract = {This article examines the post-truth debate and questions the argument
   that post-modernism and social constructivism is responsible for
   post-truth and alternative facts, including in climate denial. The
   article argues that social constructivism is not the problem but rather
   an epistemological orientation that helps us better understand the rise
   of post-truth. Toward this end, the essay examines the way empirical
   findings are translated into political knowledge and the role of science
   in ``truth regimes{''}. From this perspective, there is no amount of
   fact-checking alone that will resolve the post-truth problem. The
   argument is illustrated with the case of climate denial.},

Abstract = {Achieving a proper balance between administrative discretion, which
   promotes efficient and effective governance, and oversight of that
   discretion to ensure political responsiveness has been a classic and
   enduring issue in public-administration literature. This study joins the
   dialogue by examining the question in the context of China, where power
   is highly concentrated and there are not many checks and balances. By
   examining administrative discretion in work safety regulation, this
   study argues that in China's context, the tension between efficiency and
   responsiveness is less explicit among the legislature, executive and
   judiciary powers, but more explicit between central and local powers. In
   other words, if local bureaucracies have considerable discretionary
   power, they may use this power to achieve local interests at the expense
   of national goals. To improve local bureaucracies' political
   responsiveness, the Chinese leaders have adopted both legal and
   managerial measures. On the one hand, administrative discretion has been
   increasingly curbed through elaborate legislation. On the other hand,
   management reforms play a crucial role in bringing local leaders' goals
   in line with national ones. China's efforts to balance administrative
   efficiency and political responsiveness suggest that each country must
   choose solutions in keeping with its own context and problems.},

Abstract = {Iver Neumann started his academic career as a Russia scholar, and while
   he has later expanded his repertoire of expertise considerably, he has
   always retained an interest in Russia, both the country's history and
   its current politics. He has brought his broad theoretical knowledge
   into the study of Russia, thus adding important new perspectives to
   Norwegian scholarship on Russia. Particularly valuable are his identity
   studies, based on Fredrik Barth's new approaches to anthropology.
   While Neumann is a highly acclaimed and much quoted researcher, he has
   never been content with contributing to academic research only, but also
   plunged into public debates in general and in foreign policy debates in
   particular. Here he has got embroiled in some not always very fertile
   polemics in which he has advocated postmodernist positions. In his
   comments on current politics in both Russia and Norway, however, his
   analysis often does not differ significantly from what is normally
   regarded as `` realistic{''} perspectives.
   One of Neumann's characteristics, both as a researcher and media
   commentator, is his very rich language. He uses the entire register of
   stylistic nuances, both in Norwegian and English, something which makes
   his texts a joy to read. However, his willingness and ability to express
   himself pointedly in interviews and short newspaper articles and accept
   journalistic jargon can sometimes make his statements excessively
   bombastic.},

Journal = {MORAL PHILOSOPHY AND POLITICS},

Volume = {6},
Number = {2, SI},
Pages = {313-336},
Abstract = {Proponents of deliberative democracy believe deliberation provides the
   best chance of finding effective and legitimate climate policies.
   However, in many societies there is substantial evidence of biased
   cognition and polarisation about climate change. Further, many appear
   unable to distinguish reliable scientific information from false claims
   or misinformation. While deliberation significantly reduces polarisation
   about climate change, and can even increase the provision of reliable
   beliefs, these benefits are difficult to scale up, and are slow to
   affect whole societies. In response, I propose a combined strategy of
   `thinking and nudging'. While deliberative theorists tend to view
   nudging askance, combining deliberation with nudges promises to be a
   timelier and more effective response to climate change than deliberation
   alone. I outline several proposals to improve societal deliberative
   capacity while reducing climate risks, including media reform, strategic
   communication and framing of debates, incentivising pro-climate
   behaviour change, and better education about science.},
