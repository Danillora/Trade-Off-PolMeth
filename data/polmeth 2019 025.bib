Title = {When balance of power meets globalization: China, India and the small
   states of South Asia},

Abstract = {This article addresses the research question: how have most small states
   of South Asian region managed to acquire substantial amount of
   investment from China and India without falling into the strategic orbit
   of either power? This is an anomaly because most structural theories, in
   particular neorealism, would expect small states not to have much power
   and influence on their own in their relationship with powerful states. I
   answer this puzzle by arguing that the limited competition between China
   and India in an era of intensified economic globalization has provided a
   window of opportunity to small states to maximize their returns from the
   two without upsetting their relationship with either in a big way. This
   short-term bargaining window has been facilitated by the managed rivalry
   and economic interdependence between China and India which is yet to
   become an intense strategic rivalry. The article cautions that as the
   Chinese and Indian ambitions in the Indo-Pacific collide, the smaller
   states may be asked to make choices akin to bandwagoning with either
   one, in particular by offering military bases and naval facilities. This
   development, if it occurs, will drastically affect the bargaining power
   of the smaller states.},

Abstract = {This article analyses conflicts among traditional authorities over
   ancestral lands, and boundaries during and in the aftermath of
   Zimbabwe's Fast Track Land Reform programme (FTLRP). It argues that the
   FTLRP gave a fresh impetus to conflicts over land and boundaries among
   traditional authorities as they sought to recast their authority into
   areas from which they were displaced during the colonial period. It
   further argues that land claims in the post-FTLRP period were often
   entangled with contestations over history and legitimacy as rival groups
   made use of oral traditions and archives to bolster their claims. Most
   of these struggles over land ended up being decided in the country's
   court system. Overall, the article argues that struggles over land
   claims in the post-FTLRP period have largely ended up being struggles
   over versions of the history of land ownership and colonial
   displacements.},

Abstract = {The sharp break that began with contemporary globalization followed the
   double defeat of colonization and of hegemony. The demise of bipolarity
   led to the end of a protective mechanism that enabled the old powers to
   hold onto their illusions, their privileges and an outmoded superiority,
   as they still held sway over the international agenda through the cold
   war and detente. Defeat on one side, disengagement on the other: the new
   relationship to the other was becoming an issue. There were three
   reactions to these challenges, all three expressed through an evolving
   American foreign policy, grappling more than any of the others with the
   uncertainties of power. These responses were formed over the course of
   the last successive presidencies: controlling the entire world,
   governing it from afar, or withdrawing into the domain of its national
   interests. George W. Bush was thus the champion of neoconservatism,
   Barack Obama that of neoliberalism, and Donald Trump of neonationalism.
   The other powers would align themselves in their own way with these
   urgently devised inventions.},

Abstract = {Interpreting the historical importance of the Enlightenment era has
   become increasingly complex in recent decades. This essay reviews
   prominent competing narratives of historical interpretation concerning
   the Enlightenment with a view toward resurrecting a more satisfying and
   coherent interpretation of the movement (or movements). I argue that
   Dale Van Kley's contention-that eighteenth-century secular and religious
   reform movements might be most profitably studied as emerging from a
   century of ``plural lights{''}-points toward a fruitful paradigm of
   historical interpretation. Van Kley's conclusions, if coupled with
   theoretical perspectives associated with the scholarship of l'histoire
   croisee (historical entanglement), provide a more useful compass to
   navigate the fractured landscape of eighteenth-century studies.},

Abstract = {Secessionist conflicts present challenges for peacemaking. Separatists'
   and states' irreconcilable demands frequently prevent negotiated
   settlement. One peacemaking model for territorial conflict is temporary
   autonomy followed by a referendum on independence. Both sides have an
   opportunity to persuade voters of their positions while de-escalating
   conflict prior to a polarizing vote. This article examines the
   application of this model in two cases: the French territory of New
   Caledonia and the Papua New Guinean province of Bougainville, and argues
   that the model succeeds in temporary stabilization but may fail to alter
   the irreconcilable territorial claims of states and breakaway regions,
   risking conflict relapse.},

Abstract = {The paper argues that the norm of sovereignty was extended to sea areas
   with only minor adaptations. Using an English School approach, it
   explores the political evolution of control over the seas, demonstrating
   why and how the norm of sovereignty prevailed over alternative norms and
   principles regulating control of the seas. The paper then compares the
   positions of Brazil, China and the United States on the current
   international regime of the ocean.},

Abstract = {Amid a rightward shift in Latin America, how can the left gain ground in
   cities characterized by entrenched neoliberalism? The case of Susana
   Villaran, the progressive mayor who led Lima, Peru, from 2011 to 2014,
   illustrates the uphill battle facing the left. Villaran's surprise
   election put a leftist in City Hall for the first time in 25 years. She
   confronted unrelenting opposition but defied expectations and beat back
   a recall election only to face a punishing defeat in her reelection bid.
   Weak policy-making capacity and a lack of party machinery forced her to
   expend all her political capital on the recall battle, leaving her with
   nothing to secure reelection. Her trajectory suggests an important
   lesson for progressives in cities where the left is weak: a
   headline-grabbing win by an individual leftist is no substitute for a
   robust left base. Absent the latter, simply electing a progressive mayor
   is likely to prove a fleeting victory.},

Abstract = {Decentralisation in Ghana, and across sub-Saharan Africa, faces a number
   of challenges to successful local governance provision because there are
   a number of formal and informal actors to choose from. Citizens may take
   problems they want a governance provider to solve to a member of
   parliament or a district assembly person, a traditional chief or a
   police officer, a neighbour or an NGO. In this article we report on a
   four-constituency survey administered to explore and understand how
   citizens choose between the options of local institutions available to
   them in order to solve a problem important to their community or
   themselves. We find that formal national (Parliamentarians) and informal
   traditional (Chiefs) institutions are where respondents turn for
   assistance most often instead of constitutionally described local modes
   of governance (District Assemblies). We consider the implications of
   this finding in terms of decentralisation in Ghana and the need to build
   institutions that are context-sensitive and reflect how citizens
   understand political options.},

Abstract = {While scholars have for some time debated the role of refugee flows in
   the international spread of conflict, most evidence has been indirect
   due to the scarcity of systematic data on refugee-related violence. The
   Political and Societal Violence By And Against Refugees (POSVAR) dataset
   addresses this lacuna by providing cross-national, time-series data on
   refugees' involvement in acts of physical violence in their host state,
   either as the victims or the perpetrators of violence, individually or
   collectively, in all countries between 1996 and 2015. In this article,
   we provide an overview of the main features of the dataset, identify its
   limitations, and trace variation in reported levels of refugee-related
   violence over time and across different types of actors. We emphasize
   that the data may be helpful to both researchers and policymakers for
   more accurate understanding of the prevalence of refugee-related
   violence and the design of more optimal policies to mitigate it.},

Abstract = {The first part of this article examines the decline of Mexican exports
   in the context of growing production in the United States and Canada,
   analyzes the evolution of the market for heavy crude on the U.S. Gulf
   coast, and looks at the prospects for production of Mexican heavy crude.
   The second part focuses on the geographic direction of exports, examines
   prices (especially for heavy crude), explores other aspects of PEMEX'S
   commercial policies, and underlines the onerous cost of the
   diversification of crude exports to Europe and Asia. The article
   concludes that PEMEX'S current export strategy is out of date and
   recommends that the state-owned company restructure it in order to
   address the new circumstances of the oil market both in Mexico and
   abroad.},

   implementation process until 2019 are identified. The article postulates
   types of mediation leverage to overcome the stalemate. The findings
   reveal that United Nations peacekeepers could change the stalemate under
   certain conditions, whereas sanctions would be unlikely to critically
   influence the bargaining position, and increased United States
   involvement could have an impact on the conflict resolution.},

Abstract = {This chapter connects the transition to everyday nationhood with a shift
   in the fundamentals of sociology, especially with the conception of
   modernity in the writings of Georg Simmel. While public and academic
   understandings of Emiratiness tend to link collectivity and heritage to
   the shock from modernity and the contestations of local power, more
   recent approaches critically examine this link in everyday life. This
   chapter partly shows how this constellation of assumptions, including
   the perspective from everyday life, is mirrored in the general debate
   about nations, nationalism, and classical social theory. And partly, it
   argues that studies of everyday nationhood can be analyzed through the
   example of Georg Simmel, in particular his focus upon the social forms
   of interaction, the exemplary instances of modern life, and the
   conception of modernity as the subjectivity of dualism.},

Abstract = {Cyberspace is a new domain of operation, with its own characteristics.
   Cyber weapons differ qualitatively from kinetic ones: They generate
   effects by non-kinetic means through information, technology, and
   networks. Their properties, opportunities, and constraints are
   comparable to the qualitative difference between conventional and
   nuclear weapons. New weapons and their target sets in a new domain raise
   a series of unresolved policy challenges at the domestic, bilateral, and
   international levels about deterrence, attribution, and response. They
   also introduce new risks: uncertainty about unintended consequences,
   expectations of efficacy, and uncertainty about both the target's and
   the international community's response. Cyber operations offer
   considerable benefits for states to achieve strategic objectives both
   covertly and overtly. However, without a strategic framework to contain
   and possibly deter their use, make state and non-state behavior more
   predictable in the absence of reciprocal norms, and limit their impact,
   an environment where states face persistent attacks that nonetheless
   fall below the threshold of armed conflict presents a policy dilemma
   that reinforces collective insecurity.},

Abstract = {Our understanding of the determinants of public concern about climate
   change relies heavily on survey research in the United States. But can
   those findings be generalized to the rest of the world? Analysis of the
   Pew Research Center's 2015 Global Attitudes Survey shows fairly similar
   patterns in the English-speaking Western democracies and, to a lesser
   extent, western Europe, but party identification and political ideology
   matter much less in most of the globe, and demographic factors have very
   different impacts. Female, younger, and less religious people tend to
   worry more about climate change in English-speaking Western democracies.
   In most of the world, however, concern is only weakly correlated with
   gender, rises with age and religiosity, and is more strongly correlated
   with education. A new measure of commitment to democratic values proved
   to be the most consistent predictor of concern globally.},

   Truth-Telling and Forgetting: A New Approach to Dealing With the Past in

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONFLICT AND VIOLENCE},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {13},
Abstract = {Is transitional truth-telling more beneficial to reconciliation than
   remaining silent about past crimes? The aim of this article is to
   contribute to the debate by exploring the impact of ``My Story,{''} an
   NGO initiative that uses multiethnic storytelling by victims of the
   Bosnian war to promote reconciliation. We report field observations and
   the results obtained from interviews with young Bosniaks, Croats and
   Serbs. Empathy, as a reported outcome of the storytelling, seems to
   enable deeper reflection and attitude change. Respondents reported
   reduced prejudice, competitive victimhood and blaming, and increased
   interest in information about the outgroup, increased interest in peace
   activism, a change of emotions toward the outgroup and feeling guilt for
   the misdeeds of their ingroup. We conclude that this storytelling
   initiative is beneficial and worth spreading internationally. It
   deconstructs many of the same factors that prevent reconciliation that
   truth commissions aim to deconstruct, while improving interethnic
   attitudes and enabling to look toward the future, as forgetting does.},

Title = {Ideological divergence and delegitimation within Catholic political
   activism in South Korea: A retrospective of contentious politics during
   the Park Geun-hye presidency},
Journal = {POLITICS RELIGION \& IDEOLOGY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {20},
Number = {2},
Pages = {192-214},
Abstract = {This article explores the ideological divergence within South Korea's
   Catholic population and chronicles its growing intensity during the
   presidency of Park Geun-hye, culminating in the unprecedented
   circumstances that led to Park's impeachment and subsequent
   court-ordered removal from office. Our analysis shows how the
   intertwinement of political and religious beliefs fits into the larger
   historical trajectory of South Korea's political development as well as
   the contentious debates that accompanied Park's term as president. We
   further show how the controversies that accompanied the Park presidency
   and ultimately led to its downfall fueled dynamics of delegitimation
   between two Catholic civic groups: one that sought to advance liberal
   democracy and social democracy and placed emphasis on human rights and
   social welfare, and another driven by anti-communism, neo-liberalism
   and, in some instances, extreme right-wing ideology. The ideological
   contestation between these two groups during the Park presidency-with
   both groups avowedly pursuing goals of justice and security but with
   diametrically opposing moral visions and policy prescriptions for South
   Korea-illustrates how church-related civil society organizations with
   competing outlooks continue to exert political influence in national
   arenas in the aftermath of `third wave' democratization.},

Abstract = {This paper explores the significance of religion in the
   Russian-Ukrainian crisis which has been unfolding since February 2014.
   In the first place, the study presents the views on the military
   conflict in East Ukraine expressed in the public discourse of the most
   vocal religious leaders and official documents of the Ukrainian Orthodox
   Church of the Moscow Patriarchate (UOC-MP). In connection with these
   views, special attention is given to the religious policies of the
   post-Euromaidan political regime in Ukraine. In particular, this
   concerns the government's attempts to undermine the positions of UOC-MP
   which, while remaining the largest confession of Ukraine in terms of its
   religious network, at the same time has stood in opposition to the
   ideological line of the Ukrainian state regarding the interpretation of
   the events in Crimea and Donbas and consequently has been considered by
   the authorities as the main agent of Russian ideological influence.},

Title = {Spin-off of the EEA? Norway and the European Foreign, Security and
   Defense Policy},
Journal = {INTERNASJONAL POLITIKK},

Volume = {77},
Number = {4},
Pages = {378-387},
Abstract = {Norway has cooperated closely with the EU on foreign, security and
   defense policy since the late 1990s. It seems fitting to look at this
   cooperation as a supplement to - or spin-off of - the EEA agreement. As
   this field is now changing, with new ambitious initiatives, and that the
   EU's relations with third countries will generally be reassessed as a
   result of Brexit, this will have consequences for Norway's relations
   with the EU in this area. Among other things, we see trends towards what
   we label a possible ``EEA-isation{''} of this field. This focus article
   analyses three developments and potential consequences for Norway. The
   first concerns EU decisions on what is happening within the EU, namely
   PESCO and the decision to strengthen the common European defense market.
   The second concerns initiatives outside of the EU, such as the French
   European Intervention Initiative (EI2), which must be seen in relation
   to the first. The third is Brexit, which is an attempt to take the UK
   into the ``third country club{''} where Norway so far has been the key
   player. What are the consequences of the new initiatives taken within
   and outside the EU for Norway, and what does Brexit do to Norway's
   agency as a partner to the EU in the area of foreign, security and
   defense policy?},

   that Lasswell's proposal can be taken as a `mirror' for critical policy
   studies to better see itself. That, however, means encountering many a

Abstract = {This paper studies Estonian national identity, as defined in terms of
   interethnic (de) mobilization and operationalized in terms of construing
   either strong or weak types of cultural and social boundaries between
   majority and minority ethnic groups. The first part discusses previous
   research on national identity in Estonia. The following theoretical part
   outlines a relational model to conceptualize and measure national
   identity in Estonia. The empirical part utilizes the relational model to
   carry out a demonstrative type of study of national identity among
   ethnic Estonians and Estonian Russians, who were interviewed in a survey
   within the research project `Integration Monitoring of Estonian Society
   2017'. On the basis of the analysis recommendations for theoretical
   advancement in national identity and ethnic conflict studies, as well as
   for better targeted integration policies, will be drawn in the
   conclusions section.},

Abstract = {Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to investigate the medical
   incident responses from two public hospitals in Hong Kong, namely,
   Kowloon Hospital and Caritas Medical Centre, in order to improve the
   strategic preparation for crisis management in hospitals.
   Design/methodology/approach - The paper analyses two medical incidents
   using Situational Crisis Communication Theory by Coombs (2007). The two
   case studies presented herein demonstrate the importance of consistency
   in terms of crisis responses.
   Findings - For the first case, the crisis responses from different
   parties after the incident, including Hospital Authority, the doctor and
   the nurses from Kowloon Hospital, are contradicting to each other.
   First, Hospital Authority confirmed that the incident is solely an
   accident which is a denial response. Second, the doctor passed the
   responsibility to the nurses which is a scapegoating response. Third,
   the nurses tend to reduce the responsibility for the death of patient by
   excusing strategy. As a whole, their responses are inconsistent to each
   other. For the second case, Caritas had initially denied the
   responsibilities, but finally had given partial apology under public
   pressure. That makes people think that Caritas does not really regret.
   Originality/value - Rebuilding posture should be used instead of denial
   and diminishment posture. However, public organization and civil
   servants are reluctant to use a full apology due to possible legal
   consequences. The apology ordinance would ease the pressure to express
   regret and sympathy.},

Abstract = {This research aims to expose the fallacious thinking which enables some
   of the categories of war to proliferate despite their questionable
   analytical usefulness. For this purpose, the author uses the method of
   theoretical analysis. These are the confusion about the nature of war
   and peace, the emphasis on novelty, and the attempts to capture war as a
   static phenomenon. The fallacies identified are the prevalence of
   legalistic lenses over strategic lenses, the false equivalence between
   military and non-military instruments, the ignorance of the empirical
   evidence, the ignorance of the dynamic nature of war and the neglect of
   the adversary as a crucial component of war.},

   demonstrates that these crimes are too similar to be different legal
   constructs, given their definitional elements and real-world
   applications. The study concludes that these ``crimes{''} need to either
   be eliminated from criminal law or altered so as to make the
   adjudication of so-called extremism more parsimonious, equitable, and
   consistent. Recommendations are proffered on how this can be
   accomplished.},

Abstract = {How is political violence gendered? We connect the traditional political
   violence literature's emphasis on categorizing attacks to the gender and
   politics literature's analysis of the barriers to women's political
   participation. Our framework separates gendered political violence into
   three elements. Gendered motives appear when perpetrators use violence
   to preserve hegemonic men's control of politics. Gendered forms
   emphasize how gender roles and tropes differentially shape men's and
   women's experiences of violence. Gendered impacts capture the subjective
   meaning-making processes that occur as different audiences react to
   political violence. This approach offers researchers and policymakers
   greater analytic precision regarding how political violence is gendered.},

Abstract = {An extensive body of literature examines how the media depicts female
   suicide bombers. However, there has been little systematic testing of
   these theories. I test common arguments about how female bombers are
   portrayed, relative to male bombers. I find mixed support for the notion
   that information on female bombers relies on gender stereotypes. I find
   robust evidence that the marital status of female bombers is more likely
   to be reported on than for their male counterparts, while other
   characteristics, such as education and occupation, are not. I discuss
   the incentives media outlets and armed groups have for reinforcing these
   stereotypes.},

Abstract = {There has been considerable attention in recent years on the close
   linkages between business, ethics, and economic development and how
   businesses not only have responsibilities to their shareholders but also
   to wider society. The growing power and influence of emerging economies
   has resulted in increased scholarly interest in China on studying the
   domestic political commitments to corporate social responsibility
   strategies (CSR), and their potential contribution to promoting the
   country's ambitious Belt and Road Initiative and thereby achieving the
   Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). This article explores the factors
   that influence CSR strategies and performance and examines whether we
   are witnessing the emergence of a new form of social responsibility
   among Chinese businesses that prioritizes sustainable development. In
   order to better understand how CSR strategies in China are being
   potentially reshaped and realigned with the SDGs, we examined the CSR
   reports and practices of selected Chinese companies both before and
   after the adoption of the SDGs at the United Nations in 2015. By
   focusing on the CSR-SDG linkages in China, our study contributes to a
   better understanding of state advocacy aimed at influencing corporate
   behavior on sustainable development.},

Abstract = {Improving policy deliberation is a central objective for the European
   Union's institutions. Focusing on the European Parliament's committee
   hearings as an understudied area of European governance, we aim to
   understand their role, and their capacity to improve its procedural
   legitimacy. Building on theoretical work on interest group access and
   deliberation we argue that hearings can serve three purposes: (i)
   coordinative; (ii) epistemic; (iii) enhancing public participation. We
   construct a set of measures and assess an entire population of
   participants in hearings (2009-14), concentrating on three committees.
   Our analyses show that hearings serve a hybrid purpose between
   coordinative and epistemic. At the top end, we observe a core group of
   gatekeepers representing the dominant constituencies. Simultaneously,
   research organizations are granted unique access as experts that
   de-politicize debates. Theoretically, we contribute to discussions on
   interest group access while providing an innovative set of tools for its
   measurement, and the first dataset of its kind.},

Abstract = {A large share of civilian staff working in international peace
   operations are nationals of the host state. Academic research has not
   yet investigated the effect of these locally recruited bureaucrats on
   peacebuilding. Theoretically, it is argued that to accomplish their
   missions in complex environments, peace operations require crucial
   knowledge about local perceptions, politics, and customs. Local staff
   can have a positive performance impact by soliciting such knowledge. But
   information advantages create new principal-agent problems. Peace
   operations have a hard time scrutinizing their employees' allegiances,
   and they risk sabotage from within. Empirically, it is shown that peace
   operations conducted by the United Nations (UN), the Organization for
   Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE), and the European Union (EU)
   differ significantly in how they navigate the ensuing tension by
   enabling or restricting the influence of their local staff. A new data
   set on the staffing of 52 peace operations as well as analysis of
   internal staff policies yields significant variance in the potential of
   local staff to influence peacebuilding policy implementation, which is
   most extensive in the OSCE, followed by the UN and the EU. This finding
   warrants more attention on the role of local staff as information
   gatekeepers who could be at the center of potential frictions between
   international and local norms and knowledge.},

Abstract = {How and under what conditions does legitimacy affect processes of
   international institutional change? This article specifies and evaluates
   three causal mechanisms by which variation in legitimacy induces
   institutional change in international organizations (IOs) and argues
   that an important, yet hitherto neglected, source of legitimacy-based
   change is cognitive in nature. Using survival analysis, we evaluate
   these mechanisms with a novel dataset on the establishment of
   parliamentary institutions in thirty-six regional organizations between
   1950 and 2010. We find that the empowerment of supranational
   secretariats, engagement with the European Union, and
   parliamentarization in an organization's neighborhood increase the
   likelihood of regional parliamentarization. This suggests that
   legitimacy judgments that draw on cognitive referents provide an
   important source of international institutional change. We illustrate
   the underlying cognitive emulation mechanism with a case study of
   parliamentarization in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations.},

Title = {How policy agendas change when autocracies liberalize: The case of Hong

Abstract = {This article considers how autocrats decide to expand or narrow the
   issue diversity of their policy agenda during a period of political
   liberalization. Prior studies have two competing perspectives. First,
   political liberalization increases the social and political freedom that
   enhances information exchange, and thus expands issue diversity. Second,
   political liberalization decreases government's control of the
   legislature and thus narrows the issue diversity. This article offers a
   novel theoretical perspective by combining these two countervailing
   theories. Specifically, it predicts a diminishing marginal benefit of
   information exchange and an increasing marginal bargaining cost. As
   such, this article argues that issue diversity follows a negative
   quadratic (inverted-U) relationship as the regimes liberalize. The
   analysis of a new and unique dataset of Hong Kong's legislative agenda
   (1975 to 2016) offers support for this theory. This study sheds light on
   policy-making in authoritarian regimes and democracies, and advances the
   theory of information processing.},

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL STUDIES QUARTERLY},

Abstract = {How do government rhetoric and propaganda affect mass reactions in
   international crises? Using two scenario-based survey experiments in
   China, one hypothetical and one that selectively reminds respondents of
   recent events, we assess how government statements and propaganda impact
   Chinese citizens' approval of their government's performance in its
   territorial and maritime disputes. We find evidence that citizens
   disapprove more of inaction after explicit threats to use force,
   suggesting that leaders can face public opinion costs akin to audience
   costs in an authoritarian setting. However, we also find evidence that
   citizens approve of bluster-vague and ultimately empty
   threats-suggesting that talking tough can provide benefits, even in the
   absence of tough action. In addition, narratives that invoke future
   success to justify present restraint increase approval, along with
   frames that emphasize a shared history of injustice at the hands of
   foreign powers.},

Abstract = {Purpose The purpose of this paper is to explore the conversation
   activities of design teams to negotiate task conflict and reach
   consensus. Design/methodology/approach Four case studies were conducted
   to analyse the conversation activities that teams use in the course of
   design projects. Findings The conversation activities that teams used to
   negotiate conflict and bring about consensus were identified. These
   conversation activities are associated with collaboration, communication
   and social skills enabling teams to engage in the high level of
   information exchange and negotiation that is required to manage task
   conflict. How they were used to negotiate conflict and help reach
   consensus is also discussed.
   Originality/value The benefits of task conflict have been disputed in
   the literature. This research has identified the conversation activities
   that facilitate the constructive management of task conflict to bring
   about consensus that integrates the perspectives and knowledge of a
   team.},

Abstract = {How does diffusion of civil war battles influence conflict termination?
   Recent advances in civil war literature have found that battle dynamics
   shape conflict termination by affecting the intra-conflict bargaining
   between disputants. This article extends the theoretical perspective and
   argues that how battles diffuse matters in determining conflict
   termination. While battlefield dynamics should in principle reveal
   previously unavailable private information, the relevance of
   information-revealing effect depends on the diffusion patterns of
   battles. The persistent, and possibly battle-exacerbated, commitment
   problem can also alter the prospects of conflict termination. We test
   the argument by distinguishing two distinct diffusion patterns of
   battles: distant and proximate. The empirical results reveal that
   distant diffusion, but not proximate diffusion, of battles makes civil
   conflicts less likely to terminate. The analysis also demonstrates that
   incorporating diffusion dynamics significantly improves our ability to
   predict conflict termination.},

Abstract = {Despite the development of the environmental state, climate change is
   accelerating. The concept of the `glass ceiling' - denoting an
   unexplained barrier, impeding the state from using its powers
   effectively to mitigate threats that it acknowledges should be addressed
   - has been put forward to account for this. Here, a structural account
   of this phenomenon is advanced, which suggests that environmental
   policies are generally outcompeted among government priorities wherever
   they threaten the capitalist growth imperative. In addition,
   social/cultural factors, based on the psychology of denial, provide a
   necessary contribution to our understanding. A three-fold denialism is
   at work: of climate change itself, the measures required to tackle it
   (where these contradict a modern faith in material progress), and the
   potential incapacity of the state to protect society (discouraging close
   attention to the effectiveness of its climate policies).},

   Hadith Quotation to Assert Legitimacy},

Abstract = {Through its prolific propaganda, the self-declared Islamic State (IS)
   seeks to attract new recruits, motivate existing members, and assert the
   group's legitimacy. This study addresses the question of how IS attempts
   to legitimize itself through its official rhetoric by exploring its
   invocation of religious authority via reference to sacred Islamic texts.
   The study focuses on a specific category of religious scripture: the
   collected words and actions of the Prophet Muhammad, known as the
   hadith. The body of hadith has historically served as a bridge of
   authority from past to present, linking later individuals and groups to
   the legacy of the Prophet. Related studies have demonstrated that within
   the Arabic-speaking community in general, citing hadith and Qur'an is an
   everyday rhetorical strategy for argumentation across all topics,
   secular and sacred. This article takes an in-depth look at the hadith
   quotations included in a sample of official IS propaganda to compare the
   relative frequency of specific themes and to determine which hadith
   compilations IS publicists prefer. The study compares the quotation of
   hadith across media platforms (videos, newsletters, and magazines),
   genres (print and video), and languages (Arabic and English). The
   findings show that IS messaging tends to quote hadith from canonical
   Sunni collections. The study highlights important differences between
   English and Arabic language propaganda, noting in particular that
   English-language propaganda focuses more on apocalyptic prophecies than
   Arabic-language materials. Case studies illustrate how IS selectively
   draws on the vast body of hadith literature as part of the group's
   strategic framing.},

Abstract = {A study of the implications of the coproduction-of-security policy
   implemented by Chile's postdictatorship governments shows that the
   appeal for citizen participation in security provision has resulted in
   individual practices of home defense and protection rather than the
   development of the associative programs promoted by the state. This has
   come about in a context of extreme fear of crime and mistrust of the
   institutions in charge of security. The fact that the discourse of
   security coproduction is interwoven with the individuation and
   privatization that characterize Chilean society calls for a review of
   the agenda of citizen participation in security issues. Un estudio de
   las implicaciones de la politica de coproduccion de seguridad

   llamado a la participacion ciudadana en provision de seguridad ha
   resultado en practicas individuales de defensa y proteccion del hogar
   mas que en el desarrollo de programas asociativos promovidos por el
   estado. Esto ha ocurrido en un contexto de miedo extremo al crimen y
   desconfianza de las instituciones a cargo de la seguridad. El hecho de
   que el discurso de la coproduccion de seguridad este entrelazado con la

Abstract = {What are the capacities of the state to facilitate a comprehensive
   sustainability transition? It is argued that structural barriers akin to
   an invisible ?glass ceiling? are inhibiting any such transformation.
   First, the structure of state imperatives does not allow for the
   addition of an independent sustainability imperative without major
   contradictions. Second, the imperative of legitimation is identified as
   a crucial component of the glass ceiling. A distinction is introduced
   between ?lifeworld? and ?system? sustainability, showing that the
   environmental state has created an environmentally sustainable
   lifeworld, which continues to be predicated on a fundamentally
   unsustainable reproductive system. While this ?decoupling? of lifeworld
   from system sustainability has alleviated legitimation pressure from the
   state, a transition to systemic sustainability will require deep changes
   in the lifeworld. This constitutes a renewed challenge for state
   legitimation. Some speculations regarding possible futures of the
   environmental state conclude the article.},

Abstract = {The transformation of the Gamaa Islamiya can be understood by analyzing
   it against Argyris and Sch?n?s double-loop learning model. This paper
   bases the analysis on five books published by the Gamaa Islamiya, which
   include comprehensive elaborations on internal reflections and criticism
   of Al-Qaeda. While the Gamaa Islamiya?s learning can be framed with the
   model of double-loop learning, Al-Qaeda?s reactions can be depicted as a
   less evolved single-loop learning system. This case is relevant for the
   discovery of key mechanisms of de-radicalization that could be used as a
   blueprint for other groups.},

Abstract = {The rise of populism across advanced industrial countries presents a
   challenge to the institutions and norms that make up the current global
   order and threatens to undo the global system that has enabled decades
   of free trade and investment. We outline in this paper a domestic
   political economy account of the contemporary crisis of the global
   order, rooted in disenchantment with the redistributive bargain between
   globalization?s winners and losers. We present individual and
   local-level evidence that is consistent with this account, first
   documenting the decline of the embedded liberal compromise over the past
   40 years in Europe, and then providing individual-level evidence from
   the United States of growing protectionism and xenophobia in response to
   import exposure, particularly among respondents whose occupational
   profile is most risk-exposed.},

Abstract = {Recent research into the public's attitude toward the use of nuclear
   weapons repeats long-standing mistakes in how international relations
   theorists think about morality. Falsely equating consequentialism with
   state egoism and normative obligations with restrictions on the use of
   weapons of mass destruction implies that ethically motivated beliefs
   about foreign affairs must be other-regarding and that other-regarding
   behavior is not utilitarian in character. Drawing on empirical research
   into moral psychology, we argue that liberal, other-regarding morality
   is only one kind of ethical foundation. Alternative moral concerns such
   as retribution, deference to authority, and in-group loyalty also help
   to determine foreign policy beliefs. We find that all three are
   associated with support for the use of nuclear weapons in the American
   public. Our survey respondents act as moral utilitarians who weigh
   different ethical considerations in forming their judgments.},

   War of 1982 and the second from the Iraq War of 2003, are used to
   consider attempts by civilian policy-makers to influence the conduct of
   ongoing military operations as a result of frustration with slow
   progress. Both cases highlight the importance of the higher command
   structures as providing a buffer between the government and local field
   commanders, and show the problems that can result when key strategic
   questions are left unanswered in the run-up to a campaign.},

Abstract = {Many believe the UK to have been an awkward member of the EU, firmly
   attached to a traditional idea of parliamentary sovereignty. In fact,
   the UK?s membership of the EU has coincided with a profound
   transformation in the British state and corresponding understandings of
   sovereignty. This article examines this transformation by focusing on
   its legal and constitutional aspects. The article contends that EU
   membership has provided a context for ?constitutional modernization? in
   the UK, undertaken in the absence of public scrutiny or debate. By the
   EU referendum of June 2016, the UK found itself with a transformed
   constitutional structure in practice but with an unchanged reliance in
   theory on a traditional notion of parliamentary sovereignty. Events over
   the last 3 years have revealed the depth of this disjuncture and its
   implications for British sovereignty.},

Abstract = {The connection between Russia and European political parties has been in
   the scholarly and popular spotlight recently. While scholars focus on
   the connection between the far right (and populist) parties and Russia,
   they have all but ignored the rapidly increasing literature on the role
   of political parties in foreign policy. This article provides an attempt
   to bridge these literatures. After analyzing a corpus of party
   manifestos, the results suggest that there is temporal variation in how
   European parties have seen Russia since the end of the Cold War.
   European parties tended to be mostly positive in their views of Russia
   prior to 2015. Geography and ideology were much less important as a
   factor in explaining party positions. While some ideological groups
   share attitudes across different borders, the overall influence of
   ideology on attitudes toward Russia is minimal.},

Abstract = {Recent research indicates that while higher tax levels are politically
   unpopular, greater tax progressivity is not. However, there remain
   unanswered questions regarding public support for more progressive
   taxation. In particular, little is known about how individual attitudes
   towards tax progressivity are affected by their institutional context.
   Building on existing theories of redistribution, this article develops
   the argument that the structure of the welfare state shapes public
   attitudes towards progressive taxation-support for progressive taxation
   among both average and high-income households is undermined by
   `pro-poor' welfare spending. We support our argument with a
   cross-sectional analysis of rich democracies, interacting household
   income with country-level indicators of welfare state structure. In
   doing so, we contribute a micro-level explanation for the paradoxical
   macro-level phenomenon that larger, more redistributive welfare states
   tend to be financed by less progressive tax systems.},

Abstract = {The literature on coalition presidentialism in Brazil considers the
   allocation of federal resources to the electoral bases of
   parliamentarians as an available tool for the Presidency to obtain
   support for initiatives of its interest in the National Congress. This
   article aims to verify the relationship between the transfer of these
   resources, the voluntary transfers, and the support to the Government.
   Two groups of deputies were separated to find out this behavior: those
   that vote following the Government's orientation and those that
   systematically vote against it. From each group a sample of 50 deputies
   was selected, from which the percentage of votes obtained in the 2014
   elections in each municipality was inferred. The four municipalities in
   which a deputy reaches proportionately more votes belong to his
   electoral base. Crossing this base of municipalities with data on
   voluntary transfers from the Federal Government, statistical tests found
   that the volume of federal voluntary resources received by a given
   municipality is related to the supportive alignment of the mayor and the
   governor with the Federal Government and also with the institutional
   capacity of the municipality administration. However, the volume of
   transfers received cannot be explained by virtue of whether or not the
   municipality is the electoral base of a federal deputy aligned or facing
   opposition to the Federal Executive.},

Abstract = {This article is part of the special cluster titled Conceptualizations of
   the Holocaust in Germany, Lithuania, Poland, and Ukraine since the
   1990s, guest edited by Grzegorz Rossolinski-Liebe. The Holocaust is the
   darkest page of Lithuanian history: Nearly the whole Jewish community in
   Lithuania was destroyed, while a part of ethnic Lithuanians participated
   in this destruction. This article discusses three layers and periods of
   the Holocaust in Lithuania that have made a considerable impact on the
   perception of this traumatic period in Lithuanian society. The first
   period deals with the Lithuanian-Jewish relations during the German
   occupation in Lithuania (1941-1944). The second one is related to the
   Soviet reoccupation of Lithuania and discussions among Lithuanian
   emigres in the West (1944-1990), which shaped the history of the
   Holocaust in Lithuania from the ideological (Soviet) and defensive
   (Lithuanian emigre) perspectives. The final part of this article
   discusses the historiography and Holocaust memory in independent
   Lithuania after the 1990s. Almost thirty years of independence mark not
   only the re-creation of some old myths and stereotypes in Lithuania, but
   also new groundbreaking and open discussions in society, concerning the
   perception of this dark page of Lithuanian history.},

Abstract = {The strategic environment is evolving rapidly with the recognition of
   cyberspace as a domain of warfare. The increased interest in cyber as a
   part of defence has heightened the need for theoretical tools suitable
   to assess cyber threat perceptions and responses to these threats.
   Drawing from previous research, we will formulate an analytical
   framework to study the formation of Russian thinking on cyber threats as
   a part of Russian strategic culture. This article identifies a sense of
   vulnerability, the narrative of Russia as a besieged fortress and the
   technological inferiority of Russia as specific factors influencing
   Russian cyber threat perception.},

Abstract = {This paper interrogates the interrelationships between the state,
   pentecostalism, and the media in contemporary Ghana. It examines how
   pentecostal ideological and practical approach to the indigenous field,
   its symbolisms and ritual practices, latently aids contemporary Ghana to
   negotiate between protecting indigenous normative systems and meeting
   external obligations under international human rights law. It highlights
   the often misrecognized significance of pentecostalism and the media in
   achieving state obligation of modernizing religious customary ideals. It
   examines the implications of this in relation to the politicization of
   customary normative systems in contemporary Ghana. It argues that in the
   attempt to construct an idealized modern society, the state, the media
   and pentecostalism enter into a subtly, often times, unintended
   alliance.},

Abstract = {The adoption of the United Nations (UN) Charter in 1945 marked the
   legalization of international human rights. Despite the legalized status
   of human rights, their violation by states is not uncommon. This article
   questions why a state might violate international human rights.
   Analyzing this issue from an economic perspective, this article advances
   regulatory arbitrage theory to rationalize a state's violation of human
   rights. It discusses regulatory arbitrage-type behaviors among state
   actors that derogate from the obligations to respect, protect, and
   fulfill human rights. Defending state sovereignty, minimizing regulatory
   or compliance costs, and prioritizing economic achievement are
   identified as rational arbitrage actions that circumvent international
   human rights. We call for competent and credible governance mechanisms
   that can increase the cost of arbitrage, to disincentivize state
   violation of international human rights.},

Abstract = {What is `relational theorizing' in International Relations and what can
   it offer? This article introduces a thematic section that responds to
   these questions by showing two things. First, relational theorizing is
   not a doctrine or a method, but a set of analyses that begin with
   relations rather than the putative essences of constitutively autonomous
   actors. Second, relational theorizing has emerged from different
   geo-linguistic traditions, and a relational approach to International
   Relations (IR) can offer the language and space for increased and
   productive engagement beyond Anglophone scholarship. This thematic
   section takes a significant step in this direction by staging a dialogue
   between Sinophone and Anglophone scholarship on relational IR
   theorizing. Such an engagement shows points of comparison and contrast,
   convergence and divergence. In this way, the essays presented here
   contribute to developing a more `global' IR.},

Abstract = {Compulsory voting is known to increase turnout and produce a more
   representative electorate, but there is considerable debate about
   whether it stimulates political learning. Analyses of political
   knowledge using cross-national and intranational observational data
   arrive at mixed conclusions. Experimental research is similarly
   inconclusive. We attempt to reconcile these disparate results by
   employing a novel experiment that tracks political learning during real
   elections and randomly assigns some people to receive a punitive threat
   for failure to cast an in-person vote. We demonstrate that compelled
   voter participation can increase voter participation and political
   learning, but also prompts anger.},

Journal = {TERRORISM AND POLITICAL VIOLENCE},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {31},
Number = {5},
Pages = {966-986},
Month = {SEP 3},
Abstract = {To date, scholarly work on armed groups has seldom considered the notion
   of rebel resilience, or the factors that enable these groups to survive
   despite time, military pressure, and the myriad contingent events of
   civil war. In an effort to develop an explanatory framework for
   resilience as a distinct outcome of civil war and rebellion, this
   article examines the conditions under which the Lord's Resistance Army
   (LRA) has persisted for nearly three decades. Based on fieldwork and
   original research, the article explains the LRA's resilience in light of
   the group's organizational structure and resource self-sufficiency,
   which have been well suited for the borderlands of East and Central
   Africa. The LRA is a key case of rebel resilience. It is important
   because it sheds light on the organizational foundations of armed
   groups, the relationship between resources and rebellion, and the
   broader study of conflict duration and termination. Understanding the
   sources of the LRA's resilience can inform efforts to end such
   insurgencies.},

Title = {Conquering and coercing: Nonviolent anti-regime protests and the
   pathways to democracy},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF PEACE RESEARCH},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {56},
Number = {5},
Pages = {650-666},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Recent research finds an association between nonviolent protests and
   democratic transitions. However, existing scholarship either does not
   specify the pathways through which nonviolent protests bring about
   democratization or conduct systematic empirical analyses demonstrating
   that the specified pathways are operative. This article proposes four
   pathways through which nonviolent anti-regime protests encourage
   democratic transitions, emphasizing their ability to directly conquer or
   indirectly coerce such transitions. Most simply, they can conquer
   democratic reforms by directly overthrowing authoritarian regimes and
   installing democracies. They can also coerce democratic reforms through
   three additional pathways. Nonviolent anti-regime protests can coerce
   incumbent elites into democratic reforms by threatening the survival of
   authoritarian regimes. They also increase the likelihood of elite
   splits, which promote negotiated democratic reforms. Finally, they
   encourage leadership change within the existing authoritarian regime.
   Following leadership change, nonviolent movements remain mobilized and
   are able to coerce democratic concessions from the regime's new leaders.
   Our within-regime analyses provide robust empirical support for each
   pathway. We show that nonviolent anti-regime protests conquer democratic
   reforms by ousting autocratic regimes and replacing them with
   democracies. Nonviolent anti-regime protests also coerce elites into
   democratic reforms by threatening regime and leader survival. These
   findings highlight the importance of protest goals and tactics and also
   that nonviolent anti-regime protests have both direct and indirect
   effects on democratization.},

Title = {Drone Proliferation and the Challenge of Regulating Dual-Use
   Technologies},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL STUDIES REVIEW},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {21},
Number = {3},
Pages = {497-517},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {The controversy surrounding military drones has generated many proposals
   for restricting or prohibiting existing drones, additional autonomous
   variants that may be created in the future, and the sale of drones to
   certain markets. Moreover, there is broad interest in regulating
   military drones, with proposals coming not only from academics but also
   from NGOs and policymakers. I argue that these proposals generally fail
   to consider the dual-use character of drones and that they therefore
   provide inadequate regulatory guidance. Drones are not confined to the
   military but rather spread across international and domestic security
   roles, humanitarian relief efforts, and dozens of civilian applications.
   Drones, their component technologies, the control infrastructure, and
   the relevant technical expertise would continue to develop under a
   military-focused regulatory regime as civilian technologies that have
   the potential to be militarized. I evaluate the prospects of drone
   regulation with the help of research on other dual-use technologies,
   while also showing what the study of drones can contribute to that
   literature. Drones' ubiquity in nonmilitary roles presents special
   regulatory challenges beyond those associated with WMDs and missiles,
   which indicates that strict regulatory controls or international
   governance frameworks are unlikely to succeed. With this in mind, I
   further argue that future research should acknowledge that drone
   proliferation across military and civilian spheres is unavoidable and
   shift focus to considering how drone warfare may be moderated by
   countermeasures and institutional pressures.},

Abstract = {Civilian innovation is often said to be an important facilitator in the
   development of Lethal Autonomous Weapon Systems (LAWS). This claim is
   held up as both a reason to ban LAWS urgently, and why a ban would be
   impractical. But we know little about how this dynamic plays out in
   practice. Theoretical insights on technology transfer can help to
   analyse the situation. They suggest that obtaining and utilising the
   civilian technology is harder than often assumed. Civil-military
   cooperation is hindered by the stark differences between the civilian
   and defence industries. Business practices are out of sync, there are
   few social ties between the two worlds, innovative cultures do not
   translate, and many civilian engineers resist cooperation with the
   military. Additionally, defence still needs to modify civilian
   technologies to meet military standards and develop military-exclusive
   applications of autonomy. While civilian innovation thus advances what
   is technologically possible, this does not automatically translate into
   major advances or rapid diffusion of LAWS.},

Abstract = {Does holding different foreign policy positions relative to the USA in
   the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) influence US aid delivery
   decisions? Conventional wisdom on foreign aid suggests that donors
   provide more government-to-government assistance to well-governed
   countries and use non-state development actors in recipient countries
   with poor governance. This paper argues that strategic considerations
   also determine the choice of the channel of aid delivery. Countries that
   support US-backed resolutions in the UNGA witness more
   government-to-government aid than countries that hold different
   positions. I find considerable empirical support for this theory using
   newly available data on UN voting and an originally constructed measure
   of aid delivery from 2004 to 2011.},

Abstract = {This article addresses a foundational question of political
   representation: how do representatives act for those they represent? In
   a shift away from analyses of individual representatives' attitudes and
   behaviour, we identify Women's Parliamentary Organizations as potential
   critical sites and critical actors for women's substantive
   representation. Offering one of the most in-depth studies to date, our
   illustrative case is the long-standing UK Parliamentary Labour Party's
   Women's Committee. With a unique data set, and using both quantitative
   and qualitative methods, we systematically examine the Parliamentary
   Labour Party's Women's Committee efforts to substantively represent
   women over more than a decade. We find that the Committee sustains its
   focus on a small number of women's issues and interacts with party
   leadership to advance women's interests in a feminist direction. Our
   findings capture processes of political change, a frequently
   under-explored stage in studies of substantive representation. We close
   by identifying the potential for comparative research in this area.},

Journal = {HUMAN RIGHTS QUARTERLY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {41},
Number = {3},
Pages = {701-724},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Although the scope of the right to culture has never been more
   recognized nor clarified, culture itself is currently portrayed in some
   human rights narratives as a tool of oppression and an obstacle to human
   rights, especially women's rights. Certainly, cultural rationalizations
   that justify human rights violations and the misappropriation of culture
   by dominant (male) elites put a dent in the recognition of collective
   cultural rights. However, the article argues that the binary
   understanding of universality versus culture and collective cultural
   rights ultimately harms women's rights, as such understanding does not
   reflect all women's experiences, priorities, and strategies. The article
   uses the example of indigenous women to highlight the importance of
   culture for some women. It suggests a paradigm shift from portraying
   minority and indigenous women as victims of their cultures to pushing
   for their empowerment through and beyond their cultures. In essence, the
   piece advocates for a multilayered, nuanced approach on women's rights
   that addresses universalism but also considers postcolonial feminist and
   anthropological critiques of human rights.},

Abstract = {Here, we examine the understudied merger of the Social Democratic Party
   and the Liberal Party. This systematic study of the process which
   created the Liberal Democrats in 1988 adds to our understanding of what
   was a rare but important event in British politics. We demonstrate that
   it deviated from theoretical accounts of such mergers that stress the
   need for trust at the elite level. We recognise that inter-party trust
   can instead develop across the three faces of party organisation. We
   contribute a new typology for understanding these processes, and argue
   that existing studies are right to highlight that trust between the
   party in public office is important but wrong to conclude that its
   absence precludes mergers from occurring. Instead, we find that a lack
   of trust between parties in public office restricts the degree of
   delegation and increases the level of monitoring and formalisation,
   which can have damaging effects on the parties that emerge.},

Abstract = {What are the political roots of anti-Jewish rhetoric? To address this
   ever-important query, this study analyses perceptions of Jews in Turkish
   politics. Building on group position theory and the historical
   background of Turkish-Jewish relations, the research proposes that
   right-wing ideological orientation and perceived threats can predict
   negative perceptions of Jews. It scrutinises the Turkish parliamentary
   proceedings using quantitative and qualitative content analysis. The
   findings support the premise. The study concludes that discussing
   perceived threats tends to evoke negative rhetoric while right-wing
   ideological orientation seems to be a predictive factor for the
   expression of such views. This implies that an effective management of
   perceived threats would reduce the frequency of anti-Jewish statements
   in Turkish politics.},

Abstract = {Michel Temer's government produced a new right-wing order in Brazil that
   might be called an ``armored democracy.{''} The main characteristics of
   this order are the construction of a ``leftist{''} enemy to justify
   repression of activists and social movements, preserving a loyal base
   and manipulating the anger if no economic achievements are made; a
   political partisan role for the judicial powers with strong interference
   of lobbying and military consultants; a weak democracy without political
   participation; the establishment of a market-friendly order against the
   platform voted for by the majority of Brazilians in the 2014 election;
   right-wing advances in public discourse that have reframed the political
   culture and discussion; and the accession of a far-right contender to
   the presidency for the first time since re-democratization began in
   1985. Brazil seems to be repeating its history because it has not
   reflected on and judged its past. The most important threat to democracy
   is not only this new president but the country's own elitist, corrupt,
   and restricted democratic system.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF PEACE RESEARCH},

Abstract = {Audience cost theory posits that concern over the nation's reputation
   pushes voters to sanction leaders who make empty threats because they
   tarnish the nation's honor. We question the empirical support for that
   theory. We show that survey vignettes in the previous experimental
   literature conflate audience costs generated by inconsistency and
   belligerence with approval losses arising from the perception that the
   leader is incompetent. These `incompetence costs' are due to leaders not
   achieving audiences' preferred outcomes. Our article contributes to the
   literature on audience costs by disentangling inconsistency and
   belligerence costs from incompetence costs, which we find are the larger
   component of audience costs. We also make a methodological contribution:
   we show that experimental designs in previous studies cannot test the
   different mechanisms; that previous estimates of audience costs are
   biased because treatments affect respondents' beliefs about the likely
   outcome of policy actions; and we suggest a new experimental framework
   to estimate audience costs. Our results are consistent with arguments
   that audiences care more about policy outcomes than about leaders'
   inconsistency or belligerence during a crisis.},

Abstract = {Yoweri Museveni's rebels seized power in Uganda in 1986, with Rwandan
   refugees making up roughly a quarter of his troops. These refugees then
   took power in Rwanda in 1994 with support from Museveni's regime.
   Subsequently, between 1999 and 2000, the Rwandan and Ugandan
   comrades-in-arms turned on each other in a series of deadly clashes in
   the Democratic Republic of Congo, a country they had invaded together
   only one year earlier. What explains these fratricidal clashes? This
   article contends that a social-psychological perspective focused on
   status competition between the Rwandan and Ugandan ruling elites
   provides the most compelling answer. Long treated as `boys', the new
   Rwandan rulers strove to enhance their social status vis-a-vis the
   Ugandans, seeking first equality and then regional superiority. Economic
   disputes over Congo's natural resources at times complemented this
   struggle for status but cannot explain all of its phases. The article
   draws on interviews with senior Rwandan, Ugandan, and former Congolese
   rebel officials, and triangulates them with statements given to national
   and regional newspapers at the time of the clashes. More broadly, it
   builds on the recently revitalized study of status competition in world
   politics and makes a case for integrating research on inter-African
   relations.},

Abstract = {The fossil fuel divestment movement has developed into an offshoot of
   the climate change movement in recent years. The movement has become
   increasingly effective at stigmatizing the fossil fuel industry.
   However, fossil fuel divestment remains poorly understood. Here, we
   apply the concept of theories of change to expand understanding of
   fossil fuel divestment through a thematic analysis of interviews with
   climate change and divestment activists. The main research question
   pursued is: What are the underlying strategic assumptions of fossil fuel
   divestment campaigns? Findings reveal that activists hold theories of
   change that are deeply antithetical to the fossil fuel industry and that
   divestment is part of a bigger strategic plan that seeks the ultimate
   demise of the industry. Implications for the study of divestment and
   climate politics are discussed.},

Abstract = {Narrative, we argue, can (re)construct social reality. Alternative
   imaginaries of `being in the world' can lead to alternative ways of
   `doing in the world'. We discuss the current dispute between China and
   Japan over the Senkaku/Diaoyu Islands as an example. Westphalian logic
   would have the two countries come to blows, if not go to war, over the
   Islands. The Westphalian account of the dispute centres on the key
   principle of sovereignty. But what if we utilized a different imaginary
   to re-narrate the conflict? We turn to popular culture in both Japan and
   China as a guide, and juxtapose two anime, Appleseed and Time of Eve,
   with one Chinese TV drama, Nirvana in Fire. Each of these upends
   conventional analyses of the Islands dispute and offers alternative
   conceptions of sovereignty. We conclude by considering the implications
   of such alternative imaginaries for the study, if not practice, of
   international relations.},

Abstract = {While environmental issues are among the most serious threats to human
   security, they tend to rank toward the bottom of Americans' priorities
   for political action. To redress this, environmental organizations
   strategically frame their mobilization communications in an attempt to
   garner the public's support. Advocacy research groups encourage the use
   of motivational, economic and personal frames because of their ability
   to mobilize support through distinct psychological processes: efficacy,
   psychological proximity and emotion. An experimental study is conducted
   that tests the extent to which these mechanisms mediate environmental
   frames' effects on support for an environmental campaign. Results of
   this study lead to the conclusion that motivational frames are unable to
   elicit efficacy in the target audience, thus proving ineffectual at
   influencing attitudes or behaviors. Economic and personal frames are
   more successful, aligning the audience's attitudes with the message and
   operating through psychological proximity, sadness and anger to induce
   behavioral support for the environmental campaign.},

Abstract = {This article examines the domestic causes of the Iran-Iraq War. It
   delves into secret discussions among Iranian political and military
   elites during the conflict, their analyses of their own performance on
   the battlefield, and their revealing public disputes and blame game
   decades later. It contends that an underexplored and yet critical
   driving force behind Iran's prosecution of the war was factional
   politics. Along with state-level geo-strategic, regime-level security
   and individual-level ideological concerns, factional factors must also
   be examined to understand Tehran's war-time decisions. Iran's factional
   rivalries began between the Islamists and the nationalists; and between
   the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) and the army at war's
   outbreak, and eventually penetrated into the heart of the Islamist camp
   between the militant clerics and the IRGC.},

Abstract = {This article assesses how Violent Dissident Irish Republican (VDR)
   groups have turned to funerary practice as a spoiling tactic in
   post-Good Friday Agreement Northern Ireland. In doing so it moves the
   lens of interrogation away from the residual violence exercised by these
   groups and onto other nonviolent mechanisms and strategies. Locating
   this discussion within the wider study of the VDR phenomenon, the
   article asserts that militarized and ritualized funerals possess
   propagandistic and mobilizational benefits that make them particularly
   conducive to spoiling activity in a post-conflict site that is
   increasingly embracing the process of normalization.},

Abstract = {Recent studies on global performance indicators (GPIs) reveal the
   distinct power that nonstate actors can accrue and exercise in world
   politics. How and when does this happen? Using a mixed-methods approach,
   we examine the impact of the Aid Transparency Index (ATI), an annual
   rating and rankings index produced by the small UK-based NGO Publish
   What You Fund. The ATI seeks to shape development aid donors' behavior
   with respect to their transparency-the quality and kind of information
   they publicly disclose. To investigate the ATI's effect, we construct an
   original panel data set of donor transparency performance before and
   after ATI inclusion (2006-2013) to test whether (and which) donors alter
   their behavior in response to inclusion in the ATI. To further probe the
   causal mechanisms that explain variations in donor behavior we use
   qualitative research, including over 150 key informant interviews
   conducted between 2010 and 2017. Our analysis uncovers the conditions
   under which the ATI influences powerful aid donors. Our mixed-methods
   evidence reveals how this happens. Consistent with Kelley and Simmons's
   central argument that GPIs exercise influence via social pressure, we
   find that the ATI shapes donor behavior primarily via direct effects on
   elites: the diffusion of professional norms, organizational learning,
   and peer pressure.},

Abstract = {The role of corporations in the U.S. political process has received
   increased scrutiny in the wake of the U.S. Supreme Court's Citizens
   United decision, leading to calls for greater regulation. In this paper,
   we analyze whether policies mandating greater disclosure and shareholder
   approval of political contributions reduce risk and increase firm value,
   as proponents of such rules claim. Specifically, we examine the Neill
   Committee Report (NCR), which led to the passage of the United Kingdom's
   Political Parties, Elections, and Referendums Act 2000 mandating new
   disclosure and shareholder approval rules. We find that politically
   active firms did not benefit from the NCR in the days after its release
   and suffered a decline in value in the months and years that followed.
   Politically active firms also suffered an increase in risk, as proxied
   by stock return volatility, following the release of the NCR. We
   theorize that these findings are due to the reduced flexibility these
   rules impose on corporate strategy as well as the potential for these
   rules to facilitate political activism against corporations.},

Title = {A Social Pact for the Economic Growth of Puerto Rico},
Journal = {REVISTA DEL CLAD REFORMA Y DEMOCRACIA},
Year = {2019},
Number = {74},
Pages = {159+},

Abstract = {This paper aims to explain the advantages of creating a social pact for
   the development of a national public policy. A review of the literature
   is carried out to expose the contexts in which social pacts have been
   developed and the frequent problems that countries have tried to solve
   through this mechanism, both in Europe and in Latin America. It also
   explains the prerequisites and requirements for a successful social pact
   in terms of its creation, implementation and durability. Also, the
   document presents an analysis on the need and the ideal conditions for
   the creation of a social pact in Puerto Rico. A great economic
   depression, political uncertainty, poor public administration and
   problems in the legitimacy of the institutions have been the main
   characteristics of the Puerto Rican society since 2006. In this context,
   a mechanism for the formulation of public policy is necessary to develop
   an economic growth plan that is inclusive, long-term, transcends
   political changes, and that reflects the interest of the population. The
   need for a social pact increases due to the scarcity of resources faced
   by the government and the need to address the social problems that have
   arisen as a result of the economic weakness. During the last 20 years,
   important initiatives have been generated related to seeking for
   consensus and creation of dialogue for the development of public policy,
   in Puerto Rico there is fertile ground for the creation of a social pact
   that addresses one of the most important and serious problems its
   society faces: the poor ability to create income, employment and wealth.},

Abstract = {This article looks at a project involving nine internationally acclaimed
   street artists who agreed to make murals in Oslo, following the 22 July
   2011 attacks. Resting on the art project's aims ('to promote universal
   human rights and to counter the intolerance and xenophobia that can give
   rise to violence and justify terrorism') and the art community's
   reaction, the article argues that street art's visibility and agency
   offer alternative ways of thinking about, and approaching, international
   relations (IR). The article examines the streets as the space where
   artists express and engage the `everyday'; and as the medium that allows
   artists to bring art to the public (as opposed to galleries or
   exhibitions the public chooses to visit). We argue that the
   incorporation of street art's spatiality and aesthetics into `everyday
   IR' supports more critical frameworks that (a) expose the exceptional
   logic(s) of illiberal governance; (b) enable the visibility of
   marginalised and/or dissenting voices in society; and (c) explore
   experimental, eclectic and creative approaches of doing/thinking
   everyday security, community and peace.},

Abstract = {Dual loyalty is defined as, particularly as it pertains to the field of
   medicine, a conflict or potential conflict between a healthcare
   professional's simultaneous obligations-expressed or implied-to a
   patient and to a third party. Dual loyalty situations often compromise
   physicians' ethical behavior, leading them to participate, either
   knowingly or unknowingly, in human rights violations perpetrated by a
   third party, often the state. Classic dual loyalty situations include
   the participation of physicians in state-sanctioned torture or the death
   penalty. However, there are a number of other dual loyalty scenarios
   that arise routinely in clinical practice in both closed institutions
   such as prisons, psychiatric facilities, and the military and in open
   societies promulgated by discriminatory practices, policies, and laws
   that can lead physicians and other health care professionals to
   contribute to the violation of individuals' human rights. Healthcare
   professionals are, for the most part, not formally trained to contend
   with these dual loyalty conflicts. While physicians routinely learn
   about bioethical frameworks to assist them in resolving difficult
   clinical dilemmas created, for example, by modern technology that
   extends life or by limited resources, few are taught a human rights
   framework that can assist them in protecting patients' human rights in
   cases of dual loyalty. This paper presents a case-based approach that
   utilizes a human rights framework for teaching dual loyalty in the
   undergraduate medical education curriculum. The medical profession is in
   dire need of training its workforce to grapple with the myriad dual
   loyalty issues that confront the profession today, and must institute
   curriculum reform to prepare future health care professionals to deal
   with dual loyalty scenarios that threaten individuals' human rights.},

Abstract = {Since 2009, 155 Tibetans inside Tibet have positioned themselves in
   public places and burned themselves alive, in what most understand to be
   a protest for Tibetan freedom and the return of the Dalai Lama. This
   article explores how Buddhism is used to disavow the self-immolators
   through descriptions of the protest as an act in violation of the
   Buddhist tenet to not destroy life. By examining Tibetan Buddhist
   conceptualizations of death and the theological precedents for acts of
   sacrifice, the analysis argues that the act of self-immolation resides
   in a gray area-neither implicitly sanctioned, nor prohibited. Like many
   actions in Buddhism, the ethical reading of it rests on the motivation
   with which the act is undertaken. This article also analyzes interviews
   undertaken by the author with exile teachers of Tibetan Buddhism to
   understand the act's violation of, or coherence with, Buddhism. The
   author demonstrates that conceptualizations of self-immolation are
   negotiated in the context of the political exigency in exile to make the
   act coherent with Buddhism. The article ends with a discussion of the
   global phenomena of martyrdom, and explores the discreet acts of
   resistance that the self-immolations have inspired inside Tibet.},

Abstract = {Two recent developments have the potential to fundamentally alter the
   conventional view of EU trade policy-making: the emergence of global
   value chains (GVCs) and the recent backlash against globalization. In
   this paper we summarize the conventional wisdom after which we delineate
   the main expectations derived from the GVC and the
   globalization-backlash perspectives. In so doing, we focus on the EU's
   trade and non-trade preferences, and the EU's ability to achieve its
   preferences in international trade negotiations. We then discuss the
   research agenda that would allow testing the expectations derived from
   these different perspectives. A key point that emerges from this
   discussion is that the conventional perspective, the GVC perspective,
   and the globalization-backlash perspective may all be needed to fully
   understand EU trade policy. The challenge is to know under which
   conditions which of these perspectives best explains the process and
   outcomes of EU trade policy-making.},

Abstract = {The External Incentives Model (EIM) was designed to explain the
   Europeanization of the Central and Eastern European countries (CEECs)
   through the EU's accession conditionality. This article asks how
   relevant the model remains beyond its original context. We examine
   recent data and research on the EU's impact in two additional contexts:
   post-accession developments in the CEECs and the Southeast European
   countries currently in the accession process. We find that the model
   generally accounts well for the variation in Europeanization across
   domains and countries. More specifically, the credibility of incentives
   stands out as a crucial condition for the success of EU conditionality.
   At the same time, we note omissions and limitations of the original
   model: first, the model works with highly abstract conditions that
   require contextual specification to render them more meaningful and
   better testable. Second, the EIM starts from generally favourable, but
   underspecified, background conditions.},

   to Nuclear Terrorism},
Journal = {TERRORISM AND POLITICAL VIOLENCE},
Year = {2019},
Month = {2019 MAY 18},
Abstract = {A terrorist organization constructing and detonating a nuclear device is
   often a topic of popular, academic, and political concern. Yet,
   assessing this risk is a challenging task. This article aims to
   contribute to the encompassing nature of any future nuclear terrorism
   threat assessments by further exploring the often overlooked
   organizational dimension in probability assessments on nuclear
   terrorism. Particular emphasis is given to the role of the
   organizational design. In order to do so, this article theoretically
   builds on a 2017 research article and empirically studies Aum
   Shinrikyo's chemical and biological armament activities. This article
   confirms and further refines the idea of an effectiveness-efficiency
   trade-off for a terrorist organization implementing a nuclear armament
   project. It particularly zooms in on the constraints that follow from
   the covert nature of this type of plot and elaborates on the role of Aum
   Shinrikyo's value-rationality.},

Abstract = {Over the past decade, the EU has faced multiple crises. In the
   introduction to this collection, we argue that this `polycrisis' is
   fracturing the European political system across multiple, simultaneous
   rifts, thereby creating a `polycleavage'. As a consequence, the EU is
   caught in a `politics trap'. Similar to other decision traps, this
   multi-level politics trap is dysfunctional, but difficult to escape
   altogether. The contributions to this collection analyze the mechanisms
   of the politics trap, its relationship to the European polycrisis, and
   the strategies pursued by a plurality of actors (the Commission, the
   European Parliament, national governments) to cope with its constraints.
   In light of this analysis, we argue that comprehensive, `grand' bargains
   are for the moment out of reach, but national and supranational actors
   can find ways of `relaxing' the politics trap and in so doing perhaps
   lay the foundations for more ambitious future solutions.},

Title = {Metaphor and Irony in the Public Criminological Discourse of Lithuania},
Journal = {EAST EUROPEAN POLITICS AND SOCIETIES},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {33},
Number = {2},
Pages = {400-422},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {This article discusses metaphor and irony as discursive strategies
   employed by the Lithuanian media while construing the imagery of crime,
   criminal, and criminality. The method applied to analyse metaphor and
   irony in Lithuanian criminological discourse combines the framework
   offered by conceptual metaphor theory with corpus linguistics. First of
   all, metaphorical and ironical expressions were inventoried, and then
   conceptual paradigms were reconstructed from them. The conceptual-level
   analysis revealed that the relations between the conceptual domains of
   metaphor and irony are processed by different types of mapping
   (similarity {[}metaphor] vs. dissimilarity {[}irony]). Despite
   differences in the processing of cross-domain mapping, metaphor and
   irony realised in public criminological discourse carry out the same or
   very similar rhetorical and social functions. The main function of these
   discursive strategies is the vivid expression of emotional attitudes and
   values directed at the criminal-the text adresser evaluates the criminal
   and crime negatively, dissociates from the offender, and isolates him
   symbolically from our community. In this way, the contemporary
   Lithuanian media constructs and shapes the community's approach to
   particular social phenomena-crime, criminal, and criminality.},

Abstract = {Approaching urban social conflicts in Brazil and in Palestine/Israel in
   terms of settler colonial theory allows the identification of the
   historical racist structures involved in the violent pacification of

   declaration of independence but persists in the postcolonial context
   through the constant expropriation, extermination, confinement, and

   accumulation by settler elites. The cases of Jerusalem and Rio de

Abstract = {This study examines the effect of energy resources on the chances for
   militarized conflict, water related conflict and cooperation events, and
   cooperative river treaties between pairs of states on shared
   international river basins. We examine trade-offs that riparian states
   can make between energy resources such as oil or natural gas and fresh
   water resources. Integrating upstream and downstream states'
   geographical position in a river basin with energy resource information,
   we examine four related scenarios of states sharing rivers: (1) Joint
   energy where both upstream and downstream countries have energy
   resources, (2) Downstream energy where only the downstream state has
   energy resources, (3) Upstream energy where only an upstream country has
   energy resources, and (4) No energy. Theoretically, we argue that
   Downstream energy dyads are most likely to find cooperative solutions to
   conflicts over shared river resources because downstream states can
   offer oil and natural gas side payments to upstream states in exchange
   for greater water supplies. Empirical analyses of dyadic data in shared
   river basin dyads from 1945 to 2001 provide strong support for the
   theory. Riparian cooperation through river treaties and diplomacy is
   best achieved in Downstream energy dyads, where the downstream states
   have energy resources that can be traded for water resources with
   upstream states. Militarized conflict and water related conflict events
   are most likely in Joint energy dyads. Case illustrations from the Aral
   Sea and Ganges river basins are used to demonstrate the theoretical
   arguments.},

Abstract = {Policy scholars have effectively leveraged policy process models,
   theories, and frameworks to respond to a variety of important
   environmental questions. For example, how do environmental issues arrive
   on the agendas of policymakers? What factors contribute to environmental
   policy change? What are the designs and effects of institutions (e. g.,
   policies or cultural norms) on environmental governance? In this review,
   we survey the field of policy process scholarship, focusing on
   environmental governance, with three objectives. The first objective is
   to catalog the policy process models, theories, and frameworks most
   often featured in studies of environmental governance. The second is to
   capture the methodological choices commonly employed in the application
   of these models, theories, and frameworks in environmental domains. The
   third is to identify how these approaches deal with issues central to
   environmental governance research, including time, space, and policy
   scale. We aim to identify trends and strategies for integrating key
   considerations of scale into empirical policy process scholarship.},

Abstract = {The Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) is widely recognized as the United
   States' most effective contemporary policy for reducing poverty, and
   scholars have found that it elevates recipients' sense of social
   inclusion. This raises the question of how it influences recipients'
   civic engagement, namely their attitudes about government and political
   participation. We draw on policy feedback scholarship to consider
   expectations. Then we use a unique dataset to compare recipients of the
   EITC, Aid to Families With Dependent Children/Temporary Assistance to
   Needy Families, and nonrecipients of either policy in order to identify
   how policy features are related to political attitudes and behaviors. We
   find that despite the benefits they receive, EITC recipients experience
   low external political efficacy, but are more likely to be politically
   active than their peers.},

Abstract = {The average citizen often does not experience government policy
   directly, but learns about it from the mass media. The nature of media
   coverage of public policy is thus of real importance, for both public
   opinion and policy itself. It nevertheless is the case that scholars of
   public policy and political communication have invested rather little
   time in developing methods to track public policy coverage in media
   content. The lack of attention is all the more striking in an era in
   which media coverage is readily available in digital form. This paper
   offers a proposal for tracking coverage of the actual direction of
   policy change in mass media. It begins with some methodological
   considerations, and then draws on an expository case-defense spending in
   the United States-to assess the effectiveness of our automated
   content-analytic methods. Results speak to the quantity and quality in
   media coverage of policy issues, and the potential role of mass media-to
   both inform and mislead-in modern representative democracy.},

Abstract = {Lessons from the literature on multi-stakeholder dialogue (MSD) that are
   relevant to the debate on climate engineering (CE) are examined. MSDs
   have been used to prod slow-to-develop intergovernmental regulatory
   processes on a range of transnational and global controversies. A CEMSD
   might push forward anticipatory governance of CE by promoting social
   learning, sharpening and legitimizing governance norms, and starting to
   arrange the political space for governance by states. However,
   significant challenges and risks are also identified, including
   questions about the ripeness of the issue for stakeholder dialogue;
   difficult trade-offs in the design of dialogues, particularly around
   issues of participation and knowledge-power; and inherent tensions in
   the various purposes a CEMSD might serve. Given these challenges, steps
   forward that would better prepare a space for legitimate and effective
   dialogue are recommended.},

Abstract = {This article answers the fundamental question of whether structural
   reforms on labour market regulation and social protection in Italy,
   Portugal and Spain passed during the sovereign debt crisis endured or
   were reversed once external conditionality waned. The study defines
   categorises and illustrates structural policy reversals. It finds there
   have been significant structural policy reversals across the three
   cases, but the bulk of these reforms enacted under conditionality
   endures. It also finds that the waning of conditionality and harsh
   economic austerity alone is not enough to bring about full structural
   policy reversals. Rather, full reversals occur when this condition is
   combined with a change in government and its ideological orientation, or
   when the High Courts step in.},

Title = {Experimentalist governance beyond European Territorial Cooperation and
   cohesion policy: macro-regional strategies of the European Union (EU) as
   emerging ``regional institutions'?},

Abstract = {Since 2009, the European Union (EU) has started to `experiment' with new
   forms of territorial governance: Macro-regional strategies (MRS), such
   as the one for Baltic Sea Region, seek to mobilize a variety of actors
   and have resulted in a complex and dynamic governance architecture which
   can be conceived as a new `regional institution' disposing of some form
   of authority and autonomy. We show that EU MRS are best conceived as
   test-bed for intergovernmentalizing cohesion policy - as well as its
   European Territorial Cooperation (ETC) objective - in a functional
   region, locking in previously established formats of regional
   cooperation and thereby going beyond cohesion policy and ETC. Thus, this
   paper identifies EU MRS as instances of experimentalist governance
   albeit still falling short on monitoring and evaluation of
   implementation. This weakness may ultimately jeopardize the
   macro-regional experiment altogether and, consequently, the development
   and consolidation of `regional institutions' of the EU.},

Abstract = {This article seeks to explain the frequency and tone of media attention
   for public organisations. Expectations are formulated on the impact of
   fundamental organisational features on the frequency and tone of
   coverage of public organisations. A fuzzy-set qualitative comparative
   analysis (fsQCA) is used to analyse the nuanced interplay between legal
   independence, primary task and organisational size. The results show
   that this configurational approach is necessary to understand which
   public organisations appear in the media and how. Legal independence,
   task and size do not operate independently, but combine in explaining
   the media attention for public organisations.},

Abstract = {There is no question that pacifism is largely ignored in IR. An
   important consequence of this is that normative theorising is more often
   than not limited to considerations of when to employ violence in
   response to threats and conflicts. This article aims to critically
   engage with some of the ways in which pacifist theory is neglected and
   dismissed in IR normative theorising, assess some of the consequences of
   excluding pacifist perspectives, and gesture towards the ways in which
   pacifist theory might help to expand the ethical horizons of debate over
   how to respond to violent threats. The article argues that taking
   pacifism seriously could help to expand the ethical imagination and
   range of policy options in considerations about civilian protection,
   among others. Investing in the exploration of pacifist approaches has
   the potential to go beyond short-term protection measures in violent
   conflicts, taking us instead towards the goal of breaking the long-term
   cycles of violence which perpetuate vulnerability in the first instance.},

Abstract = {What are the effects of partisan electoral interventions on the
   subsequent character of the regime in the targeted country? Partisan
   electoral interventions have been frequently used by the great powers
   ever since the rise of meaningful competitive elections around the
   world. Such interventions have been found to have significant effects on
   the results of the intervened elections determining in many cases the
   identity of the winner. Nevertheless, there has been little research on
   the effects of partisan electoral interventions on the target's
   subsequent level of democracy. This study investigates this question,
   testing three hypotheses derived from relevant political science
   literatures. I find suggestive evidence that covert electoral
   interventions have a significant negative effect on the target's
   democracy increasing its susceptibility to a democratic breakdown. I
   also find preliminary evidence that the identity of the intervener has a
   mediating effect on the negative effects of covert interventions.},

Abstract = {After the end of the Cold War, states and international organizations
   increasingly adopted a new ``anti-coup norm.{''} However, this norm has
   evolved unevenly, and has never been universally embraced or
   consistently enforced. This article examines the uneven evolution of the
   anti-coup norm by tracing its fate within the United Nations system. It
   shows how member states have sought to retain discretion in how they
   respond to individual coup cases, and how, in response, UN officials
   within the Secretariat sought to pursue norm institutionalization by
   changing the UN's internal rules and procedures for dealing with coup
   countries. In doing so, they pursued the ``lowest common denominator{''}
   norm institutionalization, which involves seeking to achieve the highest
   level of institutionalization that is achievable, even if it means
   aiming for a lower level of progress than norm promoters would ideally
   like.},

   from Liberia},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATION},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {73},
Number = {2},
Pages = {365-398},
Month = {SPR},
Abstract = {What are the effects of international intervention on the rule of law
   after civil war? Rule of law requires not only that state authorities
   abide by legal limits on their power, but also that citizens rely on
   state laws and institutions to adjudicate disputes. Using an original
   survey and list experiment in Liberia, I show that exposure to the UN
   Mission in Liberia (UNMIL) increased citizens' reliance on state over
   nonstate authorities to resolve the most serious incidents of crime and
   violence, and increased nonstate authorities' reliance on legal over
   illegal mechanisms of dispute resolution. I use multiple identification
   strategies to support a causal interpretation of these results,
   including an instrumental variables strategy that leverages plausibly
   exogenous variation in the distribution of UNMIL personnel induced by
   the killing of seven peacekeepers in neighboring Cote d'Ivoire. My
   results are still detectable two years later, even in communities that
   report no further exposure to peacekeepers. I also find that exposure to
   UNMIL did not mitigate and may in fact have exacerbated citizens'
   perceptions of state corruption and bias in the short term, but that
   these apparently adverse effects dissipated over time. I conclude by
   discussing implications of these complex but overall beneficial effects.},

Abstract = {Scholarship on civil war is overwhelmingly preoccupied with armed
   activity. Data collection efforts on actors in civil wars tend to
   reflect this emphasis, with most studies focusing on the identities,
   attributes, and violent behavior of armed actors. Yet various actors
   also use nonviolent methods to shape the intensity and variation of
   violence as well as the duration of peace in the aftermath. Existing
   datasets on mobilization by non-state actors - such as the Armed
   Conflict Events and Location (ACLED), Integrated Conflict Early Warning
   System (ICEWS), and Social Conflict Analysis Database (SCAD) - tend to
   include data on manifest contentious acts, such as protests, strikes,
   and demonstrations, and exclude activities like organizing, planning,
   training, negotiations, communications, and capacity-building that may
   be critical to the actors' ultimate success. To provide a more
   comprehensive and reliable view of the landscape of possible nonviolent
   behaviors involved in civil wars, we present the Nonviolent Action in
   Violent Contexts (NVAVC) dataset, which identifies 3,662 nonviolent
   actions during civil wars in Africa between 1990 and 2012, across 124
   conflict-years in 17 countries. In this article, we describe the data
   collection process, discuss the information contained therein, and offer
   descriptive statistics and discuss spatial patterns. The framework we
   develop provides a powerful tool for future researchers to use to
   categorize various types of nonviolent action, and the data we collect
   provide important evidence that such efforts are worthwhile.},

Abstract = {What explains national preferences concerning international and regional
   financial regulation? This article focusses on one of the main financial
   jurisdictions worldwide, the United Kingdom (UK). It is puzzling that
   since the crisis this jurisdiction has pursued stringent harmonised
   regulation in certain areas (banking), but not others (capital markets).
   We explain this in terms of how the demands of powerful economic
   interests are mediated by the political process and regulatory
   institutions. In banking, there was strong political pressure to restore
   financial stability, and regulatory institutions were significantly
   strengthened. This enabled UK regulators to resist industry lobbying and
   pursue more stringent harmonised rules at the international and European
   Union levels ({''}trading up{''}). In the case of capital markets, by
   contrast, UK regulators lacked political support for tougher regulation
   and were institutionally much weaker. As a result, the industry was far
   more effective in shaping UK preferences aimed at protecting the
   sector's competitiveness ({''}trading down{''}).},

Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {I explore the construction of women as the secret for the `successful'
   prosecution of war in Afghanistan. To do so, I take up the mobilization
   of gender in the US counterinsurgency doctrine as deployed in
   Afghanistan. I draw on the 2006 Counterinsurgency Field Manual, human
   rights and humanitarian reports, and scholarly works to identify and
   analyze this mobilization, paying attention to the colonial histories
   upon which COIN explicitly and implicitly relies. By critically
   integrating these sources and the paradigmatic moments that exemplify
   COIN, I demonstrate the constitutive relationship of gender and COIN.
   The valence of the secret - of women as concealing, revealing, being,
   and bearing the secret - is still a lesser explored element in the
   analysis of the gendering of COIN and of its `military orientalism'.
   Even as scholars have powerfully shown how, in the case of Afghanistan
   and elsewhere, the veil functions as an overdetermined and `multilayered
   signifier' in its own right, symbolizing the `tension between disclosure
   and concealment that defines the dominant conception of the secret',
   less subject to detailed analysis in case of Afghanistan is the ways in
   which Afghan women are constituted through COIN in polysemous relation
   to the notion of the secret.},

Abstract = {Freedom of Information Acts (FOIAs) aim to provide a channelled exchange
   between citizens and public officials that, irrespective of the
   citizen's identity, results in the provision of timely, relevant, and
   often new information about policy. We evaluated Mexico's FOIA by
   submitting 307 information requests on behalf of an average male citizen
   to government entities in the years 2007, 2013, and 2015. In 2007, we
   also submitted the same requests to 87 comparable entities on behalf of
   a male citizen who signalled economic and political clout.
   Encouragingly, entities do not discriminate between regular and
   seemingly influential citizens. Entities also answer more frequently and
   provide more information in 2015 compared to earlier years, but they are
   taking longer to answer, frequently charging fees, and often failing to
   provide quality information to questions they are legally bound to
   answer. Mexico's FOIA is a functional system demanding significant
   improvements.},

Abstract = {Little is known about the effects of two prominent public sector
   reformsanticorruption efforts and high-powered incentive systemson the
   accomplishment of policy goals in the absence of the rule of law and in
   the presence of an extrinsic incentive to take advantage of corruption
   to achieve performance targets. This study explores how performance
   rewards and anticorruption efforts jointly affect administrative outputs
   and policy outcomes. We examine China's air pollution control policy
   with province-level panel data. The analysis shows that performance
   rewards prompt administrative outputs that are linked to the incentive
   structure. Anticorruption activities have small significant, positive
   effects on those outputs only prior to the inception of high-powered
   rewards, but have no significant effect on policy outcomes, regardless
   of the measure. The introduction of performance incentives contributes
   to the achievement of policy outcomes only when their measurement is
   subject to government manipulation.},

Abstract = {Recent studies of media and security continue to be limited by various
   theoretical and ontological commitments, despite their claims of
   ``moving beyond{''} or ``reconsidering{''} the CNN effect. In this
   article, I review the two dominant research paradigms for media and
   security. The first research paradigm, which includes the CNN-effect
   literature, imagines media as an independent actor in the policy-making
   process. The second research paradigm portrays media as a neutral
   channel, passing along the message of foreign policy elites. Each of
   these paradigms remains wedded to an actor-centered and choice-theoretic
   approach to media and security, as witnessed by recent attempts to study
   the CNN effect. I argue that a new research paradigm based on relational
   sociology actually moves media and security studies beyond the CNN
   effect and resolves the fundamental theoretical limitations associated
   with it.},

Abstract = {In the last few years, Graham Allison's Thucydides' Trap has stimulated
   much discussion within International Relations (IR). Most IR scholars
   understand Thucydides' Trap as a shorthand for power transition theory,
   and view it as highly inadequate for analyzing China-US relations. This
   article seeks to offer an alternative, tragic, understanding of
   Thucydides' Trap that may have more purchase on the analysis of the
   dynamic of China-US relations. It first argues that while Thucydides'
   Trap shares power transition theory's focus on the shifting balance of
   power, it is also different from the latter in its emphasis on the
   emotional implications of changes in the balance of power. This article
   then explores a tragic understanding of Thucydides' Trap. Economic
   success often encourages a rising power to display ambition, confidence
   and enhanced sense of self (what Allison calls rising power syndrome),
   which leads to loosened restraint, overextension, and strategic blunder;
   meanwhile, its assertive and ambitious moves spark a ruling power's
   fear, insecurity and even paranoia (what Allison calls ruling power
   syndrome), which prompts it to take preventive actions in response to
   the rising power's assertiveness. This article finally looks at China-US
   relations through this tragic lens. It suggests that this tragic
   understanding of Thucydides' Trap can illuminate the emotional aspect of
   China-US relations, and also argues that the Thucydides Trap Research
   Project should henceforth develop an emotional line of inquiry into
   interaction between the great powers.},

Abstract = {This paper uses a new set of questions to analyse the impact of populist
   attitudes on party preferences and voting behaviour in the 2015 Polish
   parliamentary elections. At these elections, voters faced a choice
   between two broad blocs: parties that accepted the
   ``liberal-orthodox{''} model of post-communist politics, and those that
   rejected this model and the political elites associated with its
   implementation. I find that there is a coherent set of populist
   attitudes among the Polish electorate, and that it correlates with
   economic and cultural attitudes in ways consistent with the supply-side
   divide between liberal and anti-liberal parties. Analysis of the
   individual and combined impact of these attitudes on voting behaviour
   reveals that populism plays a significant role both in structuring the
   sentiments of voters towards particular kinds of political parties and
   in determining how they cast their vote.},

Abstract = {Prefigurative politics, the idea of `building the new world in the shell
   of the old', increasingly forms part of the common sense of radical
   social and political movements but deserves more careful conceptual
   analysis. Traditionally, such ideas have been discussed in contrast to
   `strategic' politics, but this has been challenged by recent
   scholarship, which has stressed that they can and should be seen as
   strategic. This article agrees but points to a more fundamental tension
   rooted in attempting to enact the future in the present. This is
   discussed through two broad approaches to prefiguration: ends-guided and
   ends-effacing. The former leads to a practical dilemma between acting to
   bring about the future and acting as if it has already been achieved.
   The latter addresses this, but nonetheless requires further articulation
   of the relationship between present and future action, which the article
   argues can be achieved by drawing on ideas from critical pedagogy.},

   current global nuclear order, but also some core theoretical concerns
   about nuclear weapons, global politics, and modernity. The call by the
   treaty's supporters to change the meaning of nuclear weapons provides an
   impetus to think further and critically about what these weapons mean.},

   arrangements, and currency linkages as well as ethnic appeals and
   propaganda/news manipulation to influence foreign audiences. In
   addition, Russia has used clandestine operations, including cyber
   attacks, and support for dissident groups. With the annexation of Crimea
   and the conflict with Georgia Russia chose direct military force because

Abstract = {Existing scholarship on climate governance has not sufficiently
   considered the relationship between climate leaders/pioneers and
   followers. Because of the global commons nature of climate change,
   unilateral leadership or pioneership by one or a small number of actors
   will be insufficient to combat climate change effectively. The need to
   take seriously the relationship between leaders and followers is all the
   greater in the wake of the 2015 Paris Agreement, which emphasises
   diffuse, bottom-up action. The relationship between leaders and
   followers in polycentric climate governance is unpacked in this
   contribution. What types of actors can be climate followers? Through
   what pathways can followership emerge and how can we capture the
   essential characteristics of leader-follower relationships? What
   conditions facilitate (or hinder) followership? The utility of the
   approach is illustrated using cases of EU climate leadership and (non-)
   followership of other actors.},

Abstract = {The world today is hostage to decolonization, marked by its failures.
   The old world has been unable to accommodate the new one within the
   community of so-called ``civilized{''} nations. Yet there are few
   exceptions, such as in Japan and Latin America, between 1947, date of
   the independence and partitioning of India, and the last wave of
   decolonization in the mid-1970s, no one knew how to open the door to the
   newcomers in a suitable way. In the aftermath of the colonial order, a
   post-colonial order was rebuilt based on trusteeship over the recently
   ``emancipated{''} states. This was the purpose of the British
   Commonwealth, of the ``Community{''} designed by General de Gaulle in
   1958, and the notorious ``Francafrique.{''} It was overlooked that these
   new states had their own histories and could not safely follow down the
   Western path of nation-building. This chapter explores the concepts of
   weak states and neocolonialism, how an instrumental vision of the South
   developed, why the Middle East can be seen as a volcano. It also
   questions issues of proximity and civilizational depth, the new
   conflicts and so called multi-level wars, and finally turns to the
   question of power, its powerlessness, and the power of the weak.},

   Kurdish Statehood: A `Missed' Opportunity?},
Journal = {ETHNOPOLITICS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {18},
Number = {1, SI},
Pages = {13-28},
Abstract = {Historians who have examined the `failure' of the Kurds to obtain
   statehood in the immediate aftermath of the First World War have,
   understandable, closely examined the lobbying efforts engaged in by the
   Kurdish elites in Istanbul, specifically those activists associated with
   the Society for the Betterment of Kurdistan (est. 1918). These efforts
   culminated in the summer of 1920 with the inclusion of clauses within
   Treaty of Sevres which provided Kurdish-inhabited regions of the dying
   Ottoman Empire with a pathway to independence. Yet, only a few years
   later, Sevres was replaced by the Treaty of Lausanne (1923), a treaty
   which made no provisions for Kurdish self-rule. This reversal of
   fortunes is accounted for in a number of ways, divisions amongst the
   Kurdish nationalists, the military success of Mustafa Kemal Pasha's
   `nationalist' forces in the Greco-Turkish War (1920-1922), and the
   `betrayal' of the Kurds by perfidious European powers. However, often
   overlooked in this story is the geopolitical legacy of the First World
   War. It will be argued here that the failure of Kurdish nationalists in
   the immediate aftermath of the war can in large part be explained by
   developments that occurred over the four years of conflict.},

Abstract = {This article addresses how desire and fantasy function in a
   project-based welfare setting by examining a case from the context of
   Danish educational policy. Drawing on Zizek and others' development of
   psychoanalytical concepts derived from Lacan, the paper shows through an
   interview-based empirical study how project managers believe in the
   project they manage through their fantasies about highly passionate
   `fiery souls'. However, as the paper argues such managerial fiery soul
   fantasies add a fantasmatic superstructure to the professional ideals in
   the reformed Danish public school in a way that challenges the
   profession category itself by eroding the difference between
   professionalism and volunteerism. The conclusion is that the secret of
   the fiery soul rather is its ability to make project-based welfare
   policy appear coherent than it is the almost supernatural abilities of
   particular individuals.},

   Insights from the Work of Ruy Mauro Marini},

Abstract = {For Ruy Mauro Marini, writing in the mid-1990s, neodevelopmentalism in
   Latin America ended with the moratoria on debt repayment in Mexico and
   Brazil in the early 1980s, which ushered in an era of International
   Monetary Fund control. For him this demonstrated the inability of the
   Latin American bourgeoisie to achieve autonomy at the international
   level. Neodevelopmentalism returned in early-twenty-first-century
   Argentina in the local context of a new class politics and a wider
   context marked by the emergence of China in the world economy and the
   influence of Chavismo. It consisted of an economic policy that
   consolidated the new hegemonic groups led by transnational capital
   through the superexploitation of labor and nature and the revival of the
   myth of development expressed by the notion of ``growth with social
   inclusion.{''} For a time the project was characterized by high rates of
   profit and high levels of (albeit precarious) employment, but, as the
   global crisis of 2008 revealed its limitations and the ``fine-tuning{''}
   of economic policy produced a decline of real incomes and consumption,
   it led to fragmentation of the political spectrum and a realignment of
   its principal actors. Mauricio Macri's election to the presidency in
   2015 represented a counterrevolution that, as Marini predicted decades
   ago, would involve more violent superexploitation and stronger
   imperialist influence.},

Abstract = {This chapter seeks to examine criminology's role in the social
   contestation of the contagion phenomenon. The argument is advanced that
   criminology is well-placed to scrutinise such developments, particularly
   given the increasingly synergistic and `plastic' relationship between
   the `special' and the `normal' within criminal justice. The important
   role played by human rights in contesting excessive securitisation,
   moreover, will require deeper criminological engagement with human
   rights. In this regard, it is argued that the application of
   governmentality-informed criminological concepts may help to illuminate
   the process and context in which departures from human rights standards
   are made and the `rationalities' and `knowledges' facilitating them.},

Abstract = {The article discusses the disconnect between arms control and
   disarmament practices vis-a-vis peacebuilding practices. It critically
   analyzes Disarmament, Demobilization, and Reintegration (DDR) practices
   focusing on their absence of dialogue with international arms control
   and disarmament (ACD) practices. It proposes that a conversation between
   experts involved in these distinct practices could promote a political
   discussion on the place of weapons held by state and non-state actors in
   times of peace. The argument is illustrated through an analysis of the
   treatment of rules on weapons in the Colombian peace process
   (2012-present) with the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC).
   The article concludes that the disconnect between the arms control and
   disarmament and the peacebuilding associations, as seen in the context
   of DDR practices, reinstates the rule on the monopoly of violence by the
   state, preventing a broader discussion of the role of weapons and
   violence in the building of political communities.},

Abstract = {How do social movements, business interests and states' social and
   material environments influence the regulation of innovative industrial
   activities that bring not only transformative economic benefits but also
   significant social disruption and environmental risk? How can we
   adjudicate between these influences across states and over time?
   Analyzing a longitudinal dataset of 34 American states at risk of
   `fracking' from 2009 to 2016, I find that environmental movement
   organizational capacity and economic health are the strongest predictors
   of states' decisions to intervene and regulate fracking. In addition,
   although higher resource-dependence on the fossil-fuel industry does not
   directly predict less regulation, that effect is mediated by increased
   physical potential for fracking (i.e., shale resources) within the
   state's natural environment. I argue that the effects of non-state
   actors and institutional context on how new markets are regulated
   depend, in part, on the extent of potential economic benefits and
   societal risks posed by the economic activity.},

Abstract = {Purpose - The primary objective of this paper is to extend the Activity
   Reduces Conflict Associated Strain (ARCAS) model. To test the ARCAS
   model, the study aims to examine the effect of process conflict on
   employee well-being and the role of negative affect as an intrapersonal
   mechanism linking process conflict and employee well-being. Further, to
   extend the emerging ARCAS model, the study examines whether the assumed
   indirect effect of process conflict on employee well-being through
   negative affect is conditional upon levels of conflict management
   styles.
   Design/methodology/approach - In total, 554 software engineers working
   in information technology firms responded to the administered
   questionnaire and hypothesised relationships were tested using Process
   Macros.
   Findings - The findings indicate that process conflict is negatively
   related to employee well-being and the negative affect state mediates
   the relationship between process conflict and employee well-being. As
   hypothesised, it was found that the indirect effect of process conflict
   on employee well-being through the negative affect state is conditional
   upon levels of conflict management styles of the employees.
   Research limitations/implications - The study contributes to the
   conflict literature by establishing the detrimental effect of process
   conflict on employee well-being. The study also established the
   explanatory mechanism linking process conflict and employee well-being.
   Further, the study extended the emerging ARCAS model by establishing the
   moderating role of conflict management styles as well as the conditional
   indirect effect.
   Practical implications - The study highlighted the within-individual
   effect of process conflict in deteriorating employee well-being. The
   study provides valuable insights to the managers and practitioners about
   how individuals' conflict management styles influence well-being.
   Originality/value - The study specifically examined the effect of
   process conflict, which was omitted from conflict literature considering
   it the same as task conflict, on employee well-being. The study
   established the within-individual mechanism through which process
   conflict diminishes employee well-being. Also, the study extended the
   ARCAS model by examining the effect of conflict management styles with
   the aid of Affective Events Theory.},

Journal = {POLICY STUDIES},

Volume = {40},
Number = {3-4, SI},
Pages = {270-286},
Abstract = {In the policy advice literature, there has been two main ``waves{''} of
   research focus. In the first wave, the focus of scholarly attention
   tended to focus on single policy advice actors. A key innovation was
   offered by Halligan, who sought to frame policy advice within a policy
   advisory system, with a focus on government control and location. In
   later research, Craft and Wilder called for a ``second wave{''} of
   research which also sought to integrate factors such as policy content,
   context, ideational compatibility but also reflect the increasingly
   polycentric advice landscape. This article contributes to the second
   wave drawing attention to a key element of the institutional dynamics of
   policy advice systems, namely the issue of political ``demand{''}. A
   core argument offered in this article is that the dynamics of demand
   need to be interrogated more fully, and be given greater prominence in
   current understandings of PAS dynamics. The net effect of marginalizing
   ``demand{''} factors is that it can de-politicize the extent and nature
   of advice-giving, and reduce it to a seeming technocratic exchange. To
   expand our understanding of demand, this paper offers a framework for
   understanding the dynamics of demand within policy advice systems.},

Journal = {POLITICS RELIGION \& IDEOLOGY},

Pages = {170-191},
Abstract = {The need to bridge the perceived gap between religious and secular
   allies-individuals or movements incorrectly understood to be in tension
   with one another-presents a serious challenge for those attempting to
   understand such collaborations. Dominant efforts to reconcile the two
   have, moreover, been problematically inadequate. This article-taking
   religious ISIS and the secular Baath Party as its example-begins by
   identifying and critiquing the dominant strategies that analysts have
   employed to explain such collaborations: secularization (of ISIS),
   conversion (of the Baath Party), and minimization (of religion and
   ideology altogether). It argues that each of these approaches relies on
   distorting and misrepresenting the very movements under analysis and
   thus precludes an accurate understanding of what is happening. It then
   charts a constructive path forward by adapting political theorist
   William Connolly's work on resonance machines. An approach informed by
   Connolly makes it possible to retain ISIS's religiosity and the Baath
   Party's secularism; highlights the reality that putatively incompatible
   movements may be united by a shared ethos that amplifies their
   respective ideologies; and sheds new light on the implicit messaging
   that may tempt recruits to join such movements.},

   Policy in Calgary in 2011},

Abstract = {Policy termination is identified as a rare occurrence and thus difficult
   to study. However, one policy area, community water fluoridation, has
   seen an apparent increase in termination in recent years. We examine the
   specific case of termination in Calgary, Alberta in 2011 with a specific
   goal to apply Kingdon's Multiple Streams Approach to the policy
   termination framework. Our findings suggest that of key importance for
   the termination of water fluoridation was the impending need for an
   upgrade to the fluoridation infrastructure, the effectiveness of the
   local anti-fluoridation activists, the speed of decision making, and a
   prominent framing of the issue in ethical terms. The opening of a policy
   window made possible by the 2010 Calgary municipal election, one that
   introduced a number of new members to council, as well as the presence
   of a policy entrepreneur who took advantage of the window's opening,
   were of specific importance to the success of policy termination.},

Title = {The influence of cognitive style diversity on intra-group relationship
   conflict, individual-level organizational citizenship behaviors and the
   moderating role of leader-member-exchange},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONFLICT MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {30},
Number = {4, SI},
Pages = {490-513},
Abstract = {Purpose - This paper aims to investigate the influence of cognitive
   style diversity on intra-group relationship conflict and
   individual-level organizational citizenship behaviors (OCBs). The role
   of leader-member exchange as a moderating variable is also examined.
   Design/methodology/approach - The authors used hierarchical linear
   modeling and hierarchical regression analysis to analyze results from a
   sample of 344 members from 83 teams nested within 126 departments in six
   manufacturing organizations in the People's Republic of China.
   Findings - Results yielded general support for our hypothesized
   relationships between cognitive style diversity and intra-group
   relationship conflict. Leader-member exchange was also found to moderate
   the relationship between these two variables. Contrary to expectations,
   there were no relationships between these variables and individual-level
   organizational citizenship behaviors.
   Originality/value - This research addresses calls from the team
   diversity and conflict literature to address the understudied area of
   deep-level cognitive diversity. Second, this study addresses previous
   calls for more team-level and mixed-level theory and methodology to
   inform OCB research. Third, this is the first study of group-level
   cognitive style diversity and the moderating influence of
   leader-member-exchange and provides valuable insights into ways of
   mitigating some of the negative effects of cognitive diversity on teams.},

Abstract = {While researchers have recognized the importance of social movements for
   market emergence, we know little about the mechanisms through which
   mobilized secondary stakeholders trigger interest in new markets among
   incumbent firms. We investigate the possibility that social movements
   create and amplify a polluting technology stigma that leads incumbents
   to develop a stigma dilution strategy, which is associated with entering
   a new market. We also examine the contingent factors that enhance the
   positive environmental consequences of technology stigma. Our
   quantitative analyses of the adoption of green power programs by U.S.
   electric utilities and the subsequent growth in green power consumption
   allows us to test hypotheses about the effect of technology stigma,
   secondary stakeholders and moderator effects. The analysis confirms our
   hypotheses, speaking to the literature on movements, organizations and
   markets.},

Month = {JAN 1},
Abstract = {Truth commissions aim to promote transparency, accountability, and
   reconciliation by compiling detailed narratives of political violence.
   To achieve this end, both victims and perpetrators of abuses must
   testify. Yet, little is known about how commissions can be designed to
   facilitate perpetrator testimony. This article develops a theory of
   perpetrator participation in truth commissions, with a focus on
   institutional design. The article then evaluates the effectiveness of
   four design featuresamnesties, subpoena powers, dual-party agreements,
   and spiritual frameworksin facilitating perpetrator testimony in the
   truth commissions in Sierra Leone, South Africa, and Timor-Leste. The
   analysis indicates that the theoretical constructs developed are
   present, functional, and influential for perpetrator participation in
   the three commissions. And, while no individual design feature is
   essential, the case studies reveal that perpetrator participation may
   not be forthcoming without a robust dual-party agreement and/or a
   resonant spiritual framework. This underscores the importance of
   normative foundations for perpetrators' engagement with commissions.
   Crucially, though advantageous features may be present, the criteria
   required for them to function may not be met, resulting in no effect or
   a negative effect on participation.},

Title = {Microfoundations of Active Representation in Public Bureaucracies:
   Evidence From a Survey of Personnel Recruitment in the Swiss Federal

Abstract = {This article investigates the link between passive (descriptive) and
   active (substantive) representation in public bureaucracies. Previous
   studies on this topic mostly focused on the US context, where race and
   gender are the most salient aspects of bureaucratic representation. In
   Switzerland, representation of the various cultural communities in the
   federal bureaucracy is the most salient issue. Active representation is
   operationalized as administrators preferences for minority origin, as
   well as for skills in minority languages when selecting candidates in
   personnel recruitment processes. We use a structural equation model to
   analyze individual-level data from a survey of administrators in the
   Swiss federal civil service. Findings are that passive representation
   fosters active representation not only at the level of individual
   bureaucrats, but also at the level of the agencies as the main
   bureaucratic work environment. Moreover, we find that effects of passive
   on active representation are not direct but mediated by administrators
   sensitivity to issues related to minority representation. Sensitivity to
   minority conditions therefore appears as the main microfoundation for
   active representation of minority interest, and as a core explanatory
   factor for active representation outside of demographic congruence.},

Abstract = {How does the alliance between a client state and its nuclear ally
   influence support for proliferation in the client? Conventional wisdom
   suggests that when nuclear security guarantees are not credible, support
   for proliferation will be high, since a domestic nuclear capability
   offers an alternative source of deterrence. I introduce a new theory,
   which posits that highly credible security guarantees can backfire by
   causing some individuals to fear their ally might miscalculate-either by
   using nuclear weapons in an unnecessary preventative attack or by
   precipitous escalation of a crisis or conflict. Survey experiments
   conducted among representative samples of South Korean citizens in 2018
   and 2019 support this theory, showing that increases in the credibility
   of the US nuclear security guarantee lead to increased support for
   nuclear proliferation among South Korean respondents.},

Abstract = {Lulism is one of the most important political phenomena of
   twenty-first-century Brazil. It can be compared to the Varguism that
   dominated Brazilian politics between 1930 and 1964 in its broad popular
   but politically unorganized base and its policy of state intervention in
   the economy to stimulate economic growth, increase the state's room for
   maneuver against the imperialist countries, and promote a moderate
   income distribution. These two variants of populism differ, however, in
   that Varguism was based on the working class while Lulism, which may be
   called ``neopopulism,{''} is based on the marginal mass of workers and
   has less potential to destabilize the political process. Bonapartism, to
   which Lulism has also been compared, is distinct from it in that what
   links its leadership to its base is the fetish of the state based on
   order rather than the fetish based on protection. O lulismo e um dos
   fenomenos politicos mais importantes do Brasil do seculo XXI. Pode ser
   comparado ao varguismo que dominou a politica brasileira entre 1930 e
   1964 em relacao a sua ampla, mas politicamente desorganizada, base
   popular, e sua politica de intervencao estatal na economia para
   estimular o crescimento economico, aumentar a margem de manobra do
   Estado contra os paises imperialistas e promover uma distribuicao de
   renda moderada. Essas duas variantes do populismo diferem, no entanto,
   no sentido de que o varguismo era baseado na classe trabalhadora,
   enquanto o lulismo, que pode ser chamado de ``neopopulismo{''}, e
   baseado na massa marginal de trabalhadores e tem menos potencial para
   desestabilizar o processo politico. O bonapartismo, ao qual o lulismo
   tambem foi comparado, e distinto dele, pois o que liga sua lideranca a
   sua base e o fetiche do estado baseado na ordem, e nao o fetiche baseado
   na protecao.},

Abstract = {Fragmentation and specialization-two characteristics of governance-have
   increased the number and variety of actors involved in the governing
   process, which can influence policy outcomes and legitimacy. To date,
   studies on governance or policy networks usually focus on one policy
   field and one moment in time. In this article, we analyse the dynamic
   aspect, thus how governance networks change over time, and examine
   whether the fragmentation and specialization of the governance system is
   mirrored in the circulation of public officials. Our case is the urban
   governance system of the Paris region, which is characterized by high
   fragmentation along policy fields and territory. The data show that
   Paris is governed by three sub-systems that largely correspond to the
   different territorial levels of governance, but also to different types
   of organizations. Generally, territorial fragmentation seems to be
   stronger than policy field fragmentation. This structure is quite stable
   across time.},

Abstract = {Research in several domains has shown that attitudinal inoculation
   effectively promotes resistance to persuasion. Despite its proven
   efficacy, inoculation has not been empirically tested as a strategy for
   preventing the adoption of beliefs and attitudes consistent with violent
   extremist ideologies. The current study addresses this gap in the
   literature. In a between-subjects experiment performed in the U.S.,
   participants (N = 357) were exposed to an inoculation message or
   no-inoculation control message before reading left- or right-wing
   extremist propaganda. Inoculation positively predicted psychological
   reactance, which in turn, reduced intention to support the extremist
   group. Inoculation also negatively predicted perceptions of the
   extremist group's credibility, which positively predicted support
   intention. Neither the apparent source of the inoculation message, nor
   the ideological focus of the propaganda, moderated any of these
   relationships. These results effectively extend the scope of inoculation
   theory into the realm of violent extremism and have implications for the
   development of messages intended to prevent persuasive outcomes
   consistent with extremist ideologies.},

Title = {The SciencePolicy Nexus in Collaborative Governance: Use of Science in
   Ecosystem Recovery Planning},
Journal = {REVIEW OF POLICY RESEARCH},
Year = {2019},
Month = {2019 NOV 13},
Abstract = {Across many social-ecological systems, policy makers and scholars
   increasingly call for science to inform policy. The science-policy
   interface becomes especially complex as collaborative approaches include
   multiple stakeholders working together across jurisdictions.
   Unfortunately little is known about how much and how science is used in
   collaborative governance for social-ecological systems. This exploratory
   study examines instrumental, conceptual, and symbolic use of science in
   a science-rich collaborative planning case in the Puget Sound, USA. It
   also examines the influence of science, relative to other factors, in
   collaborative planning, and what factors affect it. Results from a
   survey and document analysis indicate the prevalence of conceptual use
   of science, with relatively little symbolic use. Some factors promoting
   conceptual and instrumental use discourage symbolic use. Overall, while
   science is seen as influential in this science-rich context, its
   influence is balanced by local stakeholder preferences and contextual
   information.},

Abstract = {What is the appropriate way to respond to actions that break basic norms
   of respectfulness, sincerity, and public-mindedness? At the same time as
   this question has become a central concern for democratic societies, a
   `systemic' turn has unsettled established solutions for democratic
   theorists. From the systemic perspective, it is more important how
   actions contribute to public discourse than whether they meet standards
   of deliberation individually. This article challenges theorists to
   consider three additional propositions: (1) to be inclusive and
   deliberative, the system and its parts must be mutually supportive; (2)
   well-performing systems have sufficient reflective capacity to examine
   their own deficiencies when violations of basic norms occur; and (3) the
   performance of a deliberative system needs to take into account both the
   frequency of violations and the reflective qualities of the system's
   response. For a well-performing system, violations of basic norms are
   opportunities to learn and strengthen the support for spaces of
   deliberation.},

   Applications: Methodological and Conceptual Considerations},
Journal = {POLICY STUDIES JOURNAL},

Volume = {47},
Number = {4},
Pages = {899-920},

Abstract = {Recent literature reviews on contributions applying the multiple streams
   framework (MSF) concluded that although the framework is prolific, there
   is a lack of contributions testing it in a larger sample size. By
   addressing which barriers to entry medium and large n MSF applications
   face and by suggesting ways to handle them, we aim at providing
   researchers with a benchmark contribution for developing MSF-guided
   research designs based on a medium to a high number of cases. Building
   on an overview of the few existing medium and large n MSF studies, we
   address three challenges researchers must deal with: (1) choice of
   dependent variables and case selection; (2) operationalization and
   measurement of the framework's (predominantly figurative) key concepts;
   and (3) choice of a method that corresponds with the framework's
   research questions. In the latter regard, we focus on the pros and cons
   of employing regression analysis and qualitative comparative analysis.
   We conclude that although the barriers to entry are high for testing the
   MSF in a larger sample size, they are not insurmountable.},

Journal = {POLICY STUDIES JOURNAL},

Volume = {47},

Abstract = {The existence of the tutela mechanism and the endemic weaknesses of the
   legislative and executive branches of the Colombian state have led to a
   de facto judicialization of health policymaking. The objective of
   evidence-informed policy is to identify effective policy approaches and
   legitimize policy decisions. Questions arise about the basis on which
   judges take decisions with significant policy and budgetary
   consequences, and the forms of evidence they use to inform these. This
   article focuses on the extent to which courts take account of research
   evidence in judgements and assesses the implications for health policy
   in Colombia. We place these discussions in the context of a broader
   analysis of the ongoing reforms to the Colombian health system and the
   most recent literature on evidence-informed policymaking. The
   judicialization of health policymaking offers a suboptimal means to
   achieve the objective of evidence-informed policymaking. The emergence
   of a range of evidence advisory bodies in recent years is an attempt to
   address the issue of judicialization alongside the other constitutional
   and political weaknesses Colombia faces.},

Abstract = {One of the most important legacies of the ``Troubles{''} in Northern
   Ireland and the ensuing 20 years post-peace-process era, heralded by the
   1998 Good Friday Agreement, is the rise of complex and diverse
   Republican and Loyalist paramilitary groups engaging in acts of
   terrorism and a wide range of organized criminal and cross-border
   activities. Yet, little scholarship has been dedicated for examining the
   nexus between terrorism and organized crime in Northern Ireland or for
   accurately understanding the role that paramilitaries play in organized
   crime and their dynamic interactions with organized criminal groups.
   Informed by empirical evidence and qualitative interviews with
   government agencies in Northern Ireland, it is this important gap in
   scholarship that this article aims to fill. It does so by developing a
   new terrorism-organized crime model which reveals a range of different
   types of crime-terror interactions in Northern Ireland. The article
   concludes that national terrorism-organized crime models, and the
   Northern Ireland model in particular, albeit with variations to its
   constituent components to accommodate local situations, are most
   appropriate for capturing intricate and dynamic interactions between
   these two phenomena across diverse environments rather than existing
   models designed for universal application.},

Abstract = {Public policy generally emerges from interactions among actors embedded
   within complex governance systems, composed of multiple actors and
   forums (issue-based arenas where stakeholders repeatedly interact to
   resolve collective action problems). Such systems allow actors multiple
   forums wherein they can influence policy decisions. But actors do not
   value the decisions made in each forum equally, and it remains unclear
   how actors allocate resources across forums. This article links actor
   strategy to their influence within the forums the actors identify as
   most important (their primary forum). There is theoretical ambiguity
   about how actors invest their limited resources across the forums that
   affect their interests to maximize primary forum influence. Do they
   concentrate all their effort within the primary forum or participate
   more broadly? To answer this question, we offer two competing theories.
   First, broad participation may allow actors to develop political capital
   necessary to influence other actors and thus influence primary forum
   policies. The second approach notes the opportunity costs of broad
   participation-actors have fewer resources to invest in their primary
   forum. An analysis of stakeholder participation in the Sacramento-San
   Joaquin River Delta and Tampa Bay Watershed governance systems
   demonstrates that broader participation is associated with greater
   primary forum influence.},

Abstract = {Representative bureaucracy theory suggests that demographic
   representation among street-level bureaucrats will improve outcomes for
   minority citizens receiving a given public service. Scholars of
   representation in public bureaucracies argue that the effect of
   bureaucrats' demographic profile on outcomes for minority citizens
   becomes particularly salient in contexts where bureaucrats exercise
   relatively high amounts of discretion. Empirical evidence has documented
   this relationship in education, policing, and a variety of public
   programs. We extend this literature to the context of prisons, where
   street-level corrections staff exercise considerable discretion over
   inmates' daily lives. Using prison violence and disciplinary actions to
   proxy for the potential effects of a representative staff on the
   experiences of prison inmates, we find that prisons with greater
   representation have fewer assaults and exercise fewer disciplinary
   actions. We offer evidence that the positive effects of demographic
   representation may not hold in privately managed prisons. We speculate
   that differential organizational socialization and managerial incentives
   may help to explain this result.},

Abstract = {States and regional organizations like the European Union (EU) now
   cooperate in a variety of policy fields, including environment, trade,
   justice, and home affairs. Such policy cooperation provides external
   actors with a catalogue of options for imposing sanctions, meaning that
   sanctioning is no longer restricted to violations of purely political or
   economic norms. Noticeably, sectoral norms now play an increasingly
   large role. However, existing research tends to focus on the
   ineffectiveness of sanctions as primarily economic-coercion measures,
   and neglects to investigate also the determinants of the decision to
   sanction, or not, the violation of any internationally or bilaterally
   agreed norm. This research agenda argues for a multi-dimensional view on
   EU sanctioning. Given globalization and increasing transnational
   cooperation, it identifies the need for scholarship to respond to the
   externally and internally changing environment of EU policymaking. Based
   on a discussion of the implications of this transnationalized reality
   for EU sanctioning, it identifies promising avenues for future research.},

Month = {APR 2},
Abstract = {In this era of austerity, while there are significant fiscal pressures
   on social protection programs particularly on cash benefits, there is
   increasing rhetoric concerning the ?social investment turn.? Yet, some
   scholars question whether social investment policies are actually
   expanding. The evidence is not sufficiently apparent, and others
   question whether social protection policies have actually crowded out
   social investment policies. So far, few systematic studies have examined
   this issue. This research aims to explore the effect of traditional
   social protection on social investment policies in 18 OECD countries
   from 1980 to 2010. To investigate the predictive and causal
   relationships between the two types of policies, we will use the Granger
   panel analysis. Then, we will adopt the Beck \& Katz panel model to
   analyze the crowding-out effect that social protection policies have on
   social investment. We argue that social protection has not crowded out
   social investment policies in general but, rather, that the positive
   link between them is increasingly weaker in recent years. In the end, we
   discuss the theoretical and policy implications of our findings.},

Abstract = {Instrumentalist understandings of the role of religion in violent
   conflicts are now conventional, and yet religious instrumentalism
   remains only weakly conceptualized. This article offers a new typology
   of religious instrumentalism aimed at enhancing conceptual rigor in
   future studies. In characterizing religious instrumentalism as
   consisting of a set of observable tactics, the typology facilitates
   comparative research as well as allows for greater specificity and
   clarity in scholarly analysis. The article discusses the implications of
   the conceptual exercise for theory-building and empirical analysis of
   ?religious? conflicts, and has broader applicability in the study of
   identity politics.},

Abstract = {Many European countries have been the target of jihadist terrorist
   attacks between 2015 and 2017. While the chance of becoming a victim of
   a terrorist attack is low, terrorism scholars have emphasized that
   terrorism does not revolve around statistics and casualty numbers.
   Terrorists use attacks to reach an audience and affect groups beyond the
   direct victims. To this date, little is known about how terrorist
   attacks might affect the salience of terrorism beyond national borders.
   This paper investigates possible convergence of issue salience of
   terrorism among citizens within the European Union for ten jihadist
   attacks in the period 2015?2017 using Eurobarometer survey data. The
   results indicate that it is not simply a question of convergence or
   divergence of salience of terrorism after a terrorist attack. The
   connection is multidirectional and depending upon a variety of factors.
   Most importantly, we observed convergence on the EU-level, but
   divergence on the national level. This raises important questions about
   the transnationality of the effects of terrorism. As this research does
   not test nor find a causal mechanism and is solely dependent on existing
   data, further research is necessary to test some of its findings.},

Abstract = {Despite increased research on social policy variation among U.S. states,
   few have examined U.S. state-level political-economies in the wake of
   welfare reform. This is problematic given the ability of state-level
   political-economies to solidify patterns of stratification. I address
   this by analyzing four dimensions of U.S. state-level
   political-economies in the welfare reform era: labor policy,
   family/social policy, tax policy, and state imposed fiscal constraint.
   From this analysis I delineate five state-level political-economic
   types: (1) progressive; (2) contested progressive; (3) boilerplate; (4)
   frontier conservative; and (5) Southern conservative. Four determinants
   of type membership are also evaluated: Democratic Party control,
   unionization, racial fractionalization and income per capita. While my
   results demonstrate these as meaningful determinants, patterns of
   association vary by type, thus suggesting a revision to the assumed
   progressive/conservative continuum of U.S. social policy and
   political-economies. I conclude by elaborating how my analysis expands
   our understanding of U.S., and cross-national, political-economies.},

Abstract = {This article is part of the special cluster titled Conceptualizations of
   the Holocaust in Germany, Lithuania, Poland, and Ukraine since the
   1990s, guest edited by Grzegorz Rossolinski-Liebe.The question, if and
   to what extent the Ukrainian nationalists murdered Jews in Volhynia and
   eastern Galicia during the Holocaust, has haunted Jewish and Ukrainian
   communities in various countries of the Western world during the entire
   Cold War. It also puzzled German historians of Eastern Europe and Nazi
   Germany. Historians, although in theory responsible for investigating
   and clarifying such difficult aspects of the past, have for various
   reasons not investigated them or they investigated only other aspects of
   the Holocaust in Ukraine. This article briefly explains how factions of
   the Ukrainian diaspora invented a narrative that portrayed Ukrainian
   nationalists as anti-German and anti-Soviet freedom fighters who did not
   kill or harm any Jews during the German occupation of Ukraine. In the
   next step, it shows how testimonies and other sorts of documents left by
   survivors from Volhynia and eastern Galicia can help historians
   understand the role that ordinary Ukrainians and the OUN and UPA played
   in the Shoah in western Ukraine. Finally, it asks why it took Ukrainian,
   German, Polish, Russian, and other historians so many years to
   investigate and comprehend the anti-Jewish violence of the Ukrainian
   nationalists, if relevant documents were collected and made accessible
   as early as in the middle 1940s.},

Abstract = {In security studies, there is an unquestioned assumption of a linear
   link between trust and security. However, such an assumption neglects
   complex identity dynamics that can be involved in trust-building
   discourses for engendering security. There needs to be greater
   examination into what is meant by trust, and upon what, and whom, and
   how the politics of identity works in social trust building and how
   states can influence this process. This article contributes to the
   literature on trust, security, and identity in International Relations
   (IR) by making a case for a conceptual focus on the formation of
   particularized distrust towards ``the other{''} as a corollary to trust
   and security of ``the self.{''} It is argued that in the construction of
   a political community where security is associated with trust,
   particularized distrust can also be promoted through institutional
   discourses-strengthening the ``trusting we{''} by constructing ``the
   other{''} who can challenge social trust and feelings of security
   associated with it. The argument is illustrated through critically
   examining a state-level narrative in Norway in relation to ``the
   other,{''} that is, the immigrant. Through this illustrative example,
   mutual constitutiveness of trust and distrust in a self/other discursive
   construction will be shown.},

Abstract = {This paper analyzes a large content of the Islamic State (IS)
   English-language magazines Dabiq (fifteen issues, 2014-2016) and Rumiyah
   (13 issues, 2016-2017), which represent the largest text sample of IS
   propaganda prepared for English-speaking recipients. The author attempts
   to understand the propaganda methods and leading themes related to
   Russia exploited in the magazine. Research confirmed strong, omnipresent
   religious dualism between ``believing{''} and ``disbelieving{''} applied
   to non-religious entities, seen by Islamic State as enemies. Thus,
   military opponents, such as Russia are labeled with words such as
   Crusaders or unbelievers, while self-proclaimed caliphate is portrayed
   as the last Muslim bastion against the invaders. This article attempts
   to fill a gap in research on the Islamic State's propaganda methods used
   in its flagship online magazines. Its major objective is to discover and
   understand the Islamic State's approach to one of its biggest
   enemies-the Russian Federation. In order to reach this goal,
   quantitative and qualitative content analysis is used.},

Abstract = {Natural resource extraction is economically important in many developing
   countries, but social conflict can threaten the viability of the sector.
   This article examines why polluting extractive industries sometimes
   generate social mobilization but often do not. First, I distinguish
   acute, highly visible environmental externalities from chronic, less
   observable pollution, showing that only the former generate social
   mobilization. Second, I explore how high-quality local governance can
   mitigate the local resource curse dynamic by both reducing pollution and
   improving compensation in mining-intensive areas. The analysis uses
   microlevel data on extractive commodities, water pollution, children's
   and livestock health, local government quality, and mining-related
   social conflict in Peru to demonstrate the full causal pathway of the
   local resource curse.},

Abstract = {This paper accepts Zehfuss's argument for the inseparability of ethics
   from politics, and her critique of an ethics of war that assumes the
   application of the right just war principles will deliver a type of
   warfare that is ethical (in the sense of being morally correct).
   Building on Zehfuss's argument, I will suggest that if we wish to pursue
   the ethics of war as an ethico-political practice, then we need to work
   out how to embed ethico-political reflexivity in the practice of ethical
   theorising about war. I will argue that it is in certain strands of
   pacifism that we find the most persuasive examples of what such an
   ethics of war involves.},

Abstract = {Empirical support for the purported benefits of retail electric
   deregulation is mixed at best. Prior studies that identify states as
   simply ``retail deregulated{''} overlook complex policy environments in
   which deregulation is implemented by regulators with a high degree of
   discretion. Prior studies also rely on Energy Information Administration
   data that do not account for core regulatory interventions that can take
   place during the process of implementing deregulation. Using robust time
   series household final bill survey data from the Public Utilities
   Commission of Ohio, this article provides a quasi-experimental analysis
   of the price impacts of retail electric restructuring in Ohio. The
   results suggest that residential electricity prices have increased
   following retail restructuring in all service territories in Ohio, with
   significant favourable welfare effects observed only in the Cincinnati
   area, where key policy implementation stages were not circumvented.},

Abstract = {Half a century after the ``Second Great Debate{''} in international
   relations (IR) started, scholars still perceive the qualitative versus
   quantitative division as their principal divide, and yet we do not have
   a good grasp of the impact of this divide. My research explores how the
   divide shaped the incentives and behaviors of scholars and influenced
   the organization of our academic communities and knowledge production.
   The impact of the divide expressed itself in the distribution of
   research among methodologies in terms of relative quantity and impact.
   Less obviously, and yet more importantly, the divide influenced the
   distribution of quantitative research among different institution types,
   across fields and journals, and with respect to policy engagement. Using
   the TRIP database of 7,792 IR articles in twelve top journals from 1980
   to 2014, I classify journal articles into three
   categories-quantitative-only, qualitative-only, and mixed-methods-and
   categorize author institutions into similar types-publishing
   quantitative research only, producing nonquantitative work only, and
   publishing various proportions of quantitative research. Notably,
   qualitative and quantitative works switched positions over time in terms
   of relative quantity and impact, with quantitative research more likely
   published but only slightly more cited in the recent decade. More
   importantly, the divide produced other less obvious but more serious
   outcomes. Among 1,111 institutions that ever published IR research in
   twelve top journals over thirty-five years, two-thirds published
   nonquantitative research only; fifty-three institutions published more
   than half of all quantitative articles; institutions publishing
   quantitative-only or nonquantitative-only research constituted two modal
   categories. Political science journals published more quantitative
   research, persistently and with growing convergence; IR journals also
   evolved toward publishing more quantitative research though with
   persistent divergence and forming two clusters. Quantitative articles
   and political science journals were significantly less engaged in
   providing policy prescriptions than qualitative articles and IR
   journals. To overcome this lasting and self-perpetuating divide, we must
   better understand its impact, learn to appreciate alternative
   approaches, and change the way we train future scholars.},

Abstract = {This article advances a reputation-based account to explain the relative
   salience that different issues assume in central banks' communication.
   Based on an innovative dataset consisting of a corpus of speeches by the
   members of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System of the
   United States (also known as the Fed) delivered from 2006 to 2016, the
   analysis shows that the most salient issues in the Fed's communication
   are shaped by reputational concerns about policy reversals.
   Specifically, when these concerns are higher, the Fed is more likely to
   focus on issues related to areas where its reputation is weak or not yet
   established-that is, issues related to credit easing and systemic
   financial regulation. In contrast, issues related to activities where
   the Fed's reputation is established are likely to become less
   salient-that is, issues related to economic activity and inflation. A
   similar pattern of issue attention is observed when the Fed addresses
   political audiences compared to other audiences.},

Abstract = {Despite the prominence of exogenous factors in theories of policy
   change, the precise mechanisms that link such factors to policy change
   remain elusive: The effects of exogenous factors on the politics
   underlying policy change are not sufficiently conceptualized and
   empirically analyzed. To address this gap, we propose to distinguish
   between truly exogenous factors and policy outcomes to better understand
   policy change. Specifically, we combine the Advocacy Coalition Framework
   with policy feedback theory to conceptualize a complete feedback loop
   among policy, policy outcomes, and subsequent politics. Aiming at
   theory-building, we use policy feedback mechanisms to explain why
   advocacy coalitions change over time. Empirically, we conduct a
   longitudinal single case study on policy-induced technological change in
   the German energy subsystem, an extreme case of policy outcomes, from
   1983 to 2013. First, using discourse network analysis, we identify four
   patterns of actor movements, explaining coalition decline and growth.
   Second, using process tracing, we detect four policy feedback mechanisms
   explaining these four actor movements. With this inductive mixed-methods
   approach, we build a conceptual framework in which policy outcomes
   affect subsequent politics through feedback mechanisms. We develop
   propositions on how coalition change and feedback mechanisms explain
   four ideal-typical trajectories of policy change.},

Title = {Can Vision 2020 be far away? Malaysia's transformation problems to a
   high-income economy},

Abstract = {At the beginning of 1990s, the then Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad set
   the goal that Malaysia in 2020 should become a high-income economy and a
   vigorous and economically just middle class society. We are not far away
   from 2020. We therefore raise the question whether Malaysia is close to
   or far away of becoming a high-income economy with this economic trap
   issue in the article. Instead, we focus on income inequality as an
   inroad to economy seen from an OECD country level perspective. In our
   examination of this question, we first discus different strands in the
   debate on transformation from middle-income to high-income economies.
   The debate has focused on the middle-income trap issue especially from
   an economic perspective. It is an interesting and fruitful input to the
   transformation debate, particularly the question whether lack of
   industrial upgrading and deepening keeps middle-income economies back
   from becoming high-income economies. We do not deal so much with
   Malaysia's transformation problems. From our point of view, income
   inequality (high Gini coefficient) is an important but often neglected
   element in the mosaic to explain Malaysia's transformation problems both
   in a domestic and global policy perspective. We examine income
   inequality and transformation to a high-income economy from different
   angles. We look into the business structure; income distribution
   compared with high-income economies; household income distribution,
   consumption, lifestyle and the middle class; education and tax system as
   lever or barrier for reducing income inequality; old and new political
   coalitions as drivers for maintenance or change of income inequality.
   Through this analysis, we seek at the same time to highlight whether
   Malaysia is close to become a vigorous and economically just middle
   class society.},

Abstract = {The relationship between terrorist activities and states of emergency
   has never been explored in a cross-country perspective. This article is
   a first step to change that. Given that a terror act has been committed,
   what are the factors that lead governments to declare a state of
   emergency (SOE)-or refrain from declaring it? And given that a SOE has
   been declared, what are the effects thereof? On the basis of
   seventy-nine countries all having Western-style constitutions, we find
   that more terrorist incidents increase the likelihood of a SOE.
   Interestingly, emergencies are less likely to be declared in election
   years, supposedly because governments believe them to be unpopular. Once
   a SOE is declared, it generally leads to substantially more government
   repression. Finally, countries already under a SOE are more likely to
   suffer from additional terror attacks, challenging the effectiveness of
   states of emergency.},

Abstract = {This article looks specifically at the front end of the radicalization
   problem and argues that vulnerability to political violence is first and
   foremost a social problem. The article explores the historical
   counterradicalization approach in Britain and the government/community
   relationship, and argues that addressing the disaffection that comes
   with social vulnerability is the key to building resilience to
   radicalization. Last, the article profiles a holistic
   counterradicalization response undertaken by Quintessential Insight and
   the Barking Mosque whereby social vulnerability is reduced, individuals
   and communities are empowered, social and political agency is maximized,
   social contracts are restored, and resilience to radicalization is
   increased.},

Abstract = {A noticeable feature of the political discourse accompanying the rise of
   nationalism in white-majority countries is that white people fare worse
   than other ethnic groups in their societies. However, it is unclear
   based on the extant literature why group-based relative deprivation
   (GRD) would correlate with majority-group nationalism. Here, we propose
   that the psychological function of nationalism for majority-group
   members lies in its ability to assuage the negative feelings arising
   from GRD. Accordingly, in a New Zealand national probability sample
   (N=15,607), we found that GRD among whites was negatively associated
   with well-being. However, we also found an opposing indirect association
   mediated by nationalism. GRD was associated with higher nationalism,
   which was in turn associated with higher well-being. These findings
   suggest that endorsing beliefs about national superiority is one way a
   nation's dominant ethnic group can cope with the negative psychological
   consequences of perceiving that their group is deprived.},

Abstract = {In this article, we study the political use of denial-of-service (DoS)
   attacks, a particular form of cyberattack that disables web services by
   flooding them with high levels of data traffic. We argue that websites
   in nondemocratic regimes should be especially prone to this type of
   attack, particularly around political focal points such as elections.
   This is due to two mechanisms: governments employ DoS attacks to censor
   regime-threatening information, while at the same time, activists use
   DoS attacks as a tool to publicly undermine the government's authority.
   We analyze these mechanisms by relying on measurements of DoS attacks
   based on large-scale Internet traffic data. Our results show that in
   authoritarian countries, elections indeed increase the number of DoS
   attacks. However, these attacks do not seem to be directed primarily
   against the country itself but rather against other states that serve as
   hosts for news websites from this country.},

Abstract = {Building on empirical qualitative material, this article argues that the
   international promotion of democracy is crucial to account for Tunisia's
   positive transitional outcome. Specifically, the study sheds new light
   on the capacity of international democracy promoters (IDPs) to enhance
   competitive politics and contribute to the professionalization of
   political parties and civil society groups during Tunisia's
   post-revolutionary path. The article also offers two research avenues
   for reviewing the negative standing on international democratic
   promotion in the MENA region. First it argues that promotion of
   democracy in transitions away from authoritarianism is more likely to
   succeed when a wide spectrum of transitional elites agrees upon the
   political system to establish and they do not enter into conflicts on
   how to collaborate with the IDPs. Second, it emphasizes that during a
   transitional period, structured and strategic partnerships between IDPs
   and transitional elites enable fragile societies to sustain their
   democratic process if internal and external anti-systemic interventions
   do not place obstacles in the path of this interplay.},

Abstract = {Collaborative governance systems are likely to be populated by
   participants with a mix of social or public service motivations,
   including both proself and prosocial orientations. However, these
   variations in motivation have not been adequately considered in the
   development of theory regarding participants' interaction and group
   performance in collaborative governance. For this study, we develop an
   agent-based simulation model that incorporates insights from public
   administration, social psychology, and behavioral economics, the results
   from which suggest a number of theoretical propositions regarding the
   effects of the distribution of and patterns of adjustment in actors'
   social motivation on outcomes in collaborative governance situations. In
   contrast to literature that has paid primary attention to free-riders
   and the role of punishment in sustaining collaboration, we suggest that
   more theoretical and practical attention needs to be given to the
   prosocial motivation of actors and their interactions so as to
   facilitate a virtuous circle of collaboration in public collaborative
   governance.},

Abstract = {This article traces the evolution of an Islamist ideology in Kenya's
   public discourse, putting Islamist ideas within a longer history of
   Muslim politics than most other studies. Specifically, it examines
   internal debates amongst the minority Muslim population of Kenya, and
   debates between Muslims and the state and Muslims and the wider
   Christian public, regarding how to improve the Muslim condition in a
   Christian-dominated country. The immediate background for the emergence
   of Islamist ideas is then discussed through an examination of trends
   since the 1990s, including increased contestations of religious and
   political authority, and responses to Muslim activism by the state and
   the wider Christian public. The article concludes that Islamist politics
   in Kenya, and elsewhere, are more often than not a result of local
   histories as much as they are part of a global Muslim `victimization'
   narrative.},

Abstract = {In many ethnically segregated countries, policy is directly linked to
   ethnicity, and thus, nonruling ethnic groups may suffer from the
   implemented policy. For these groups, a secession is one instrument to
   eliminate ethnic heterogeneity costs by implementing their own policy.
   However, leaving the country reduces economies of scale in the public
   good provision. Therefore, separatist ethnic groups face a trade-off
   between eliminating ethnic heterogeneity costs and losing economies of
   scale in the provision of public goods. I present a model for unraveling
   secessions in an ethnically segregated country. I use this model to
   derive conditions for the breakup of countries and to compare
   equilibrium behavior with and without the possibility of a consecutive
   secession. Among others, I find that a secessionist conflict will be
   more likely if there is a previous secession. Furthermore, aggregated
   conflict spending is larger in secessions with the possibility of a
   consecutive conflict.},

Abstract = {The current scholarship on mass killing demonstrates that genocide and
   other forms of mass murder are usually policy responses to threats,
   emphasizing armed conflict and political upheaval, such as revolution,
   as important causal factors. However, scholars have so far had little to
   say about the relationship between a country's external threat
   environment and mass killing. We argue that a country's external
   security environment, particularly when its neighbors pose threats to
   its territorial integrity, is a critical and understudied factor shaping
   a leader's decision to employ mass killing. External territorial threats
   can produce domestic in-group/out-group dynamics, heightening fears that
   some domestic groups may be supporting or colluding with the enemy. Yet,
   given the availability of alternative policies and the enormous costs of
   mass killing, territorial threats alone do not suffice to explain why a
   state chooses mass killing over other types of violent or nonviolent
   strategies. Only when leaders are committed to exclusionary ideologies,
   are territorial threats more likely to catalyze hatred and fear of
   domestic out-groups, increasing a leader's willingness to direct massive
   violence against them. Such leaders are more likely to frame domestic
   out-groups as inherently threatening and as enemies to be eliminated.
   Our empirical analysis reveals that a country's territorial threat,
   measured by either territorial rivalries or territorial claims, is
   associated with a greater likelihood of mass killing onset only when
   leaders hold exclusionary ideologies.},

Abstract = {Under what conditions will those who fight against racism shift their
   strategies from traditional political participation to entrepreneurial
   activity? What would the institutional characteristics of the new
   organizations be, and what strategies would their activists employ?
   Whereas previous studies on anti-racism activities focused on
   traditional collective organizational patterns of action, this study
   examines the phenomenon on the individual level. We analyze the struggle
   of Ethiopian Israeli activists against racism. The framework suggests
   that the diffusion of techniques from other locations around the world
   and long-term learning processes in view of past failures, as well as
   newly acquired political skills, explain the transition to political
   entrepreneurial patterns. A comparison between traditional anti-racism
   actions and entrepreneurial strategies indicates that the essential
   differences between the two are the latter's flexibility, creativity and
   innovation. These differences are manifested in the entrepreneurs'
   attitudes toward the existing organizations, their relationship with the
   establishment, and their coalition-building strategies. The
   entrepreneurs' coalition building is two-pronged. On one hand, they
   cooperate with the establishment on specific issues, and on the other
   hand, their actions challenge the establishment. They do not trust
   policymakers and are ready to confront the government more radically
   than in the past.},

Abstract = {Scholars debate the ambitions and policies of today's `rising powers'
   and the extent to which they are revising or upholding the international
   status quo. While elements of the relevant literature provide valuable
   insight, this article argues that the concepts of revisionism and the
   status quo within mainstream International Relations (IR) have always
   constituted deeply rooted, autobiographical narratives of a
   traditionally Western-dominated discipline. As `ordering narratives' of
   morality and progress, they constrain and organize debate so that
   revisionism is typically conceived not merely as disruption, but as
   disruption from the non-West amidst a fundamentally moral Western order
   that represents civilizational progress. This often makes them
   inherently problematic and unreliable descriptors of the actors and
   behaviours they are designed to explain. After exploring the formations
   and development of these concepts throughout the IR tradition, the
   analysis is directed towards narratives around the contemporary `rise'
   of China. Both scholarly and wider political narratives typically tell
   the story of revisionist challenges China presents to a US/Western-led
   status quo, promoting unduly binary divisions between the West and
   non-West, and tensions and suspicions in the international realm. The
   aim must be to develop a new language and logic that recognize the
   contingent, autobiographical nature of `revisionist' and `status quo'
   actors and behaviours.},

Abstract = {Coalition action is a common lobbying strategy to exert influence over
   policy, but is rarely addressed in studies of lobbying success. This
   article adds to resource exchange theory, firstly, that active
   co-operation with others to gather information, optimize strategies and
   jointly signal a position should increase lobbying success similarly to
   spending economic resources on lobbying on an issue individually.
   Secondly, it expects important interactions between active co-operation
   and economic resources, because the costs and benefits of co-operation
   will be distributed unequally among partners who invest different levels
   of resources themselves. Using new survey data on lobbying on 50 policy
   issues in five European countries, the article provides strong support
   for these expectations: Active co-operation on an issue increases
   lobbying success measured as perceived influence. Moreover, it mediates
   the effect of individual economic resources on lobbying success. These
   findings have important methodological and normative implications
   regarding alternatives pathways of lobbying power.},

Abstract = {The testimonies of witnesses who testify before criminal courts provide
   crucial insights into the situated experience of conflict-related sexual
   violence. Witness testimonies highlight the complex realities and
   everyday lives of individuals caught up in situations of armed conflict.
   The evidence presented by witnesses can provide vital insights into
   lived experiences of wartime violence, and reveal the seemingly mundane
   strategies and tactics adopted by victims to cope with, survive and
   resist the violent and coercive circumstances of war. This article
   foregrounds conflict-related sexual violence witness testimonies as
   highly significant sources of knowledge of everyday experiences of
   conflict. It sets out a bottom-up, mixed-method approach for identifying
   and analysing the experiential accounts of those who lived through
   conflict-related sexual violence, while engaging with the opportunities
   and challenges of using witness testimony. Our approach unsettles
   existing notions of `the everyday' in Peace \& Conflict Studies as a
   synonym for narratives and practices of violence, justice and
   peacebuilding that are private, informal and largely hidden from view.
   Understanding witness testimonies requires conceptualising the everyday
   as an amalgam of formal and informal practices, as accessible through
   both elite and lay knowledges and as documented in both public and
   private (e.g. redacted) sources. It requires challenging
   taken-for-granted dichotomies that are frequently invoked to understand
   conflict and peace.},

Abstract = {Oil wealth tends to impede democracy, but scholars disagree about both
   why and under what conditions. This note helps answer these questions by
   evaluating the field's foundational theory of the rentier state, which
   claims that oil wealth finances generous societal benefits that reduce
   citizens' demands for representation and hinder the emergence of
   democratic regimes. I create a new measure of such benefits, focusing
   specifically on the size of domestic gasoline subsidies in dollars per
   capita. I then use a global sample from 1990 through 2014 to demonstrate
   that greater spending on these subsidies significantly reduces the
   likelihood of a transition toward democracy. The impact on
   democratization is as consequential in practical terms as are large
   increases in the rate of economic growth. Moreover, including the
   measure of fuel subsidies helps account for the autocratic effect of oil
   income. I conclude by highlighting how this fuel subsidy data can shed
   light on a number of other political economy questions.},

Abstract = {In this study we examine how grievances and social connection among
   Somali immigrants are associated with attitudes towards radicalization
   to violence. Data was drawn from structured interviews with 213 Somali
   young adult men living in North America. Structural Equation Modeling
   was used to test the association of grievances with attitudes in support
   of political violence, and the mediating role of social connection
   (ethnic community belonging, attachment to nation of residence, and
   social comfort seeking online). Both grievances and social
   connection/disconnection relate to support for political violence, but
   in complex ways. Findings are discussed in relation to prevention of
   violent extremism.},

Abstract = {Member states of the European Union (EU) often agree on common policies
   which are not legally binding and for which there is no enforcement. In
   these cases, policy networks arguably increase the capacity and
   political leverage for national compliance. Yet, vertical links between
   levels often remain weak, resulting in limited national adaptation. How
   can the gap between common policy-making within the EU and lacking
   implementation `at home' be explained? Looking at `joint programming' in
   EU development co-operation, this contribution analyses (1) how policy
   professionals have engaged as policy entrepreneurs in Brussels; and (2)
   in how far such a common policy principle is compatible on ideational
   and administrative grounds `back home'. Based on insights from France
   and Germany, this contribution argues that, despite ideational resonance
   that motivates joint policy construction, procedural and structural
   incompatibility exacerbate national implementation.},

Abstract = {Violent conflict among rebels is a common feature of civil wars and
   insurgencies. Yet, not all rebel groups are equally prone to such
   infighting. While previous research has focused on the systemic causes
   of violent conflict within rebel movements, this article explores the
   factors that affect the risk of conflict between pairs of rebel groups.
   We generate hypotheses concerning how differences in power, ideology,
   and state sponsors between rebel groups impact their propensity to clash
   and test them using data from the Syrian civil war. The data, drawn from
   hundreds of infighting claims made by rebel groups on social media, are
   used to construct a network of conflictual ties among 30 rebel groups.
   The relationship between the observed network structure and the
   independent variables is evaluated using network analysis metrics and
   methods including assortativity, community structure, simulation, and
   latent space modeling. We find strong evidence that ideologically
   distant groups have a higher propensity for infighting than
   ideologically proximate ones. We also find support for power asymmetry,
   meaning that pairs of groups of disparate size are at greater risk of
   infighting than pairs of equal strength. No support was found for the
   proposition that sharing state sponsors mitigates rebels' propensity for
   infighting. Our results provide an important corrective to prevailing
   theory, which discounts the role of ideology in militant factional
   dynamics within fragmented conflicts.},

Abstract = {This essay reviews the policy-oriented literature on economic inequality
   in wealthy countries published from 2008 to 2018. We focus on this
   decade because it is a period bookended by both the beginnings of the
   Great Recession of 2008-2009 as well as the recovery. During this
   timeframe, attention to inequality by social policy scholars grew
   substantially, which we argue reflects an interest in both inequality
   trends as well as redistributive social policy. We observe in the
   literature sustained efforts to understand both the relationship between
   social policy and economic inequality, as well as determinants of
   changes to redistributive social policy. We also note substantial
   variation in research traditions, as well as opportunities to address
   substantive, methodological, and theoretical gaps. Our review summarizes
   the approaches and findings from the literature and discusses the
   implications of the findings for the study of economic inequality within
   the academic field of public policy.},

Abstract = {The embedded nature of the British Political Tradition has created a
   series of pathologies about the way politics in Westminster is
   conducted. The endurance of the British Political Tradition emanates
   from its resilience to pressures for reform. Yet the rising
   anti-politics tide, the expression of which was vented in the 2016
   European Union referendum, presents a critical challenge to the British
   Political Tradition. Given the political instability resulting from
   Brexit, this article maps the fate of previous attempts to reform the
   way politics is conducted in Britain. It identifies two waves of `new
   politics' that have defined themselves against the `old politics' of the
   British Political Tradition: the first, a series of demands for reform
   during the 1970s; the second, a sustained call for political reform from
   the 1990s onwards. The subsequent analysis reveals a link between both
   waves in demands for a less `elitist' and more participatory style of
   democracy, but at the same time, a failure to dislodge the core tenets
   of the British Political Tradition. Given the current state of British
   politics, the article considers whether calls for a new form of politics
   in response to the climate of anti-politics, and the need for a
   post-Brexit settlement, will suffer a similar fate.},

Abstract = {The distinction between subsistence emissions and luxury emissions was
   originally devised in 1992 to guard people so poor as to be able to
   afford only fossil fuels from being priced out of energy by market
   mechanisms like cap-and-trade that were proposed to assist with limiting
   climate change. Non-carbon energy can now be made as affordable and
   accessible as fossil fuel, but tensions remain between measures to
   support sustainable development and measures to control climate change.
   Consequently, the distinction between subsistence energy and luxury
   energy continues to be surprisingly relevant to current international
   political struggles. The most fully justified method for normative
   assessment of Nationally Determined Contributions under the Paris
   Agreement, the Climate Equity Reference Framework, presupposes the
   distinction. Normative evaluation of the choice between maximally
   ambitious ratcheting-up of Nationally Determined Contributions in the
   immediate future and lazy reliance upon hoped-for carbon dioxide removal
   in future decades depends on it.},

Abstract = {How do new leaders impact crisis negotiations? We argue that opposing
   states know less about such a leader's resolve over the issues at stake.
   To fully appreciate the consequences, we develop a multi-period
   bargaining model of negotiations. In equilibrium, as a proposer becomes
   close to certain of its opponent's type, the duration and intensity of
   war goes to 0. We then test whether increase in leader tenure decrease
   the duration of militarized interstate disputes. Our estimates indicate
   that crises involving new leaders are 25.3 percent more likely to last
   one month than crises involving leaders with four years of tenure.
   Moreover, such conflicts are more likely to result in higher fatality
   levels. These results further indicate that leader tenure is a useful
   proxy for uncertainty.},

Abstract = {This article conducts a meta-analysis of the effect of military
   expenditures on growth within a structured analytic framework. We extend
   the pioneering study of Aynur Alptekin and Paul Levine, by using a much
   larger sample of studies. Like them we confine our attention to studies
   that use the share of military expenditure in GDP, the military burden,
   as the independent variable, but unlike them we include not just those
   that use the military burden directly, what we call the core sample, but
   also those that use other functions of it, such as logarithms,
   differences, etc., which we call the remaining sample. We also consider
   an overall sample which pools all results. The t-statistic on the
   coefficient of military burden is used as the dependent variable. Our
   null hypothesis is that military expenditure has no significant effect
   on growth and we explain why this is plausible. The estimates are
   sensitive to the sample and type of data used, estimation method
   adopted, and the controls included. Overall, the results are consistent
   with the hypothesis of no effect: the average effect across all studies
   is close to zero. Certain study characteristics appear significant
   determinants of the effect of military expenditure on growth, but there
   does not appear to be a simple pattern and different characteristics
   were significant in the three samples. This might be a result of data
   mining to produce a significant result. However, there does not appear
   to be strong evidence of publication bias towards positive or negative
   results, perhaps because there is no strong a priori belief in the
   direction of the effect.},

Title = {Towards a Definition of Terrorist Ideology},
Journal = {TERRORISM AND POLITICAL VIOLENCE},
Year = {2019},
Month = {2019 APR 21},
Abstract = {While conventional wisdom holds that the ideology espoused by a
   terrorist organization is somehow related to that organization's
   actions, the precise nature of the relationship between these phenomena
   is hotly debated, with scholarship often yielding contrasting empirical
   results. We argue that one reason for this divergence in viewpoints and
   research findings is an inadequate understanding of what ideology
   actually is and how it relates to terrorism. Indeed, the terrorism
   literature reveals widely disparate uses of the concept of terrorist
   ideology. This article endeavors to provide a common framework for
   approaching ideology in the context of terrorism studies by
   systematically building a new definition of terrorist ideology from
   first principles. In so doing, we introduce a definition of terrorist
   ideology that is logically consistent, has robust theoretical
   underpinnings, and connects the study of ideology within terrorism to
   broader disciplinary research traditions regarding ideology. This
   provides a conceptual foundation from which to examine terrorist
   ideology in an objective, systematic manner and thereby enables
   terrorism researchers to more productively investigate important
   outstanding questions, such as which aspects of an ideology are most
   relevant to violent behavior.},

Abstract = {During the early 2010s, creditor states and EU institutions demanded
   that the Southern states of the eurozone liberalise their labour markets
   to facilitate internal devaluation and export-led recoveries. With some
   variation, the Greek, Portuguese, Spanish and Italian governments
   complied. This article explains why such a strategy of internal
   devaluation within the eurozone might fail to produce adequate
   employment growth to put these countries on stable financial footing. It
   exploits variation in the timing and intensity of reforms to evaluate
   the record of the internal devaluation strategy. Our findings suggest
   that there is no linear relationship between internal devaluation and
   export-growth. Even where the latter has been impressive, dualism
   persists and the employment recovery has been weak.},

Abstract = {This paper provides the first ever analysis of the two-way relationship
   between the privatisation of government services and fiscal balance. It
   uses data from 22 European countries between 1995 and 2013 to examine
   the factors that promote privatisation policies and the effects that
   privatisation then has on public finances. This is important because
   privatisation has been promoted by both the European Union and the
   International Monetary Fund as a way of responding to financial crises,
   and in an era of austerity it is important to have robust empirical
   evidence about the extent to which privatisation has achieved this. Our
   analysis demonstrates that governments often adopt privatisation
   policies in the hope of improving their fiscal balances, but that
   political ideology is important since left-wing administrations are more
   likely to see it as a means of also restructuring government services.},

Abstract = {Misinformation often continues to influence people's memory and
   inferential reasoning after it has been retracted; this is known as the
   continued influence effect (CIE). Previous research investigating the
   role of attitude-based motivated reasoning in this context has found
   conflicting results: Some studies have found that worldview can have a
   strong impact on the magnitude of the CIE, such that retractions are
   less effective if the misinformation is congruent with a person's
   relevant attitudes, in which case the retractions can even backfire.
   Other studies have failed to find evidence for an effect of attitudes on
   the processing of misinformation corrections. The present study used
   political misinformation-specifically fictional scenarios involving
   misconduct by politicians from left-wing and right-wing parties-and
   tested participants identifying with those political parties. Results
   showed that in this type of scenario, partisan attitudes have an impact
   on the processing of retractions, in particular (1) if the
   misinformation relates to a general assertion rather than just a
   specific singular event and (2) if the misinformation is congruent with
   a conservative partisanship.},

Abstract = {Research on social movement outcomes focuses on the publicly visible
   stages of government policymaking. It rarely opens the black box of
   government's translation of movement demands beyond the agenda-setting
   stage and before their materialization into legislative bills. Using a
   bureaucratic politics perspective, we suggest that bureaucrats play a
   central role in translating movement agendas into concrete problems and
   policy solutions, which they tend to link with their bureaus' missions
   and existing programs. We further suggest that relative consensus among
   bureaucrats when coupled with politicians' disinclination to intervene
   in the translation process tends to advantage conservative
   interpretations of movement agendas. Conversely, interbureau
   confrontation and political intervention are associated with more
   radical policy responses. Empirically, we examine the responses of the
   Israeli government to the large-scale mobilization, in 2011, surrounding
   the rising costs of housing and living. We build on archival research
   and interviews with senior bureaucrats located in 11 central-government
   ministries.},

Abstract = {The rise of the super-rich has attracted much political and academic
   attention in recent years. However, there have been few attempts to
   explain the cross-national along with the temporal variation in the rise
   of top incomes. Drawing on the World Wealth and Income Database, we
   study the income share of the top 1\% in current postindustrial
   democracies from 1960 to 2012. We find that extreme income concentration
   at the top is a predominantly political phenomenon, not the result of
   increasing marginal productivity of top managers in markets of
   increasing size. Top income shares are largely unrelated to economic
   growth, increased knowledge-intensive production, export
   competitiveness, financialization and wealth accumulation, though they
   are related to stock market capitalization. Instead, they are closely
   associated with political and policy changes such as union density and
   centralization, secular-right governments, top marginal tax rates and
   investment in public tertiary education.},

Abstract = {Regime theorists argue that international regimes and institutions are
   based on principles, norms and decision-making procedures that
   constitute a set of patterned behaviours around which expectations
   converge. The notion of these institutionalised `logics of
   appropriateness' has led to the proliferation of many global norms, such
   as the UN Global Compact, that are considered to govern the practices of
   multinational corporations in the extractive sector. The key question
   that this paper asks is, to what extent is the UN Global Compact
   influencing the behaviour of mining companies in Ghana - particularly
   the social responsibility performance of Newmont Ghana Gold Ltd and
   Chirano Gold Mines Ltd.? Since the existing global CSR norms thrive
   mainly on voluntary subscription and compliance, the overall objective
   of this paper is to underscore the paradox of putting a widely acclaimed
   arrangement such as the Global Compact into practice and its
   implications for the livelihoods of expected `norm beneficiaries'. The
   goal is to contribute to the literature on the nature and rationale of
   CSR in Ghana, as well as to improve our understanding of localised
   diffusion and contestations of global norms.},

Abstract = {Often portrayed as behaviour that is inconsistent with policy goals,
   public noncompliance poses a significant challenge for government. To
   explore what compliance efforts entail on the ground, this study focuses
   on childhood immunization as a paradigmatic case where a failure to
   ensure compliance poses a public health risk. The analysis draws on 48
   semi-structured interviews with frontline nurses and regional/national
   public health officials in England (N =15), Sweden (N =17) and Israel (N
   =16), all of which have experienced periodic noncompliance spikes, but
   differ in direct delivery of vaccination provision. Compliance efforts
   emerged as a joint decision-making process in which improvisatory
   practices of personalized appeals are deployed to accommodate parents'
   concerns, termed here street-level negotiation'. Whereas compliance is
   suggestive of compelling citizens' adherence to standardized rules,
   compliance negotiation draws attention to the limited resources
   street-level workers have when encountering noncompliance and to
   policy-clients' influence on delivery arrangements when holding
   discretionary power over whether or not to comply.},

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL STUDIES QUARTERLY},

Abstract = {How do peacekeepers operating in Haiti, Liberia, and the Democratic
   Republic of the Congo (DRC) discursively construct the local people,
   especially local women, and to what effect? I show a connection between
   peacekeepers representations of local people, articulated in discourse,
   and the gendered, often sexualized interactions and transactions in
   peacekeeping sites. Gender plays a central role in peacekeeper
   discourse. It situates the peacekeeper outside, and superior to, the
   chaotic, dysfunctional, feminized local. At the same time, a close
   reading of peacekeepers representations of local people disrupts
   idealized notions of peacekeeper masculinity as protective and benign,
   which still persist in peacekeeping circles, revealing it as something
   more vulnerable and brittle. The connection between discourse and
   (non)performance of peacekeeping duties is neither causal nor
   straightforward, but I argue that peacekeepers discursive constructions
   of locals affect how peacekeepers interpret their mandate to protect
   civilians: protection becomes conditional on peacekeepers perceptions of
   locals appearance, affect, behavior, and their ability to act out an
   idealized role as someone worth protecting. The article thus brings new
   insight to our understandings of gender, masculinities, and protection
   failures in peacekeeping.},

Abstract = {Trade policy has become increasingly multidimensional. Current trade
   agreements not only address market access but also encompass rules and
   provisions related to flexibility of commitment, investment protection,
   and dispute settlement mechanisms. Yet, rigorous evidence about how
   interest groups evaluate each of these in relation to the others remains
   scarce. We develop a firm-level theoretical framework to explain how
   firms international operations affect their preferences on different
   trade policy measures. We experimentally evaluate preferences over
   multiple policy dimensions using a conjoint analysis on firms in Costa
   Rica. Notably, for many types of firms, the standard trade policy
   measures of yesteryearutariffs and subsidiesuare no longer their most
   important concerns. Instead, the degree of firms involvement in global
   value chains shapes their preferences. Multinational corporations care
   most about protection of their foreign investments. Those exporters who
   are not central to global supply networks most value strong dispute
   settlement procedures. Finally, we find that preferences over these
   policy dimensions are more likely to vary by firm than by industry,
   which calls into question the existing literature's focus on
   interindustry distinctions.},

Abstract = {Gender scholars show that women in situations of civil war have an
   impressive record of agency in the social and political spheres.
   Civilian women's political mobilization during conflict includes active
   involvement in civil society organizations, such as nongovernmental
   organizations or social movements, and public articulation of grievances
   - in political protest, for example. Existing explanations of women's
   political mobilization during conflict emphasize the role of demographic
   imbalances opening up spaces for women. This article proposes a
   complementary driving factor: women mobilize politically in response to
   the collective threat that conflict-related sexual violence constitutes
   to women as a group. Coming to understand sexual violence as a violent
   manifestation of a patriarchal culture and gender inequalities, women
   mobilize in response to this violence and around a broader range of
   women's issues with the goal of transforming sociopolitical conditions.
   A case study of Colombia drawing on qualitative interviews illustrates
   the causal mechanism of collective threat framing in women's collective
   mobilization around conflict-related sexual violence. Cross-national
   statistical analyses lend support to the macro-level implications of the
   theoretical framework and reveal a positive association between high
   prevalence of conflict-related rape on the one hand and women's protest
   activity and linkages to international women's nongovernmental
   organizations on the other.},

Abstract = {While we know that war can have wide-ranging consequences for life
   expectancy, social capital, and political participation, we know little
   about how wartime violence affects intimate relationships. Existing
   literature suggests that conflict violence could increase the risk of
   intimate-partner violence, but lacks compelling statistical evidence to
   evaluate this claim. We test this proposition with newly available data
   on conflict-related violence and the Demographic and Health Surveys data
   on intimate-partner violence in Peru. We find that exposure to general
   conflict violence significantly increases the risk of intimate-partner
   abuse and that these effects are particularly pronounced for
   conflict-related sexual violence. This information should help policy
   makers and practitioners improve the efficacy of domestic violence
   prevention programs by identifying and targeting populations most at
   risk.},

Abstract = {Sovereignty conditions all aspects of the extractive process. That it
   underpins the dynamics of capitalist accumulation is apparent in the
   power that governments have to classify space, alienate certain areas
   for investment, and charge rents. A review of the large-scale land
   acquisitions and changes in the mining and oil and gas industries in
   Brazil from 2002 to 2016 shows that initiatives intended to curtail
   foreign investment actually stimulate foreign enterprises to engage in
   novel forms of capitalist accumulation.},

Abstract = {There has been significant scholarly interest in organizational
   hybridity, the combination of multiple institutional logics in one
   entity. However, the extant research has mainly studied the implications
   for organizations and individuals, neglecting the challenges for
   organizational members as a collective. To mitigate, this article
   examines how members of a British institutionalized public-private
   partnership grapple with the question of what their organization may be,
   highlighting the confusion they are experiencing and their attempts to
   overcome it. Drawing on the concept of organizational identity
   (theorized as the outcome of collective sensemaking), the analysis
   identifies two mechanisms that recursively connect the organization and
   its members. Relational positioning draws on possible configurations of
   institutional logics and associated identity resources while discursive
   framing captures members' hopes and expectations. The main contribution
   of this article is a better understanding of collective sensemaking in
   hybrid organizations in the light of institutional complexity.},

Abstract = {Since its inception in 2009, Uber has grown into a technology behemoth,
   with operations in over 70 countries and 500 cities around the world.
   Along the way, it has successfully forced regulatory upheaval in
   hundreds of local taxi markets controlled by municipal authorities. In
   this sense, Uber is not only a market disruptor, but also a policy
   disruptor. This paper examines the nature of such policy disruption at
   the local level by reviewing regulatory responses to Uber in ten North
   American cities. We find that regulatory outcomes are a function of two
   factors: Uber's government relations strategy, either cooperative or
   confrontational, and the degree to which local governments perceive Uber
   as complementary or harmful to the existing marketplace. We conclude by
   proposing a typology of regulatory responses to Uber as a basis to
   identify patterns in the behavior of municipal regulatory authorities
   and political leaders.},

Abstract = {Governance scholars have long championed the adaptive utility of
   decentralized management institutions, in part due to their ability to
   bring diverse stakeholders into decision-making processes. However,
   research into the link between decentralization and participation often
   looks at policy design but bypasses important system feedbacks that
   shape sustained participation over time. To paint a more robust picture
   detailing how decentralization and participation are related, this paper
   uses a complex systems framework to explore interacting structural,
   operational, and cultural components of decentralized wildlife
   governance institutions in the United States and Botswana. Through this
   comparative analysis, I argue that the landscape of public participation
   in decentralized governance institutions appears to be significantly
   impacted by three factors: 1) how decentralization processes occurred,
   2) where in the process of decision making participation is situated,
   and 3) perceptions of power distribution between groups with competing
   interests.},

Abstract = {There have been important changes in the enforcement of European Union
   environmental law over the last 25 years. Environmental law has
   traditionally been reliant on the European Commission, but the
   Commission has started to withdraw from enforcement. Instead, it is
   undertaking efforts to `outsource' enforcement to environmental
   non-governmental organisations (NGOs) by systematically promoting access
   for such groups to national courts. While the Commission has indicated
   that it sees centralised and private enforcement as substitutes, the
   advantages and drawbacks of each mechanism are evaluated and it is
   concluded that both mechanisms have an important role to play. In
   particular, the private enforcement of EU environmental law is dependent
   on national opportunity structures that are unlikely to ever be fully
   liberalised and harmonised by EU procedural law. Private enforcement is
   therefore not a panacea for compliance problems, and the growing absence
   of a central enforcing authority is a cause for concern.},

Abstract = {Over the last three decades, ecological modernisation (EM) has emerged
   as a powerful political discourse, in which economic growth,
   environmental protection and energy security are mutually reinforcing.
   Here, the trajectory of EM in the European Union is traced, using a
   discourse analysis of the seven Environmental Action Programmes. The
   discourse articulated in these documents points towards an encroaching
   `double depoliticisation'. First, political decisions are discursively
   constructed as a matter of market rationality rather than a democratic
   process that engages with different political positions. Second, EM is
   reified as the only feasible solution, and alternative and contesting
   discourses are marginalised. Thus not only are political differences
   erased from the discourse, but the discourse is itself removed from
   political debate.},

Abstract = {Purpose The purpose of this paper is to propose that a more optimal
   regulatory focus in conflict reflects a mix of promotion and prevention
   considerations because conflict often elicits needs for promoting
   well-being as well as needs for preventing threats to security and
   interests. Two studies using distinct methodologies tested the
   hypothesis that social conflict is associated with better outcomes when
   the parties construe the conflict with a regulatory focus that reflects
   a combination of both promotion and prevention orientations.
   Design/methodology/approach Study 1 was an experiment that framed the
   same low-intensity conflict scenario as either prevention- or
   promotion-focused, or as both. In Study 2, we mouse-coded
   stream-of-thought accounts of participants' actual ongoing
   high-intensity conflicts for time spent in both promotion and prevention
   focus. Findings In Study 1, the combined framing resulted in greater
   satisfaction with expected conflict outcomes and goal attainment than
   did either prevention or promotion framing alone. However, a promotion
   frame alone was associated with greater process and relationship
   satisfaction. These results were replicated in Study 2.
   Originality/value Prior research on regulatory focus has emphasized the
   benefits of a promotion focus over prevention when managing conflict.
   The present research offers new insight into how these seemingly
   opposing motives can operate in tandem to increase conflict
   satisfaction. Thus, this research illustrates the value of moving beyond
   dichotomized motivational distinctions in conflict research, to
   understand the dynamic interplay of how these distinctions may be
   navigated in concert for more effective conflict engagement. It also
   illustrates the value of mouse-coding methods for capturing the dynamic
   interplay of motives as they rise and fall in salience over time.},

Abstract = {This opening article maps the terrain of the ongoing debate over various
   forms of `non-Western' International Relations (IR) theory-building
   enterprise with the aim not only of providing contextual background for
   the Special Section, but also, and more importantly, of identifying what
   is missing in the overall debate. It is often pointed out that IR as a
   discipline is `too Western centric', and that much of mainstream IR
   theory is `simply an abstraction of Western history'. In this respect,
   many IR scholars have called for `broadening' the theoretical horizon of
   IR while problematising the Western parochialism of the discipline, and
   it is increasingly acknowledged that IR needs to embrace a wider range
   of histories, experiences, and theoretical perspectives, particularly
   those outside of the West. However, despite such a meaningful debate
   over non-Western IR theorisation and its recent contributions, several
   critical questions and issues still remain unclear and under-explored. I
   suggest that there are (at least) three sets of questions that require
   more careful attention in our discussion. First, does IR need to embrace
   theoretical pluralism? Second, to what extent has contemporary IR become
   pluralistic? Third, should IR pursue the promotion of dialogue and
   engagement across theoretical and spatial divides? Of course, each of
   these questions invites several subsequent questions. This discussion
   will serve as a useful point from which more substantial and exciting
   bearings may be taken in enriching the ongoing debate and moving IR
   towards becoming a more pluralistic discipline.},

Abstract = {Despite enormous variation in the order, positivity, and content of
   information that real-world electoral campaigns present to voters, we
   know little about their interactive role in candidate evaluation. This
   study presents results from two multiwave experiments that varied the
   positivity of information, its order, and its personal or policy content
   and assessed its memorability and impact on evaluations over several
   days. Consistent with observational evidence, recent information is not
   only more memorable, but also more impactful, in candidate evaluation.
   However, these effects on evaluations are asymmetric by the positivity
   of the information, with negative information more impactful than
   positive information when it is recent, even though negative information
   fades more quickly in memory. Furthermore, positive and personal
   information is more memorable, and positive personal information can
   serve as a powerful anchor when presented first, diminishing recency
   effects.},

Abstract = {From nuclear weapons testing to uranium mining and from the actual use
   of nuclear weapons to the mere threat of use, race, colonialism and
   nuclear weapons, all have been inextricably linked since 1945. One could
   argue that these links have never been clearer. Indeed, as much of the
   non-white world joins together to ban nuclear weapons, the United States
   and other nuclear-armed states ignore and boycott the Treaty on the
   Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons (TPNW). But the passage of the TPNW has
   shown what is possible when nations and committed individuals join
   together for peace, and while it did not abolish nuclear weapons, it has
   edged the world a bit closer to the dream set at the Bandung Conference:
   a world without racism, colonialism and nuclear weapons.},

Abstract = {Development cooperation is a foreign policy tool marked by deep-seated
   conflicts of interest and dilemmas of particular relevance to
   second-tier and non-nuclear countries that aim to change their
   international status and role. Building on the concept of `graduation
   dilemma', this article compares specific dilemmas that Brazil and South
   Africa face in their foreign policies concerning the development
   cooperation agenda at three levels: the domestic, the regional and the
   global level. The research question guiding this analysis is: how does
   the graduation dilemma manifest in relation to Brazil and South Africa's
   role in development cooperation?},

Abstract = {The redistributive reforms carried out by center-left governments in
   Chile and Uruguay in the 2000s affected the core interests of economic
   elites. Efforts to increase taxes on high-income sectors and reform the
   institutions that regulate the capital-labor relationship produced
   different results in the two countries. While Uruguay adopted
   significant reforms, reforms in Chile were marginal in 2000-2010 and
   moderate in 2014-2016. Their different trajectories are related to
   different configurations of the distribution of power resources between
   the elites and the social organizations that represent the interests of
   low-income sectors.},

Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL POLITICS},

Volume = {28},
Number = {5},
Pages = {822-846},
Abstract = {To what extent has the European Union (EU) had a benign or retarding
   effect on what its member states would have undertaken in the absence of
   EU climate policies during 2008-2012? A measurement tool for the EU
   policy's effect is developedand shows a benign average EU effect with
   considerable variation across countries. The EU's policy effectiveness
   vis-a-vis its member states is explained by the EU's non-compliance
   mechanism, the degree of usage of the Kyoto flexible mechanisms, and
   national pre-Kyoto emission reduction goals. Time-series cross-sectional
   analyses show that the EU's non-compliance mechanism has no effect,
   while the ex-ante plans for using Kyoto flexible mechanisms and/or the
   ambitious pre-Kyoto emission reduction targets allow member states to
   escape constraints imposed by EU climate policy.},

Abstract = {The international arena is inseparable from social actors, their
   behavior, culture, and expectations. We've come a long way since the
   European concert that brought together princes and dynasts with the same
   mindset and culture. Today, the politics of diplomacy are perpetually
   hostage to the density of globalization and the complexity of-sometimes
   clashing-narratives. The end of bipolarity had fueled the illusion that
   the United States remained alone on its hegemonic pedestal, a posture
   which, as we established earlier, has been extremely rare throughout
   history while, until 1989, the proceeding aspiration only manifested on
   a diarchic basis, versus the Soviet Union and with it. We also saw that,
   after the fall of the Berlin Wall, the unipolar illusion lasted little
   more than three or four years. After examining the illusions and
   setbacks of hegemonic power, this chapter turns to the three stages of
   the American reaction and the appeal and limits of soft power. The
   author then considers the frustrated Russian empire, the European
   Union's lost opportunities, the emerging countries frustrated expansion,
   and finally turns to China and questions its discretion and assertion.},

Volume = {77},
Number = {2},
Pages = {158-166},
Abstract = {Iver Neumann has been an inter-disciplinary entrepreneur for political
   science in Norway. For Neumann, interdisciplinarity has been coupled
   with an understanding of politics as the search for meaning and
   identity. These features are well-developed in European political
   science, particularly within the field of international relations, but
   they are more rarely encountered in Norway. This brief article provides
   a sketch of political science as it evolved and matured in its Norwegian
   incarnation. In situating Iver Neumann within the discipline, I
   emphasise his international and eclectic orientation. The personal,
   national and international meet in Neumann's works, as do popular
   culture and politics.},

Title = {Stories of the sharing economy: Policy narratives surrounding the entry
   of transportation network companies into four mid-sized American cities},
Journal = {CRITICAL POLICY STUDIES},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {13},
Number = {3},
Pages = {306-327},
Abstract = {New transportation businesses such as Uber and Lyft have recently
   entered metropolitan markets across the US. Because they do not fit into
   existing regulatory and policy frameworks, and their entrance into
   markets is sometimes abrupt or illegal, these transportation network
   companies (TNCs) engender widely varying reactions from city
   governments. These reactions are captured in different stories that
   develop about TNCs when they enter a market. Using content analysis,
   elements of the narrative policy framework (NPF), and application of
   Mark Bevir and R.A.W. Rhodes decentered theory of governance, this study
   explores the narratives that develop about TNCs and how those narratives
   may influence policy making. Prominent themes that emerged from an
   analysis of city council meetings in four mid-sized American communities
   include safety, leveling the playing field, and market considerations.
   There was also an identifiable causal linkage between the types of
   stories councilmembers told, and the solutions they proposed in
   deliberations. Finally, this article makes a compelling argument for the
   compatibility of the NPF and Bevir and Rhodes interpretivist tradition
   by pointing out the similarities among the two, and demonstrating ways
   in which they can effectively dovetail in narrative analysis.},

Abstract = {Civilians who have fled violent conflict and settled in neighboring
   countries are integral to processes of civil war termination. Contingent
   on their attitudes, they can either back peaceful settlements or support
   warring groups and continued fighting. Attitudes toward peaceful
   settlement are expected to be especially obdurate for civilians who have
   been exposed to violence. In a survey of 1,120 Syrian refugees in Turkey
   conducted in 2016, we use experiments to examine attitudes towards two
   critical phases of conflict termination - a ceasefire and a peace
   agreement. We examine the rigidity/flexibility of refugees' attitudes to
   see if subtle changes in how wartime losses are framed or in who
   endorses a peace process can shift willingness to compromise with the
   incumbent Assad regime. Our results show, first, that refugees are far
   more likely to agree to a ceasefire proposed by a civilian as opposed to
   one proposed by armed actors from either the Syrian government or the
   opposition. Second, simply describing the refugee community's wartime
   experience as suffering rather than sacrifice substantially increases
   willingness to compromise with the regime to bring about peace. This
   effect remains strong among those who experienced greater violence.
   Together, these results show that even among a highly pro-opposition
   population that has experienced severe violence, willingness to settle
   and make peace are remarkably flexible and dependent upon these cues.},

Title = {From outsiders to insiders: the rise of China ENGOs as new experts in
   the law-making process and the building of a technocratic representation},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CHINESE GOVERNANCE},

Volume = {4},
Number = {3, SI},
Pages = {207-232},
Abstract = {Studying the pluralization of the law-making process in China, this
   article explains how environmental NGOs shifted from an outsider to an
   insider status following the amendment of the Environmental Protection
   Law. Whereas law-making in China has often been described as a search
   for compromise, this case-study rather highlights the link between the
   entry of new actors into the legislative process and their role in
   rebalancing power relations among administrative agencies with
   conflicting views and interests, thereby directly impacting the
   reframing of the law. This case-study thus highlights consultative
   authoritarianism's permeability with power politics and social
   mobilization. Differentiating the entry moment' from the process whereby
   ENGOs durably become insiders, this article also investigates the
   conditions for sustainable inclusion and the way the inclusion process
   broadens. Pointing out that authoritarian participation differentiates
   from democratic participation because ENGOs are primarily included as
   experts, this article complements the consultative authoritarianism
   framework by arguing that expertise allows for a technocratic form of
   representation of the broader public deprived of the right to political
   participation, hence enabling the law to better reflect the general
   interest.},

Title = {When and how cognitive conflict benefits cross-functional project team
   innovation The importance of knowledge leadership},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONFLICT MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {30},
Number = {4, SI},
Pages = {514-537},
Abstract = {Purpose - This research aims to comprehensively investigate when and how
   cognitive conflict benefits team innovation in cross-functional project
   teams (CFPTs), by exploring the moderating role of knowledge leadership
   and dual mediation mechanisms of elaboration of task-related
   information/knowledge and affective conflict.
   Design/methodology/approach - All hypotheses have been empirically
   tested by using structural equation model to analyze the quantitative
   data from a questionnaire survey covering 73 CFPTs in China.
   Findings - Results indicate that knowledge leadership positively
   moderates the relationship between cognitive conflict and CFPT
   innovation. This moderating effect is directly or indirectly revealed by
   the dual mediating roles of task-related information/knowledge
   elaboration and affective conflict, which are two processes manifesting
   whether cognitive conflict can or cannot be incorporated into team
   innovation.
   Research limitations/implications - Despite the external validity of
   results limited by convenient sampling method, the findings offer
   implications for promoting CFPT innovation. This can be achieved by
   developing competent knowledge leadership into team sensegiver, dissent
   reconciler and facilitator to accentuate benefits of cognitive conflict
   in information/knowledge elaboration and attenuate the likelihood of
   escalating to affective conflict.
   Originality/value - This study advances the understanding of why
   cognitive conflict has an equivocal effect on team innovation in the
   context of CFPT by originally revealing how leaders' role in
   information/knowledge management acts as a contingency and suggesting
   the dual mediating mechanisms that reflect the contingent impact.
   Project-based teams or organizations, characterized by cognitive
   clashes, can enhance innovation performance by shaping the
   meaningfulness of information/knowledge activities triggered by
   cognitive conflict.},

Abstract = {What is the historical, normative and institutional setting that helps
   leading Latin American and Eurasian countries to implement a
   post-hegemonic agenda and contribute to the multipolarization of global
   politics? Post-hegemony describes a situation in which the unipolar
   organization of the world political economy is challenged by a plurality
   of alternative projects, without however being entirely replaced by
   another system. Emblematic of post-hegemonic initiatives is the rise of
   the Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa countries who have
   taken the lead in creating alternative institutions that constrain US
   global hegemony, while however failing to spearhead a coherent, uniform
   and confrontational opposition movement. Regarding post-hegemonic
   regionalism, Latin American regionalism - as represented by Bolivarian
   Alliance for Our America (ALBA) - is characterized by a social
   justice-driven agenda that refutes US neoliberal hegemony, whereas the
   peculiarity of Eurasian regionalism - as represented by Shanghai
   Cooperation Organization - lies in its security-oriented focus that
   confronts US interventionism and international terrorism. An underlying
   commonality of both Latin American and Eurasian experiences is that they
   constitute a multi-front struggle centered on four main areas: culture,
   economy, financial cooperation, and regional defense. They both hinge on
   a strong normative framework and firm commitment in the regionalization
   of an endogenous culture, educational cooperation, and defense system.
   They all accord primary importance to social, financial, and
   infrastructural development. Overall, these experiences suffer from
   unresolved tensions between national sovereignty and supranationalism
   alongside the predominance of charismatic leaders inhibiting
   institutionalization. The limitations and contradictions of
   post-hegemonic transformations also include Latin America's inability to
   resolve the question of extractivism, Eurasia's neglect of the question
   of democratic participation, and both regionalism's failure to offer a
   coherent alternative model of economic development to US hegemonism.},

Title = {Four Nordic Russia relations. Towards a joint Nordic Russia policy after
   Crimea and Trump?},
Journal = {INTERNASJONAL POLITIKK},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {77},
Number = {2},
Pages = {197-222},
Abstract = {The Nordic countries interact with Russia not only in the Baltic Sea
   region, but also in the Barents region and in the Polar Arctic. In order
   to get a full picture of the underlying dynamics, individual Nordic
   Russia-relations should be studied in a comprehensive framework.
   Swedish-Russian, Danish-Russian, Norwegian-Russian, and Fenno-Russian
   relations have developed differently since about 2000. There are two
   barriers to Nordic security policy cooperation: (1) the countries'
   different geographical locations, and (2) various idiosyncrasies between
   pairs of Nordic countries, typically rooted in different interpretations
   of their common history. Thus, the Nordic soil has traditionally been
   fertile for great powers seeking to `divide and rule', and Russia has
   apparently succeeded in this since about 2000. However, in the wake of
   Russia's involvement in the Ukraine conflict and the election of Donald
   Trump as US president, geopolitical interests seem to be converging with
   fairly even threat perceptions being found in Nordic capitals. In the
   absence of idiosyncrasies, this will strengthen security and defence
   cooperation, although a common Nordic Russia-policy will not
   materialize. All four countries, in particular Sweden, face difficult
   dilemmas in this new situation.},

Journal = {CRITICAL POLICY STUDIES},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {13},
Number = {1},
Pages = {101-121},
Abstract = {Focusing on a long-running health campaign, this paper examines the UK
   government's use of a policy technique known as `nudge', which draws on
   behavioral economics in order to shape civic behaviors toward more
   desirable ends. Public health campaigns tend to be immune to critique
   because of assumptions that their goals are laudable and that they are
   `unproblematically' educational. Here, I argue that the use of `nudge'
   tactics helps legitimate a narrowing of the sphere of governmental
   responsibility for this complex and classed social problem by
   pathologizing working class lifestyles as inherently `irrational'. I use
   critical discourse analysis to explore the textual strategies through
   which a corpus of TV cartoon adverts enacts a `biopedagogic' discourse
   and shapes `self-disciplinary' subjectivities, targeting children in
   particular. Through subtle semiotic markers (register and regional
   accent) these adverts target a northern English, working class
   demographic, and shift responsibility onto certain individuals while
   glossing over the deeply entrenched and escalating forms of social
   inequality which lie behind the problem. In light of the increasing
   prominence of `soft' governance techniques like nudge, I argue for a
   close dialog between detailed linguistic analytical methods and a
   Foucauldian analytics of power.},

Journal = {MORAL PHILOSOPHY AND POLITICS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {6},
Number = {1, SI},
Pages = {147-173},
Abstract = {What impact should sufficientarianism have on the measurement of
   inequality? Like other theories of justice, sufficientarianism
   influences how economic inequality is conceived. For the purpose of
   measurement, its standards of justice can be approximated by
   income-based thresholds of sufficiency. At which income level could a
   threshold of having enough be pegged in OECD countries? What would it
   imply for standard indicators of inequality, such as decile comparisons
   of cumulated income, income spreads, or the Gini coefficient? This paper
   suggests some answers to these questions, showing that sufficientarian
   ideas could make a difference with respect to the measurement of
   inequality in a society.},

Abstract = {Using the Aristotelian virtue of friendship and concept of practical
   wisdom, this paper argues that engaging in political discourse with
   friends on social media is conducive to the pursuit of the good life
   because it facilitates the acquisition of the socio-political
   information and understanding necessary to live well. Previous work on
   social media, the virtues, and friendship focuses on the initiation and
   maintenance of the highest form of friendship (Aristotle's `ideal
   friendship') online. I argue that the information necessary to live well
   can come from non-ideal, civic friends in addition to ideal friends. In
   order to acquire this information successfully via social media, users
   should practice inclusive engagement, self-control, discretion, and
   audience-sensitivity in their cyber interactions. This argument is
   salient given the current concerns about `echo chambers' or `filter
   bubbles', in which users ignore or block out friends and news sources
   that support political perspectives different from one's own.},

Abstract = {Following Moltke's dictum that `no battle plan ever survives contact
   with the enemy', military learning and adaptation has long been a staple
   of military studies. Over the past fifteen years, much of the literature
   has been focused on Western armed forces in Afghanistan and Iraq. Little
   attention has been paid thus far to adaptation by the Iraqi armed forces
   in their fight against ISIS. Whereas the Iraqi army was routed by the
   group in 2014, three years later it managed to take back almost all the
   territory lost to ISIS. How was that possible? This article discusses
   military adaptation by the Iraqi armed forces and their role in the
   military defeat of ISIS in Iraq. Combining an academic theoretical
   framework on military adaptation with a primary source-based
   investigation of the Iraqi fight against ISIS, we reconstruct how the
   Iraqi armed forces learned from their mistakes in 2014 and which role
   this process played in the military defeat of ISIS in Iraq.},

Abstract = {The government effectiveness and control of corruption is general
   principle supported in the public sector. By using cross-national
   secondary data from 191 countries, this study examines how the
   development of e-government relates to this principle through a two-step
   cluster analysis. Considering the critical roles of senior civil
   servants in enacting administrative reforms, the Public Service Bargains
   (PSB) Theory was employed to analyze the similarities and differences
   among clustered countries in terms of the level of professionalism, the
   autonomy of civil services, and the nature of political-administrative
   relationships. The empirical results indicate a positive association
   between e-governments' development and government effectiveness, as well
   as between e-governments' development, and their control of corruption.
   The study contributes to the body of knowledge on the importance of
   establishing a stable PSB, whether a trustee or agency type, with the
   minimal internal bureaucratic resistance needed to successfully enact
   e-governments' development and eventually improve the overall
   government's effectiveness and corruption control.},

Abstract = {Understanding what stimulates agribusiness firms to lobby the government
   and what makes the government responsive to lobbying are the two issues
   that have been discussed extensively in the debates concerning
   determinants of biotechnology policy. This paper examines the factors
   influencing agribusiness firms' lobbying and government response using
   econometric modeling on a new data set of 160 leading agribusiness firms
   in the food, feed, chemical, and seed industries in China. The results
   show that approximately 10\% of agribusiness firms lobbied the
   government about biotechnology policy and regulations and over half of
   those that lobbied received a verbal or written acknowledgment from
   government agencies. Seed and feed companies are more likely to engage
   in lobbying than chemical companies. Owning GM patents not only has a
   positive impact on firms' lobbying activities, but firms with these
   patents are more likely to receive a government response to their
   lobbying efforts. The experience of selling GM products does not
   significantly influence lobbying activities or response from the
   government.},

Abstract = {This article utilizes van Gennep's neglected theory of territorial
   passages to answer two key questions in the study of ontological
   security (OS) in migration. First, why do the members of the receiving
   society lose their perceived sense of OS in face of a mass of strangers
   arriving at their gates? Second, how, if at all, do they attempt to
   reconstitute it while incorporating the strangers into their world?
   Following the recent call within OS studies in international relations
   (IR) to spell out the social mechanisms that facilitate the anxiety and
   uncertainty of the agents, I use the case of the German societal
   response to the 2015 refugee crisis to demonstrate that van Gennep's
   classical approach, far from being structural and functionalist, offers
   an advanced, power-informed, and processual perspective for uncovering a
   possible sociosymbolic mechanism behind the perceived ``losing{''} and
   ``re-finding{''} of OS in migratory encounters. The article delineates
   the principles of a ``thick{''} approach to OS in migration, explains
   how van Gennep's theory adds to this approach, and highlights the
   ultimate unattainability of OS as an essentialist category that is
   either ``present{''} or ``absent{''} throughout the migratory encounter.
   It concludes by discussing the added value of van Gennep's theory to the
   study of OS in the contemporary global milieu of the ``age of
   migration.{''}},

Abstract = {Chinese outward foreign direct investment (FDI) has been one of the
   economic tools China has used to engage South America. Although Colombia
   has been attracting inward FDI in quantities similar to other key
   regional states, its macroeconomic and sectoral features and investment
   attraction policies positively correlate with many of the factors known
   to attract Chinese outward FDI (OFDI), and both the Colombia and Chinese
   governments are committed to increasing Chinese OFDI (COFDI) flows to
   Colombia, COFDI volumes to the Andean nation have yet to live up to
   expectations. This puzzling case highlights the need for a better
   understanding of the political-economic factors that drive COFDI. My
   case study show that Colombia's political and economic traits have been
   hindering COFDI. Regarding the former, Colombia's local politics
   regarding extractive activities and bidding on infrastructure projects
   and its close relations with the United States function to create an
   adverse environment for increased COFDI. With respect to the latter, the
   international economic environment, especially regarding commodities'
   prices, has impaired Chinese investment in Colombia. Overall, Colombia's
   case underscores the delicate interplay of international, national, and
   subnational factors on COFDI flows.},

Abstract = {Inclusive voting practices have been defined in this special issue to
   refer to policy instruments which can reduce turnout inequality between
   groups and mitigate other inequalities within the electoral process.
   This concluding article reflects on the lessons learnt from the
   empirical studies about (a) how citizens come to be excluded at the
   ballot box; (b) which electoral processes are effective at bringing
   about greater inclusion; (c) what the wider effects of inclusive voting
   practices are; and (d) why such policies instruments not undertaken by
   the state. It argues that there are major lessons for the theorizing of
   democracy, as well as policy and practice in elections worldwide.},

Abstract = {Although people with disabilities are considerably less likely to vote
   than those without a disability, empirical explanations as to why remain
   underdeveloped. The present study investigates whether this discrepancy
   in turnout rates is directly related to voting procedures. Analyzing
   data from the Cooperative Congressional Election Study, we assess the
   ways in which people with disabilities are disenfranchised by election
   administration barriers. Specifically, we identify how experiences with
   voter registration, voter identification regulations, and methods of
   ballot submission impact those with and without disabilities. Also
   considered is the degree to which disability affects one's own political
   competence and political interest. Reflecting on these findings, we
   offer recommendations for reducing such electoral hurdles and providing
   pathways by which comprehensive political incorporation of all
   individuals with disabilities might be achieved.},

Abstract = {What explains the establishment of an `incomplete' Banking Union and its
   `asymmetric' effects? This paper takes an intergovernmentalistapproach
   to explain the incompleteness of Banking Union as well as its asymmetric
   functioning. The institutional design of Banking Union was a compromise
   between the preferences of the main member states, albeit it was closer
   to the positions of Germany. In turn, the incomplete institutional
   design of Banking Union has affected its subsequent functioning. It has
   produced asymmetric effects that have mostly penalised the member states
   in the Southern periphery of the euro area, notably, Italy, Spain,
   Portugal and Greece, which, to no avail, have called for completion of
   Banking Union. Banking Union has not severed the doom-loop in these
   countries and has weakened the institutional capacity of the national
   authorities to deal with ailing banks in these countries, without
   sufficiently strengthening the capacity of supranational authorities to
   do so.},

Abstract = {National human rights institutions have spread rapidly across Europe and
   its Neighbourhood consolidating their powers to protect human rights.
   Yet, we know little about the causes for change in the strength of
   national human rights institutions over time. We propose an analysis of
   institutional strength along two dimensions of safeguards ? durability
   and enforcement ? based on original data for 50 states. We illustrate
   the quantitative analysis with two case studies ? Hungary and Poland. We
   find that European Union membership conditionality is the strongest
   predictor of increased strength in national human rights institutions.
   Additionally, we find evidence of democratic ?lock-in?, as newly
   democratized states seek to increase the durability of their
   institutions. The influence of the United Nations and the European
   Union, through state networks, increases the strength of national human
   rights institutions, particularly their durability. The Council of
   Europe has a positive impact on the institutional safeguards for
   enforcement.},

   Governance-Induced Migration},
Journal = {EAST EUROPEAN POLITICS AND SOCIETIES},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {33},
Number = {4},
Pages = {899-916},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {The article develops a concept of governance-induced migration, focusing
   on the aspect of migrant motivations that remains largely underexamined
   in current migration research. The wage differentials, family reasons,
   and availability of welfare benefits are often indicated as the aspects
   of the host state with a ``magnetic{''} power of attraction. The article
   argues that other aspects of state development also may prominently
   influence the behaviour of immigrants and their readiness to settle in a
   receiving country. The case study presented here of Ukrainian migrant
   entrepreneurs in Poland (interviews with fifty-one respondents)
   demonstrates that their motivations for migration are more complex and
   diversified. They encompass not only the economic and family reasons but
   also the quality and efficiency of public institutions.
   Governance-induced migration is associated with the perception of the
   host state as more citizen-friendly, transparent, effective in ensuring
   safety, and providing an environment for development. The differences
   between Poland and Ukraine in the functionality of public institutions
   and the level of socio-political risks lead to enhanced migration flows
   and entrepreneurship drain from Ukraine.},

Journal = {GLOBAL POLICY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {10},
Number = {4},
Pages = {455-476},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Scientific and technological progress might change people's capabilities
   or incentives in ways that would destabilize civilization. For example,
   advances in DIY biohacking tools might make it easy for anybody with
   basic training in biology to kill millions; novel military technologies
   could trigger arms races in which whoever strikes first has a decisive
   advantage; or some economically advantageous process may be invented
   that produces disastrous negative global externalities that are hard to
   regulate. This paper introduces the concept of a vulnerable world:
   roughly, one in which there is some level of technological development
   at which civilization almost certainly gets devastated by default, i.e.
   unless it has exited the `semi-anarchic default condition'. Several
   counterfactual historical and speculative future vulnerabilities are
   analyzed and arranged into a typology. A general ability to stabilize a
   vulnerable world would require greatly amplified capacities for
   preventive policing and global governance. The vulnerable world
   hypothesis thus offers a new perspective from which to evaluate the
   risk-benefit balance of developments towards ubiquitous surveillance or
   a unipolar world order.},

Abstract = {This article addresses the largely neglected issue of the decline of
   ethnic cleavages in plural societies as expressed in voting behaviour.
   It argues that theoretically, Creolization, a specific form of
   acculturation, accounts for the erosion of ethnic bonding but finds that
   the application of the concept is limited. Hence, the article combines
   the current concept of Creolization with that of political hegemony,
   while broadening Creolization to comprise the acculturation of several
   ethnic groups. However, the paper considers that actual voting patterns
   may be countervailed by party characteristics and election campaigns.
   Using multiple fieldwork methods, the erosion of ethnic voting loyalties
   is analysed in a case study of Suriname, a Caribbean society that is
   representative of a class of plural societies. The paper centres on the
   conceptual apparatus to analyse the erosion of ethnic voting loyalties
   rather than making comparisons. It claims that its argument is
   applicable to plural societies that are characterized by the erosion of
   voting loyalties and decline of ethnic cleavages, notably Trinidad and
   to a lesser degree in Mauritius and Fiji, and increasingly in Suriname
   and Guyana.},

Journal = {POLITICAL PSYCHOLOGY},

Volume = {40},
Number = {6, SI},
Pages = {1201-1215},

Abstract = {This introductory article to the special issue zooms in on the
   literature on political emotions with a specific focus on methodological
   questions of ``how to study{''} political emotions. To the extent that
   methodological matters are addressed in the extant literature, the
   associated challenges are often portrayed as a clash between social
   science and natural science disciplines, a clash frequently illustrated
   by the meeting between political science and neuroscience. Rather than
   being a clash between academic disciplines, this article argues that
   many of the methodological challenges facing emotional research have
   their origin in scholars' diverse views on the relationship between
   themselves as researchers and political emotions as a research object.
   In the light of this acknowledgment, the article encircles and discusses
   the methodological challenges associated with three key conceptual
   distinctions between: (1) individual and collective emotions, (2)
   emotions and reason, and between (3) involuntary political emotions and
   the strategic usage of political emotions. Using the contributions to
   this special issue as illustrations, the article argues in favor of
   moving beyond mutually exclusive dichotomies regarding these conceptual
   distinctions and offers pathways for dealing with current methodological
   challenges to emotional research. It points to methodological pluralism,
   transparency, and context-sensitive research strategies.},

Abstract = {The increasing cost of weapons, decreasing defence budgets and
   globalization of armaments supply-chain have made defence-industrial
   cooperation a priority in the European context. However, despite strong
   systemic incentives, European cooperation in defence-industrial
   activities remains very discontinuous. Why do European countries decide
   to cooperate with their partners in some instances and refrain from
   acting cooperatively in others? The present article introduces market
   size as a variable to elucidate different first and second-tier states'
   approaches towards European defence-industrial cooperation. While firms
   settled in larger domestic markets lobby to maintain existing
   technological capabilities, firms in smaller domestic markets prefer to
   be competitive in limited sectors of the defence-industrial supply-chain
   in order to preserve export market niches. The article tests the
   plausibility of this argument by way of in-depth case studies of the
   French, German and Italian approaches towards two collaborative
   armaments projects: the Eurofighter and the A400M.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF PEACE RESEARCH},

Volume = {57},
Number = {3},
Pages = {422-436},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {How do leaders signal their intentions during a crisis? Scholars point
   to audience costs, potential political punishment for bluffing during
   bargaining, to explain how accountable leaders communicate. However, the
   empirical support for audience costs is mixed. I argue that this
   apparent disconnect between theory and evidence is due to different ways
   that audiences can threaten to use their sanctioning power during a
   crisis. When determining whether to punish a leader for a failed
   coercive threat, their domestic supporters should balance concerns over
   consistency and policy outcomes. As such, accountable leaders' ability
   to credibly communicate is not automatic, rather it depends on their
   supporters' policy preferences. I apply this insight using casualty
   sensitivity as a conditioning policy preference. I expect, and find,
   that audiences only help a leader commit to fight when fighting is
   low-cost, and actually prevent commitment when fighting is high-cost.
   Using compellent threat data, I find that audiences have countervailing
   effects on credibility due to their preferences for leaders who are both
   consistent and avoid costly conflict. This conditional effect could
   explain prior mixed support for audience costs in observational data, as
   prior studies pool together instances where I find audiences have
   strong, but opposing, effects.},

Abstract = {Purpose The purpose of this study is to examine the differential
   association of three different workplace conflicts on employee-related
   outcomes, such as loneliness and well-being. Further, the study pursues
   to explore the perceived social support at the workplace as a
   conditional factor in the relation between different conflict types and
   employee loneliness. Design/methodology/approach The data were collected
   using a self-administered survey from 554 IT employees. Structural
   equation modelling (SEM) was used to test the study postulations.
   Findings The findings indicated that all three types of conflicts
   differently associate on both loneliness and well-being. Besides, it
   found that loneliness works as a mediator between conflict types and
   employee well-being. Further, perceived social support at the workplace
   moderates the relationship between different types of conflict, such as
   relationship, process, task conflicts and employee loneliness at work.
   Originality/value To the best of the authors' knowledge, for the first
   time, a study has been conducted highlighting the differential
   association of workplace conflict and employee outcome and indicating
   its intervening mechanisms and conflict management conditions.},

Abstract = {The objective of this study was to explore how emergency responders'
   experience, beliefs and organizational context influence their
   decision-making processes and their interaction with their clients. The
   study includes 27 interviews with 911 emergency responders to unveil the
   underlying factors which lead responders to act in favour of some of
   their clients, that is, actively represent them, while limiting their
   representation of others. The study is situated at the intersection
   between the street-level bureaucracy and representative bureaucracy
   literatures. Building on symbolic representation, this study argues that
   active representation is shaped by factors beyond mere socio-demographic
   characteristics and organizational or group identities. By focusing the
   analysis on the attitudes of the bureaucrats themselves, this study
   provides initial evidence to support Meier's recent hypotheses in his
   micro-theory of representative bureaucracy.},

Abstract = {Prime ministers in Central Eastern Europe (CEE) are commonly perceived
   to be weaker and less ``presidential{''} than their Western European
   colleagues. In contrast, I argue that the post-communist legacy of CEE
   provides a more favourable context for prime ministers to develop a
   central characteristic of ``presidential{''} prime ministers: a strong
   personal influence on voting behaviour in parliamentary elections, which
   provides prime ministers with the opportunity to gain autonomy within
   their party and cabinet. I theorise that party system instability, as
   well as the comparatively lower media independence and freedom, gives
   greater electoral potential to prime ministers in CEE than to their
   Western European counterparts. Consequently, prime ministers in CEE have
   a stronger influence on vote choice than West European prime ministers.
   These hypotheses are investigated using survey data from several waves
   of the CSES project.},

Abstract = {While comparisons and connections between the Balkans and the Middle
   East are often invoked, the authors in this symposium are putting them
   at the heart of their analysis. In seeking new insights into the
   relationship between identity and war they engage in ``comparative area
   studies.{''} The comparisons, connections, and lessons that emerge from
   these contributions challenge our understandings of the so-called ``war
   on terror{''}, the dynamics of grassroots peacebuilding, and the
   language of sexualised violence in war. The symposium contributes to the
   debate about how comparative area studies can bridge the gap between
   area studies and comparative politics and international relations.},

Abstract = {Comparative scholars fundamentally disagree about the impact of partisan
   politics in modern welfare states, particularly in certain `new' policy
   areas such as active labor market policy (ALMP). Using new data on 900
   ALMP programs across Europe, this study attempts to reconcile a
   long-standing dispute between the traditional `power resources' approach
   and the `insider/outsider' approach pioneered by Rueda. The study argues
   that both left-wing and right-wing governments invest in ALMP but that
   politics still matter because parties' preferences regarding
   unemployment differ. The left is more inclined to expand programs
   primarily designed to reduce unemployment, which exclusively target
   `core' groups in, or at risk of, un-employment, and programs in which
   participants are no longer counted among the unemployed. In contrast,
   both sides are equally prone to expand programs that also-or
   instead-target people who are not yet participating in the labor market,
   which thus also-or instead-serve to increase labor supply.},

Abstract = {Over the past 25 years, Sweden has gone from having one of the most
   generous unemployment benefit systems among the rich democracies to one
   of the least. This article advances a multi-causal explanation for this
   unexpected outcome. It shows how the benefit system became a target of
   successive right-wing governments due to its role in fostering social
   democratic hegemony. Employer groups, radicalized by the turbulent 1970s
   more profoundly than elsewhere, sought to undermine the system, and
   their abandonment of corporatism in the early 1990s limited unions'
   capacity to restrain right-wing governments in retrenchment initiatives.
   Two further developments help to explain the surprising political
   resilience of the cuts: the emergence of a private (supplementary)
   insurance regime and a realignment of working-class voters from the
   Social Democrats to parties of the right, especially the nativist Sweden
   Democrats, in the context of a liberal refugee/asylum policy.},

Abstract = {There is a long-standing debate in the literature about the effects that
   citizen participation can have on the efficacy and efficiency of
   government, particularly at subnational level. Much of the discussion
   has focused on the potential that citizen participation holds for local
   democracy. However, doubts remain about whether participative mechanisms
   and citizenship involvement can contribute to improving these actions of
   the local state. This paper therefore carries out a systematic review
   and meta-analysis of the literature, in order to discover what light
   specialist research can throw on this debate. After the analysis
   described, the results show that most studies reveal a positive
   relationship between citizen participation and the improvement of
   government performance, based on both theoretical and empirical
   analysis, highlighting the potential in terms of improving the provision
   of public services, in the consolidation of democratic values and in the
   construction of trust between citizens and public administration.
   However, there are also evidence of blocking factors that could generate
   negative and counterproductive effects. It concludes with an analysis of
   the results and a brief agenda for future research.},

Abstract = {Most public frontline employees work out of sight of management. Direct
   management through authority and incentives is therefore often
   challenging. We argue that managers can rely on change-oriented training
   as an effective management tool that can affect employee behavior and
   work as an alternative or supplement to commands and incentives. First,
   we outline the concept of change-oriented training and explain how it
   can direct the behavior of public employees towards organizational goals
   and political priorities. Second, we test the effect of change-oriented
   training on employee behavior in a large-scale field experiment of
   teachers in Danish public schools. We show that training has a
   substantial effect on teachers' behavior in the classroom and infer from
   this that training should be seen as a valuable management tool with the
   ability to influence the behavior of frontline employees.},

Abstract = {South-South relations have regained widespread interest in recent years,
   together with increasingly visible stances on international stages.
   Brazil's interactions with the African continent, in particular, came to
   epitomise such a perception while sustaining an expectation of mutual
   alignment in several global issues. However, these assumptions still
   lack empirical corroboration. Drawing on United Nations General Assembly
   voting data for the 1991-2013 timeframe, this article questions a
   supposed South-South solidarity at the multilateral institution with the
   largest global representation and identifies key thematic axes that
   incite greater collective stances. The analysis further sheds light on
   whether or not a common South-South agenda has emerged over time.},

Title = {Going beyond science-policy interaction? An analysis of views among
   intergovernmental panel on climate change actors},
Journal = {CRITICAL POLICY STUDIES},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {15},
Number = {1},
Pages = {37-54},
Month = {JAN 2},
Abstract = {Scholarly literature on science-policy interaction is typically divided
   between advocating that science and policy need to be brought closer
   together or separated. In a recent article in this journal, Sundqvist
   and colleagues {[}Sundqvist et al. (2018) Oneworld or two?
   Science-policy interactions in the climate field, Critical Policy
   Studies, 12:4, 448-468] proposed a typology that structures this debate.
   We use their typology to conduct a text analysis on empirical material
   from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's (IPCC) internal
   consultation on its future. We find that science-policy practitioners
   are not as divided as the scholarly debate. Moreover, while the typology
   is a powerful tool in unearthing differences in opinion regarding
   science-policy interaction, it comes at the price of reductionism. We
   suggest that a continuum, instead of separate boxes, helps visualize the
   large spectrum of ideas. However, regardless of type of typology, it is
   important that the discussion goes beyond the relationship between
   science and policy, and beyond an unconstructive battle between
   extremes. It is neither possible nor normatively desirable to demarcate
   `science', `policy' and other actors. Whilst this discussion is of
   central importance to the IPCC, greater focus should be put on its
   relationship with society.},

Abstract = {The European Commission launched in November 2014 an Investment Plan for
   Europe to foster Europe's economic recovery. Despite prognosis of
   failure, in 2016 Juncker announced the success of the Plan and proposed
   its extension. Using as theoretical framework an adaptation of Bovens
   and `t Hart's model of two logics of policy evaluation (political and
   programmatic) (1996; 2016), our goal is to answer the question: Is the
   Investment plan truly a success as claimed by the Commission? Our
   findings suggest that although the Plan scored fairly poorly as the
   reputation goes, the perception is gradually improving over time. In
   terms of performance, most of the numbers are in line with, or above,
   the expected results for the timeframe of the analysis.},

Title = {Global mobility of microfinance policies},
Journal = {POLICY AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {39},
Number = {1, SI},
Pages = {19-35},
Month = {JAN 2},
Abstract = {Throughout the 1970s in South Asia and Latin America, there was a surge
   of experiences of offering small loans through innovative practices.
   Following these successes, the dissemination of microfinance
   institutions is seen all over the globe. Brazil stands out for being a
   pioneer in this field, having developed a microcredit program even
   before Grameen Bank, from Bangladesh, the main institution responsible
   for the spread of microfinance worldwide. This paper aims to understand
   the social practices, power relations and institutional infrastructure
   surrounding microfinance, taking the Global South as a starting point
   and focusing on Brazil. In so doing, it looks at the policy mobility of
   microfinance, shining light on how policy diffusion and transfer are
   entangled in the practices and processes of different institutions,
   actors and networks. It identifies two approaches within the formulation
   and practice of microfinance historically. Four illustrative cases are
   discussed in order to present the mobility of microfinance policies in
   Brazil drawing from the international scenario. The paper's point of
   departure for the analysis of the mobility of microfinance is that
   policy trajectories are fraught with ambivalence and contradiction. They
   are part of a complex universe permeated by hybridism over time and
   space.},

Abstract = {The rulings of internationals courts are often reduced to ``who
   won?,{''} but much more is at stake. Like other institutions, the World
   Trade Organization (WTO) offers rulings that balance legal discipline
   against political constraints. We argue that one way in which the WTO
   handles politically sensitive issues is by increasing the amount of
   affect in their rulings. In doing so, judges provide national
   governments with discursive resources to persuade their domestic
   audiences of the legitimacy of compliance. To test our expectations, we
   conduct a text analysis of all rulings rendered by the institution since
   1995. Specifically, we find that more politically charged decisions,
   such as the ones concerning nonfiscal rather than fiscal aspects of
   national treatment claims, are explained in qualitatively different
   terms. We also find that, as an issue gets ruled on repeatedly, the
   amount of affect deployed progressively decreases. In sum, the WTO
   chooses its words strategically to persuade litigants, and their
   domestic audiences, of the legitimacy of compliance in politically
   fraught disputes.},

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL STUDIES QUARTERLY},

Volume = {63},

Abstract = {Powerful countries use foreign media broadcasts to enhance their soft
   power, yet there is scant empirical evidence as to whether such efforts
   actually sway public opinion abroad. Moreover, researchers have not
   specified conditions that may shape variations in the influence of
   foreign broadcasts and internet. We propose a theory that predicts,
   respectively, opinion-formation and issue-framing effects of foreign
   broadcasts as functions of the pervasiveness and familiarity of the
   issues they cover. We test our hypotheses by examining the potential
   effects of exposure to Russia-sourced broadcasts on views of Russia and
   other foreign policy issues in Kyrgyzstan, a most likely case of foreign
   media effects. Using an original, nationally representative survey
   conducted in Kyrgyzstan in 2015, we find that the influence of Russian
   media on Kyrgyzstani opinions varies according to the pervasiveness and
   familiarity of the issues at stake and is more limited than
   traditionally believed. The modest and conditional effects of foreign
   media in this particularly favorable environment cast doubt on the
   assumption that media are a soft-power tool ``par excellence{''} and
   call for further research on how media can be used effectively for
   public diplomacy.},

Abstract = {Since the 1950s, US military personnel have taken on an increasingly
   diverse set of responsibilities, including less traditional roles
   delivering disaster aid and engaging in public diplomacy. Focusing on a
   particular subset of deployments, humanitarian and civic-assistance
   deployments to Latin America, we examine the effect that a US military
   presence can have on public opinion in the host country. We focus on the
   microfoundations of popular support and use survey data and newly
   collected subnational data on deployments to examine the effect of these
   deployments on mass attitudes toward the US military and government in
   Peru. We find that these deployments do improve perceptions of the US
   military and government, and correlate with assessments of US influence
   that are more positive. Our findings bolster the conclusions of previous
   research that shows how aid can both improve public attitudes toward the
   donor country and address the foreign aid attribution problem.},

Abstract = {East Asia is a region of signal importance for global order because of
   its economic dynamism and growing heft, China's challenge to the United
   States as incumbent regional and global hegemon, and other conflict
   hotspots like the Korean peninsula. This requires academic analysis that
   both appreciates the subtleties inherent to this region and can relate
   them to the wider systemic context. Many analysts have begun to allude
   to the challenging characteristics that are present in the international
   relations of East Asia, in particular struggling to explain how growing
   levels of economic interdependence can coexist with heightened security
   tensions. This article offers a research prospectus that suggests ways
   of analyzing these apparently contradictory trends. It proposes the
   development of research questions and approaches that are more suited to
   studying the international relations of a region with characteristics
   that we define as dual, hybrid, and contingent. We propose a
   Conjunctions Analytical Framework that explores what happens at the
   conjunctions of the regional-global and the unit-regional/global levels
   of analysis-the ``grey areas{''} where social formations meet and
   interact. We aim to help shape the future study of the IR of East Asia
   and to suggest more effective ways of analyzing the complex reality of
   East Asia's regional and global politics.},

Abstract = {In search of a better image, Russia has created a whole arsenal of soft
   power since the mid-2000s according to a Western model. However, the
   impact of these tools was limited: the image of Russia continues to be
   tarnished by the absence of an attractive model and by the priority it
   continues to give to military force and methods of influence, far from
   being ``soft{''}. Since the annexation of Crimea, these latter tools
   have been considerably strengthened, further degrading the image of
   Russia. However, part of the international audience, including among
   Western elites and populations, was seduced by the vigor of the new
   Russian posture and the assertive political leadership of Vladimir
   Putin. Russian foreign policy, backed by powerful information tools, is
   at the heart of the new image of Russia which values its otherness, the
   legitimacy of its action and the central role in the most important
   international issues.},

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL STUDIES QUARTERLY},

Abstract = {Research on international election observation shows that observation
   reduces fraud, encourages participation, and boosts confidence in the
   election. However, this conventional account misses the negative,
   violence-inducing potential of observer criticism. This is the first
   study examining how observer criticism influences post-election
   violence. Democracy depends on the loser's consent, and the willingness
   of election losers to be governed by the winners can be influenced by
   observer criticism. When reputable observers criticize the credibility
   of an election, they can encourage losers to challenge the result.
   Observer criticism strengthens the electoral loser by legitimizing a
   challenge and serving as a focal point for mobilization. Using data on
   post-election violence in thirty-eight countries in sub-Saharan Africa
   since 1990, I show that internationally condemned elections are more
   likely to turn violent than not-condemned elections. These results are
   robust to various control variables (including observer presence and
   election fraud) and accounting for potential selection, spuriousness,
   endogeneity, and omitted variables.},

Abstract = {This article analyses narrative stories used by the Chinese government
   to connect the problem of population ageing to welfare reform. The
   findings derived from semi-structural interviews and key policy
   documents suggest the unfolding of the narrative stories of power and
   stories of rising and stories of decline. The narrative stories in the
   developmental Chinese welfare state are diverse and stem from different
   processes than those for the mature European welfare states. The
   Narrative stories also vary for different policy areas. For inequality
   and health-care policies, under the master narrative of story of power,
   state depicts `stories of giving-to-give' to support expansion in the
   traditional `old risk' type of policies to main population, including
   the elderly. For long-term care, the power narrative of
   `giving-to-shape' legitimizes the expansionary reforms for a small group
   of deserving frail elderly. Behind this political framing of long-term
   care reform lies the story of decline that justifies the modest role of
   state provision in the organization of long-term care and leaves the
   responsibility for economic, social and spiritual wellbeing for the
   society itself. The story of decline in China also gravitates around
   sustainability of societies rather than around financial sustainability
   commonly underlining the political debate in the West.},

Abstract = {Despite a vast literature documenting motivations for collective action,
   the role of sociopolitical ideologies, including right-wing ideologies,
   in predicting collective action is underresearched. Literature on
   right-wing ideological beliefs suggests that those higher in right-wing
   authoritarianism (RWA) or social dominance orientation (SDO) hold
   specific attitudes or endorse specific policies, in part, because of
   factors such as perceived fear-based threat or empathy. In the present
   research, structural equation modeling (SEM) was run on pooled data from
   a diverse Canadian university sample and two American adult samples
   (total N = 1,469). Participants completed measures of RWA, SDO,
   fear-based threat, empathy, and domain-specific collective action.
   Results showed that RWA and SDO both related positively to collective
   action targeting societal moral breakdown but negatively to collective
   action aimed at equalizing race relations or fighting climate change.
   Whereas the indirect effects of right-wing ideologies via fear-based
   threat or empathy were significant in all four domains for SDO, the
   indirect effect of RWA was only significant in the climate change
   domain. Implications are discussed.},

Abstract = {Cultural policies were invented in post-war Europe with three basic
   aims: to safeguard cultural heritage; to encourage creation; to bring
   The Arts closer to citizens. Thus, led by Scandinavia and countries such
   as France and Great Britain, these policies spread and shaped different
   models, each of which responded to different cultural, historical and
   political traditions. A process of European cultural convergence is
   currently under way within the framework of the European Union. Evidence
   for this convergence is to be found in Compendium, Eurostat and
   Eurobarometer data. However, long-lasting structural and institutional
   factors explain why notable differences in cultural spending and the
   make-up of cultural consumption persist, hence the need to rethink the
   notion of European cultural policy models.},

Abstract = {This article analyses the military transformations that India underwent
   during the Second World War. It focuses on the institutional dimension
   of these changes and considers the longer-term changes wrought by the
   war in the composition of the army, the logistical and support
   infrastructure and the emergence of an indigenous military industrial
   base. Taken together, the article argues, these changes positioned India
   as a potential regional military power that was qualitatively different
   from the interwar period.},

Pages = {1643-1666},

Abstract = {Drawing on the evolutionary approach, this paper proposes that certain
   universal cognitive mechanisms (parochial altruism) underlie engagement
   and involvement in terrorism. Parochial altruism is the tendency to
   perceive and behave in ways that favour ingroups and disfavour outgroups
   in light of particular intergroup cues, whilst incurring some kind of
   personal cost in order to effect that bias. New data is generated by
   implementing an experiment and using a student sample to investigate
   certain features of parochial altruism. Findings indicate that
   sensitivity to parochial altruism varies across individuals, according
   to sex, group size, and feelings of vulnerability. Some individuals are
   more sensitive to perceiving and responding to threatening outgroups,
   which is relevant to the radicalisation process. It is proposed that in
   certain conditions, such as the presence of radicalisation risk factors,
   those most sensitive to parochial altruism may be more open to
   perceptions of threat to the ingroup, extremist ideology, and more
   likely to engage in violent actions than others.},

Abstract = {This paper provides a theoretical sketch of relationality within the
   field of International Relations (IR). It argues, contrary to what many
   IR scholars hold, that representation is practice: academic
   representation reflects the background of a community of practice and
   highlights what is embodied therein. Therefore, different cultural
   communities have different practices and draw from different background
   knowledge. Rationality, which serves as the dominant foundation for
   background knowledge within many Western communities of practice,
   permeates mainstream IR theory. Relationality performs a similar role in
   traditionally Confucian communities of practice, where relations enjoy a
   distinct ontological status over individual rationality. A relational
   theory assumes (1) that self-existence coincides with other-existence
   and coexistence, and (2) that self-interest coincides with
   other-interest. Based on these assumptions, it argues that relations
   select, meaning that in a social situation actors base their action on
   relations in the first place and that rationality is and can only be
   defined in terms of relations. The article uses the Association of
   Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) as an example to elaborate its
   theoretical point.},

Abstract = {Despite a sizable literature on racial priming, scholars have failed to
   account for the shifting nature of racial appeals. First, theories of
   racial priming have not yet been widely applied to increasingly common
   anti-immigrant and anti-Latino political appeals. Second, theories of
   racial priming have not adequately accounted for both an increasingly
   racialized political climate and increased tolerance for explicit
   anti-minority appeals. In two survey experiments fielded both before
   Trump's rise and after his presidential victory, we find the
   Implicit-Explicit (IE) model always fails for anti-black appeals,
   sometimes fails for anti-immigrant appeals, but consistently holds for
   anti-Latino appeals. While we find the null effects of implicit versus
   explicit anti-black and anti-immigrant appeals are partly driven by
   tolerance for the explicit appeals, we also find evidence that white
   Americans are adept at recognizing the racial content of appeals
   featuring widely used, congruent issue-group pairs. Our findings shed
   light on conditions under which the IE model does and does not hold in
   the current political era.},

Abstract = {This study advances a distinction between two generic types of
   terrorists' rhetoric: (1) ideological rhetoric candidly reflecting the
   terrorists' genuine beliefs and values regarding their military
   targeting policy (who is a legitimate target), even when adopting such
   rhetoric involves high image/diplomatic costs; and (2) a PR-oriented
   rhetoric which consciously misrepresents the terrorists' intentions and
   behavior in an attempt to project a more benign and humane image, thus
   maintaining sympathy and rebuffing criticism. We contend that such a
   distinction can provide a highly useful metric for assessing terrorists
   groups' rationality and pragmatism: the most pragmatic groups will shift
   between these two types of rhetoric depending on changing strategic
   needs. To show the practical usefulness of this distinction we provide
   criteria for categorizing terrorists' rhetorical responses to (mostly
   liberal-minded) criticism that they have killed innocent civilians in
   their enemy's camp. We apply our criteria by examining terrorists'
   (sincere and insincere) apologies.},

Abstract = {Many outputs and outcomes of relevance to public administration research
   are distributed in a way that escapes simple statistical descriptives.
   The field of public administration has generally been slow to
   acknowledge this fact, but in recent years the research field of public
   budgeting has experienced what we term a ``distributional turn{''}
   reflected in a massive increase in publications studying distributions
   of changes in public budgets. Yet, distributional budget studies still
   rely on inadequate statistical methods. In this article, we introduce a
   comparative distributional method (CDM), which allows for inferential
   statistics and statistical modeling of distributions. It also allows for
   specification of parameter values that precisely characterize the
   empirical distribution. All this is important for systematic comparisons
   of empirical distributions. We illustrate the usefulness of the CDM
   approach by analyzing budget data from seven countries and conclude with
   a discussion of how this new method can be extended to other areas of
   public administration than public budgeting.},

Abstract = {Regional development agencies (RDAs) have been established in the
   countries of the former Yugoslavia, where the development of
   economically underdeveloped areas primarily targeted the federal
   republics and autonomous provinces. The role of RDAs has been
   underpinned by the EU due to significance of the cohesion policy for new
   EU member states (Slovenia and Croatia), the process of association and
   negotiations on regional policy and the coordination of structural
   instruments for candidate and potential candidate countries. The paper
   elaborates on whether and to what extent the RDAs are expected to
   enhance national administrative capacities for programming, coordination
   and implementation of financial assistance. On the basis of a normative
   analysis of policy documents, relevant legislation and desk-research of
   the core competences and activities of the RDAs, the paper aims to
   portray the institutional arrangements for regional development, in
   particular the role of RDAs in the promotion of productivity and growth.
   Although regional partnerships have emerged as new collaborative
   governance structures, the principle of partnership is not fully
   respected as a result of strong centralization, the multitude of actors
   with overlapping roles and the underdeveloped systemic communication
   with stakeholders.},

Abstract = {The economic effects of transport infrastructure have been at the
   forefront of economic research and development policies for the last
   three decades, after the estimates in the early studies uncovered
   transport investment as one of the main drivers of economic growth. This
   is still widely accepted, and the aim of this paper is to challenge this
   view by analyzing 657 estimates from 48 production function studies. Our
   results confirm a positive yet small average output elasticity of
   transport network. but further add to the literature by showing that the
   marginal returns of transport infrastructure have been falling since
   1950s. especially in the USA and China, while the output elasticities in
   Europe have been stable but low throughout the entire period.
   Furthermore, the paper reviews studies on the effects of new roads on
   firm-level performance, and concludes, based on the evidence of small
   marginal returns of transport infrastructure on both macro- and
   micro-economic level, that a a much more targeted approach to public
   investment in transport infrastructure is needed, at least in the
   developed countries.},

Abstract = {This article analyzes how the cultural diplomacy of the government of
   Enrique Pella Nieto had a presence in the international relations of
   Mexico, but suffered from a conceptual disorder and irrelevance as a
   tool of foreign policy. The image of Mexico abroad had a good start with
   the so-called Mexican Moment, but collapsed following corruption-related
   events and the escalation of criminal activity, and specifically the
   Ayotzinapa case of 2014. Meanwhile, the budget for cultural diplomacy
   was merely a nominal and decorative figure exercised by the Department
   for Educational and Cultural Cooperation of Amexcid, whose expenditure
   was made irrelevant by the lack of coordination and redundancy of the
   initiatives of the Ministries of Culture, Economy, Tourism and the
   Presidency of the Republic.},

Abstract = {In tune with the atmosphere of the `global 60s', Senegal experienced a
   major political crisis in May 1968 that began with a student strike,
   followed by the workers in a general strike. May `68 in Senegal was both
   global and local, and these aspects are not in opposition as has
   sometimes been the case in political and academic debates. The article
   goes beyond the events themselves and attempts to shed light on a period
   of `revolutionary politics' that was triggered by the revolt of 1968.
   This has scarcely been documented, but has had a real influence on
   contemporary Senegalese politics.},

   life},
Journal = {COOPERATION AND CONFLICT},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {54},
Number = {2},
Pages = {278-296},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Against the background of a continuing interest in the everyday in
   international relations, this article asks what kind of analytics upon
   and within the world mobilises one through the concept of the everyday
   and what consequences this may have for thinking about politics. In
   particular, it explores a conception of the the everyday that
   foregrounds the abundance of human life and ephemeral temporalities. The
   abundance of life invites a densification of politics combined with an
   emphasis on displacing levels or scales by associative horizontal
   relations. The ephemeral introduces a conception of temporality that
   foregrounds the political significance of fleeting practices and the
   emergent nature of life. When applied to politics, this conception of
   the everyday performs politics as emergent, as possibilities that are
   not already defined by fixing what politics can possibly be. The order
   of politics is then understood as an immanently precarious succession of
   situations and practices in which lived political lives remain
   inherently aleatory, momentary and emergent rather than as an order of
   mastering the political. The concept of the everyday, thus draws
   attention to the immanent elusiveness and fragility of politics as it
   loses its ground, its referent.},

Abstract = {This article will explore the arrangement of and relations between
   states inside ROs as they move from conflict to negotiation, as well as
   the different types of negotiations that they choose - bilateral,
   mediated, multiparty, or hybrid. In doing so, it will illuminate the
   opportunities that exist at the regional level to develop inclusive
   regional frameworks for mediation and negotiation and, in the right
   circumstances, effective security communities. Broadly defined, a
   security community exists when sovereign states can overcome a lack of
   mutual trust and difficult regional environments to develop new forms of
   cooperative security that prioritize self-restraint and the peaceful
   resolution of differences and reduce the expectation of the need to
   resort to organized violence to settle interstate disputes (Adler and
   Barnett, 1988; Adler and Greve, 2009).},

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATION},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {73},

Abstract = {What explains differential rates of ethnic violence in postcolonial
   Africa? I argue that ethnic groups organized as a precolonial state
   (PCS) exacerbated interethnic tensions in their postcolonial country.
   Insecure leaders in these countries traded off between inclusive
   coalitions that risked insider coups and excluding other ethnic groups
   at the possible expense of outsider rebellions. My main hypotheses posit
   that PCS groups should associate with coups because their historically
   rooted advantages often enabled accessing power at the center, whereas
   other ethnic groups in their countries-given strategic incentives for
   ethnopolitical exclusion-should fight civil wars more frequently than
   ethnic groups in countries without a PCS group. Analyzing originally
   compiled data on precolonial African states provides statistical
   evidence for these implications about civil wars and coups between
   independence and 2013 across various model specifications. Strikingly,
   through 1989, thirty of thirty-two ethnic group-level major civil war
   onsets occurred in countries with a PCS group.},

Abstract = {The European Union (EU) is currently enmeshed in a polycrisis. Yet, a
   treaty change to ease these crises is out of reach. We ask how a
   supranational actor, the European Parliament (EP), strives for more de
   facto powers amidst this situation. Relying on refined propositions of
   inter-institutional bargaining theory, we argue that the EP skilfully
   deploys strategies in order to extend its powers beyond the provisions
   of the Lisbon Treaty. Based on original interview material, we assess
   these propositions in two crisis-ridden areas of EU decision-making:
   economic governance and the negotiation of trade agreements. We find
   that the EP extended its powers in both policies by applying a set of
   particular strategies, which include obstructing the decision-making
   process, acting as a first-mover and mobilizing the public. Finally, we
   reflect on the possible consequences of this self-empowerment for the
   EP's legitimacy.},

Abstract = {A combination of undemocratic developments in Hungary and Poland as well
   as Eastern Europe's reluctance to engage in solidary burden-sharing at
   the height of the refugee crisis in Europe has brought back familiar
   allusions of Eastern Europeans as troublemakers for European unity and
   peace. This article offers a discursive dissection of `Eastern Europe'
   as a subtly subversive challenge to Europe's security of `self',
   entailing a fear of being overrun by an `other' perceived as endangering
   one's normative and cultural order. Proceeding from Ingrid Creppell's
   (2011) notion of normative threat, this article argues that the
   reappearance of `Eastern Europe' as an ontological insecurity trope is
   indicative of deeper anxieties within Europe, some of which are systemic
   (such as doubts about the efficacy of integration and the legitimacy of
   the European Union) and some of which are contingent (such as concerns
   about defending the European political order from populist upsurges
   amidst `resurgent nationalism').},

Abstract = {Critical security studies literature has only recently begun to take
   into account the influence of material aspects in the field of
   cybersecurity. This article traces securitization logics in popular
   visual culture to show how these representations make sense of technical
   incidents politically via material objects. Using a mix of discourse
   analysis and semiology, three types of threat representations are
   identified, showing a shift from depicting computers themselves as the
   main threat to the manipulation of data as exercise of power and
   finally, the wielding of code as weapon to create physical damage.
   Material objects define the space of engagement, being both the threat
   and what is threatened. By destabilising old authority structures, they
   pose questions about legitimate political alternatives in a world where
   only a handful of technical geniuses have the power to shape rules and
   take on the role of `the protector'.},

Abstract = {The official mechanisms of intelligence oversight and accountability in
   the United Kingdom are arguably disjointed and ineffective. Thus,
   informal actors such as journalists, have played a more significant
   role. In addition, a rise of whistleblowers and leakers, such as Chelsea
   Manning, have highlighted the importance of online archives as an avenue
   for accountability. The United Kingdom is legally bound to place
   official documents on the public record at the National Archives.
   Sensitive material on intelligence and other security subjects majorly
   impedes the bulk release of documents. Inevitably, the inclination to
   `weed' sensitive material from mundane documents has resulted in a
   costly declassification process. Evidence suggests that historians
   successfully investigated these subjects through the use of archives,
   despite the efforts of officials to obfuscate. This article argues that
   historians increasingly constitute the last forum of accountability and
   that routine declassification is an important, but neglected aspect of
   our machinery of intelligence oversight.},

Abstract = {The enlargement of 2004 and 2007 significantly transformed the European
   Union in political, economic, and social terms. It also challenged the
   collective identities of Western Europeans as well as each of the
   newcomers. However, for new members, the prospect of joining a
   supranational political entity posed a threat to their newly established
   or regained sovereignty and nationhood. The integration triggered a
   process of redefinition of both their self-perception and the perception
   of Europe as a common project. The article offers a case study of how
   the Polish Members of the European Parliament discursively (re)construct
   national and European identities and how these constructions relate to
   each other. The analysis reveals three main visions of the European
   identity that are voiced by the Polish representation and corresponding
   visions of national identity. By focusing on the supranational level of
   the European Parliament and contextualising the analysed constructions
   with references to national debates, the study is able to nuance the
   existing theoretical accounts of European and national identities.},
