Abstract = {Between pro-retrenchment politicians and segments of the media,
   exaggerated claims about the generous benefits enjoyed by those on
   welfare are relatively common. But to what extent, and under what
   conditions, can they actually shape attitudes towards welfare? This
   study explores these questions via a survey experiment conducted in the
   UK, examining: (1) the extent to which the value of the claimed figure
   matters; (2) if the presence of anchoring information about minimum wage
   income has an impact; and (3) whether these effects differ based on
   egalitarianism and political knowledge. Results suggest that increasing
   the size of the claimed figure decreases support in a broadly linear
   fashion, with anchoring information important only when (asserted)
   benefit levels are modestly above the minimum wage income.
   Egalitarianism, in turn, primarily matters when especially low figures
   are placed alongside information about minimum wage, while low-knowledge
   respondents were more susceptible to anchoring effects than
   high-knowledge ones.},

Abstract = {The UN has promoted the use of alternative dispute resolution (ADR) by
   national human rights institutions (NHRIs). This article critically
   examines this proposition by analyzing the three assumptions that
   underlie it. First, ADR is an appropriate means by which to resolve
   human rights disputes; second, ADR should be provided in institutional
   form; third, an NHRI should play a role in the delivery of ADR. We argue
   that voluntary engagement with ADR is permissible subject to procedural
   and substantive standards of justice, but identify the risk that the
   offer of ADR by an institution may turn into a de facto mandatory
   process if not set within a context in which the courts are also
   accessible. Rather than an outright rejection of a role for ADR in such
   circumstances, we examine the potential contributions an institution
   could make to redressing the deficiencies in the access to justice
   landscape and identify the key factors states and other policymakers
   should take into account when determining which institution(s) assume a
   dispute resolution role.},

Abstract = {Major powers signal support for proteges in order to reassure them and
   deter harm against them. Yet, it is not always clear how to identify who
   a major power's proteges are or the degree of support signaled. Major
   powers have a variety of complementary signals to choose among,
   including alliances, arms transfers, joint military exercises, and
   others. It can be difficult to weigh the importance of individual
   signals, especially since different major powers do not deploy each
   signal in the same way. We address this challenge using a Bayesian
   latent measurement model, which provides a theoretically coherent means
   of identifying the overall level of support signaled by a major power
   for a protege. Our approach yields a cross-sectional time-series
   dataset, providing a continuous measure of the degree of support
   signaled by major powers for all minor powers from 1950 to 2012. Our
   model also provides insights regarding which signals of support are most
   informative when sent by each major power. We find considerable
   variation among major powers regarding which of their signals are most
   meaningful, but in general alliances and military exercises tend to be
   among the most important signals. In further applications using our
   latent measure, we also assess under which conditions major powers are
   likely to increase their signals of support for proteges, as well as
   predict whether a major power will intervene in conflicts involving its
   proteges.},

Abstract = {The performed cross-national tests with negative binomial regression
   models support the presence of a curvilinear relationship between the
   quantitative expansion of education (measured with mean years of
   schooling) and terrorist attack intensity. Growth of schooling in the
   least educationally developed countries is associated with a significant
   tendency towards the growth of terrorist attack intensity. This tendency
   remains significant when controlled for income level, type of political
   regime, unemployment, inequality, and urbanization; wherein the peak of
   the terrorist attack intensity is observed for a relatively low, but not
   zero level of the quantitative expansion of formal education
   (approximately three to six years of schooling). Further growth of
   schooling in more developed countries is associated with a significant
   trend toward the decrease of terrorist attack intensity. This tendency
   remains significant after being controlled for income level, political
   regime, unemployment, inequality, and urbanization. The most radical
   decrease is observed for the interval between seven and eight mean years
   of schooling. In addition, this quantitative analysis indicates the
   presence of a similar curvilinear relationship between GDP per capita
   and terrorist attack intensity with a wide peak from \$4000 to \$14,000.
   The explanation of a curvilinear relationship between GDP per capita and
   terrorist activity through mean years of schooling intermediary can only
   be partial. The regression analysis suggests that the growth of mean
   years of schooling with economic development of middle and high income
   countries may really be one of the factors accounting for the decrease
   of terrorist attacks in countries with GDP per capita growth. However,
   this regression analysis indicates that a partial role in the
   explanation of negative correlation between GDP per capita and terrorist
   attack intensity for middle and high income countries is also played by
   a lower level of unemployment rate in the high income countries, as well
   as by a very high share of consolidated democracies and an extremely low
   share of factional democracies among the high income states. It is
   especially worth noting that after the introduction of all controls, the
   coefficient sign for per capita GDP changes from negative to positive,
   i.e., GDP growth in middle and high income countries after the
   introduction of controls for inequality, education, unemployment, type
   of regime, etc. turns out to be a factor of increase rather than decline
   of the intensity of terrorist activity. On the one hand, this suggests
   that the negative correlation between per capita GDP and the level of
   terrorist activity in these countries is actually explained to an
   extremely high degree by the fact that per capita GDP growth here tends
   to be accompanied by an increase in the educational level of the
   population, a decrease in unemployment, a reduction in inequality, a
   decrease in the number of factional democracies, and an increase in the
   number of consolidated democracies.
   On the other hand, the positive sign (with a statistically significant
   correlation) indicates here that if in the middle and high countries
   economic growth is not accompanied by an increase in economic equality
   and education of the population, a decrease in unemployment, a decrease
   in the number of unstable factional democracies, and an increase in the
   number of consolidated democracies (that is, if in fact all the fruits
   of economic growth are captured by the elites, and almost nothing gets
   from this growth to the commoner population), then such economic growth
   would tend to lead to an increase in terrorist activity (and not to its
   reduction).},

Abstract = {The discussion on `New Approaches to Political Economy (PE)' gives us a
   state-ofthe-art overview of the main theoretical and conceptual
   developments within the concept of political economy. Thereby, it
   invites us to broaden our knowledge regarding manifold novel approaches,
   which make use of more complex methods to study the less stable, less
   predictable, but faster changing realities of smaller or bigger
   geographical regions. In this discussion forum, Amable takes a closer
   look on the nature of `conflict' as well as the relationship between
   conflict and institutional change or stability. After stressing the
   relevance of comparative capitalism in general, Regan also zooms in on
   the political conflicts in comparative political economy from three
   different perspectives (electoral politics, organized interest groups
   and business-state elites), where he finds new avenues, tensions and
   research agendas are opening up. From a different perspective, Avdagic
   reviews the broad developments in the field of political economy with
   respect to the supply and demand side of redistributive policy.
   Thereafter, Baccaro and Pontusson sketch an alternative `growth model
   perspective', which puts demand and distribution at the center of the
   analysis. Finally, Van der Zwan analyses the usefulness of
   financialization studies for the study of (comparative) political
   economy.},

Abstract = {While much research has been conducted on military trauma,
   conceptualizations of deployment-related suffering have been
   predominantly approached through a medical, individual-focused lens.
   Since the military is an instrument of the state, it is crucial to
   expand the conceptual scope to include political processes, particularly
   for the fast-growing literature on ``moral injury,{''} which refers to
   the emotional impact of perpetrating, witnessing, or falling victim to
   perceived wrongdoing. This article examines the role of political
   practices in the onset of moral injury as well as the micropolitical
   responses of morally injured veterans. A study of the Dutch mission in
   Uruzgan, Afghanistan, shows that decisions and frames at the political
   level helped create distressing quandaries on the ground and that in all
   the ways the political leadership acknowledged the problems that
   veterans subsequently developed, it also maintained a silence on its
   direct contribution to these problems, as such perpetuating them.
   Consequently, veterans tried to make the political leadership take a
   material and symbolic share in their burden. Clearly, moral conflict may
   exist both in the veteran and between the veteran and the political
   domain, and therefore, experiences of institutional betrayal and a
   resultant search for reparations should be included in theory on moral
   injury.},

Abstract = {Tracing the development of modern understandings of the `politics of
   protection,' this paper examines the paradoxical reality of the use of
   violence by states to build peace, protect civilians and provide
   humanitarian assistance. It presents the mechanisms through which a
   dominant liberal-realist ideology based on securitized and militarized
   options have come to dominate global understandings of how to protect
   civilian populations at risk and thus shaped public and political
   imagination over what is possible and moral in the realm of protection.
   However, the imaginative dominance of these ideologically based modes of
   protection can and are being challenged through processes of aesthetic
   imaginative acts.' These acts are a form of counterpower that create
   fissures in the liberal-realist narrative and in turn enable populations
   to reconfigure political imagination to include alternative, empathetic
   responses to humanitarian crises. Analysis of one modality of aesthetic
   imaginative acts' in one case, namely musical recordings by Canadian
   artists in response to the Syrian refugee crisis, will be analyzed in
   relation to how they challenge the dominant liberal-realist imagination
   and facilitate a broader, nonviolent or empathetic imagination regarding
   protection.},

Abstract = {This article posits a competitive bacterial ecology as a framework for
   Mexican drug trafficking with a novel focus on bacterial conjugation
   (one type of horizontal gene transmission) to explain tactical
   homogenization. Individual drug traffickers consciously switch between
   Mexican organized crime groups sometimes three and four times, much like
   individual bacteria exchange their DNA in a horizontal genetic transfer
   that allows rapid evolution and resilience. Bacterial conjugation is a
   useful amplifying variable for understanding the homogenization of
   violence and this article probes its plausibility by providing examples
   of traffickers switching groups and taking tactics with them. Drawing on
   examples of traffickers and cells from the Arellano Felix Organization,
   the Sinaloa Cartel, Cartel de Jalisco Nueva Generacion, the Viagras,
   Zetas, and the Gulf Cartels, this article traces the genealogy of
   violent tactics, techniques, and procedures such as dissolving bodies in
   acid, asphyxiation, and infantry tactics, through individual traffickers
   into new groups drawn generally in the direction of more powerful,
   proximate, and similar trafficking groups.},

Abstract = {Unity among a rebel movement is associated with positive returns, yet
   rebel groups often fail to come together and even fall into fratricide
   infighting. Focusing on a rebel field in which one group enjoys primacy,
   I present three pathways that are likely to produce rebel fratricide:
   first, power shifts within the rebel movement; second, spillover from
   internal conflict within the dominant group; and third, disagreements
   over targeting noncombatants. I explore the role these mechanisms played
   in fratricidal violence among the Islamist opposition in Algeria during
   the 1990s civil war.},

Abstract = {As a counterterrorism officer of thirty years, I have a healthy respect
   for history. Yet I also know that hindsight changes what you think about
   what you once thought. My observations about terrorism trends and
   counterterrorism strategies over the years are not what they once were.
   What I think now is more aligned with how I feel, and therefore, much
   clearer. Until recently, I had always based my observations about
   national security in my experiences as a counterterrorism analyst. I
   have come to realize that the lessons I believe are the most valid are
   not a result of my career experiences but from allowing the rest of my
   life to shed light on my career.},

Abstract = {Why do some former authoritarian elites return to power after
   democratization through reelection or reappointment to political office,
   or by assuming board positions in state-owned or major private
   enterprises, whereas others do not and still others face punishment?
   This article investigates this question using an original data set on
   constitutional origins and the fate of the upper echelon of outgoing
   authoritarian elites across Latin America from 1900 to 2015. I find that
   authoritarian elites from outgoing regimes that impose a holdover
   constitution that sticks through democratization are more likely to
   regain political or economic power-especially through national positions
   where the potential payoffs are largest-and less likely to face severe
   or nominal punishment. I also find a positive role for political capital
   among former elites. These results are robust to alternative
   explanations of authoritarian elites' fate and using instrumental
   variables to address potential endogeneity. The findings have important
   implications for democratic consolidation and quality.},

Abstract = {This paper examines the process of how Crimean Tatars strived to attain
   group differentiated rights since they have returned to their homeland
   in the early 1990s. Whereas the politics of minority rights were viewed
   through security lens in earlier literature, we emphasize the
   significance of cultural constructs in influencing the minority
   policies, based on qualitative content analysis of ``speech acts{''} of
   elites, and movement and policy documents. Focusing on the interaction
   of the framing processes of Crimean Tatars with the Crimean regional
   government, Ukraine, and Russia, we argue that the ``neo-Stalinist
   frame{''} has played a major role in denying the rights of Crimean
   Tatars for self-determination and preservation of their ethnic identity
   in both pre and post annexation Crimea. The Crimean Tatars
   counter-framed against neo-Stalinist frame both in the pre and
   post-annexation period by demanding their rights as ``indigenous
   people{''}. Ukraine experienced a frame transformation after the
   Euromaidan protests, by shifting from a neo-Stalinist frame into a
   ``multiculturalist frame{''}, which became evident in recognition of the
   Crimean Tatar status as indigenous people of Crimea. (C) 2019 The

Abstract = {While international relations scholars make many claims about violence,
   they rarely define the concept. This article develops a typology of
   three distinct kinds of violence: direct, indirect, and pacification.
   Direct violence occurs when a person or agent inflicts harm on another.
   Indirect violence manifests through the structures of society. We
   propose a third understanding of violence: pacification. Using a
   phenomenological methodology, and drawing on anarchist and postcolonial
   thought, we show that the violence of pacification is diffuse,
   inconspicuous, intersubjective, and structured into the fabric of
   society. This understanding of violence matters for the study of
   international relations in general and research on the liberal peace in
   particular. We argue that the spread of liberal institutions does not
   necessarily decrease violence but instead transforms it. Our
   phenomenological analysis captures empirical trends in human domination
   and suffering that liberal peace theories cannot account for. It reveals
   how a decline in direct violence may coincide with the transformation of
   violence in ways that are concealed, monopolized, and structured into
   the liberal order. We call this process liberal pacification.},

Abstract = {Environmental peacebuilding represents a paradigm shift from a nexus of
   environmental scarcity to one of environmental peace. It rests on the
   assumption that the biophysical environment's inherent characteristics
   can act as incentives for cooperation and peace, rather than violence
   and competition. Based on this, environmental peacebuilding presents
   cooperation as a win-win solution and escape from the zero-sum logic of
   conflict. However, there is a lack of coherent environmental
   peacebuilding framework and evidence corroborating the existence of this
   environment-peace nexus. Building on a multidisciplinary literature
   review, this article examines the evolution of environmental
   peacebuilding into an emerging framework. It unpacks the concept and
   explains its main building blocks (conditions, mechanisms and outcomes)
   to develop our understanding of when, how and why environmental
   cooperation can serve as a peacebuilding tool. It assembles these
   building blocks into three generic trajectories (technical, restorative
   and sustainable environmental peacebuilding), each characterised
   according to their own causality, drivers and prerequisites, and
   illustrated with concrete examples. Finally, this article draws
   attention to the remaining theoretical gaps in the environmental
   peacebuilding literature, and lays the foundations for an environmental
   peacebuilding research agenda that clarifies if and how environmental
   cooperation can spill over across borders, sectors and scales towards
   sustainable peace.},

Abstract = {There is a debate in international relations on how, when, and why
   international institutions influence domestic policy. This article
   contributes to this debate by looking at the influence of the World
   Trade Organization (WTO) on the European Union's (EU) Common
   Agricultural Policy (CAP). It shows that the transfer of authority to
   international institutions may transform an external factor into a
   permanent influence on domestic policy. The transfer of authority in
   agriculture to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT - now
   included in the WTO) in 1994 led to the introduction of a dormant clause
   on export subsidies in all subsequent EU CAP regulations. This clause
   provided the legal foundation for the 2015 EU decision to remove export
   subsidies. Multilateral pressure (i.e. the demands of third countries in
   GATT/WTO negotiations) is not the only determinant of CAP, but it is
   important, and affected by the GATT/WTO having authority on agriculture.},

Abstract = {This article analyzes an alternative perspective on the relationship
   between the USA and the concept of empire. We should note that another
   rich vein of policy dissent, the anti-imperial tradition, has long
   existed in American history. A republican tension between `empire' and
   `republic' has formed the core problematique of American political
   thought from the beginning. Furthermore, this enigma has haunted US
   politics along its trajectory, even though James Madison tried to invent
   a federalist solution to the ancient dilemma of liberty and power.
   Therefore, I will explore the lineage of the American tradition of
   anti-imperialism and its foreign policy manifestations, stretching back
   from the founding era to the contemporary world by re-reading American
   political development through the lens of republican security theory. I
   hope that such exercise will shed light on the future direction of US
   grand strategy in our age of the American hegemonic decline.},

Abstract = {The decrease of political participation in Chile since the early 90s
   lead to a discussion about political disaffection in the beginning of
   the new century. To what extent does political disaffection affect the
   decrease in political participation? Previous studies on this subject
   have been theoretical and descriptive and have only linked disaffection
   to the electoral participation. This study argues that higher levels of
   political disaffection are associated to less conventional and
   unconventional political participation. To demonstrate this the
   Auditoria a la Democracia (2010) survey is used to perform statistical
   analyzes of political disaffection on different types of political
   behavior. Results show that political disaffection is a compound and
   internally coherent concept, consisting of attitudes of distrust towards
   political actors and institutions, no interest in politics, internal and
   external inefficacy, and democracy dissatisfaction. Regression analyses,
   using participation rates as a dependent variable, also conclude that
   disaffection has a negative effect on both dimensions of political
   participation.},

Abstract = {Attaining durable peace (DP) after a civil war has proven to be a major
   challenge, as many negotiated agreements lapse into violence. How can
   negotiations to terminate civil wars be conducted and peace agreements
   formulated to contribute to lasting peace? This question is addressed in
   this study with a novel data set. Focusing on justice, we assess
   relationships between process (procedural justice {[}PJ]) and outcome
   (distributive justice {[}DJ]) justice on the one hand and stable
   agreements (SA) and DP on the other. Analyses of fifty peace agreements,
   which were reached from 1957 to 2008, showed a path from PJ to DJ to SA
   to DP: The justice variables were instrumental in enhancing both short-
   and long-term peace. These variables had a stronger impact on DP than a
   variety of contextual- and case-related factors. The empirical link
   between justice and peace has implications for the way that peace
   negotiations are structured.},

Abstract = {This project examines long-term viability of former rebel parties in
   postconflict elections following negotiated settlements. Building on a
   growing literature examining the environmental and organizational
   factors affecting insurgent-to-party transformations and emergence, this
   project asks why some insurgent organizations remain politically viable
   as party labels in postsettlement environments while others do not,
   despite facing similar costs of entry. I propose that revenues from
   foreign patrons provide political opportunities to desperate rebel
   groups, easing their transition into viable political parties. However,
   I also propose that the connection between foreign sponsorship and rebel
   party development is not ironclad. Utilizing the principal-agent model
   and the two-level game, this piece argues that the political development
   of rebel clients may be constrained by the rational and institutional
   pressures that potential foreign patrons face. Using binary logit models
   and marginal effects postestimation, this piece finds that rebel parties
   with authoritarian patrons are more likely to regularly participate in
   national elections and accumulate governing power.},

Abstract = {The notion of open government has been established in representative
   democracies since the 70s of the XXst century. However, the greater
   access to public and political information by civil society has been
   applied asymmetrically, placing great emphasis on the legal framework
   but little on the moral framework. This study aims to analyse the
   conception of open government and its main problems from a political and
   philosophical point of view. Among these we highlight some
   contradictions in the laws of transparency in the Spanish and European
   panorama; the type of information that is transmitted; and the
   conception of civil society that should promote a greater culture of
   transparency in an ethical sense.},

Abstract = {Social role theory provides a framework to help understand the
   complexity of gender in the political sphere. We demonstrate how SRT
   both helps to explain extant research findings and to generate future
   research that will help explain the complicated ways in which gender
   shapes U.S. politics. This article considers two broad categories of
   behavior: the gendered opinions and engagement of the citizenry and the
   gendered evaluations of political actors by elites and voters. Within
   each category, we propose moving beyond the male-female binary and
   consider the effects of gender in conjunction with other key political
   identities, such as race, ethnicity, age, as well as examining the
   effects of (dis)ability, and class. As well, our work demonstrates how
   masculinity encompasses the U.S. political system and serves as a
   backdrop in front of which gender roles shape political behavior, and
   role incongruity can lead to prejudice. This project lays the groundwork
   for future work to apply theories from psychology to a gendered analysis
   of U.S. politics. Through a better understanding of sex, gender, and
   their combined effects with race and other intersectional identities, we
   contribute to a broader goal of creating a more inclusive U.S. politics.},

Abstract = {Corporate climate leadership and its relationship with state regulations
   are discussed. First, a typology defining corporate climate leadership
   is introduced and distinguished from the other strategic behaviours
   corporations may adopt in response to climate change. A conceptual
   framework to explore the mechanisms enabling corporate climate
   leadership within a given policy system is then presented. This
   framework is applied to two big Swiss food retailers, considered as
   typical of corporate climate leaders, firms that showed an early
   interest in climate protection, as a result of ecological values, third
   actors' lobbying and particular market incentives. Most importantly, the
   two companies were set in motion by a regulatory framework that featured
   stringent policy goals associated with flexible instruments and economic
   sanctions. The importance of these findings for understanding the role
   of corporate leadership in polycentric climate governance is discussed.},

Abstract = {The reconfigured agrarian structure imposed new production and
   commoditisation patterns across the settlement types in Zimbabwe. From
   2000, new markets were established, with differentiated effects on
   capital accumulation for different sets of farmers. After the Fast Track
   Land Reform programme, the impact of the economy-wide challenges,
   climate change, capital and global geo-politics on the agrarian economy
   remain relatively unexplored. Using a case study of Hwedza District,
   this article reveals the changing agrarian relations beyond the trimodal
   agrarian structure, showing that smallholder farmers have significantly
   relied on reinvestment of agricultural sales proceeds rather than
   contract farming. Farmers exit the contract farming arrangements citing
   their exploitative nature. The article contributes to the debate on
   Zimbabwe's agrarian and political transition.},

Abstract = {Although it is widely accepted that inter-local agreements can enhance
   municipal governments' capacity to provide complex services, there is
   little evidence in the Latin American case to explain why municipalities
   decide to collaborate with each other. What propels municipal
   governments to collaborate? Using data from Chilean government this
   paper identifies and analyzes the determinants of inter-local
   collaboration to address environmental issues. Five logit models are
   used for the empirical analysis. The results show that this form of
   cooperation is determined by poverty, population size, municipal fiscal
   capacity, and the degree of urbanization of local communities.},

Abstract = {While the number of American jihadi terrorist attacks remains relatively
   rare, terrorist plots thwarted by law enforcement have increased since
   September 11, 2001. Although these law enforcement blocks of would-be
   terrorists are considered counterterrorism triumphs by the FBI, human
   rights and civil liberty watch groups have conversely suggested that
   those who plan for attacks alongside government informants and
   undercover agents may be unique and essentially dissimilar from
   terrorists. Underlying this debate is the empirical question of how
   planned yet unsuccessful attacks and their plotters compare to
   successful terrorist homicides and their perpetrators. The current study
   addresses this question by comparatively examining jihadi terrorist
   homicides and unsuccessful plots occurring in part or wholly on U.S.
   soil between 1990 and 2014. Data for this study come from the U.S.
   Extremist Crime Database (ECDB), an open-source database with
   information on terrorism and extremist crimes. Based on these data,
   descriptive statistics are provided for several incident, offender, and
   target variables across three jihadi terrorist violence categories,
   including homicides, plots with specified targets, and plots with
   non-specific targets. We find several important differences across
   categories of terrorist violence, suggesting that unsuccessful plotters
   and their intended crimes vary from their more successful terrorist
   counterparts.},

Abstract = {In contrast to the expansive literature on military casualties and
   support for war, we know very little about public reactions to foreign
   civilian casualties. This article, based on representative sample
   surveys in the United States and Britain, reports four survey
   experiments weaving information about civilian casualties into vignettes
   about Western military action. These produce consistent evidence of
   civilian casualty aversion: where death tolls were higher, support for
   force was invariably and significantly lower. Casualty effects were
   moderate in size but robust across our two cases and across different
   scenarios. They were also strikingly resistant to moderation by other
   factors manipulated in the experiments, such as the framing of
   casualties or their religious affiliation. The importance of numbers
   over even strongly humanizing frames points toward a utilitarian rather
   than a social psychological model of casualty aversion. Either way,
   civilian casualties deserve a more prominent place in the literature on
   public support for war.},

Title = {From power-blind binaries to the intersectionality of peace: connecting
   feminism and critical peace and conflict studies},
Journal = {PEACEBUILDING},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {7},
Number = {2, SI},
Pages = {160-177},
Abstract = {Critical Peace and Conflict Studies scholars have increasingly sought to
   overcome binary approaches to engage more fully the ways in which
   peacebuilding missions are designed, implemented and contested. In doing
   so, scholars have tried to understand `the local' and mobilised three
   different concepts to do so - hybridity, the everyday and narratives.
   However, this shift has failed to translate into fully convincing
   research transcending the old binaries of `international' and `local'.
   The use of the `everyday' sees power everywhere, hybridity approaches
   fall into the same binary trap scholars want to avoid in the first
   place, and narrative approaches tend to focus on very personal stories,
   removing structural power from the equation. We suggest that a fruitful
   interaction with Feminist approaches and methodologies, and especially
   the scholarship on intersectionality, can help shed a new light on the
   power imbalances and inequalities within peacebuilding missions. We
   highlight the possible contribution of the concept of intersectionality
   to Critical Peace and Conflict Studies through an intersectionality of
   peace approach, which allows for a better understanding of multiple and
   complex identities of researchers and researchees. We illustrate this
   argument through a discussion of intersectional narratives centred
   around the space of the `guesthouse' of South Africa.},

Abstract = {The doctrine of self-determination has been problematic because of the
   difficulties in specifying the subject, which is classically the nation
   or people and the object, which is traditionally a territorially
   delimited sovereign state. Modern understandings in some ways make the
   problem more difficult. It is widely accepted that the nation is
   socially constructed and contested. The state is undergoing
   transformations and can no longer easily be defined. Territory is also
   seen as socially constructed and as much of a sociological as a
   topological concept. Yet these new understandings also open up new
   perspectives and ways to reconciling nation, state and territory.
   Post-sovereign perspectives provide new ways of framing the
   relationships. Yet, in spite of its elusive nature, claims to
   sovereignty recur. This is because nationality claims are ontological as
   well as normative and the surest way of demonstrating that a people is a
   nation is to assert its sovereignty.},

   practices of the UN Peacebuilding Commission (PBC) in Guinea-Bissau,
   with the aim of rethinking the concept of Peace consolidation that
   arises from the acts of the Commission. The essential argument is that
   the PBC, by assuming the universal validity of the liberal peace
   paradigm, fails to adequately consider the local historical, political
   and socioeconomic conditions. By noting the poor fit between the PBC
   approach and the local reality, this study expands the debate on the
   role of the PBC in scenarios following the contemporary conflicts.},

Journal = {CONTEMPORARY SECURITY POLICY},

Volume = {40},
Number = {1},
Pages = {38-55},
Abstract = {Recent scholarship in security studies has started to explore the causes
   and consequences of various forms of national restrictions in
   multinational military operations (MMOs). This article makes a
   conceptual contribution to this literature by developing a theoretical
   framework of national restrictions in MMOs that distinguishes between
   structural, procedural, and operational restrictions. I argue that these
   types of restrictions are governed by different causal mechanisms.
   Structural restrictions are relatively stable over time and effect
   deployment decisions irrespective of other factors. Procedural
   restrictions, on the other hand, can constitute veto points against
   deployment only in combination with distinct political preferences.
   Finally, operational restrictions directly affect the rules of
   engagement of troop contributing countries. The article illustrates the
   three types of restrictions and their interaction with empirical
   examples from a range of countries and sketches their impact on MMO
   deployment decisions and mandates.},

Pages = {241-260},
Abstract = {Affect and identity are often recognized as important considerations in
   critical policy studies. But because these notions lack materiality, it
   is not observably obvious how they function in policy discourse. Their
   function can be understood by adopting the concept of narrative
   subscription. This conceptualization raises the prominence of narrative,
   treating it as the key observable feature of a policy discourse.
   Narratives are made resonant, coherent, and worthy of one's allegiance
   by the concepts, values, emotions, and symbolic connotations
   (ideographs) embedded in their story lines. Narrative subscription is
   not necessarily permanent; one can cancel one's subscription, so to
   speak. Context can shift attachments and identifications, possibly (but
   not necessarily) leading to shifts in narrative subscription. Narratives
   are thus conspicuous vehicles in the political struggle for dominance in
   a policy discourse. Policy discourse is not merely a matter of rational
   argumentation, but understanding its dynamics entails more than the
   simple addition of values and feelings into the mix. Identification with
   a narrative depends on a shared normative understanding within a
   community or referent group. To understand narrative subscription is to
   understand the psycho-social origins of discursive power.},

Abstract = {Public frontline employees are increasingly exposed to performance
   information, and their acceptance of this information as a valid,
   legitimate, and useful foundation for decision-making is central to the
   success of performance management systems. However, despite this, we
   know very little about what affects frontline employees acceptance or
   disapproval of performance information as well as their willingness to
   take causal responsibility for the information. We contribute to filling
   this gap by developing hypotheses claiming that frontline employees are
   more likely to accept and take causal responsibility for performance
   information when their organization is doing well on the performance
   indicators. Using a survey experiment including 1,988 public high-school
   teachers from 121 organizations, we offer evidence to support our
   hypotheses. The implication of our argument and results is an ironic
   problem: performance information has the least credibility as a
   management tool, among frontline employees, in poorly performing
   organizations.},

Abstract = {This paper offers an analysis of the relation between political populism
   and mass media, and how this relation becomes problematic for democratic
   societies. It focuses on the fact that mass media, due to their purpose
   and infrastructure, can unintentionally reinforce populist messages.
   Research findings from communication science and political psychology
   are used to illustrate how, for example, a combination of mass media
   agenda setting and motivated reasoning can influence citizens' political
   decisions and impair their political autonomy. This poses a particular
   normative challenge for modern democracies: how to counter these
   populism-supporting effects within the constraints of democratic
   legitimacy? After showing how severely limited legal measures to curb
   populist media effects would be, the paper argues in favour of media
   competence education as a way of providing future citizens with an
   epistemic toolkit to navigate the media environment and strengthen their
   political autonomy.},

Abstract = {For many public organisations, boards are the primary accountability
   mechanisms for management. Boards have a multipronged portfolio:
   strategic advice, employment, external linkage and critical scrutiny.
   The literature casts serious doubts about their capabilities. There is
   `managerial dominance'. This article reviews existing studies on public
   sector boards and identifies important reasons why boards are likely to
   fail as accountability mechanisms. This sets the stage for a new
   research agenda. When are boards more effective on the micro-level? How
   to organise effective checks and balances around organisations? And why
   has the board-model become so popular: is this learning or
   blame-shifting?},

Abstract = {Evaluation of the growth model of the PT governments based on the
   contributions of Celso Furtado reveals that the recent growth cycle has
   alleviated the typical characteristics of underdevelopment by developing
   a mass consumption market and improving labor market conditions.
   However, the limitations of the model prevented modernizing the
   structure of production to sustain changes on the demand side, including
   labor in sectors with higher productivity, limiting the control of
   foreign subsidiaries, and reducing the structural vulnerability inherent
   in specialization in basic commodities exports. The limits of the model
   were aggravated by the crisis of 2008-2009, revealing the difficulty of
   incorporating a peripheral economy like the Brazilian into global
   capitalism. Uma avaliacao do modelo de crescimento dos governos do PT a
   partir da contribuicao de Celso Furtado revela que o ciclo de
   crescimento recente amenizou caracteristicas tipicas do
   subdesenvolvimento ao desenvolver um mercado de consumo de massa no
   Brasil e ao melhorar as condicoes no mercado de trabalho. No entanto, as
   limitacoes do modelo nao permitiram modernizar a estrutura produtiva de
   forma a sustentar as transformacoes do lado da demanda, incluir a mao de
   obra em setores de maior produtividade, limitar o controle das filiais
   estrangeiras, e diminuir a vulnerabilidade estrutural inerente a
   especializacao em exportacoes de commodities basicas. Os limites do
   modelo de desenvolvimento adotado se agravaram apos a crise de
   2008-2009, revelando as dificuldades de insercao de uma economia
   periferica como a brasileira no capitalismo global.},

Volume = {57},

Abstract = {Why do the first multiparty elections after authoritarian rule turn
   violent in some countries but not in others? This article places
   legacies from the authoritarian past at the core of an explanation of
   when democratic openings become associated with electoral violence in
   multi-ethnic states, and complement existing research focused on the
   immediate conditions surrounding the elections. We argue that
   authoritarian rule characterized by more exclusionary multi-ethnic
   coalitions creates legacies that amplify the risk of violent elections
   during the shift to multiparty politics. Through competitive and
   fragmented interethnic relations, exclusionary systems foreclose the
   forging of cross-ethnic elite coalitions and make hostile narratives a
   powerful tool for political mobilization. By contrast, regimes with a
   broad-based ethnic support base cultivate inclusive inter-elite
   bargaining, enable cross-ethnic coalitions, and reduce incentives for
   hostile ethnic mobilization, which lower the risk of violent elections.
   We explore this argument by comparing founding elections in Zambia
   (1991), which were largely peaceful, and Kenya (1992), with large-scale
   state-instigated electoral violence along ethnic lines. The analysis
   suggests that the type of authoritarian rule created political legacies
   that underpinned political competition and mobilization during the first
   multiparty elections, and made violence a more viable electoral strategy
   in Kenya than in Zambia.},

Abstract = {The objective of this research is to explore national institutional
   arrangements for Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), describe the
   roles of different stakeholders in SDG implementation, and identify
   where gaps may lie at national and regional level. This paper analysed
   initiatives taken by seven South Asian countries towards implementing
   the health-related SDGs thus far. The analysis for the paper is based on
   the findings of a research project on `Research Institutions and the
   Health SDGs: Building Momentum in South Asia' conducted in seven South
   Asian countries led by Sustainable Development Policy Institute (SDPI),
   Pakistan and study conducted by country research teams in Afghanistan,
   Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Nepal, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka. The extent to
   which SDGs have been localized and implemented varies across the South
   Asian countries. While, Bangladesh and Bhutan have initiated the
   adoption of SDGs with development plans and programs, others have
   established national level institutional structures and coordination
   channels. An overarching concern is inadequate ownership of the SDGs by
   the sub-national governments for implementation and coordination. The
   level of engagement of non-state stakeholders such as non-governmental
   organizations (NGOs), civil society, think tanks, research institutes,
   academia, and media, however, varies across countries. This engagement
   ranges from raising awareness, to consultations, membership in
   committees, and planning and policymaking.},

Abstract = {This study uses the case of Holocaust Day in Israel to examine the
   premise that national days impact national identity and collective
   memory. Specifically, the study examines whether a very unique type of
   national day-Holocaust Day-impacts national identification, nationalism,
   and collective memory in the form of Israeli Jews' perceptions of the
   ``lessons{''} of the Holocaust. This study uses panel survey design data
   on national identity and perceptions of the Holocaust's lessons from the
   same sample of Israeli Jews (N = 665) collected two months prior to
   Holocaust Day and again during and after Holocaust Day. During and after
   Holocaust Day, respondents expressed increased levels of nationalism and
   more perceptions of both particularistic and universalistic Holocaust
   lessons. Participation in Holocaust Day practices had a stronger
   relationship with nationalism and national identification during
   Holocaust Day than before but a weaker relationship with the perception
   of a universalistic lesson during Holocaust Day. These findings indicate
   that Holocaust Day impacts national identity and collective memory and
   highlights the multifaceted nature of the relationships between national
   identity, collective memory, and national days. The theoretical
   implication of the findings as well as the case comparability are
   discussed in light of the findings.},

Title = {Technological Distribution in Uganda: Information and Communications
   Technology and the State in an Eastern African Nation},
Journal = {REVIEW OF POLICY RESEARCH},
Year = {2019},
Month = {2019 DEC 1},
Abstract = {Information and communications technologies (ICTs) include old
   technologies-such as the radio and the television-as well as newer
   technologies-such as the Internet and wireless telephony. This study
   considers the process that the government of Uganda has used to adopt
   and implement ICT policy. This study also considers the techniques which
   the government of Uganda has used to distribute ICTS in public locations
   such as government offices, schools, and hospitals. In particular, this
   study attempts to consider the political motivations for distribution.
   The Ugandan government's attempt to distribute this technology reflects
   strengths in the area of distribution of artefacts, particularly to
   rural areas. Information and communications technologies are an
   important part of the Ugandan economy. In addition, ICTs strengthen the
   ability of citizens to communicate with each other across regional and
   language borders through shared access points. Methodologically, this
   paper uses the case study method. Semi-structured interviews were
   conducted with politicians, policy makers, civil society activists,
   citizens, academics, medical personnel, regional government officials,
   and business people. This paper argues that politicians use ICTs as a
   component of a basket of goods and services that they can distribute to
   witnessing publics. This paper argues that ICT should be viewed as a
   type of infrastructure, and that as a public good, it can be used as a
   ``club{''} good or ``pork.{''} Although several authors discuss the
   potential of ICTs as democratizing, this paper documents that the
   Ugandan government has employed ICTs in oppressive ways, including for
   the surveillance of opposition leaders, and for social control.},

Abstract = {Two burning academic and policy questions in the study of Latin American
   and Caribbean- China ties relate to the effects of China's rising trade,
   investment and financial presence on Latin American and Caribbean (LAC)
   country foreign and domestic policies. In this article, we study the
   case of Ecuador, focusing on Rafael Correa's administration (2007-2016),
   as a way to delve into these issues. As conventional wisdom about the
   power of economics suggests, we find that Ecuador's foreign and domestic
   policies have inclined towards China and Chinese companies. However,
   this was not solely because of China's economic allure. Ecuador's stance
   also has something to do with the fact that better ties with China and
   receptivity to Chinese foreign direct investment (FDI) flows fit the
   government's international economic and political agenda. Moreover, they
   also conformed to the social agenda of Ecuadorian leaders, which made it
   even more logical to pursue warm ties with Beijing and create an open
   door for Chinese outward FDI (OFDI). As for Correa specifically, his
   regime sought to bring in Chinese OFDI as a means to promote a new
   growth model as well as his development philosophy Buen Vivir.},

Abstract = {While existing literature on collective trauma in international
   relations represents a vital (albeit inchoate) contribution to the
   field, to date, it has largely analyzed collective trauma's impact as
   primarily psychological and sociocultural. This essay argues that a
   complete vision of collective trauma in IR must incorporate not only
   these more intangible dimensions but also how its legacy is reified
   materially over time in economic conditions-distinguishing the trauma of
   those with the resources to ``work through{''} and those without. I
   begin this essay with a novel conception of collective trauma that draws
   upon existing traditions' insights but also facilitates mediation
   between collective trauma's material and sociocultural dimensions.
   Employing this definition, I then outline three analytical frameworks
   via which future scholarship can address collective trauma in
   international economic relations. First, scholarship can incorporate a
   notion of the trauma of poverty. Second, scholars can analyze the loss
   of economic opportunity that trauma entails as akin to Dominick
   LaCapra's concept of structural trauma of absence. Finally, scholarship
   can examine collective trauma's ability to break down trust in
   institutions and the impact this breakdown has on international economic
   relations.},

Abstract = {Polling stations are at the fulcrum of the democratic process. They are
   the location where most voters exercise their democratic rights, but
   also one place where electoral fraud and irregularities may occur, both
   in consolidating and established democracies. This study provides a
   detailed analysis of the nature and frequency of electoral
   irregularities that are found in English local elections using original
   surveys of poll workers in 2018 and 2019 (n = 5659). It also identifies
   the effects of recent attempts to improve electoral integrity through
   the introduction of voter identification requirements on a pilot basis.
   Elections are found to be broadly well run but problems are reported
   with names missing from the electoral register and polling station
   accessibility requirements. Some more infrequent problems were reported
   with inappropriate behaviour from party agents/candidate - and some
   gender-based intimidation amongst voters. Attempted impersonation was
   exceptionally rare, however, and measures to introduce voter
   identification requirements therefore had little effect on the security
   of the electoral process. In fact, they led to some voters not casting
   their ballot, either for reasons of convenience and availability of
   suitable forms of ID, or reasons of principle and protest. There are
   therefore important implications for the wider literature on electoral
   integrity and the design of democratic practices.},

Abstract = {On 31 March 2019 Turkish voters ended the Islamist local governance in
   the country's largest cities after 25 years and handed the ruling AKP
   its most serious electoral defeat since its rise to power in 2002. The
   article explores the electoral strategies of major parties in the local
   election, offers a comparative analysis of the results, and discusses
   post-election developments, including the rerun in Istanbul. The
   election and its aftermath reaffirmed the competitive authoritarian
   nature of the regime, as the governing bloc enjoyed an uneven playing
   field, while the opposition had to meet a higher electoral bar than the
   incumbents to win. The economic crisis, growing discontent with the
   government's policies, and effective coordination of opposition parties
   facilitated this outcome.},

Abstract = {Who blames whom in multilevel blame games? Existing research focuses
   either on policymakers' preferences or their opportunities offered by
   the institutional structures in which policymakers operate. As these two
   strands of literature barely refer to each other, in this article we
   develop an integrated theoretical model of blame-shifting in multilevel
   governance systems and assess it empirically. In line with the first
   strand, we assume that policymakers have a preference for shifting blame
   onto actors on a different level from themselves. In line with the
   second, we suppose that opportunities for doing so depend on
   institutional responsibility for policymaking and policy implementation.
   We check the plausibility of our integrated model by examining
   policymakers' blame attributions in three cases where European Union
   migration policies have been contested: border control, asylum, and
   welfare entitlements. We find that our integrated model does better in
   explaining blame-shifting in these cases than the isolated models.},

Abstract = {This article investigates, through the theory of social construction and
   policy design, the feedforward effects of labeling on policy conflicts.
   It argues that such conflicts escalate when policymakers distinguish
   between more and less deserving and more and less powerful segments of
   the population. It draws on the empirical analysis of 32 narrative
   interviews with vital stakeholders in the conflict over the contested
   multibillion-euro Oosterweelconnection highway in Antwerp (Belgium), as
   well as on the media analysis of 739 articles. According to such
   analyses, Flemish policymakers became increasingly hostile toward action
   groups as the latter moved beyond conventional policy-making procedure,
   labeling them as a powerful but undeserving ``vocal minority.{''}
   Meanwhile, they endorsed the Oosterweel policy, claiming that it
   represented an increasingly powerless but deserving ``silent
   majority.{''} However, labeling action groups as powerful but
   undeserving and consequently dismissing them resulted in the escalation
   of a substantive policy conflict to a relational policy conflict, which
   became increasingly difficult to settle as parties fought each other
   rather than fighting over policies.},

Abstract = {The literature on de facto states challenges the conventional
   identification of states by legal recognition, proposing to identify
   states based on their effectiveness instead. Yet, as I argue in this
   paper, rather than turning the tables on recognition, the de facto state
   challenge ultimately reveals all state identification in International
   Relations and international law to be essentially indeterminate. This
   lacuna, I suggest, is not an accidental omission, but an expression of
   the foundational paradox of modern political order that is rooted in the
   intertwined ontology of the state system and the individual states
   constituting it, with each presupposing the other. As a result, the
   opposition between empirical facts, political decisions, and legal norms
   invoked in attempts to identify states cannot but remain irresolvable.
   This should not be regarded as a problem to be overcome, however, but as
   a source of social order. Although states cannot be substantively
   identified, any effort to do so in practice naturalizes the state as the
   very form through which we articulate and shape political claims,
   conflicts, and settlements. In performatively enacting states precisely
   at the contested margins, state identification thus both invokes and
   (re-)produces the statist international as the central imaginary of
   modern political order.},

Abstract = {The Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) appeared at its
   inception to be a Beijing-led multilateral development bank that is
   focused on the financing of mega infrastructure projects. The role for
   meaningful participation by offshore financial centers such as Hong Kong
   and Singapore was less defined. This article maps the growing role and
   influence of these two city-states within the ongoing development of the
   AIIB. It analyzes the respective and distinct motivations of Hong Kong
   and Singapore as members in the AIIB, and assesses how each city is
   positioning itself to make unique contributions to the new multilateral
   development bank.},

Abstract = {Nonviolent movements are more successful when mobilizing large and
   diverse numbers of participants. However, while there has been
   considerable research on the outcomes of nonviolent campaigns, far less
   is known about the initial emergence of nonviolent action. A growing
   literature suggests ethnic divisions may undermine the ability of
   activists to engage in mass nonviolent mobilization across diverse
   social lines. Yet many large and diverse nonviolent movements have
   successfully emerged in various ethnically divided societies across the
   world. I argue that nonviolent mobilization is made possible in
   ethnically polarized contexts when broader cross-cutting grievances are
   present as they enable local activists to widen their appeal across
   social lines. I focus on food price spikes as an example of a
   cross-cutting issue that is likely to affect consumers from different
   ethnic groups. The unique and symbolic nature of food price spikes
   facilitates nonviolent mobilization across ethnic lines and provides
   clear short-term incentives for many people to participate in protests
   against the government. Using new spatially disaggregated data on
   government targeted nonviolent action, I analyse grid-cell years across
   41 African countries (1990-2008). I find strong evidence that food price
   spikes increase the likelihood of nonviolent action in politically
   excluded and ethnically diverse locations.},

Abstract = {Migration is arguably the single most salient issue in in Western
   democracies today. Anti-immigrant attitudes have fueled the rise of
   right-wing populist parties, have proved decisive in swaying a slim
   margin of the British public to support Brexit and have catalyzed
   delicate democracies down authoritarian tracks. We contend that because
   of predominant identity and security concerns, the free movement of
   people has never become a key element of the contemporary global order
   despite its qualifying, liberal credentials. Even in the European Union
   (EU), the integration of migration policy has remained fragmented and
   differentiated. These omissions are taking their toll as they generate
   friction between domestic and supranational goals, and as global
   problems - like the recent refugee crisis - lack `global' or unified
   solutions. Migration has turned from an orphan of the global order to
   one of its primary challengers.},

Abstract = {This article explores why the European Union (EU)'s promotion of
   Russia's market liberalization has failed to generate the desired
   outcome. It takes as its starting point the Russian annexation of
   Crimea, and the question of whether the political rupture in 2014
   constitutes a watershed in the EU-Russian trade and energy relationship.
   The sanctions targeting Russia for its actions in Ukraine, and the
   Russian counter-embargo, constrain the room for manoeuvre of businesses,
   but have not resulted in a decisive shift in the EU-Russian trade and
   energy relationship. The article finds that very limited progress had
   been made on key contentious issues throughout the decade preceding the
   breakdown of their political relations. Rather, the main shift took
   place with Russia's accession to the World Trade Organization in 2012,
   which provided the EU with tools of compellence. The EU's market
   policies have achieved very little resonance in Russia of their own
   accord.},

Abstract = {Student mock elections are conducted in schools around the world in an
   effort to increase political interest and efficacy among students. There
   is, however, a lack of research on whether mock elections in schools
   enhance voter turnout in real elections. In this article, we examine
   whether the propensity to vote in Swedish elections is higher among
   young people who have previously experienced a student mock election.
   The analysis is based on unique administrative population-wide data on
   turnout in the Swedish 2010 parliamentary election and the 2009 European
   Parliament election. Our results show that having experienced a mock
   election as a student does not increase the likelihood of voting in
   subsequent real elections. This result holds when we study both short-
   and long-term effects, and when we divide our sample into different
   parts depending on their socio-economic status and study each part
   separately.},

Title = {Shaping China's rise: the reordering of US alliances and defence

Abstract = {The US-led system of alliances and defence partnerships in East Asia has
   undergone profound change since the end of the Cold War. The so-called
   ``hub-and-spokes{''} system of bilateral alliances has been gradually
   supplemented by a ``networked security architecture{''}-a network of
   interwoven bilateral, minilateral and multilateral defence arrangements
   between the US and its regional allies and partners, in which China is
   also included through a variety of cooperation channels. This paper
   shows that, from Washington's perspective, the networked security
   architecture is not merely a means to externally balance a revisionist
   China, as Structural Realist analyses contend. Rather, the US has sought
   to broaden the composition of the US-led hegemonic order in East Asia by
   diversifying the range of defence ties with and amongst its allies and
   partners, but also by seeking to include the PRC in it. Thereby,
   Washington aims to channel and shape the trajectory of China's rise
   within the US-led hegemonic order, from a position of pre-eminence,
   through a mixture of negative and positive incentives (resistance and
   accommodation) with the ultimate goal of upholding the existing
   hegemonic order. To empirically substantiate this argument, the paper
   relies on a large body of elite interviews with senior US policymakers.},

Abstract = {Empirical studies analyzing the push factors of expat jihadism are
   scarce and typically give contradictory results. We hypothesize that
   youth unemployment, as opposed to overall unemployment, is a significant
   determinant of foreign fighters flow to join the Islamic State.
   Moreover, we also consider the interaction between youth unemployment
   and the Muslim population share as another meaningful variables
   affecting expat jihadism. Controlling for several variables including
   gross domestic product per capita; Gini; geographical proximity; the
   share of manufactures and services as a percentage of Gross Domestic
   Product; Polity score; and fractionalization, we provide strong evidence
   for the hypothesis that Muslim youth unemployment is a driver of expat
   jihadism not only for Muslim-majority countries, but globally.},

Abstract = {The aim of this article is to analyse the position of the Court of
   Justice of the EU with regard to the conflicts of sovereignty that
   emerged during and in the aftermath of the EMU crisis. The economic and
   financial crisis increased legal integration and therefore led to more
   rule of law. This context opened the possibility for plaintiffs to call
   upon the CJEU. The aim of this article is to analyse the Court rulings
   on this matter since the beginning of the economic and financial crisis
   in 2008: does the Court defend supranational sovereignty or does it take
   national sovereignty concerns into account? To what extent do the
   Court?s rulings reflect parliamentary and popular sovereignty? Based on
   a conceptual framework combining a legal and a political science
   approach, the aim is to analyse which type of sovereignty the Court
   defends and when.},

Abstract = {In the past decade, policymakers have increasingly used behaviourally
   informed policies, including nudges,' to produce desirable social
   outcomes. But do people actually endorse those policies? This study
   reports on nationally representative surveys in five countries (Belgium,
   Denmark, Germany, South Korea, and the US) carried out in 2017/2018. We
   investigate whether people in these countries approve of a list of 15
   nudges regarding health, the environment, and safety issues. A
   particular focus is whether trust in public institutions is a potential
   mediator of approval. The study confirms this correlation. We also find
   strong majority support of all nudges in the five countries. Our
   findings in general, and about trust in particular, suggest the
   importance not only of ensuring that behaviourally informed policies are
   effective, but also of developing them transparently and openly, and
   with an opportunity for members of the public to engage and to express
   their concerns.},

Abstract = {This article examines what factors cause states to withdraw from foreign
   territorial interventions. Scholarly analyses of withdrawal are rare,
   whilst within the broader research area of territorial conflict, studies
   are often dichotomized into neorealist or constructivist-inspired works,
   emphasizing a select few variables and one level of analysis alone. We
   argue these excessive simplifications of international politics lack
   utility for understanding territorial withdrawal. Instead, we employ the
   principles of strategic theory informed by a Clausewitzian paradigm, and
   construct a framework of three ``arenas of bargaining,{''} spanning
   multiple variable-types and levels of analysis, to explain territorial
   withdrawal. In so doing, the analysis delineates a comprehensible and
   novel theoretical framework for understanding an under-researched policy
   problem.},

Abstract = {A number of high profile crises and disasters have driven the EU to
   increase cooperation among its member states in the area of civil
   protection and to enhance its capacity to conduct civil protection
   operations in Europe and around the world. However, in the light of
   recent transboundary crises in the EU, manifested by the refugee crisis,
   terrorist attacks, and natural disasters, it is far from clear how
   effective such cooperative EU arrangements can be due to differences in
   the way national civil protection has been organized and due to the
   question of whether sufficient trust exists within and between the
   involved organizations. In this article, drawing from a unique study of
   civil protection agencies in 17 EU member states, and utilizing theories
   on crisis management, public administration and trust, we shed light on
   the factors that promote national and EU-level effectiveness in civil
   protection and crisis management.},

Abstract = {With the rise of the self-proclaimed Islamic State of Iraq and Syria
   (ISIS), the phenomenon of foreign fighters became a significant security
   concern. Governments around the world have become preoccupied with the
   possibility of their citizens leaving for combat zones and then coming
   back with training and experience. While previously foreign fighters
   participated in such conflicts as Afghanistan, Bosnia, or Chechnya,
   today ISIS has attracted record numbers of individuals from various
   backgrounds. This article examines factors that might be connected with
   the outflow of foreign fighters to Syria and Iraq. The analysis is based
   on 190 countries with 103 of them serving as countries of origin for
   33,815 foreign fighters. Negative binomial regression is used to
   evaluate the connection of political, economic, demographic, and social
   factors to numbers of foreign fighters. The findings indicate that more
   foreign fighters come from countries with higher Human Development Index
   levels, unemployment rates, percentages of youth, population size,
   percentages of Muslim population, emigration levels, Internet
   penetration, and the presence of Al Qaeda cells. However, the findings
   further indicate that the effect of these variables is not uniform
   across majority Muslim and majority non-Muslim countries.},

Title = {On Legitimacy Crises and the Resources of Global Governance
   Institutions: A Surprisingly Weak Relationship?},
Journal = {GLOBAL POLICY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {10},
Number = {3},
Pages = {313-326},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {While scholars commonly assume that Global Governance Institutions
   (GGIs) need legitimacy to perform effectively, there are few systematic
   empirical studies assessing the consequences of legitimacy (or the lack
   thereof) for the functioning of GGIs. Inspired by the new
   institutionalism in organization theory, which predicts that more
   legitimate organizations will get more resources than illegitimate ones,
   we look into how legitimacy affects the resourcing of GGIs. We assess
   how crises of legitimacy affect the staff and financial resources of 21
   GGIs from 1985 to 2015. Multivariate statistical analysis suggests that
   the effects of legitimacy crises on GGI resourcefulness are interesting
   but surprisingly weak, often GGI specific, and dependent on time and the
   source of the challenge. Specifically, we find that elite criticisms of
   GGIs lead to deep resource cuts in the short and medium term, while the
   effect of mass protests takes longer. The paper concludes by setting an
   agenda for further theorizing and empirical testing of the consequences
   of legitimacy in global governance.},

Title = {When delegation fails: the politics of indivisible sovereignty},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS AND DEVELOPMENT},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {22},
Number = {3},
Pages = {676-697},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Despite the frequency with which governments delegate authority to
   international organisations, arguments about the indivisibility of state
   sovereignty continue to pose difficulties for governments seeking to
   delegate powers to international organisations. The existing theories of
   delegation assume that sovereignty is always divisible; they thus have
   difficulties accounting for those instances in which principled
   arguments about the need to preserve sovereignty preclude the
   possibility of delegation even when the balance of policy preferences
   would seem to favour it. In this paper, I develop a theory to explain
   the conditions under which sovereignty is constructed as indivisible. I
   distinguish between two discourses of sovereignty, national and
   administrative sovereignty, which represent the purpose of state power
   differently. When a discourse of national sovereignty intersects with a
   set of conditions related to the audience and the institutional rules
   governing delegation choices, sovereignty will be constructed as
   indivisible and lead to delegation failure. This argument is illustrated
   through an analysis of the US Senate's failure to ratify the Convention
   on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. My argument sheds light on
   the relationship between sovereignty and delegation and identifies an
   important set of factors that help to explain the conditions under which
   delegation fails.},

Abstract = {The General Assembly of the United Nations (UNGA) is a large negotiation
   arena. While much research focuses on the behaviour of its member
   states, the role of different regional organisations (ROs) has attracted
   little comparative scholarship. Although ROs have no formal votes, they
   are active in UNGA negotiations, most often through their member states.
   To answer why some ROs (e.g. EU, ASEAN, CARICOM) are more vocal in UNGA
   negotiations than others (e.g. AU, SCO, CoE, Andean), we theorise how
   ability, opportunity and willingness components influence RO
   dispositions to participate actively in international negotiations. We
   illustrate that ROs are increasingly vocal in the UNGA if they are
   small, well-equipped, old, have policy competencies that match the
   issues covered by the negotiation arena, and have good formal access to
   UN negotiations, while ROs that score lower on ability and to some
   extent also on opportunity and willingness components tend to be less
   active in UNGA negotiations.},

Abstract = {Contributing to the literature on norm resistance and backlash, this
   article explores the phenomenon of norm immunization, that is, the
   creation of legal barriers by a state with the purpose of fending off a
   transnationally diffusing norm by blocking its local advocacy. How do
   norm immunizations occur? What conditions facilitate or hinder this
   process? Focused on the area of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender
   (LGBT) rights, the article's main argument is that a state's
   immunization against these rights is undertaken through the
   securitization of nontraditional sexual orientations and gender
   identities. The article applies the theorized securitization mechanism
   to the (attempted) immunization against LGBT rights in Russia and
   Hungary in the last decade and identifies the relevant differences
   between the two cases to inductively sketch a general explanation of the
   success and failure of norm immunization attempts.},

Abstract = {While some scholars have assessed how various features of organizational
   structure shape intrinsic motivation, the role of budgets and, in
   particular, programme funding has been overlooked. To address this gap
   in the literature, we examine how programme funding decisions impact
   employee motivation. Referencing previous work, we hypothesize that
   funding choices that emphasize some programmes over others signal
   clearer organizational goals for employees, thereby increasing intrinsic
   motivation. In contrast, departments that do not use their budgets to
   signal clear goals can run the risk of reducing their employees'
   intrinsic motivation. We empirically investigate this hypothesis within
   the context of the US Federal executive departments, constructing a
   longitudinal dataset (2010-15) from multiple sources. Findings support
   our hypothesis. Employees in departments that more evenly fund their
   programmes report lower levels of intrinsic motivation.},

Abstract = {This article analyzes the complex dynamics of international hierarchy
   and functional delegation among established and emerging powers, by
   focusing on one of the most pressing and highly debated issues of the
   global security agenda, nuclear non-proliferation. While the established
   powers delegate some responsibilities in mediation efforts to enhance
   the legitimacy of the liberal international order, this delegation of a
   mediator role has challenges and limitations, as well. Therefore, this
   article examines the Joint Declaration by Iran, Turkey and Brazil
   (Tehran Declaration) on nuclear fuel in May 2010 as an empirical case
   that reveals the challenging quest of emerging powers to elevate their
   position in the hierarchical pyramid of the international order. We
   argue that the Nuclear Deal reflects the limits of the functional
   delegation in the international order, since the emerging powers
   encounter difficulties in their mediation efforts, particularly when
   they want to display more foreign policy autonomy.},

Abstract = {Research in behavioral economics finds that moral considerations bear on
   the offers that people make and accept in negotiations. This finding is
   relevant for political negotiations, wherein moral concerns are
   manifold. However, behavioral economics has yet to incorporate a major
   theme from moral psychology: People differ, sometimes immensely, in
   which issues they perceive to be a matter of morality. We review
   research about the measurement and characteristics of moral convictions.
   We hypothesize that moral conviction leads to uncompromising bargaining
   strategies and failed negotiations. We test this theory in three
   incentivized experiments in which participants bargain over political
   policies with real payoffs at stake. We find that participants' moral
   convictions are linked with aggressive bargaining strategies, which
   helps explain why it is harder to forge bargains on some political
   issues than others. We also find substantial asymmetries between
   liberals and conservatives in the intensity of their moral convictions
   about different issues.},

Abstract = {Despite different institutional and situational conditions, the recent
   French labor market reforms bear a strong resemblance to the labor
   market reforms in Germany in the early 2000s. Governments at both points
   in time turned away from the conservative welfare state model and failed
   to appropriately legitimize their reforms toward the public as well as
   their originally partly social-democratic electorate. Given the
   diverging conditions which are expected to lead to different strategies
   of legitimization, this contribution inquires after the narrative
   stories with which the corresponding acting government framed its
   reforms publicly. Surprisingly, despite the large differences that the
   two governments faced, the analysis shows that the respective narratives
   stories were not only similar but can be assigned to certain
   programmatic groups that used the narratives to push their own policy
   program and place themselves in power positions. In doing so, the
   contribution establishes a yet missing link between the recently
   established Programmatic Action Framework (PAF) and the concept of
   narrative stories and discourse in policy analysis, thereby adding to
   both research strands. This link lies in the observation that
   programmatic groups use narratives to strengthen in-group identification
   and thus improve their chances of success, which makes dominant
   narratives an important indicator of programmatic groups. However, when
   legitimizing reforms - even if these are transferred from other country
   experiences - it is imperatively important to embed the strategies of
   legitimization in the national context.},

Abstract = {This article examines Soviet perceptions of subversive and military
   threats from Poland to the Soviet Union in the 1920s and early 1930s.
   Drawing on archival materials from the Soviet foreign ministry,
   Communist Party leadership and security organs, it shows how the Soviet
   leadership held exaggerated fears about Polish threats to the Soviet
   western border regions and military intervention. A pattern of
   misperception stemmed from the Bolshevik defeat to Poland in the 1919-20
   Soviet-Polish War, which rather than moderating the early Soviet regime
   ultimately encouraged more widespread use of state violence and provided

Abstract = {What should a powerful patron do when a weaker protege plans to launch a
   counter-proliferation strike against the nuclear facilities of a target
   country? This paper identifies three possible strategies available to
   the patron when handling a `trigger happy' protege. These strategies
   range from lending `tacit support' to the protege' on the one end, to
   `intervention by exposure', on the other end, where the raid is
   effectively sabotaged. Occupying the middle ground is a strategy termed
   `status quo adherence', in which the patron attempts to warn the protege
   against launching the raid, while simultaneously bidding to mitigate the
   protege's concerns by other diplomatic measures. By accessing previously
   untapped documents from several archives, the study uses the Carter
   administration's approach to Israel's growing agitation with the Iraqi
   nuclear programme to explore the strategy of `status quo adherence' and
   its lessons.},

Volume = {31},

Abstract = {This article questions the current narrative paradigm and argues that
   al-Shabaab attacks Kenya for strategic and highly rational reasons,
   beyond sharing a border and having bases in southern Somalia closer to
   major population centres than Ethiopia or Uganda. Al-Shabaab targets
   Kenya more than other frontline states because of the opportunity spaces
   linked to Kenya's international status and visibility, its relatively
   free and independent media that widely publicizes terrorist attacks, a
   highly developed and lucrative tourist sector that provides soft
   targets, the comparatively high number of Kenyan foreign fighters within
   the group's ranks, the presence of terror cells in Kenya, expanding
   democratic space, and high levels of corruption. These variables play
   into al-Shabaab's motivations and aid planning and execution of
   terrorist acts that aim to fulfil the group's quest to survive by
   maintaining relevance. In order to address this predictable menace, we
   offer a number of measures that Kenya needs to take, including reducing
   corruption in order to properly invest in intelligence efforts and
   relevant homeland security measures, thereby making it possible for
   Kenya to sustainably and effectively combat al-Shabaab.},

Abstract = {The decision in the case of Holder v. Humanitarian Law Project raised
   important issues about civil liberties in the United States (2010),
   including freedom of speech and freedom of association, in relation to
   U.S. foreign policy actions. While the decision has the potential to
   infringe on certain liberties, the decision itself was based on very
   limited information on the nature of terrorism, the foreign terrorist
   organizations involved, and the processes by which terrorist groups can
   be induced to peacefully re-enter domestic political systems. There are
   also concerns about what can be the arbitrary designation of groups as
   foreign terrorist organizations. These issues raise serious questions
   about the role of the Supreme Court in the overall political system and
   judgments in cases involving terrorism and foreign policy.},

Title = {Another Form of American Exceptionalism? A Comparative Analysis of
   Terrorism Sting Operations in the US and Abroad},

Abstract = {Sting operations can potentially thwart terrorist plots, but could also
   threaten civil liberties and alienate communities, making them a
   critical subject for counterterrorism research. Yet despite considerable
   research on U.S. cases, little is known about terrorism stings
   elsewhere. How common are such cases abroad, and how many feature strong
   entrapment claims or result in entrapment-related acquittals? In this
   study, data are gathered about non-U.S. terrorism stings, each of which
   is evaluated for entrapment indicators. Results show that, contrary to
   claims of American exceptionalism, terrorism stings could be identified
   in twenty-one countries, and the average number of entrapment indicators
   per case is similar between the U.S. and several countries. In addition,
   several non-U.S. cases present entrapment claims as strong as some of
   the most-criticized U.S. cases. However, relatively few non-U.S.
   terrorism stings (fifty-one) could be identified, while there are 156
   U.S. cases. In addition, unlike in the U.S., courts have acquitted
   defendants on entrapment grounds in a high proportion of non-U.S. cases.
   Political, cultural, and legal differences between the U.S. and other
   countries, and certain cross-national commonalities, are identified as
   likely accounting for these results. Potential implications of these
   findings for terrorism prevention and legal reform are considered.},

Abstract = {Why do civilians in warzones often hold widely divergent beliefs about
   what is happening in the fighting? While there is a burgeoning
   literature on the micro-dynamics of armed conflict, variation in
   civilians' factual beliefs has received scant attention. Yet such
   beliefs are critical, as they form the basis for wartime opinion and
   action. I argue that-particularly for civilians outside the direct
   ``line of fire{''}-this variation comes not chiefly from an event's
   empirical nature, but from civilians' prior political orientations in
   the dispute. In order to investigate these dynamics, I fielded a survey
   experiment in Pakistan in which I manipulated the features of a reported
   counterinsurgent air strike and then measured civilians' ensuing beliefs
   about it. The results show that these beliefs are most driven by the
   perpetrator's identity and civilians' own preexisting attachments. While
   actual casualty levels matter too, these findings suggest that
   civilians' beliefs about conflict events are often deeply biased in
   nature.},

Abstract = {The paper is focused on town planning from different point of view
   thancurrent urban and economic development which stresses the need of
   building metropolises and smart cities as a cure for urban problems. The
   paper is a counter balance to this statement, especially in the
   conditions of Slovakia. The objective of this paper is to analyse living
   preferences of 496 respondents and to discuss a new term of
   nostalgianomics. Nostalgianomics explains that nostalgic sentiment can
   be used as an economic and creative force, as an incentive for
   investment, housing and urban planning Main conclusion proves this
   statement, most respondents chose a place to live that is less crowded
   and less urban.},

Abstract = {Using the case of the Czech narrative on ``Russian hybrid warfare{''}
   (RHW), this article contributes to the broader question of why
   narratives succeed. Building on Lacanian psychoanalysis, narrative
   scholarship, and affect/emotions research in International Relations, we
   suggest that narrative success is facilitated also by two interrelated
   factors: embedding in broader cultural contexts and the ability to
   incorporate and reproduce collectively circulating affects. We develop a
   methodological framework for encircling unobservable affects within
   discourse via ``sticking points{''}-linguistic phenomena infused with
   affective investment. We outline three categories of sticking
   points-valued signifiers, fantasies, and biographical narratives.
   Utilizing the approach in our case study, we focus on a narrative based
   around the notion that Russia waged a ``hybrid war{''} against ``the
   West{''} and that this should be faced with quasi-military measures,
   which was successful in changing the language of Czech national
   security. We show that this narrative incorporated a range of sticking
   points, which contributed to its relative success. It utilized valued
   signifiers, such as ``the West,{''} ``the Kremlin,{''} ``agents,{''} and
   ``occupation,{''} weaved them together into a fantasy of a threat to the
   nation's ``Western{''} identity, and intertwined this with the
   biographical narratives of history as a lens for world politics and
   East/West geopolitics.},

Abstract = {By enabling the Court of Justice to engage domestic judges, the
   preliminary ruling mechanism is widely recognised to have played a major
   role in European integration. Yet both the incentives and motivation to
   cooperate with the Court of Justice are believed to vary significantly
   across domestic courts. We explore how domestic courts differ in their
   referral behaviour depending on the position they occupy in the
   juridical hierarchy using a novel dataset, which extends, complements
   and corrects data initially collected by Stone Sweet and Brunell (1998.
   `The European Court and the national courts: a statistical analysis of
   preliminary references, 1961-95', Journal of European Public Policy 5
   (1): 66-97). We find that first instance courts pioneered the use of the
   preliminary ruling procedure, but that appellate and peak courts
   subsequently overtook them. We explain these shifts by the combined
   effect of institutional consolidation, organisational design and legal
   rules. We argue that resort to Article 267 TFEU was initially
   `accidental' but became institutionalised as more courts submitted
   references. This, in turn, allowed the division of labour underpinning
   the organisation of national judiciaries to reshape referral dynamics.},

Volume = {97},

Pages = {279-295},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {The aim of this article is to explore the opportunities and challenges
   of employing soft' metagovernance to promote public value in governance
   networks. Soft metagovernance can be defined as a form of relational
   leadership that is exercised through face-to-face contact. This involves
   making an emotional connection with people to exert influence through a
   collaborative endeavour, rather than employing bureaucratic authority.
   Drawing on a case study of a local social enterprise-The Bristol
   Pound-in the UK, this article examines how soft metagovernance can be
   used by non-state actors as a form of leadership to create public value.
   Evidence reveals that relational forms of leadership are a powerful
   asset in helping leaders of networks to create public value. Moreover,
   if network leaders understand how soft metagovernance functions they can
   use it more purposefully to maximize public value creation and mitigate
   the risks of public value destruction in governance networks.},

Abstract = {Societies must make collective decisions even when citizens disagree,
   and they use many different political processes to do so. But how do
   people choose one way to make a group decision over another? We propose
   that the human mind contains an intuitive political theory about how to
   make collective decisions, analogous to people's intuitive theories
   about language, physics, number, minds, and morality. We outline a
   simple method for studying people's intuitive political theory using
   scenarios about group decisions, and we begin to apply this approach in
   three experiments. Participants read scenarios in which individuals in a
   group have conflicting information (Experiment 1), conflicting interests
   (Experiment 2), and conflicting interests between a majority and a
   vulnerable minority who have more at stake (Experiment 3). Participants
   judged whether the group should decide by voting, consensus, leadership,
   or chance. Overall, we find that participants prefer majority-rule
   voting over consensus, leadership, and chance when a group has
   conflicting interests or information. However, participants' support for
   voting is considerably diminished when the group includes a vulnerable
   minority. Hence, participants showed an intuitive understanding of
   Madison's concerns about tyranny of the majority.},

Abstract = {Despite the growing importance attributed to organizational performance
   in global governance, management change in international public
   administrations (IPAs) is still poorly understood. In particular, the
   lack of comparative analyses that cover a broader range of management
   areas limits our descriptive knowledge about the direction and intensity
   of management change in IPAs. Without such knowledge, however, refining
   existing theories about the causes and consequences of change is
   difficult. Based on the reforms of the European Commission, the article
   reviews available studies about managerial change in IPAs to identify
   pertinent topics, available knowledge and gaps in the literature. Aiming
   to narrow these gaps, empirical data on three IPAs are presented to show
   in which areas and to what degree the management changed over time in
   these cases and to illustrate how multi-dimensional managerial change
   can be studied comparatively in future research more generally.},

Abstract = {Both leadership and public value are increasingly seen as concepts
   highly relevant to public administration, not only because of complex
   societal challenges but also as ways to address pluralistic interests in
   society. This article explores in detail the varied conceptualizations
   of public value and of public leadership. Furthermore, we argue that
   political astuteness provides an important conceptual linkage between
   leadership and public value, enabling actors to read, understand and
   foster coalitions around diverse and sometimes competing interests. In
   this introduction to the symposium, we analyse the different
   conceptualizations of public value, of leadership, and also show how the
   six articles explicitly or implicitly draw on the linking concept of
   political astuteness. The article assesses how the six articles of the
   symposium contribute to each of these three concepts.},

Abstract = {For America's foes in Afghanistan and the Middle East, triumph on the
   battlefield is less important than winning the battle of perceptions. In
   response, the United States has turned to Strategic Communication and
   Public Diplomacy (SC-PD) to engage key audiences in ways that advance
   U.S. interests and to win the political-ideological contest for domestic
   and international legitimacy. But are these strategies effective? While
   winning hearts and minds is politically important, SC-PD-even at its
   best-is much less effective than other well-crafted and mutually
   supportive policies and strategies. Moreover, there are structural
   obstacles that greatly limit the effectiveness of SC-PD.},

Abstract = {Most political science interpretations of the post-2010 Orban regime
   have been written either within the framework of populism or in the
   democratization paradigm. We have learned much from these papers about
   Hungary's drift in an authoritarian direction, but they also have
   drawbacks. This article aims to fill the gap between these two
   approaches and offers a theoretical framework to analyze the impact of
   populism and other trends of contemporary politics (like de-alignment,
   growing electoral volatility, citizens' disengagement, personalization,
   legitimacy problems, the decline of party membership and partisanship,
   the mediatization of politics, etc.) on the political regime. It argues
   that these trends add up to an authority and regime type that can be
   conceptualized by Weber's concept of plebiscitary leader democracy
   (PLD). PLD forms a new hybrid regime type that differs from comparative
   authoritarianism and other hybrid regime types known from the literature
   in three respects. First, PLD is less about institutional framework and
   procedures than about the sources of legitimacy; second, it serves
   better to understand how the regime works than measuring its distance
   from liberal democracy; third, it is an ideal type that aims to reveal
   the endogenous logic of democracy that generates authoritarian elements
   of the regime. The article also demonstrates the suitability of the
   concept of PLD for empirical research through presenting a structured

Abstract = {One of the most passionately contested issues in the aftermath of the
   UK's decision to leave the European Union in the June 2016 referendum
   concerned the standing of EU citizens residing in British territory.
   This article addresses this question from the perspective of normative
   political theory. Connecting the issue to recent debates about immigrant
   rights and the political significance of territorial presence, I argue
   that non-citizen residents should be granted full citizenship of the
   host state rather than a mere right to stay. This naturalisation process
   should proceed automatically in the case of EU citizens in post-Brexit
   UK, given legitimate expectations on both sides created during the UK's
   membership in the European Union.},

Abstract = {The European Parliament (EP) has a long-established reputation as an
   environmental champion'. Yet, environmental policy has potentially been
   profoundly and negatively affected by the conglomerate of crises that
   has beset the European Union (EU) since the late 2000s. There has been a
   swing to the right within the Parliament in recent elections, and the
   entry of a range environmentally sceptic states to the EU, which may
   have led to weakening policy ambition. This article uses a mix of
   quantitative and qualitative data to analyse whether there has been a
   shift in the EP's treatment of legislation, such that it has tried to
   weaken the policy ambition of proposals since the late 2000s. The
   analysis finds limited evidence of a general trend to deliberately water
   down legislation, and overall suggests that despite a less favourable
   policy context, the EP still can and does exercise a positive influence
   over EU environmental policy.},

Volume = {38},

Abstract = {Rittel and Webber boldly challenged the conventional assumption that
   scientific' approaches to social policy and planning provide the most
   reliable guidance for practitioners and researchers who are addressing
   complex, and contested, social problems. This provocative claim, that
   scientific-technical approaches would not work' for complex social
   issues, has engaged policy analysts, academic researchers and planning
   practitioners since the 1970s. Grappling with the implications of
   complexity and uncertainty in policy debates, the first generation of
   wicked problem' scholars generally agreed that wicked issues require
   correspondingly complex and iterative approaches. This tended to
   quarantine complex wicked' problems as a special category that required
   special collaborative processes. Most often they recommended the
   inclusion of multiple stakeholders in exploring the relevant issues,
   interests, value differences and policy responses. More than four
   decades later, however, there are strong arguments for developing a
   second-generation approach which would mainstream' the analysis of
   wicked problems in public policy. While continuing to recognize the
   centrality of complexity and uncertainty, and the need for creative
   thinking, a broader approach would make better use of recent public
   policy literatures on such topics as problem framing, policy design,
   policy capacity and the contexts of policy implementation.},

Abstract = {Public policy problems are increasingly being characterised as wicked or
   tame problems, assuming that this classification is also meaningful for
   attempts to effective problem-solving. But do distinct wicked' or tame'
   problems empirically exist? We investigate 37 water-related problems in
   Germany, based on interview-based data on problem wickedness and
   official data on policy delivery. Our analysis clearly reveals four
   clusters of water governance problems (system complexity, uncertainty,
   tame and wicked problems), based on variations of three factors of
   wickedness (goals, uncertainty and system complexity). These clusters of
   problems vary in their effects on different dimensions of policy
   delivery (goal formulation, stages and degrees of implementation of
   measures), with significant effects on goal formulation and the number
   of measures in construction'. These empirical insights may contribute to
   a more systematic design of governance strategies for addressing water
   governance problems in practice.},

Abstract = {The starting point for this paper is the suspected existence of a
   globally functioning operational democratic mechanism. Based on the work
   of Michel Foucault, it conceives this mechanism as a network that links
   up heterogeneous elements and has the effect of producing
   subjectivities. By making methodological use of this mechanism, it links
   ethical propositions about freedom, theoretical constructions of
   international relations, political practices of states and international
   organizations, and normative constructions (specifically, the
   responsibility to protect) that accompany international interventions in
   the Global South, in order to reflect on the production of a democratic
   subject, the predicate of a global liberal government.},

Abstract = {Literature on punctuated equilibrium theory (PET) explains the reasons
   organizations undergo incremental and punctuated policy changes. This
   study examines PET within the budgeting process. Alongside
   disproportionate information processing and institutional friction,
   recent innovations in PET have incorporated organizational history and
   theories from public administration to explain budgetary fluctuations.
   Part of the work merging PET with public administration has demonstrated
   how policy feedback (measured as the absolute level of performance)
   influences budgetary changes. Building upon this work, this study adds
   to the literature by examining another measure of policy
   feedback-organization performance gaps. This is a theoretically
   interesting question in how managers respond to performance growth and
   decline over time. It addresses performance budgeting and evidence-based
   policy making. Results show that while incremental budgetary changes are
   the most prevalent no matter the performance change, the probability of
   negative and positive budgetary changes differ across the spectrum of
   positive and negative performance gaps.},

Abstract = {The transition from Fordism to the knowledge economy in the world's
   advanced democracies was underpinned by the revolution in information
   and communications technology (ICT). The introduction and rapid
   diffusion of ICT pushed up wages for college-educated workers with
   complementary skills and allowed top managers and ems to reap greater
   rewards for their own talents. Despite these common pressures, income
   inequality did not rise to the same extent everywhere; income in the
   Anglo-Saxon countries remains particularly unequally distributed. To
   shed new light on this puzzle, the authors carry out a panel data
   analysis of eighteen OECD countries between 1970 and 2007. Their
   analysis stands apart from the existing empirical literature by taking a
   comparative perspective. The article examines the extent to which the
   relationship between the knowledge economy and income inequality is
   influenced by national labor market institutions. The authors find that
   the expansion of knowledge employment is positively associated with both
   the 90/10 wage ratio and the income share of the top 1 percent, but that
   these effects are mitigated by the presence of strong labor market
   institutions, such as coordinated wage bargaining, strict employment
   protection legislation, high union density, and high collective
   bargaining coverage. The authors provide robust evidence against the
   argument that industrial relations systems are no longer important
   safeguards of wage solidarity in the knowledge economy.},

Abstract = {About half of US employers consider personal credit history when hiring,
   a practice that connects individuals' prospects for employment to their
   financial pasts. Yet little is known about how employers translate
   credit reports, complicated financial documents, into hiring decisions.
   Using interviews with 57 hiring professionals, this paper offers the
   first in- depth look at how employers move from document to decision.
   Faced with the context- free numbers of a credit report, and without
   predictively valid credit scores to fall back on, hiring professionals
   struggle to make sense of financial data without knowing the details of
   job candidates' lives. They therefore reach beyond credit reports, both
   by inferring events that led to delinquent debt and by testing to see if
   candidates can offer morally redeeming accounts. A process of moral
   storytelling re-inflates credit reports with social meaning and prevents
   people with bad credit from getting jobs. This process carries
   implications for the reproduction of economic disadvantage since
   judgments about when it is and is not legitimate to have unpaid debt
   seem to at least partly depend on social background.},

Abstract = {This study observes the roles of the different actors involved in the
   processes of innovation. The theoretical framework on which this study
   is based deals mainly with the idea of collaborative innovation. This is
   a case study of eight Finnish municipalities (Hattula, Hollola,
   Hameenlinna, Kuusamo, Pudasjarvi, Raahe, Rovaniemi and Salo) and their
   innovation processes. The research question is: how did collaboration
   occur between the diverse actors during the observed development
   processes? The main data of this article emanates from the workshops
   held in these eight municipalities. Four groups of actors emerge in the
   empirical analysis: key actors, actors within the municipal
   organization, actors within the municipality and actors outside the
   municipality. The roles of promoters, coordinators and leaders of
   innovation processes and municipal management were highlighted. These
   key actors have the opportunities to promote and organize collaboration
   in the innovation processes. Collaborative practices in innovation
   processes are seen, as an important aim and the importance of including
   different stakeholders is quite widely understood. However, it seems
   that a systematic approach towards collaboration in these processes is
   lacking and in some cases the instruments for collaboration might be
   lacking.},

Abstract = {This paper develops a model of institutional change in order to analyze
   the determinants that operate on the level of institutionalization of
   meritocratic bureaucracies in two Latin American countries: Chile and
   Argentina. According to this model, the progress or degree of
   implementation of such meritocracies depends as much on the capacity for
   assertion and organization of civil society and state actors, as on the
   pre-eminence of a particular political and institutional framework. The
   empirical comparisons made by the model indicate that the intensity of
   presidential powers of patronage is the principal determinant of the
   degree of institutionalization of the meritocratic systems evaluated.},

Abstract = {Intergroup emotions motivate behavior, yet little is known about how
   people perceive these emotional experiences in others. In three
   experiments (Ns = 109, 179, 246), we show that U.S. citizens believe
   collective guilt is an illegitimate emotional motivator for ingroup
   political behavior, while collective pride is legitimate. This
   differential legitimacy is due to the perception that collective guilt
   violates the norm of group interest, while collective pride adheres to
   it; those who believe ingroup interests are more important than
   outgroups' exhibited this illegitimacy gap. The perception that the
   intergroup emotion promoted ingroup entitativity mediated the
   relationship between emotion (pride vs. guilt) and legitimacy; this
   relationship was especially strong for those high in the belief in the
   norm of group interest. Collective guilt can have prosocial
   consequences, yet the perception that it is illegitimate may hinder such
   consequences from being realized.},

Abstract = {Why are some factions fighting for greater national self-determination
   (SD) more violent than others? While previous explanations of violence
   in these disputes have focused on the number of factions, their internal
   structures, and power distributions among factions, we find many
   factions that do not follow the expectations of these theories. In this
   article, we center on religious ideology, its unique transnational
   character, and the opportunity it creates for political elites from
   competing factions within the same SD movement to mobilize support. We
   argue that ``religious factions{''} have a greater incentive to use
   violence than other factions. Violence serves as a costly signal, and it
   can be used to demonstrate a faction's religious credentials to
   transnational networks and contacts, as they compete with each other on
   the international stage for the same potential benefactors. We code
   original data on the religious ideology of factions. We find that an
   increasing number of religious factions is associated with increased
   religious faction use of violence. Furthermore, our findings point to a
   critical insight: it is not religious ideology, but competition between
   religious factions, that generates violence.},

Abstract = {Some terrorist organizations provoke their targets into deploying
   massive countermeasures, allowing terrorists to mobilize a greater share
   of their audience. Why would a government pursue such a costly strategy
   if it only strengthens the opponent? I develop a signaling model of
   terrorism, counterterrorism, and recruitment. If a target government is
   unsure whether the terrorists' audience is sympathetic to the cause,
   weaker groups sometimes bluff strength by attacking. To check this
   bluff, governments sometimes respond to attacks with large-scale
   operations, even though they know they might be overreacting.
   Comparative statics reveal that overreaction regret is most likely when
   the target is wealthy and large operations are more effective. Thus, a
   selection effect creates the false impression that provocation is most
   effective against geopolitically privileged targets.},

Abstract = {The European Union (EU) has become the main driver for environmental
   policy output for its member states whose number has more than tripled
   over the past four decades. The EU's deepening and widening has led
   researchers to expect more non-compliance with EU environmental
   legislation. In fact, however, the implementation gap has narrowed over
   the past 25 years. Except for Southern enlargement, taking on new member
   states has not exacerbated the EU's compliance problem in the field of
   environmental policy. Nor has the expansion of the environmental acquis.
   This is explained by the European Commission's strategies of managing
   and enforcing compliance. EU environmental policy has become less
   demanding on member states since it increasingly tends to amend existing
   rather than set new legislation. Simultaneously, the Commission has
   developed new instruments to strengthen member state capacities to
   implement EU environmental legislation.},

Abstract = {This article explores family separation and reunification of the
   disappeared Salvadoran children separated from their families during El
   Salvador's civil war (1980-1992) from the perspectives of adult
   relatives. During separation, adult relatives experienced an
   ``unresolvable loss.{''} Following reunion, families experienced an
   immediate relief that was often accompanied by an ``ambiguous
   reunification.{''} Emotions were especially complicated and painful when
   the separation had been a ``forced choice{''} by the parent under
   coercive wartime political conditions. Adoptive parents strongly
   influenced reunification. Findings suggest that disappeared children and
   biological and adoptive family members need psycho-social support
   throughout separation and reunification.},

Abstract = {Given long-standing criticism of global economic institutions by rising
   powers, it is puzzling that these same governments supported the
   transfer of substantial resources and responsibilities to the IMF and
   the World Bank during recent reform negotiations. We argue rising
   powers' support for international organization (IO) empowerment is
   linked to their concerns regarding an IO's flexibility. We introduce two
   types of flexibility as being most relevant for rising powers. These
   include governance flexibility - the extent to which rising powers may
   participate in IO decision-making - and issue flexibility - the extent
   to which rising power preferences are incorporated into IO policies and
   programs. We illustrate our argument by examining the preferences of the
   BIC states (Brazil, India and China) towards IMF and World Bank reforms
   between 2008 and 2012. Drawing on archival material with over 50
   statements from BIC representatives, we find, first, that there were
   clear links between Bank and Fund governance flexibility and the BICs'
   support for empowerment of these IOs, but that this was not true for
   issue flexibility. Second, we find evidence indicating the strategies of
   individual BIC governments differ within these IOs, suggesting a need to
   undertake more differentiated studies of rising powers' IO activities.},

Abstract = {Building peace is a challenge for a country like Colombia that has
   remained hopeless to achieve it for more than half a century. This
   requires the participation of all Colombians, especially those victims
   of serious violations, whose fundamental rights were affected as a
   consequence of the armed conflict. In order to intervene in this
   process, the State created the Law 1448 in 2011 to compensate the
   damages and restore territories. After six years it is important to know
   the perception and experience of the families affected by displacement
   and enforced disappearance about the individual and collective
   reparation contemplated in its articles. To achieve this objective a
   hermeneutical research took place between 2016 and 2018 with 60
   participants from different organizations, associations and collectives
   from Barrancabermeja, Colombia. Interactive techniques were used
   -descriptive, historical-narrative, analytical and expressive- and
   allowed the expression of thoughts, feelings, experiences and
   appreciations about the Law 1448/2011. In this way the participants
   illustrated the social representation around the elements of the
   integral reparation that is supposed to be fulfilled by the Colombian
   State. The results show that the participants continue under the
   condition of victims and that they want dignity rather than an economic
   compensation. They demand the truth and answers to their emotional
   losses and a State that guarantee non-repetition of violations to the
   fundamental rights. Furthermore, the results indicate that the
   regulatory framework must be modified according to the needs demanded by
   the survivors in terms of rehabilitation and the effective enjoyment of
   human rights at the individual, collective, material, symbolic and moral
   level. Only in this way it facilitates the end of the internal armed
   conflict and the achievement of a stable and lasting peace.},

Abstract = {Certain shifts in demography, social values, and the labor market are
   part of a generational transformation that favors the attraction of
   young talents for the Brazilian public sector. However, the Brazilian
   State faces structural obstacles to take advantage of the opportunity to
   train a new generation of public professionals, among which are the poor
   organization and inconsistent of the Brazilian bureaucracy, its
   fragility as employer, and its obsolete recruitment and development
   methods. In this context, the civil society organization Vetor Brasil
   assumed the responsibility of contributing to overcome these obstacles.
   It launched the Public Management Trainee Program in 2015 in order to
   provide assistance in recruiting, selecting, and developing talented
   youth for public service careers. Using a method based on skills, it has
   received 60,000 applications and placed 280 professionals in local
   government positions of all Brazilian federal units. It now boasts a
   network of committed and diverse professionals capable of driving
   cultural changes in the public sector multiplying Vetor's mission. The
   initiative also works as laboratory for new human resources management
   practices that can be tested and generate evidence. After three years of
   operation, the program have opened countless horizons and Vector has
   privileged its voice in the growing debate on the modernization of
   Brazil's public sector. Trusting that the lessons learned could provide
   an inspiration and example for the development a growing ecosystem of
   civil society organizations devoted in promoting innovation within
   State, Vetor shares its experience in this article.},

Title = {Populism as an intra-party phenomenon: The British Labour Party under
   Jeremy Corbyn},
Journal = {BRITISH JOURNAL OF POLITICS \& INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {21},
Number = {1},
Pages = {99-115},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {This article seeks to demonstrate that the concept of populism can help
   us to understand the dynamics of intra-party politics. This argument is
   made via a case study of the British Labour Party under Jeremy Corbyn,
   who was elected as its leader in late 2015. Corbynism as a (highly
   personalistic) political phenomenon has relied, in its resistance to
   opposition from more moderate MPs to Labour's leftward turn, upon the
   idea that the party's members are `the people'. This idea links to
   notions of the `heartland' members occupy, the elite conspiracy against
   them and the democratic resolution made possible by the leader.
   Analysing how the rise of populist politics affects politics within
   parties, as well as between them, may, the article argues, help account

Abstract = {This paper looks at how an innovative policy comes to be transferred to
   another country and be successfully implemented. We explore three key
   dimensions (time, location, and people) in policy transfer studies using
   two cases of international aid (Saemaul Undong and e-Government
   projects). Utilizing a case study method, this paper upholds the
   predominant role of the policy entrepreneur over the environment
   (different time frame and different social, political, economic
   systems). The stakeholder analysis shows that policy entrepreneur's role
   is critical in making policy transfer successful. In part, this argument
   is in line with previous ``Advocacy Networks{''} studies, such as that
   of Keck and Sikkink (1998), highlighted the importance of policy
   entrepreneurs being able to navigate in the networks of international
   development. This paper aims to contribute to the literature by applying
   Dolowitz and Marsh's policy transfer framework in the international aid
   context and calls for further empirical research employing the network
   analysis method.},

   social unrest over economic issues},
Journal = {CRITICAL POLICY STUDIES},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {13},
Number = {4},
Pages = {470-487},
Abstract = {Communicative discourse is widely understood as consisting of a top-down
   political dynamic in which policy elites actively construct discourse
   and convey it to a passive public. Yet, this understanding overlooks
   instances of a bottom-up dynamic where social unrest puts policy elites
   in a reactive position. Relying on the literature on depoliticization, I
   argue that in bottom-up dynamics, policy elites use a different
   discursive tactic than in top-down dynamics, namely, containment. Using
   the containment tactic, policy elites accommodate their discourse to
   engage with public pleas in a manner that reaffirms the ideational
   framework that currently underlies policymaking, by using two
   complementary practices: boundary-setting and tailored framing. I
   illustrate my argument through an analysis of the Israeli policy elite's
   public discursive responses to a period of mass protest during 2011. The
   article concludes by pointing out the rising importance of studying
   communicative discourse in bottom-up political dynamics.},

Abstract = {In 2003, NATO set out to support the establishment of `a
   self-sustaining, moderate and democratic Afghan government able to
   exercise its authority and to operate throughout Afghanistan.' The
   article examines why NATO's attempt to bring stability to Afghanistan
   over the decade that followed failed to advance its initial and highly
   ambitious vision for the country. A fundamental inability to recognise
   and engage with the drivers and dynamics of conflict within Afghanistan
   provides an important part of the answer. Underlying divisions and
   tensions among key allies over strategic objectives in Afghanistan were
   also major sources of fragmentation and incoherence in NATO's
   involvement. Above all, the failure to prioritise the search for an
   inclusive political settlement among parties to the conflict and to
   tailor operations on the ground to a realisable political objective
   ensured growing insecurity and instability over time. The experience
   holds important lessons for the theory and practice of stabilisation.},

Title = {An international review of arts inclusion policies: lessons for Hong
   Kong},
Journal = {PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION AND POLICY-AN ASIA-PACIFIC JOURNAL},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {22},
Number = {2},
Pages = {173-191},
Abstract = {Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to review and compare the
   implementation of ``arts inclusion{''} policies (AIPs) by 14 different
   public administrative systems around the world. It aims to provide a
   consolidated source which informs further studies in this field, and to
   develop a framework to compare AIPs at a global level.
   Design/methodology/approach - Using ``arts inclusion policy{''} as the
   search term, academic journals from a wide spectrum of fields were
   reviewed. A data set was extracted from the Compendium of Cultural
   Policies and Trends' online database which provided real-time
   information of national cultural policies. Another data set is from the
   United Nations' Inequality-adjusted Human Development Index, as the
   geographic scope of the review - largely focussing on UK, US,
   Australian, Scandinavian and Asian contexts. Using existing
   policy-making literature as benchmark, the authors designed and applied
   a comparative framework dedicated to AIPs which focussed on
   ``policy-making structures{''} as the main ground of comparison.
   Findings - An important finding is that the policy development and
   implementation of AIPs often underscore inter-sectoral involvement in
   many public administrations in this study. With policy leadership and
   financial incentives pivotal to effective AIPs, central governments
   should take a more concerted leadership role to include AIPs in national
   inter-sectoral policies, encourage evidence-based research, expand
   funding and advocate the recognition of the impacts of arts inclusion.
   It is concluded that AIPs in western countries remain more developed in
   targeted scopes and programme diversity compared to those of Asian
   countries and regions. Continued studies in this field are encouraged.
   Originality/value - This review is the first of its kind to include a
   number of Asian and western countries within its research scope,
   allowing it to offer a more holistic outlook on the development and
   implementation of AIPs in different countries and regions. A common
   critique with all relevant existing literature was usually their lack of
   concrete comparative grounds, and the present study's all-encompassing
   review of literature from across different levels and sectors of
   respective public administrative systems contribute to a unique and
   comprehensive perspective in the arts and health discourse.},

Abstract = {The eurozone crisis has spectacularly increased the European Union's
   (EU's) institutional demand for expert knowledge. While the crisis has
   challenged the legitimacy of the EU in many ways, it has in contrast
   amplified the visibility and the role of Brussels-based think tanks as
   laboratories of ideas that think ahead about eurozone governance and
   policies. Drawing on the analysis of more than 450 expert reports
   produced by two leading Brussels-based think tanks, over 300 CVs and
   biographical notes as well interviews, this article explores when, how
   and why Brussels-based think tanks expand their networks in times of
   crisis. While the article leaves aside the question of their ideational
   impact upon agenda-setting and the policy formulation process leading to
   the new European economic governance, it shows how think tanks adapt to
   crises and how they seek to have a voice in thinking about the future of
   the EU's economic governance.},

   polarization and economic development},
Journal = {TERRORISM AND POLITICAL VIOLENCE},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {31},
Number = {3},
Pages = {536-558},
Abstract = {Many scholars have sought to explain why countries with ethnically
   heterogeneous populations experience higher levels of political
   violence, but these studies have produced mixed findings. Unlike most
   studies that use ethno-linguistic fractionalization indices to examine
   this relationship, we argue that ethnic polarization is a more
   appropriate measure to assess the role of ethnicity as a causal factor
   of domestic terrorism. This paper hypothesizes that high ethnic
   polarization influences the incidence of domestic terrorism,
   particularly when intervening economic factors are present. To test
   three hypotheses, we use negative binomial regression to model data from
   the Global Terrorism Dataset, World Bank, and the Reynal-Querol (RQ)
   ethnic polarization index of 116 countries between 1970 and 2012. Our
   findings show that terrorism is more likely to emerge in societies with
   high ethnic polarization and economic malaise.},

   Obama administration},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL POLITICS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {28},
Number = {7},
Pages = {1192-1213},
Abstract = {Environmental policy in the United States (US) is known for its
   media-specific approach to problems, and scholars have argued that this
   is ineffective. To combat these problems, some have argued for a more
   coordinated, integrated approach to policymaking. With Congressional
   gridlock prohibiting legislative solutions, the Obama administration
   offers some examples of a regulatory path to policy integration.
   Importantly, these efforts do not entail significant organizational
   remodels, which can be difficult to adopt. Three different `types' of
   policy integration from the US Environmental Protection Agency and
   Bureau of Land Management are described. These cases serve as a
   potential roadmap for broader implementation of policy integration
   within the fragmented US bureaucracy.},

Title = {States and transnational resistance networks: Iran's mobilization of
   Iraqi Shi militias after 1979},
Journal = {INTERNASJONAL POLITIKK},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {77},
Number = {3},
Pages = {296-322},
Abstract = {The Islamic Republic of Iran has been building a transnational network
   of Shi'a militias since 1979, commonly referred to as its asymmetric
   warfare capability and `strategic depth'. While it is a known fact that
   Iran has mobilised Shi'a militias in other countries to strengthen its
   regional position, how they have done it has not received much scholarly
   attention. The objective of this paper is to explain this phenomenon by
   examining how Iran has mobilised Iraqi Shi'a militias since 1979. The
   selected cases are the mobilisation processes of three most prominent
   Shi'a militias in Iraq today: Badr Organisation, Asa'ib Ahl al-Haq, and
   Kata'ib Hizbullah. Although variation exists between them, they are all
   cases of Iran's network of armed resistance groups, which have allowed
   it to engage in covert or indirect conflict intervention in the Middle
   East. To logically connect the empirical data with the study's research
   question, I have used a case study research design, with process tracing
   and the semi-structured interview as methods for data collection.
   Furthermore, the empirical analysis has been guided by a theoretical
   framework that has attempted to build a bridge between the existing
   literatures on state-militia dynamics and contentious politics.},

Abstract = {In this article, Bjorn Tore Godal shares his experiences from when he,
   as Minister of Commerce, signed the EEA Agreement in Oporto, Portugal on
   May 2, 1992, on behalf of Norway. He shows how the EEA Agreement can be
   understood as a natural prolongation of Norwegian foreign policy
   tradition where relations with Europe always have been complex and
   complicated. While international cooperation has been highly supported,
   there has also been a deep skepticism of unions and great powers. As a
   leader of AUF (the social-democratic youth league) in the early 1970s,
   he also fought against Norwegian membership in the EC. As a Minister of
   Commerce, he believed that the EEA could be a lasting alternative to EU
   membership. In this contribution, Godal shows how the EEA Agreement has
   worked and how he has experienced the functioning of this agreement in
   his various roles.},

   Cambodia: Results of a Randomized Controlled Outcome Trial},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONFLICT AND VIOLENCE},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {13},
Abstract = {Based on the hypothesis that pain is a stand-alone problem, not just a
   symptom of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), the effect of group
   psycho-education ({''}pain school{''}) for survivors of the Khmer Rouge
   regime with pain-PTSD comorbidity was tested in Cambodia in 2015. After
   baseline assessment comprising pain-related measures (Brief Pain
   Inventory, Disability Rating Index) and measures for PTSD, anxiety,
   depression, and distress, 113 subjects were randomized to a waitlist
   control group (CG, n = 58) and a treatment group (TG, n = 55). After
   treatment TG improved significantly, with clinically relevant effect
   size. Effect size was, however, substantially lower than in two prior
   pilot trials, and the improvement was not maintained at six-month
   follow-up. The main reason for this is hypothesized to be that the
   intervention had been delivered in too condensed a format. It is
   concluded that treatment addressing pain can also ameliorate mental
   health problems, implying that more attention should be paid to pain
   treatment for subjects suffering from pain/PTSD comorbidity.},

Title = {Effect of stakeholder's conflicts on project constraints: a tale of the
   construction industry},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONFLICT MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {30},
Number = {4, SI},
Pages = {538-565},
Abstract = {Purpose - The purpose of this research is to quantify the effect of
   stakeholder conflicts on project constraints in the construction
   industry using ordinal regression analysis. For this purpose, the most
   significant project constraints and factors that cause stakeholder
   conflicts found in the literature are measured.
   Design/methodology/approach - Factors causing stakeholder conflicts and
   project constraints are extracted through a content analysis of the
   published literature. Further, a questionnaire survey is conducted
   involving 170 professionals to assess the effect of conflicts on project
   constraints. Finally, to obtain a more objective assessment, a
   statistical model is developed, and to highlight the most severe factors
   causing conflict and impacting project constraints, ordinal regression
   analysis is performed.
   Findings - The results show that in the construction industry, all
   project constraints are affected by stakeholder conflicts. Factors that
   result in stakeholder conflicts indicated a positive relationship with
   cost, time and resources. This means that any increase or decrease in
   the effect of stakeholder conflicts will directly influence these three
   project constraints. Similarly, a negative relationship was observed
   between stakeholder conflicts and quality, workforce productivity,
   protection of environment and safety regulations in the construction
   industry, indicating that increase in the effect of stakeholder
   conflicts will decrease these four project constraints and vice versa.
   The results for cumulative ordinal regression model highlight that lack
   of communication, poor quality of completed works and change orders and
   rework have intense effects on project constraints collectively.
   Originality/value - A small number of studies have been undertaken to
   examine the emergence of project constraints in the developing
   countries. And even more, its relationship with stakeholder conflicts in
   the construction industry is limited. This research highlights the most
   significant project constraints and factors that result in stakeholder
   conflicts in the construction industry. Therefore, this study adds to
   the existing body of knowledge by developing an ordinal regression model
   that will help decision-makers and top management control this enigma of
   stakeholder conflicts in the construction industry.},

Abstract = {This article contributes to the debate on environmental determinants of
   public service performance by analyzing the effect of country size
   (population size) on public service effectiveness. It theoretically
   describes and empirically tests a size-induced trade-off between
   economies and diseconomies of scale in national bureaucracies. The main
   argument is that public service performance increases with size due to
   economies of scale, but it decreases after the optimal country size when
   bureaucracies become too large and cumbersome to manage. The
   hypothesized curvilinear effect is tested for the first time empirically
   in cross-sectional regression models and multilevel within-between RE
   models that isolate the theoretically relevant between-country effect.
   The results support the expected inverse U-shaped relation on a global
   scale and in the subsample of democracies. The findings and their
   implication for research and practice are discussed: Public management
   must adapt theoretically and practically to country size as it is a
   contextual factor beyond the control of managers.},

Abstract = {The heterogeneous practices adopted by politicized ethnic groups and the
   variations in the types and intensity of mobilization pose a significant
   question for conflict analysts. What accounts for the shift of aggrieved
   ethnic groups, with stated political demands, from protest mobilization
   to organized violence? The proposed study builds a conceptual framework
   of violent conflict that allows scholars to look at variables related to
   the feasibility of violent conflict. The study assumes that the decision
   of group actors to use organized violence depends on the perception of
   structural conditions conducive to the emergence of violence: (i)
   ethno-spatial factors; (ii) operational factors; (iii) international
   factors; and (iv) state response. Selected opportunity structures have
   substantially influenced the violent trajectory of the Albanians in the
   Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, establishing some clear
   congruency of theoretical directions with empirical findings. However, a
   comparative examination of variables across conflicts is important for
   identifying and explaining non-agreeable cases of violent and
   non-violent conflict.},

Abstract = {This article examines the challenges of narcotic drugs in West Africa
   following the region's emergence as a major transit zone for the
   trafficking of cocaine and other illicit drugs to many countries in
   Europe. In addition to the trafficking problem, the use of narcotic
   drugs has been on the increase in the region. In effect, the drug policy
   terrain in West Africa appears to be undergoing changing trends. To
   understand these changes, the article draws on the policy paradigm
   (orders of change) theory to examine the types of change that are
   occurring. The analysis reveals that the drug policy terrain is
   undergoing first and second order changes.},

   Analysis of Violence-related Norms in Selected Post-Industrial

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONFLICT AND VIOLENCE},
Year = {2019},

Abstract = {Youth violence remains a concern in Germany, particularly in specific
   ``risky{''} neighborhoods that tend to be socially segregated and
   ethnically diverse. In this paper we critically compare the results of
   twenty-seven qualitative interviews conducted in three risky
   neighborhoods in the German Ruhr area with the code of the street. While
   this theoretical framework is frequently cited in explaining youth
   violence, it was based on research in an ethnically homogenous
   neighborhood in the United States and thus does not engage with
   questions of diversity. Our findings show that the core of the code of
   the street is also applicable in heterogeneous contexts, thus extending
   the generalizability of the theoretical framework. Manifestations of
   manhood, reputation, and symbolic power were found to be major elements
   of street culture, although characterized somewhat differently than in
   the original work.},

Journal = {CRITICAL POLICY STUDIES},

Volume = {13},
Number = {1},
Pages = {81-100},
Abstract = {Network governance, which involves an informal and self-regulated set of
   public and private actors, who together address various political and
   social problems, has substantially altered the institutional landscape
   concerning the formation and implementation of public policy. A common
   view is that this has made it possible to enhance pluralism and disperse
   political power by transferring power from the sovereign state to a
   wider set of private actors and stakeholders. I argue in this article
   that we need to analyze network governance in reference to the concept
   of domination and the theoretical tradition of neo-republicanism. For
   this purpose, I develop a theoretical framework that specifies five
   dimensions in which domination may arise and, conversely, be mitigated.
   An alternative image of network governance emerges which reveals that
   this type of governance may in fact generate a form of institutional
   domination that encompasses both citizens and civil society actors due
   to the arbitrary influence that certain network participants come to
   exercise upon the life choices of nonparticipants.},

Abstract = {Why did the Punjab bear the brunt of the mass violence and the migration
   that accompanied the partition of India? This paper makes the case for
   analytical eclecticism by showing that the following three explanations
   - centred respectively on democratisation, nationalism, and ideas; the
   commitment problem; and the security dilemma - account for the
   violence/migration in the different stages in the run-up to the
   partition of India. Instead of arguing that `everything mattered', this
   paper elucidates the complex causality at work by demonstrating how
   these factors interacted with one another during the different stages
   leading to India's partition.},

Abstract = {Decentralized decision making has created restructuring from larger to
   smaller administrative units, but in many places, strays little from
   existing arrangements. Moves toward decentralization from central
   government to city-regions, and in some areas, below city-region scale
   to neighborhoods, reflect a mandate for reform. What is the nature and
   extent of desired reforms? Using an institutionalist lens, homogeneity
   and heterogeneity in local narratives about possible future reform can
   be surfaced. This article emphasizes the importance of understanding the
   role of local actors' narratives in shaping decentralized institutions.
   This article uses the findings from a Q-methodology study to identify
   and interrogate distinctive local viewpoints on attempts to decentralize
   decision making in England. In a systematic empirical analysis, local
   actors' narratives were largely in favor of relatively minor
   modifications to the status quo. The findings question a conflation of
   decentralization with participation in decision making.},

Abstract = {The study focuses on the role of policy advice brokers - political
   advisors - pertaining to the issue of politicization in the European
   Commission (EC). The study conceptualizes politicization as increased
   use of political advisors - known as ``cabinets{''} in the EC context -
   by the Commissioners to ensure political direction over the work of the
   civil service. Commissioners' private cabinets fulfil several functions,
   one of which is political steering of the policy work in the
   departments. The study argues that as a result of the NPM-style reform
   and strengthening of the civil service accountability to the political
   level, the political steering function of the cabinet advisors grew in
   importance. To examine whether the political steering function of
   cabinets became more important after the reform, the study analyzed the
   lists of cabinets' responsibilities available online from the Prodi to
   the Junker Commissions. The content of the lists of responsibilities was
   first coded and then statistically analyzed testing for the effect of
   the reform on the structure of cabinets' responsibilities.},

Title = {Jamaica's development of women entrepreneurship: challenges and
   opportunities},
Journal = {PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION AND POLICY-AN ASIA-PACIFIC JOURNAL},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {22},
Number = {2},
Pages = {152-172},
Abstract = {Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to assess how far Jamaica has
   come regarding women economic empowerment, female entrepreneurship and
   its development policies in favour of women entrepreneurship
   development.
   Design/methodology/approach - This exploratory study employs a mixed
   method approach to achieve its research objectives, consisting of
   literature review and corroboration with existing database and indices.
   Key insights of research on female entrepreneurship are used to reflect
   on published data to assess progress of female entrepreneurship
   development in Jamaica. The 2017 editions of the Global Entrepreneurship
   Monitor and Gender Entrepreneurship and Development Index were examined
   to gain a better understanding of how the Jamaican business environment
   has progressed or regressed over time and how the economic development
   and business environment impact female participation in Jamaica's labour
   force and entrepreneurial initiatives.
   Findings - The economic conditions in Jamaica and the role of females as
   domestic caregiver have made it difficult for women to enter the labour
   force even though Jamaican women are relatively better educated than
   men. Women remain at a disadvantage in the labour force. Jamaica's
   legislation and budget allocations in favour of female entrepreneurship
   are analysed to identify where and how Jamaica is investing its efforts
   to improve women's participation in the labour force. The authors
   conclude with suggestions on how the Jamaican government could
   facilitate further women entrepreneurship development to reach a more
   gender balanced inclusive socio-economic development.
   Originality/value - While global policy has been promoting women
   empowerment through entrepreneurial development, little is known on the
   actual outcome of such human capital investment strategy and the
   critical vectors that contribute to such outcome. This scarcity of
   knowledge is also applicable to Jamaica. This paper attempts to
   contribute to women entrepreneurship research by reaching beyond the
   output-oriented perspective of various skill development programmes and
   attempts to link policy choice with overall macro results of
   entrepreneurship development in general and women entrepreneurship
   development in specific. The study thus provides a rare glimpse of the
   entrepreneurship ecosystem in Jamaica.},

Abstract = {Local governments have emerged as important players in climate change
   governance, both at home and on the international stage. Likewise,
   action by states and provinces has been increasingly highlighted,
   particularly as national actors have moved slowly to reduce greenhouse
   gas emissions. But to what extent do local governments act independently
   from state and provincial governments in the area of climate change
   mitigation? Using an explicit process tracing approach, the article
   tests two hypotheses regarding the influence of upper level subnational
   governments on local policy. In Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, a
   city that is a climate change leader, provincial government intervention
   cannot explain the results of climate change mitigation policy making.
   This suggests that local governments can exercise an important degree of
   autonomy over climate change policy, but also implies that where
   municipalities are less independently committed to climate action,
   active upper level government intervention will likely be needed.},

Title = {What Now, Norwegian Defence Industry? Instrumental and Institutional
   Answers to the EU's New Security and Defence Policies},
Journal = {INTERNASJONAL POLITIKK},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {77},
Number = {4},
Pages = {398-419},
Abstract = {The article discusses the EU's new defence package with emphasis on CARD
   (Coordinated Annual Review on Defence), PESCO (Permanent Structured
   Cooperation) and EDF (European Defence Fund). The aim is to strengthen
   the EU as a security actor and encourage strategic autonomy. This
   package challenges Norwegian security, defence, and defence-industrial
   policies. The research questions are: What consequences will these EU
   initiatives have for Norwegian defence-industry and defence-research
   policies? How will the authorities (Ministry of Defence; MoD) act to
   maintain a national defence industry? We apply instrumental and
   institutional theories. Instrumental theories expect rational actions in
   accordance with logic of consequences. Institutional theories expect
   appropriate actions in line with established culture and expectations in
   their surroundings. The EU's security and defence policy becomes more
   similar to other EU policy areas. Therefore, a multilevel governance
   approach is relevant. Our interviews with representatives of Norwegian
   authorities and Norway's defence industry reveal that they have
   fragmented knowledge and expectations about the significance of the
   defence package. We conclude that the authorities act instrumentally,
   but the lack of a comprehensive understanding makes it difficult to
   answer rationally. The authorities therefore also act according to a
   cultural perspective.},

Journal = {CONTEMPORARY SECURITY POLICY},

Volume = {40},

Pages = {101-115},
Abstract = {The decision to employ force abroad is often a contentious political
   decision, where partisanship plays a crucial role. Prior to military
   intervention, political parties usually make their ideologically
   distinctive preferences clear and seek to implement them once in power.
   What remains unclear, however, is how ideology affects the decision to
   use military force. This article contends that alliance and electoral
   calculations constrain the ability of political parties to implement
   their ideological preferences with regards to the use of force. It
   examines a most likely case for the partisan theory of military
   intervention, namely Canada's refusal to take part in the invasion of
   Iraq and its decision to commit forces to the war against the Islamic
   State. It finds that only in combination with alliance and electoral
   calculations does executive ideology offer valuable insights into
   Canada's military support to U.S.-led coalition operations, which
   contributes to our understanding of allied decision-making.},

Abstract = {The selection of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) , targets and
   indicators for sexual and reproductive health and rights (SRHR) can only
   be understood in the light of struggles to advance these rights amid a
   context of the growing reliance on indicators to measure progress. If
   the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) de-politicized inherently
   polemical issues in SRHR, the (re)production of knowledge of rights in
   the SDGs poses a subtler, but just as serious, threat. Although rights,
   and SRHR in particular, are apparently taken into account, the apparent
   neutrality of these metrics obscures politics and ideology. There is a
   danger that over-reliance on quantitative indicators obscures the
   structural challenges facing the advancement of SRHR, and therefore
   indicators should be coupled with qualitative information derived in
   context.},

Abstract = {The economic policies of the governments of Lula da Silva (2003-2010)
   and Dilma Rousseff (2011-2016) combined orthodox measures with
   distinctive pro-growth measures that, although they deviated from
   neoliberalism, cannot be called ``developmentalist{''} either. They
   lacked a long-term strategy for reversing the deindustrialization of the
   country or advancing to a new technological paradigm. They did, however,
   have a historical commitment to income redistribution that was largely
   implemented. The broad social pact proposed by Lula acknowledged the
   hegemony of financial capital, and its contradiction was that it
   protected the hegemonic group by means of monetary and fiscal policies
   that required growth in the gross domestic product, a favorable balance
   of payments, and a gap between wages and productivity. When these
   conditions no longer held, Rousseff responded to the crisis with a ``new
   macroeconomic matrix{''} that amounted to the abandonment of Lula's
   class-coalition pact. As politicas economicas dos governos de Lula da
   Silva (2003-2010) e Dilma Rousseff (2011-2016) combinaram medidas
   ortodoxas com distintas medidas pro-crescimento que, embora se
   desviassem do neoliberalismo, tambem nao podem ser chamadas de
   ``desenvolvimentalista.{''} Eles careceram de uma estrategia de longo
   prazo para reverter a desindustrializacao do pais e avancar para um novo
   paradigma tecnologico. Eles tinham, no entanto, um compromisso historico
   com a redistribuicao de renda que foi implementada em grande parte. O
   amplo pacto social proposto por Lula reconheceu a hegemonia do capital
   financeiro, e sua contradicao foi que protegia o grupo hegemonico por
   meio de politicas monetarias e fiscais que exigiam crescimento do
   produto interno bruto, uma balanca de pagamentos favoravel e uma lacuna
   entre salarios e produtividade. Quando essas condicoes nao mais se
   mantiveram, Rousseff respondeu a crise com uma ``nova matriz
   macroeconomica{''} que resultou no abandono do pacto de coalizao de
   classes de Lula.},

Abstract = {Robert Glinski's post-communist film Czesc Tereska generated extensive
   controversy as a story of Polish teenagers disconnected from traditional
   morality in an anonymous apartment block. Its central character of a
   young girl, Tereska, makes the film appear to be about femininity and
   danger in 1990s neoliberal Poland. In an alternative interpretation
   using the approach that neoliberalism is a form of governmentality, an
   analysis of male characters surrounding Tereska demonstrates that the
   film can also be interpreted as a depiction of the inability of
   individuals to achieve neoliberal ideals of masculinity. The 1990s
   dominant ideology of individualism and freedom created expectations that
   men would embody a self-contained, self-restrained potency that
   functioned to curb the excesses of the society around them. We argue
   that the impossibility of achieving this embodiment generates tensions
   in the film that are only resolved at times when Tereska is made to take
   on the responsibility for managing men's desires. While several scholars
   have pointed to a ``crisis of masculinity{''} in Eastern Europe, we find
   that Czesc Tereska can be seen as a narrative that delineates the
   specific effects of anxious masculinities on female-gendered agency and
   autonomy, but that is limited in its ability to fully work out those
   implications.},

Abstract = {The article provides a critical overview of the rise of resilience at
   the European Union (EU) level and to what extent its adoption is
   reshaping the terms of the EU's peacebuilding interventions. It argues
   that resilience offers a four-fold contribution to promoting sustainable
   peace: (1) a focus on complexity; (2) a systems approach; (3) a shift
   toward local capacities; and (4) an emphasis on human agency. The
   article then applies this framework to assess the implementation of the
   EU's ``resilience turn{''} since the adoption of the EU Global Strategy
   in 2016. Focusing on the EU's discourse and its peacebuilding practices
   in the Western Balkans, the evidence suggests that the EU has only
   embraced a systems/integrated approach, while neglecting deeper
   understandings of complexity, local capacities and human agency. As a
   result, the contribution of resilience to EU peacebuilding remains
   limited.},

Abstract = {Established explanations of differences in compliance outcomes highlight
   the policy preferences of implementers. The application of these
   theories to compliance with EU laws focuses on national governments and
   stakeholders. This study improves on existing conceptualisations of
   governments' and stakeholders' preferences by distinguishing between
   their incentives to deviate from, conform to and exceed the standards
   contained in EU laws. We apply these concepts to detailed evidence on
   national governments' and stakeholders' policy preferences and national
   governments' transposition records. The study finds that incentives to
   conform and exceed are generally more frequent than incentives to
   deviate. Moreover, the policy preferences of national governments and
   stakeholders are linked, as governments' preferences often agree with
   national stakeholders' demands. Both national governments' and
   stakeholders' incentives to comply positively affect the timeliness of
   transposition.},

Abstract = {This article unpacks the role that analogical reasoning plays in
   epistemic learning, helping actors identify and evaluate what solutions
   can be used to fix complex, high-stakes policy problems. Based on recent
   research in cognitive psychology, we develop a two-stage analogical
   reasoning model of learning in which core causal lessons are transferred
   to the current target case, but where contextual differences are also
   discounted. The result is the restriction of the set of solutions
   considered in a policy debate to those that have positive source cases
   associated with them, and no compelling negative source cases. In the
   Banking Union case study assessed in this article, we provide evidence
   that analogical reasoning did play an important role in setting the
   parameters of the debates. The article concludes with a call for policy
   analysts to pay more attention to how comparisons with the past
   structure policy debates.},

Abstract = {The article attempts to identify major factors of the nationalization of
   the vote in contemporary Russia using the two level approach: the
   between- and within-region. The former compares regions as units of
   analysis while the latter additionally takes into account voting in
   municipalities to obtain levels of voting homogeneity within the
   regions. The study uses data from the last 2012-2016 national-regional
   electoral cycle investigating both federal and regional election
   results. Following Ishiyama (2002) for the between-region level of
   analysis the Regional Party Vote Inequality index has been utilized. The
   Party Nationalization Score proposed by Jones and Mainwaring (2003) has
   been applied to the measurement of voting territorial diversity at the
   within-region level. The results show that regional political factors
   may be still considered as major drivers of the nationalization of the
   vote as it did in the 1990s. The difference is that in politically
   recentralized Russia non-competitive regions headed by politically
   strong governors provides between-region inequality rather than
   contributing to nationalization. At the same time, the similarity
   continues in the ability of governors' ``political machines{''} to
   contribute homogeneity of the vote, but only within their regions. (C)

Abstract = {It is usually assumed that the cost of abating pollution is the main
   deterrent of domestic support for international climate cooperation. In
   particular, some scholars have argued that, due to the burden of
   pollution abatement, businesses commonly constrain governments, which
   then take less cooperative positions on global climate agreements. I
   suggest that this argument needs further qualification:
   pollution-related costs rarely have unconditional effects on preferences
   for global climate agreements. Instead, a sector's pollution level is
   more likely to influence preferences for climate cooperation if mediated
   by its trade exposure. If pollution is high, firms in high-trade sectors
   may be less able to absorb climate regulation, and hence they should be
   more sensitive to climate cooperation. If pollution is low, firms in
   high-trade sectors may support climate cooperation, because by being
   more efficient they are more capable of adjusting to regulation. These
   dynamics should then affect governmental positions on global climate
   politics. I test my sectoral argument with original data from business
   statements and national communications at the United Nations climate
   negotiations. In line with my argument, I find that businesses in
   trade-open sectors are more likely to oppose climate agreement as their
   sector's emissions increase. I also find that in countries where
   high-emission sectors are open to trade, governments have low
   preferences for climate cooperation. The findings have implications for
   the domestic politics of environmental agreements and the distributive
   politics of global public good provision.},

Title = {Rethinking Affective Experience and Popular Emotion: World War I and the
   Construction of Group Emotion in International Relations},
Journal = {POLITICAL PSYCHOLOGY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {40},
Number = {6, SI},

Abstract = {Research in International Relations (IR) frequently confronts claims
   about the emotions shared by members of a group. While much attention
   has been devoted to the potential for affective and emotional experience
   beyond the individual level, IR scholars have said less about the
   politics of invoking popular emotion. This article addresses that gap.
   Specifically, we argue that between individual-and even shared-affective
   experience on the one hand and group-based ``popular emotion{''} on the
   other exists not mechanisms of aggregation but rather processes of
   framing, projection, and propagation that are deeply political. We
   distinguish between two tropes that commonly structure references to
   popular emotion: communal emotion, the idealized attribution of an
   authentic, unifying emotional response of ``the people,{''} and mass
   emotion, a volatile and potentially dangerous mob-like reaction, but one
   also susceptible to manipulation. Using the outbreak of World War I as a
   showcase, we demonstrate the political significance of popular emotion,
   including its enduring relevance for understanding contemporary
   populism.},

   organizations (CSOs). We posit that the status of civil society within
   recipient states conditions the effect of democracy aid inflows on
   conflict probability. Using an instrumental variables approach to
   account for endogeneity between aid allocation and conflict propensity,
   we find that democracy aid is destabilizing when directed to
   environments where CSOs are weak and poorly connected to the regime and
   thus are less willing and able to seek change through peaceful means.
   When civil society is stronger and more institutionalized, however,
   larger democracy aid flows pose less threat.},

Abstract = {When citizens experience an irregularity while voting, their confidence
   in elections is diminished, and they are more likely to perceive the
   results of the election as illegitimate. Although there are many
   irregularities that a voter may experience, this article evaluates the
   consequence of extensive wait times to vote on citizen confidence in the
   United States. Utilizing the 2008-2016 Survey on the Performance of
   American Elections (SPAE) the analysis finds that wait times have a
   negative effect on confidence as do challenges with the voting equipment
   and voter registration. The effect of negative experiences extends
   beyond lowered confidence that a voter's ballot is counted as intended
   to lower confidence that ballots at the local, state, and national level
   are counted as intended by voters as well. While extended wait times
   have a limited effect, negatively effecting the confidence in a voter's
   personal ballot and ballots across the local jurisdiction, negative
   experiences with registration or ballots and voting equipment affect
   evaluations of confidence at the personal level and across the local
   jurisdiction, state, and nation.},

Abstract = {European countries have been required to formulate a national preference
   in relation to the EU Financial Transaction Tax. The two leading
   approaches to explaining how the financial sector makes its views felt
   in the political process ? the structural power of the financial
   services sector based on potential disinvestment, and its instrumental
   power arising from direct political lobbying ? fall short of providing a
   comprehensive account. The missing link is how and why policy-makers
   might be willing to adopt the priorities of key sectors of the financial
   services industry. We outline how three levels of ideational power might
   be at work in shaping outcomes, using Ireland as a case study. We argue
   that background systems of shared knowledge that are institutionalised
   in policy networks generated broad ideational convergence between the
   financial sector and policymakers, creating a policy paradigm over the
   priorities of industrial policy in general. Against that backdrop,
   debate over specific policy choices (policy instruments and policy
   settings) can leave room for a wider range of disagreement and indeed
   political and ideational contestation. Irish policymakers proved
   responsive to industry interests in the case of the FTT, but not for the
   reasons normally given.},

Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Although in principle states can bargain over the entire extent of their
   combined territory, we observe historically that states bargain within
   far more limited confines defined by well-bounded claims. We argue that
   this observation stems from the fact that states generally have limited
   territorial aims due either to limited benefits of obtaining additional
   territory and/or the costs of absorbing and controlling new territories
   and their inhabitants. Using a formal model, we show that introducing
   states with limited aims over territory has strategic implications for
   bargaining that have not been appreciated in canonical models that do
   not consider heterogeneity in state preferences. Whereas traditional
   models generally imply that small demands undermine the credibility of a
   challenger's threat, the existence of states with limited territorial
   aims makes limited demands credible, effective, and stable in the face
   of shocks to relative power. We then employ geospatial data on the
   geographic extent of territorial disputes in the period 1947-2000 to
   establish two results: the size of claims is weakly related to the
   relative power of disputants and unaffected by dramatic changes in
   power, and smaller claims are associated with a higher probability that
   the challenger will receive any concession.},

Journal = {GLOBAL POLICY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {10},
Number = {4},
Pages = {593-603},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {This essay examines the AIIB's approach to investing in sustainable
   infrastructure (SI). The main argument is that the AIIB is taking a
   hybrid layered approach to SI investment. On the one hand, the Bank is
   following the `do no harm' pathway of the traditional MDBs, of using
   safeguards to avoid and compensate adverse social and environmental
   impacts. On the other hand, it is pursuing innovation, and a more
   transformative agenda, that encourages investment in SI projects that
   generate broader, positive developmental spillovers. In pursuing its
   hybrid agenda, the AIIB is developing its own multi-layered safeguards
   regime to ensure smooth and strong SI investment, and alignment between
   the Bank's overarching strategic policy, its ESF, sector and thematic
   strategies, and projects. The analysis also details three ways in which
   the AIIB stands out from other MDBs for how it is `trying new things'
   with its approach to SI investment: first, is how `economic
   sustainability' is one of the main considerations for project selection
   alongside environmental, social and governance sustainability; second,
   how the Bank has integrated social and indigenous and oversight
   safeguards into its `environmental and social framework' (ESF); third,
   its creation of large-scale public-private Funds for green finance and
   climate finance.},

Abstract = {Until a few years ago, EU external trade initiatives attracted little
   attention. But matters have been different with TTIP with the United
   States and CETA with Canada. What can explain their politicization?
   Existing research emphasizing institutional changes occasioned by the
   2007 Lisbon Treaty and broader postfunctionalist theories offer valuable
   but limited insights. Recent work on the regulatory content of trade
   deals offers an alternative perspective. This paper builds on that work
   by proposing an account rooted in economic sociology highlighting the
   possibility that agreements assert fundamental values and identities.
   Agreements can thus be symbolically, even existentially, charged,
   especially when they involve major countries or other trading blocs in
   the world. Politicization follows. The case of food with TTIP and CETA,
   two agreements that opponents considered connected and thus even more
   significant, illustrates this.},

Abstract = {There is increasing interest in developing anticipatory governance of
   climate engineering (CE) research. Discourse is the source code with
   which contested futures are written, shaping how future governance
   options can be imagined, designed and institutionalized. ?Cracking the
   code? underpinning the CE research governance debate can, therefore,
   help anticipate and critically reflect upon the ongoing constitution of
   governance. I present a sociology-of-knowledge-based discourse analysis
   (SKAD) of a series of interviews with governance experts from the US,
   the UK and Germany about a proposed Code of Conduct for climate
   engineering research. I illustrate how ? by shaping what is defined as
   the object(s) of governance, why governance is considered necessary, and
   who is assigned the authority to govern ? the underlying discursive
   structure of a given governance debate can shape governance development.},

Abstract = {This study examines whether negative contact with immigrants promotes
   voting for radical right-wing parties, to what extent this relationship
   can be explained by feelings of outgroup threat, and whether this
   relationship depends on perceived personal and collective self-efficacy.
   Hypotheses were tested among 630 native Dutch respondents, mainly living
   in multicultural neighborhoods. The results show that negative contact
   with immigrants is associated with feelings of personal (egocentric) and
   group (sociotropic) threat, and both these feelings, in turn, are
   associated with radical right-wing voting. However, negative intergroup
   contact is less strongly related to egocentric threat when individuals
   feel able to personally address negative situations with other people
   (personal self-efficacy). Furthermore, the findings suggest that
   negative intergroup contact is less strongly related to sociotropic
   threat when individuals believe that people in their neighborhood are
   able to collectively address some negative situations (collective
   self-efficacy).},

Abstract = {In the nationwide debates in the build-up to the Ghana elections of
   December 2016, the New Patriotic Party, then in the opposition, claimed
   that 76,000 individuals were registered on both the Togolese and the
   Ghanaian voters' registers, casting doubt on the citizenship status of
   voters who crossed the border from Togo to vote in Ghana. The issues
   that political parties continually raise about the voters' register
   result in recurrent debates about identification documents and
   belonging. This article poses the underlying questions that many
   election analyses overlook: who is the electorate? Who decides who
   belongs to the nation? I argue that the criteria for belonging are
   neither those that are set in the law, nor those that seem to be
   suggested by political parties, but those that are decided at a local
   level where communities are the real gatekeepers of the vote. This
   article contributes to the literature on elections in Africa by
   highlighting the porosity of borders in a mobile world, not purely in
   terms of electoral outcomes, but in terms of broader issues about
   citizenship and belonging.},

Abstract = {This article tests the extent to which the organization and stringency
   of occupational health and safety regulation complements the dominant
   mode of coordination in the political economy. While the UK explicitly
   sanctions risk-cost-benefit trade-offs, other European countries mandate
   ambitious safety goals. That contrast appears to reflect cleavages
   identified in the Varieties of Capitalism literature, which suggests
   worker protection regimes are stronger in coordinated market economies
   than in liberal market economies. Our analysis of Germany, France, UK
   and the Netherlands, shows that the varied organization of their
   regulatory regimes is explained through a three-way complementarity with
   their welfare systems and modes of coordination. However, despite varied
   headline goals, we find no systematic differences in the stringency of
   those countries' regulatory protections insofar as they all make
   trade-offs on safety. Instead, the explicitness, rationalizations and
   logics of trade-offs vary according to each country's legal system,
   state tradition and coupling between regulation and welfare system.},

Abstract = {Why does combat success sometimes fail to produce a stable and durable
   post-war settlement? In the 1965 war, India successfully defended
   against a Pakistani invasion, but did not improve the long-term security
   of Kashmir or establish deterrence against Pakistan. I argue that, to
   deter rivals after war, states must couple battlefield success with
   credible signals of resolve, such as retaining captured territory or
   risking a wider war. In 1965, India used both denial and punishment
   strategies, but both failed to establish post-war deterrence because it
   judged the necessary signals of resolve to be too costly.},

Title = {Can't get no learning: the Brexit fiasco through the lens of policy
   learning},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF EUROPEAN PUBLIC POLICY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {27},
Number = {5, SI},
Pages = {703-722},
Month = {MAY 3},
Abstract = {It seems paradoxical to suggest that theories of learning might be used
   to explain policy failure. Yet the Brexit fiasco connects with recent
   approaches linking varieties of policy learning to policy pathologies.
   This article sets out to explain the UK government's (mis)management of
   the Brexit process from June 2016 to May 2019 from a policy learning
   perspective. Drawing on interviews with UK policy-makers and
   stakeholders, we ask how did the UK government seek to learn during the
   Brexit negotiations? We consider four modes of learning: reflexivity,
   epistemic, hierarchical, and bargaining. By empirically tracing the
   policy process and scope conditions for each of these, we argue that
   learning through the first three modes proved highly dysfunctional. This
   forced the government to rely on bargaining between competing factions,
   producing a highly political form of learning which stymied the
   development of a coherent Brexit strategy. We argue that the analysis of
   Brexit as a policy process - rather than a political event - reveals how
   policy dynamics play an important role in shaping the political context
   within which they are located. The article concludes that public policy
   analysis can, therefore, add significant value to our understanding of
   Brexit by endogenising accounts of macro political developments.},

Abstract = {Security dilemma theorists have long recognized the importance of
   empathy to the de-escalation of conflict between actors caught in
   security dilemma dynamics, but they have left empathy undertheorized and
   have neglected to recognize its deeply contested nature. This article
   responds to this omission by bringing multidisciplinary literature on
   empathy to bear on security dilemma thinking. Contrary to some
   contemporary empathy research that draws attention to its automatic,
   unconscious, and intuitive properties, the article highlights the
   deliberate, effortful, and reflexive capacity to empathize across
   complex social contexts such as security dilemma dynamics. It shows how
   empathy of this kind can lead actors to moderate their positions on key
   issues at the heart of a conflict, reinterpret their interests, and
   broaden the zone of possible agreement between themselves and an
   adversary. The article demonstrates these notions empirically by
   locating empathy within the de-escalation of tensions between the United
   States and Iran between 2009 and 2016. Drawing on primary interview
   material with former U.S. officials, the argument is made that the
   development of specific empathic capacities by key U.S. officials played
   an important and unrecognized role in the de-escalation of security
   dilemma dynamics between the United States and Iran.},

Abstract = {Qualitative interviews were conducted with nine members of the Islamic
   State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) and Al-Qaeda currently incarcerated in
   Kuwait's Central Prison. The semistructured interviews attempted to
   understand psychosocial factors in Kuwait that contributed to their
   decision to join extremist organizations. Interviews were analyzed using
   Interpretive Phenomenological Analysis (IPA) and the emergent themes
   identified the following core themes explaining their involvement: (1)
   religious identity development; (2) personal connections; (3)
   propaganda; (4) defense of Islam; and (5) social marginalization.
   Participants described a process whereby their religion became a central
   part of their personal identity. As their religious identity developed,
   they became involved in Islamic organizations where they met people
   involved with ISIS or Al-Qaeda. These social connections exposed them to
   jihadi propaganda which, in addition to increased military conflict in
   the Middle East, crystallized their beliefs that Islam is under attack,
   and they were religiously obligated to defend it. The results also
   identified societal factors that increased the probability of engaging
   in terrorism including relatively low levels of education, coming from
   low socioeconomic groups in Kuwait, and feeling socially marginalized by
   broader Kuwaiti society.},

Abstract = {Will emerging technologies increase the risk of conflict escalation?
   This paper develops a framework for evaluating the role of technology in
   different types of intra-war escalation. It then uses the framework to
   probe empirically the possible role of technology in escalation through
   three carefully chosen cases from Cold War. The findings largely cast
   doubt on the idea of emerging technologies as an independent, primary
   driver of otherwise avoidable escalation, suggesting instead that
   technology more likely functions as an intervening variable - a
   sometimes necessary, but rarely sufficient, condition for escalation.
   The conclusion explores the implications of this analysis for the
   future.},

Abstract = {State mobilization is crucial for promoting social participation in
   mainland China. Due to its historically weak roots, social
   participation's limited popularity reflects the failure of China's
   current instrumental mobilization approach which focuses on risk
   control, bureaucratism, and implementing top-down directives. As
   explained in this article, mobilization should be a value-oriented and
   inclusive process that emphasizes people's happiness rather than
   achieving bureaucratic goals. This research contributes to the field of
   study by examining the key elements of value-oriented mobilization based
   on data from a national, large-scale survey conducted in mainland China.
   The implications for the development of policy for, and the part
   nonprofits can play in, social participation mobilization in China are
   also discussed.},

Abstract = {This article provides a roadmap to help analysts approach the
   under-researched phenomena of policy-making driven to some extent by an
   attempt to show that governments and broader governing systems have a
   policy in place to manage tough policy issues, rather than addressing
   deeper causal factors of the problem. The metaphor of placebo policies
   is used to explore these issues, supported by a novel secondary metaphor
   of a `policy trap' (expectations on governments and governing systems
   being greater than their capacity to realise). Examining the political
   value of `doing something', it suggests that placebo responses are often
   the least risky means of escaping from policy traps. The framework is
   illustrated using a process of triangulation, though a detailed
   examination of the 1998 appointment of a `Drugs Tsar' under the UK's
   first term New Labour government.},

Abstract = {Institutional constraints on executive behavior are commonly understood
   to be crucial constitutional features that limit state expropriation,
   protect property rights, and promote economic development. Combining new
   data describing the presence of parliamentary constraints for the entire
   European continent with data on city sizes, we build upon theories of
   endogenous economic growth to demonstrate that paths of both economic
   and political development over the long span of European history from
   1200 to 1900 are the consequence of a common process of urban
   agglomeration. In doing so, we provide evidence that both outcomes-the
   existence of constraining institutions and growth-are driven by initial
   conditions that fostered technical know-how embodied in urban-dwelling
   artisans who, in turn, were able to force institutional limits on
   rulers' actions. Hence, instead of reflecting a true underlying cause of
   development, parliamentary constraints are themselves outcomes
   determined by an endogenous process of growth.},

Abstract = {The current migration and refugee crisis in Europe requires an
   understanding of the different migration drivers beyond the well-known
   economic determinants. In this article, we view migration from a broader
   human security perspective and analyze the determinants of regular and
   asylum seeker migration flows from Africa to Europe for the period 1990
   to 2014. Our results show that, in addition to economic determinants, a
   combination of push and pull factors influences migration decisions of
   individuals. In particular, rising political persecution, human rights
   violations, ethnic tensions, political instability, and civil conflicts
   in African source countries are all significantly associated with
   increased migration flows into European destination countries.
   Therefore, our results underscore the need for the European Union and
   European countries to collaborate with the source countries, not only in
   terms of supporting economic development in the source countries but
   also in promoting human security: human rights, democracy, peace, and
   social stability.},

Abstract = {Many scholars are dissatisfied with the tendency of research and
   teaching in the field of international relations to be framed as clashes
   among competing schools of thought. I examine two prominent options for
   reform that relate to the schools and offer one element of an
   alternative path forward. The first option, which I term analytical
   singularism, calls for the abandonment of the IR schools and their
   replacement with a single, uniform framework for the study of
   international relations. By virtue of a constricted ontology and
   partialist epistemology, this option is plagued by omitted variable bias
   and underspecified modeling of important international processes. The
   second option, analytical eclecticism, suggests that improved IR studies
   might emerge from the consideration of interactions between causal
   factors that are drawn from the different IR schools of thought.
   Analytical eclecticism holds promise but faces serious challenges
   arising from its preference for qualitative methods and context-specific
   epistemology. I then outline a process of collaborative challenges
   between adherents of the different IR schools as one way by which we
   might advance research in international relations.},

Abstract = {Baden-Wuerttemberg's economy is characterized by a close combination of
   highly specialized R\&D-intensive industry and business related
   services, with the manufacturing sector generating a significantly
   higher share of value added than the average of the federal states
   (Lander). Over the long-term trend, these structural framework
   conditions have generated above-average GDP growth rates and also per
   capita income. Another peculiarity ist that economic output is generated
   relatively even within the regions of the federal state (Land). This
   economic model requires low transaction costs in the broadest sense to
   serve a large relevant market. For this reason unhindered access to
   international markets is a necessary prerequisite for prosperity.
   However, there must be a certain competitive and innovation advantage.
   Maintaining the competitiveness and innovation capacity of the location
   is a permanent task for economic policy.},

Journal = {PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION},

Volume = {97},

Abstract = {After the international financial crisis, new financial regulation was
   adopted at the international, regional and national levels, raising the
   issue of how to promote regulatory coherence, defined as the consistency
   between the rules adopted at different governance levels and in a
   variety of policy venues. A major recent area of reform concerned the
   loss absorbing capacity (LAC) of banks. In practice, the lack of
   regulatory coherence concerning LAC hampers the effective resolution of
   large international banks in a timely manner, ultimately undermining
   financial stability. We examine the role of regulators in the quest for
   coherence on LAC, explaining the incentives they had and how they
   deployed their delegated competences at different levels to achieve
   coherent rules that ensure financial stability. Theoretically, we
   combine insights from the public administration and political economy
   literatures. Methodologically, we process trace the making of LAC rules
   on three governance levels and in multiple policy venues.},

   through Impact Investment},

Volume = {10},
Number = {3},

Abstract = {Publicized as a global call for action in 2015, the United Nations
   General Assembly passed a resolution on the Sustainable Development
   Goals 2030 (SDGs). Before issuing the SDGs in 2015, the United Nations
   Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) has already identified in
   2014, as part of their World Investment Report, that especially
   developing countries are facing an estimated USD 2.5 trillion funding
   gap annually in the efforts to achieve the SDGs. Yet, the investment
   opportunities and challenges for investors, when contributing to the
   closure of this funding gap while benefiting from its economic potential
   have not been widely discussed. Despite that Foreign Direct Investments
   (FDI) are a key driver to sustainable economic growth and prosperity of
   a nation, policies and a holistic framework linking the 2030 Agenda to
   actionable investment opportunities for private investors are missing.
   Furthermore, a global platform capturing, channeling and promoting
   investment projects aiming to achieve the SDGs through impact investment
   has not been established. Utilizing global financial resources more
   effectively while developing new approaches and tools to promote impact
   investments, which demonstrate the benefits for investors to tap into
   the funding gap of the 2030 Agenda, will have the potential to
   significantly shape and influence the future of FDI.},

Abstract = {Peacekeeping is widely considered to be an effective means of preventing
   civil war recurrence. However, as peace has collapsed in a considerable
   number of cases despite peacekeeping efforts, we are left with the
   question which combinations of peacekeeping environments and
   peacekeeping missions lead to lasting peace. This article compares 22
   peacekeeping missions between 1990 and 2012. While prominent United
   Nations documents assume that the success of post-conflict peacekeeping
   primarily depends on the features of the mission itself, the analysis
   shows that characteristics of the terminated civil war have a strong
   influence on whether peace endures. Restrained peacekeeping, defined by
   low troop density, non-robustness, and a lead nation that is not a
   permanent member of the Security Council, only succeeds in preserving
   peace in conducive environments. Inconclusive war endings, evenly
   distributed military capabilities at war's end, ethnic conflicts, and
   high intensity create a particularly difficult context for peacekeeping.},

Abstract = {In a context of welfare austerity and growing inequalities many citizens
   ask for public sector reforms in the health sector and for community
   action as a relevant practice. However, analyses of community action for
   health are still limited to single actions. For this reason, this
   article analyzes community action for health as a whole process of a
   public intervention in the neighbourhood context, including multiple
   actors and actions. Based on research on four disadvantaged districts in
   Barcelona, we develop and apply an analytical tool that allows to
   identify facilitators and challenges of community action for health on
   three dimensions of policy: symbolic (why), substantive (what) and
   operational (how). In this regard, several factors emerge as key ones:
   generating a shared discourse on health and its assets, developing a
   common and integral agenda (health promotion, prevention and treatment),
   ensuring institutional recognition and improving participation and
   involvement at all times of the different agents.},

Abstract = {Does public opinion act as a constraint on military action, are ordinary
   citizens the easily manipulated targets of the public relations efforts
   of their governments, or does the general public react as assertively to
   threats as decisionmakers? This article examines the causal connection
   between military action, public opinion and threats. Empirically, it
   focuses on the pattern of EU member state participation in two recent
   military operations: the 2011 intervention in Libya and the operation
   against the self-proclaimed Islamic State (IS). Three competing causal
   models on the relationship between threats, public opinion and military
   action were derived from the scholarly literature and tested with
   coincidence analysis. The results of the analysis show that public
   opinion acted as a constraint on executives during the Libya operation.
   However, there was no direct causal link between public opinion and
   military participation in the operation against IS, in which both
   military action and public support were an effect of threat. More
   generally, the results suggest that the context of the intervention is
   decisive for the relation between threat, military action and public
   support. More specifically, whether public opinion constitutes a
   constraint on military action or is an effect of threats to national
   interests depends on whether these threats are clear and tangible.},

Abstract = {Interpretations of the nature of integration since the outbreak of the
   euro crisis differ greatly. Either observers see a full restoration of
   national control or they find a substantial upgrade of supranational
   autonomy. In light of these contradicting perspectives, this article
   searches for general patterns of crisis-driven integration. To this end,
   it analyses the key institutions of the reformed European economic
   governance. The findings show that control over risk-reducing and
   market-making institutions have been delegated to supranational
   institutions whereas control over all risk-sharing and market-correcting
   institutions has remained in the hands of the member states. This
   pattern of pooling and delegation of competences reflects the superior
   bargaining power of creditor states during the crisis. As a consequence,
   crisis-driven integration has deepened the structural asymmetry between
   market-making and market-correcting of European integration.},

Abstract = {While doing good for specific citizens and users is often considered a
   powerful motivator among public service employees, little research has
   rigorously evaluated how public managers can promote individualized
   prosocial motivation. We follow recent studies on the behavioural
   implications of `user orientation' to explore how public managers can
   use a specific leadership strategy-transformational leadership-to
   reinforce employees' individualized prosocial motivation. Combining a
   field experiment with 80 childcare centre managers and survey reports
   from their 590 preschool teachers, we assess the effect of a
   transformational leadership training programme on user orientation. The
   results show a positive effect on user orientation three months after
   the training programme but no persistent effect 15 months after the
   intervention. This implies that, at least in the short term, public
   managers can use transformational leadership behaviours to stimulate
   user orientation.},

Abstract = {New actors and emerging norms are strengthening the focus on the
   protection of cultural heritage in conflict zones and the codification
   of transnational legal processes. Following the destruction of cultural
   and religious sites in Timbuktu in 2012, the International Criminal
   Court (ICC) prompted a watershed moment in international criminal
   justice-the Al Mandi trial, which represented the first ever case before
   an international court where the defendant was solely charged with the
   war crime of destruction of cultural heritage. The Al Mandi case
   provided an opportunity to identify the victims of crimes of destruction
   of cultural heritage in international law. Beyond the local communities
   for whom the destroyed sites were of value, it is apparent that the
   ``international community,{''} personified in this case by UNESCO
   emerged as an actor with legal and symbolic standing. This article
   charts the trajectory through which UNESCO became the representative-via
   bifurcation-of the international community in cases of destruction of
   cultural heritage.},

Abstract = {This article analyses the rationale for and impacts of Conservative
   Party overseas volunteering projects from 2007 to 2017. Using interview
   data and participant observation, we uncover aims of project founders
   and explore impacts of volunteering on Party members and policy. We make
   three substantial contributions. The first focuses on the survival of
   Conservative Party modernisation strategies launched under David
   Cameron. Support for development, particularly Party pledges to spend
   0.7\% of UK gross national income on aid, are poorly explained by
   existing research. We argue that a focus on volunteering helps explain
   the survival of this commitment. Second, we argue that volunteering
   experience may support sustained Party policy change by enhancing `issue
   ownership'. Our final contribution is providing the first analysis of
   political parties as development-volunteer sending communities. Through
   new data and distinctive contributions, we demonstrate that
   understanding Party-supported volunteering promotes improved
   explanations of Party modernisation persistence and policy change.},

Abstract = {In an important study of popular support for the National Front
   following the November 13, 2015 terrorist attacks in France,
   Vasilopoulos, Marcus, Valentino, and Foucault (2019) argue that (1)
   anger-rather than fear-explains support for the Far Right and (2) the
   effect of fear on support for the Far Right is negative, rather than
   positive, as previous work (including my own) would suggest. However,
   these conclusions are based on statistical models that adjust for anger
   (but no other emotional variables) when investigating the effects of
   fear, and the results indicate the presence of a suppression effect.
   Following a collegial exchange with the authors, I share evidence (which
   they provided) that (1) the effect of fear on support for the Far Right
   is in fact positive and significant (rather than negative) and (2) anger
   and authoritarianism both mediate the effect of fear on support for the
   Far Right. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed.},

Abstract = {Efforts are underway to develop a stronger political science perspective
   regarding the practice of language policy to establish language policy
   as a distinct field of public policy studies. The article's original
   theoretical contribution is to develop a framework, grounded in
   historical institutionalism, to analyse the multi-level institutional
   factors that influence language policy choices relating to regional or
   minority languages within European multi-level states. The framework is
   tested by applying it to analyse the multi-level factors that condition
   language policy decisions regarding the Welsh language, and through
   further investigating the framework's significance and robustness to
   analyse language policy trajectories in two contrasting European cases.
   Overall, the article makes the case for the strengths and adaptability
   of the framework in producing convincing explanations of the multi-level
   dimensions of language policy development in different institutionalised
   contexts and calls for greater investigation of its ability to analyse
   other regional and minority languages in Europe.},

Abstract = {This paper provides a new theoretical framework to explain China's
   strategic behaviour along with its rise and in doing so engages with the
   debate on strategic culture between Colin Gray and Alastair Johnston. We
   suggest that China's behaviour is shaped by two variables: realpolitik
   realist threat perceptions on the strategic level and Confucian moralist
   cultural norms on the ideational level. In the case of a high strategic
   threat, China's behaviour will be heavily influenced by the realpolitik
   variable in Chinese culture and become offensive in nature. Under low
   strategic threat, China's policy will follow the Confucian tradition and
   thereby emphasize the non-use of force and resort to defensive
   principles. When external threats change from high to low, Chinese
   behaviour will feature a combination of `realpolitik' and
   `Confucianism', that is, a self-constrained offensive policy. China's
   foreign policy in the South China Sea after the Cold War is a case study
   that illustrates the utility of this new strategic culture framework.},

Abstract = {The political and institutional coordinates that appear in official
   classifications of the victims of the Peruvian armed conflict
   (1980-2000) affect their subsequent recognition as beneficiaries of
   reparations programs. A review of the conceptual bases of the
   Comprehensive Reparations Program calls attention to the tension in the
   design and implementation of this program between a strictly reparative
   approach and another that addresses the structural disparities present
   in the aftermath of the war. Examination of the effects of that tension
   in two cases shows that the early stages of implementing housing
   reparations equated the concept of ``victim{''} with that of ``poor{''}
   and later made poverty a prerequisite for receiving housing reparations
   and points to the difficulty of making an appropriate offer of
   reparations for displaced persons, whose specific problems are not
   properly addressed by the traditional agenda of transitional justice.
   Las coordenadas politicas e institucionales que atraviesan la
   calificacion oficial de las victimas del conflicto armado peruano
   (1980-2000) afectan su consiguiente reco-nocimiento como beneficiarios
   de programas de reparacion. Al revisar los fundamentos conceptuales del
   Programa Integral de Reparaciones destacamos una tension tension en el
   diseno e implementacion de este programa entre una perspectiva
   propiamente de reparacion y una perspectiva de combate a las
   disparidades estructurales presentes en el periodo posconflicto.
   Examinamos la presencia y efectos de esta tension en dos casos
   concretos. El primero muestra como los inicios en la implementacion de
   reparaciones en vivienda equipararon la figura de la victima con la de
   pobre, y posteriormente pusieron a la pobreza como requisito para
   recibir reparaciones en vivienda. El segundo muestra la dificultad de
   proponer una oferta adecuada de reparaciones para personas desplazadas,
   al ser una poblacion cuyas caracteristicas no encajan en la agenda
   clasica de la justicia transicional.},

Abstract = {All major theoretical approaches that explain the growing rivalry
   between the United States (US) and China share a common prediction: as
   tensions develop, the US and China will each construct a master
   narrative emphasizing zero-sum interests, the efficacy of coercion, and
   the perceived blamelessness of the Self for the Other's aggressions.
   However, the concrete process by which these narratives emerge has been
   neither explicitly theorized nor measured in practice. We theorize that
   in the digital media age, narratives emerge when `memes'-discrete,
   widely circulated images/descriptions of the Self or Other-are connected
   into coherent stories that eventually coalesce into a master narrative
   of rivalry. We therefore argue that tracking the speed and spread of
   memes provides a useful indicator of security dilemma dynamics. To this
   end, we note that in the United States the US-China rivalry is
   associated with a prominent meme that describes China as `challenging
   the international rules-based order' (RBO). We use qualitative and
   quantitative text analysis, including network and plagiarism analysis,
   to track the spread of this meme. We provide preliminary evidence that
   the RBO meme and the `revisionist China' narrative may be crowding out
   other, less malign narratives about China's rise.},

Abstract = {This paper analyzes the foreign policy of President Enrique Pena Nieto
   in terms of security. It first reviews the foreign policy approaches of
   his administration and his attempt to ``restore{''} Mexico's leadership
   as an ``emerging power,{''} as well as the emphasis on economic reforms
   and the intention to ``desecuritize{''} foreign policy. The article
   argues that there were three factors that ultimately caused the
   intention of desecuritizing foreign policy to fail and that, instead,
   led it to become an uninvited guest: the surge in the homicide rate from
   2014, the crisis arising from the disappearance of students from the
   Ayotzinapa normal college, and the murder of a number of alleged
   criminals in Tlatlaya by the armed forces, as well as the arrival of
   Donald Trump to the presidency of the United States, which made security
   an important card to play in negotiating with that country. The text
   concludes that, even if the processes of securitization or
   desecuritization are rhetorical tropes used by state actors, in the end
   they must correspond with reality.},

Abstract = {This article discusses causal inference techniques for social scientists
   through the lens of applied microeconomics. We frame causal inference
   using the standard of the ideal experiment, emphasizing problems of
   omitted variable bias and reverse causality. We explore how laboratory
   and field experiments can succeed and fail to meet this ideal in
   practice. We then outline how different methods and the statistical
   assumptions behind them can lead to causal inference in nonexperimental
   contexts. We explain when problems with omitted variable bias can and
   cannot be addressed using observed controls. We consider tools for
   studying natural experiments, including difference-in-differences,
   instrumental variables, and regression discontinuity techniques.
   Finally, we discuss additional concerns that may arise such as
   weighting, clustering, multiple inference, and external validity. We
   include Stata code for implementing each of these methods as well as a
   series of checklists for researchers detailing important robustness and
   design checks. Throughout, we emphasize the importance of understanding
   the context of a study and implementing analyses in a way that
   acknowledges strengths and limitations.},

Abstract = {Public service motivation (PSM) and ethical behavior are central
   concerns in public administration. Yet, experimental evidence on the
   causes of ethical behavior and the causal effects of PSM remains scarce,
   curtailing our understanding of both. This article draws on a novel
   survey experimental design to improve this understanding. The design is
   based on a simple insight: asking about PSM can render salient
   PSM-oriented identities of respondents. By randomizing the order of PSM
   and outcome questions, PSM may be exogenously activated among survey
   respondents, and the causal effects of this activation assessed. Drawing
   on this design and a sample of over 5,000 Chilean central government
   employees-the largest experimental PSM survey sample to date we find
   that PSM activation enhances willingness to report ethical problems to
   management. This provides the first experimental evidence that PSM may
   promote ethical behavioral intent, and suggests that activating public
   employees' PSM can benefit public sector ethics.},

Abstract = {Governments around the world are building online infrastructures which
   they hope will become the main channels through which they interact with
   citizens. This new, globally dominant orthodoxy in policymaking is
   closely tied to design-thinking which claims that digital technology
   addresses the dual crises of state capacity and public trust. Through an
   examination of virtual courts, this paper offers a critical analysis of
   the organising principles and the effects of the digital government
   revolution. It shows that virtual courts reconfigure the role of the
   public in `seeing justice being done', leading to the emergence of a new
   `visuality of technocracy'. However, it questions the claim that digital
   technology will transform public services and increase public trust.
   Creating new virtual spaces and interfaces is not a costless endeavour
   and, while it may make public services more convenient, it recasts
   citizens as passive viewers of justice and individual users of public
   services.},

Title = {Does Collaboration Improve Organizational Efficiency? A Stochastic

Abstract = {Despite an abundance of research on collaboration, relatively little
   attention has been paid to the impact of collaboration on organizational
   outputs. This study helps fill this gap by unveiling the efficiency
   implications of collaborative arrangements. Using stochastic frontier
   (SF) analysis, we evaluate the efficiency of U.S. cities' use of Energy
   Efficiency Conservation Block Grant (EECBG) funds in implementing
   sustainability programs and the extent to which collaboration influences
   resulting efficiency levels. The findings indicate the presence of
   considerable inefficiency in cities' use of EECBG dollars. However,
   cities' collaboration with a greater variety of governmental and
   community organizations is found to reduce this inefficiency, supporting
   the positive effects of collaborative partnerships in public policy
   implementation and management. Collaboration's efficiency-improving
   effects are, however, not linear; its marginal effects diminish as
   cities approach the highest levels of collaboration. This implies that
   while collaboration brings a positive impact on achieving cost-efficient
   organizational outcomes, there is an optimal level of collaboration for
   cities to engage in.},

Abstract = {The main aim of the paper is to analyze the constitutional backgrounds
   of the local taxes' legal regulation, assessment, and collection in the
   Slovak Republic and the Czech Republic. The paper starts with the
   general constitutional regulation of taxes and continues with the
   critical analyses of local taxes' regulation and application in both
   countries. It follows the legal power of legal norms, starting with the
   international aspects - the European Charter of Local Self-Government,
   continuing with the constitutional issues and finishing with the
   statutory regulation of local taxes. The first part of the hypothesis
   that even if the constitutional regulation in these countries is very
   different and gives different opportunities for the local taxes
   adoptions both in national Parliaments and in local councils, the
   practice in both countries is very similar, was (with a small difference
   in the actual use of given possibilities to adjust the real property tax
   revenues by the municipalities, which speaks in favour of the Slovak
   ones compared to the Czech) confirmed. However, the second part of the
   hypothesis that in both countries local self-government units do have
   adequate powers to impose and collect local taxes was rejected. In the
   conclusion, the comparison between the Czech Republic and the Slovak
   Republic is made and possible changes de lege ferenda are presented.},

Abstract = {This article shows that, in the study of immigrant integration policy in
   the U.S. states, it is critical to report data and coding decisions for
   individual laws. This analysis uses an updated and public database of
   law-level decisions, which includes 2,703 legislative actions recorded
   by the National Conference of State Legislatures from 2005 to 2016.
   These data are used to estimate models of aggregate state policy
   activity in a variety of ways: as a single continuum of policy balance
   versus separate models of welcoming and hostile, lumping all policy
   subareas together versus analyzing a specific subarea, and lumping all
   years together in one cross section versus panel analysis. The results
   in these models differ enough to indicate that reporting codes for
   individual-level laws is absolutely essential so that each researcher
   easily can construct the measure that fits his or her theoretical
   framework best.},

Abstract = {This paper studies non-state militant group emulation and development of
   a special operation capability that stands in stark contrast to the
   normal repertoire of guerilla and terror tactics. Building on evidence
   of one well-documented Islamic State attack in 2012 that fit many of the
   criteria of a special operation, we analyzed the mission using concepts
   from strategic studies to understand the decision-making behind it. We
   then expanded our search of Islamic State operational claims looking for
   other examples, in order to understand the scope and frequency of
   Islamic State special operations since 2006. We found solid evidence of
   at least three Islamic State special operations over a decade: Ramadi,
   Iraq (2007), Haditha, Iraq (2012), and Abu Ghraib/Taji, Iraq (2013).
   Using these insights, we present two key levers - leadership and

Abstract = {The link between environmental frames and policy outcomes in China is
   explored. Environmental nongovernment organizations' (ENGOs) issue
   interpretation and presentation affect environmental policy changes. The
   notion of `frame alignment' is introduced, and it is argued that it can
   serve to link ENGOs' advocacy needs and frame resonance among different
   stakeholders, thus successfully promoting advocacy. Based on in-depth
   interviews and analysis of news reports over a span of 10 years, it is
   found that where ENGOs are able to align their issue frames with those
   of the central state and media, the resulting frame resonance smooths
   policy change. In contrast, where ENGOs adopt conflict frames critical
   of state authorities, the absence of alignment leads to a slim chance of
   policy change. The findings shed light on why some ENGOs successfully
   create linkage and achieve their desired outcomes while others fail to
   do so.},

Abstract = {Governments use tariffs to manage the politics of international economic
   integration. To navigate competing demands on trade policy, governments
   can target tariff rates to individual products. But existing theories
   miss an important aspect of tariffs: they also need to be enforced at
   border crossings, which for some governments creates substantial
   challenges. Faced with high tariffs, firms can misclassify their
   products into categories with lower tariff rates. Pointing to the
   potential for such tariff evasion, I discuss the difficulties for
   governments in targeting tariffs for political gain, and I derive
   implications for trade politics. Constraints on the ability of
   governments to enforce tariffs, in the form of low bureaucratic
   capacity, emerge as an institutional determinant of trade policy,
   discouraging the use of product-specific tariff rates. Disaggregated
   tariff data provide empirical evidence for this argument. The article
   identifies an institutional constraint on trade politics, contributes to
   growing literatures on firm heterogeneity and on illicit cross-border
   economic activity, and speaks to debates on trade policy and government
   revenue.},

Abstract = {The dynamic quality of protracted intra-state conflicts is a factor that
   complicates and sometimes confounds the efforts of peacemakers. Building
   on this insight, and given the prevalence of conflicts of this type in
   the contemporary international system, this paper takes up a central
   question: how can peacemakers adapt to changing dynamics along the
   parameters of a protracted intra-state conflict in order to cultivate
   effective resolution of the conflict? Inspired by the theme of this
   special issue on new diplomacy in new conflicts, this paper draws on and
   modifies the concepts of `adaptive peacemaking' and `adaptive
   peacebuilding' (de Coning, 2018; Okulski, 2017) in order to provide a
   heuristic device for evaluating peacemaking efforts within protracted
   intra-state conflicts. In that vein, this paper examines third-party
   mediation within the setting of the second Sudanese civil war through
   the lens of a modified adaptive peacemaking approach. The resulting
   analysis allows for a conceptual and empirical assessment of the
   prospects as well as the perils of `adaptive peacemaking' within the
   context of protracted civil wars.},

Abstract = {While socioeconomic crisis - like in Germany after World War I and in
   Russia after the Cold War - is a necessary precondition for democratic
   erosion resulting in a breakdown of democracy, it is not a sufficient
   condition. We identify, in the cases of Weimar Germany and post-Soviet
   Russia, a post-imperial syndrome that includes nationalist irredentism
   and an ambition to return to the status quo ante of a ``great power{''}
   as a main reason why democratization faces specific and enormous
   challenges for former ``great powers.{''} A slide back to
   authoritarianism in post-imperial democracies takes a high toll. It is
   facilitated by international political conflicts, including annexation
   and wars, with new neighbouring states that harbor territories perceived
   as external national homelands like the Sudetenland or Crimea. (C) 2019

Abstract = {The Bologna Process is an international policy project for the
   convergence of higher education structures in the European Higher
   Education Area. Most of the literature on Bologna represents studies
   that focus on the implementation implications of the reforms. The focus
   on the reform process, particularly in relation to the development
   process of Bologna policy actors, has been under-represented in the
   literature. This article investigates the process of the development of
   the main policy actors involved in the Bologna reform in the case of
   Ukraine. The timeframe includes the pre-history of Bologna since
   Ukrainian independence in 1991 until after the introduction of the
   relevant policy changes in 2003, and through to the issue of 2014 Law on
   Higher Education. Empirical data were collected through interviews with
   higher education actors in Ukraine and policy document search. Both
   types of data were thematically analyzed. The analysis in this article
   is informed by the policy learning theory and demonstrates the
   interconnection between path-dependency and change in the development of
   policy actors in the Bologna reform in Ukraine. This article shows that
   the old clusters of higher education actors, and the pre-Bologna
   relationships amongst some of them have been reproduced during the
   Bologna reform. At the same time, such a reproduction of the old during
   the reform was only partial as the Bologna Process has also been
   altering the relationships among some actors to an extent. (C) 2019 The

Abstract = {In this article, I investigate the impact that the rise of regional
   powers as global players has had on the nature of international
   conflict, and also the negotiating table. I focus specifically on China
   and India, and analyze their negotiating behavior in two areas: one
   multilateral, the other regional. Despite the apparent similarities that
   one might assume at first glance, the article points to some significant
   points of difference between these two players. The differences are
   important from a policy perspective, besides being theoretically
   interesting. The argument proceeds in five parts. The first section
   explains the reasoning behind the case selection, with respect to the
   countries (China and India) as well as issue-areas (multilateral trade
   governance, and the Belt and Road Initiative {[}BRI]). It also outlines
   the main hypotheses in Section 1. Section 2 investigates the two
   hypotheses about the negotiation behaviors of China and India in the
   World Trade Organization (WTO). Section 3 takes on a similar comparison
   with reference to the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). Section 4 presents
   the conclusions of the study, and Section 5 offers policy
   recommendations.},

Abstract = {Enhancing the effectiveness of conflict prevention is a major
   preoccupation of the international community. This article focuses on
   operational prevention of conflict, which entails diplomatic efforts to
   avert imminent violence in crisis situations. The conventional
   understanding is that these efforts are short-term and sporadic. In
   contrast, this article identifies and analyzes a type of operational
   prevention that has been institutionalized in order to engage in
   continuous preventive action in a particular conflict. I define
   `institutionalized operational prevention' as a standing mechanism that
   aims to prevent a conflict from becoming violent and prevent low-level
   violence from escalating into large-scale violence. The article
   discusses a number of such mechanisms that have been successful in this
   regard, and offers an explanation for their success. Policymakers should
   consider establishing standing prevention mechanisms in other situations
   that have a persistent risk of large-scale violence. Where structural
   reforms are required to reduce this risk but are politically unfeasible,
   the standing mechanisms may be the only viable means of avoiding
   violence.},

Abstract = {A large body of scholarship suggests that economic grievances play an
   important role in civil wars. But what specific economic activities
   trigger such grievances, and why would governments not take proactive
   steps to limit economic grievances in order to stabilize their regimes?
   This article argues that specific economic activities-those that
   undermine a producer's ability to exit the formal economy-cause
   governments to make taxation decisions that, despite the costliness of
   fighting, increase the likelihood of civil war. An inability for
   producers to exit the formal economy also undermines regional autonomy
   deals by encouraging governments to grab short-term rents despite the
   risk of triggering civil war. After deriving this redistributive
   grievance mechanism by analyzing an infinite-horizon bargaining model
   with endogenous labor supply and economic production, I address a
   specific empirical source of such redistributive grievances: oil-rich
   regions fight separatist civil wars relatively frequently.
   Capital-intense, geographically concentrated, and immobile oil
   production corresponds with conditions in the formal model that predict
   redistributive grievances and war. Moreover, I argue that applying the
   redistributive grievances mechanism to understanding the oil-separatism
   relationship also highlights shortcomings of alternative greed-based
   explanations.},

Abstract = {The rise of further tensions and wars in the Middle East interconnects,
   oversimplifies and radicalizes narratives. The aim of the article is to
   question the scope and practical limits of the mediators' power
   regarding parties' representations of the past. The study is divided
   into four parts. The first describes the specific challenge faced by
   practitioners. The other parts explore the Israeli-Palestinian case,
   focusing on three distinct approaches to contradictory narratives. The
   first can be summarized by the formula `neither nor' (neither the
   Israeli narrative, nor the Palestinian narrative). In concealing
   interpretations of the past, mediators try to do away with the `tyranny
   of the past'. The second approach takes into consideration `both the
   Israeli and the Palestinian narratives'. It tends to be inclusive and to
   consider all interpretations of the past. The third and last approach
   applies a `on the one hand, on the other hand' reasoning in order to
   forge new interpretations of the past. At each stage of the research,
   the purpose is to question the actual impact of these approaches. Do
   they enable the parties to move on, or do they reinforce the deadlock?
   Do they open the minds of the negotiators or do they rather close them?},

   Antideportation Campaign},

Abstract = {Opposition to immigration and the rejection of migrants have long been
   of concern to psychologists. While much is known about negative
   representations of migrants in politics and the media, far less is known
   about positive representations of migrants and immigration. In this
   article, we provide an examination of social representations promoting
   promigrant action in the context of a community campaign opposing the
   deportation of a woman and her young daughter. The woman, who had come
   to the United Kingdom from Malawi seven years prior had lost permission
   to remain following changes to personal circumstances and was facing
   deportation. Our analysis explores the ways in which the campaign's
   mobilization arguments respond to and engage with antimigrant
   representations. It identifies the importance of categorical
   representations concerning the nature, norms, and interests of the local
   community, of the two migrants under threat of deportation, and of those
   seeking to deport them. Contrary to antimigrant representations, the
   migrants at the center of the campaign were presented as ingroup members
   and their potential deportation as a violation of ingroup norms and
   ingroup interests. Finally, we also identify points of ambivalence in
   the campaign's mobilization strategy where arguments reject the
   ascription but not the nature of negative representations of migrants.},

Abstract = {Historical institutionalist research has long struggled to come to terms
   with agency. Yet injecting agency into historical-institutionalist
   accounts is no easy task. If institutions are structuring agents'
   actions, while they are simultaneously being structured by these very
   agents' behavior, the ontological status of institutions remains
   unclear. Hence, most historical-institutional accounts, at the
   conceptual level, tend to downplay the role of agency. However, in this
   way, they also remain incomplete. Following the ``coalitional turn{''}
   in historical institutionalism, we develop a new account of
   institutional change and stability that awards a central role to agency.
   At the heart of our approach is the notion that both stability and
   change in institutions presuppose constant coalition building by
   organized entrepreneurial actors. However, for several reasons, such
   coalition building is complicated, which ultimately leads to
   institutional stability. In addition, we argue that relevant state
   agencies actively shape whether the incumbent coalition or the
   challenger coalition prevails. We illustrate the potential of our
   actor-centered approach to institutional change by analyzing the reform
   of commercial training in Switzerland, tracing developments from the
   beginning of the 1980s until today.},

Abstract = {The article analyzes authoritarian regimes within the post-Soviet
   territory in terms of informal practices (clannishness, clientelism and
   patronage) and their characteristics used by political leaders to form a
   power coalition. It has been argued that any of these informal practices
   determine a power coalition of a certain size, which is consequential
   for regime sustainability. Power coalitions formed on the basis of a
   clan-like nature is the least effective way to retain power and
   generally leads to regime destabilization. Clientelism, which allows for
   forming a power coalition on a wider basis, is a more effective strategy
   in terms of regime sustainability. Maximum regime sustainability is
   reached when patronage practices are used, which require more material
   resources and are only accessible to a limited number of wealthy states.

Abstract = {International political borders have historically performed one
   overriding function: the delimitation of a state's territorial
   jurisdiction, but today they are sites of intense security scrutiny and
   law enforcement. Traditionally, they were created to secure peace
   through the territorial independence of political units. Today borders
   face new pressures from heightened human-mobility, economic
   interdependence (legal and illicit), and perceived challenges from a
   host of nonstate threats. Research has only begun to reveal what some of
   these changes mean for the governance of interstate borders. The
   problems surrounding international borders today go well beyond
   traditional delineation and delimitation. These problems call for active
   forms of governance to manage human mobility and interdependence.
   However, human rights norms sometimes rest uneasily alongside unilateral
   border governance. A research agenda that documents and explains new
   border developments, and critically assesses emerging rules and
   practices in light of international human rights, is an essential
   direction for international studies research.},

Abstract = {Most policy diffusion studies have focused on the adoption of new
   policies. However, the diffusion of the repeal of old policies also
   occurs across organizations and governments. Thus, this study
   contributes to enriching the theoretical development of policy diffusion
   from a different angle and can thereby help us learn more about why
   governments repeal an established policy. Economists have provided
   economic justifications for why a state's prevailing wage law should be
   upheld or abolished depending on their stance. However, the empirical
   results show that economic justification is not a persuasive reason. In
   other words, other, non-economic factors are more influential in the
   repeal of a prevailing wage law: political ideology, union power, and
   regional diffusion. These results are in line with arguments made in
   previous policy termination studies.},

Title = {Assessing mutual trust among EU members: evidence from the European
   Arrest Warrant},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF EUROPEAN PUBLIC POLICY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {26},

Abstract = {International cooperation on criminal justice requires mutual trust: a
   belief that the partner's legal system functions adequately and adheres
   to fundamental norms. The European Union builds its judicial-cooperation
   efforts on a presumption of mutual trust: EU members are assumed to
   trust each other's justice system since they share a commitment to human
   rights and the rule of law. Skeptics argue, however, that such trust
   does not really exist given the wide variation in legal standards and
   practices across Europe. Yet such skepticism has not been supported by
   systematic evidence. This article seeks to offer such evidence and to
   quantify the impact of the lack of mutual trust. It does so by examining
   the record of British and Irish participation in the European Arrest
   Warrant: a fast-track process of surrender of fugitives between Member
   States. We find that judicial authorities in Britain and Ireland deviate
   from the mutual-trust presumption: they accord a more favorable
   treatment to Member States with a stronger rule of law or a better
   human-rights record - and this considerably affects the rate of
   surrenders. This finding offers important implications for the EU's
   justice policy and for understanding cooperation against crime more
   broadly.},

Abstract = {The Brexit referendum triggered a feverish debate over the future of
   Britain. Critics warn of a country stripped of its international
   influence, while advocates insist that it marks the beginning of a new
   phase in British engagement with the world. This article explores a
   notable development in the ideological debate. Some prominent Brexit
   supporters endorse the idea of CANZUK, a union of Canada, Australia, New
   Zealand, and the United Kingdom. We analyse CANZUK as an attempt to
   develop a fruitful post-Brexit imaginary and as a case of transnational
   elite advocacy. We begin by placing CANZUK in the context of debates
   over the `Anglosphere'. We then map the CANZUK advocacy network. Next,
   we examine past plans for uniting English-speaking polities, tracing the
   idea back to late 19th-century debates over settler colonialism. We end
   by sketching some reasons to be sceptical about the project.},

Abstract = {Military academies tend to be strongly linked to the professionalization
   of the armed forces. This explains why many countries in the world have
   created such institutions. The following article studies a potential
   negative externality stemming from military schools: increased coup
   risk. We argue that military academies may create, inculcate, and
   strengthen cohesive views that could conflict with incumbent policies,
   and that these schools establish networks among military officers that
   may facilitate coordination necessary for plotting a putsch. We also
   contend and empirically demonstrate that these negative side effects of
   military academies are in particular pronounced in nondemocracies, that
   is, military academies have diverse effects across regime types. This
   work has significant implications for our understanding civil-military
   relations. Furthermore, we contribute to the literature on military
   education and professionalization, as we suggest that military academies
   are important vehicles through which coups can emerge predominantly in
   authoritarian states.},

Abstract = {Why do some states pursue transitional justice (TJ) in the immediate
   aftermath of armed conflict while others do not? What drives a state to
   select a particular type of justice mechanism over another? Building on
   the political explanations of TJ, we argue that postconflict justice
   (PCJ) decisions are driven by the interests and power of political
   elites shaped by recently ended conflicts. Our empirical analysis shows
   that conflict outcomes and their subsequent impact on the balance of
   power between the government and rebel groups are the most important
   determinants of PCJ decisions. Domestic trials are most likely to emerge
   out of a decisive, one-sided victory while truth commissions and
   reparations are most likely to occur after a negotiated settlement. We
   also find that conflict severity interacts with conflict outcomes to
   affect PCJ decisions.},

Abstract = {Elected leaders adopt ``anticipatory feedback strategies{''} in
   designing public policies that generate support and forestall
   opposition. This contention is at the core of a social construction
   theory of feedback. Officials anticipate approval when policies allocate
   benefits to powerful groups socially constructed as deserving and
   allocate costs or punishment to groups viewed as undeserving,
   particularly if these groups lack political power. Designs for powerful
   groups that are widely viewed as unworthy provide mainly benefits in
   ways that are hidden from the general public who would not approve. For
   politically weak groups regarded as deserving, legislators generally
   design policies that provide promises, but not much in terms of material
   benefits. Often, deception will be used to protect or enhance this
   particular allocation pattern, including the reinforcement,
   perpetuation, or change in the social constructions along with the
   stereotypes, labels, stigma, and accompanying narratives. Using data
   from legislation introduced by the 2016 Arizona Legislature, we find
   that most policy is directed toward providing benefits to positively
   viewed target populations, as expected by the theory, and legislators
   employ deceptive feedback strategies that protect themselves. Feedback
   from the general public, which otherwise might be expected, may be
   precluded by the deceptive strategies being used.},

Abstract = {This article traces the genealogy of the cross as a key Polish national
   symbol back to the independence struggles of the nineteenth century and
   the post-1918 attempts to map the new Polish nation-state over its
   multiethnic territory. Discussing the shifting meaning ascribed to the
   symbol in the changing political conditions in the 1860s and during the
   Second Republic, the article relates the semantic content of the symbol
   to the cycle of solidification and defiance (corresponding with Victor
   Turner's ``structure{''} and ``anti-structure{''}). While, in conditions
   of defiance, during the January Uprising (1863-1864), the cross connoted
   progressive and egalitarian ideas of emancipation and solidarity with
   other nations who were also deemed as deserving their freedom, this
   changed once Poland regained its independence. After the First World
   War, the cross came to be employed as a marker of Poland's territorial
   ambitions and an emblem that redefined ingroup boundaries by excluding
   from the national community the threatening Others: whether Bolsheviks,
   Ukrainians, Belarusians, Lithuanians, or Jews.},

Abstract = {How can we define the emergence of new spaces in the global corporate
   food system? This article argues that regions in food regime theory have
   been overlooked, both geographically and socially. As an example of the
   significance of the regional level, it examines the case of the
   relationship between Egypt and the Gulf states. In addition to Western
   capital, Egypt's corporate food system has been determined by regional
   capital from the Gulf. Gulf investment is one of the largest foreign
   capitals in Egypt's agribusiness sector and it owns companies that have
   controlling market shares of corporate food. It will argue that this has
   been concomitant with the political power of a class hierarchy that
   extends from Egypt into the Gulf Cooperation Council states.},

Abstract = {Tackling redistributive expansion in developing countries, this paper
   explores broader political consequences of social assistance programmes.
   Drawing from the Turkish case, where social welfare expanded since the
   2000s, it examines attitudes of social assistance beneficiaries towards
   transition to presidentialism, which was approved in a referendum in
   2017, and took effect in 2018. Using the results of an original survey,
   it indicates that social assistance benefits played a significant role
   in increasing support for presidentialism, by garnering votes from
   opposition voters, especially those with high-risk perceptions, in
   return for benefits. Given the character of Turkish presidentialism,
   devoid of vital checks and balances, the findings reveal that incumbents
   can mobilise support by using redistributive instruments in the context
   of democratic backsliding.},

Abstract = {In this article, we aim to show that the treatment of wicked problems in
   the literature on public administration approaches is inadequate. We
   briefly discuss the literature on wicked problems and propose a
   conceptualization of wicked problems that, we think, shows the core of
   the problem of wicked problems. Wicked problems, we argue, are wicked
   because the factual and normative aspects of the issues are intertwined
   at actor-level. As a result, the phenomena that Rittel and Webber
   observed at problem level emerge. This has strong implications for
   public administration. Since actors are deciding on responses, a wicked
   problem evokes, what we call, a double governance challenge. The
   governance mechanisms provided in the literature on public
   administration approaches, also the new ones, do not provide responses
   to such double challenge. They either assume that actors do not build
   upon their own, actor-level factual and normative evaluations or that
   some compiled actor or supra-actor might overcome the limitations of the
   actors that together constitute the collective level of wicked problem
   response. Making such assumptions, they apparently conceptualize the
   wicked problem as non-wicked. Therefore, re-iterating, wicked problems
   are indeed wicked: solutions that implicitly conceptualize the wicked
   problem as non-wicked might be perfect, but seem unintelligent. A wicked
   problem, we argue, does not allow perfect, but instead requires
   imperfect, but intelligent responses. In this paper, we then discuss
   four such intelligently imperfect responses. They are necessarily
   imperfect in the sense that they cannot be considered to completely
   cover the problem, but intelligent in the sense that they truly
   acknowledge its wickedness.},

Abstract = {After the Lisbon Treaty came into effect, the European Parliament has
   seen its powers over the negotiations of the European Union's annual
   budget reduced. This article shows that, despite initial setbacks and a
   position of relative weakness in the budgetary negotiations, the
   Parliament can extract, through threat of veto, significant concessions
   in the three pillars of the budget: annual expenditure; long-term
   expenditure; and the revenue side. Through process tracing and
   interviews with key actors, the article evaluates the Parliament's
   successes and failures in negotiating the 2013 budget package and the
   circumstances under which the Parliament can maximise its limited power.},

Abstract = {The European Parliament enjoys an array of powers in development
   cooperation, ranging from legislative and budgetary powers to scrutiny
   and democratic oversight. However, its role has largely been overlooked
   and generally been absent from the key debates in the EU foreign policy
   literature. Partly this stems from the low politics' nature of
   development cooperation, when set against the high politics' of EU
   external relations as typified by CFSP/CSDP and trade. This article
   combines a legal analysis of the EP's post-Lisbon powers in EU
   development cooperation with an examination of the Multiannual Financial
   Framework, the European Consensus on Development and interinstitutional
   interactions to assess how the EP has succeeded in gaining a more
   significant role in this policy field. The article argues that the low
   politics' of EU development cooperation is highly susceptible to the
   EP's institutional assertion and empowerment in overall EU external
   relations.},

Abstract = {Based on a survey of civil servants in the Norwegian central government,
   this article describes perceptions of coordination capacity and examines
   to what degree the variations in perceived coordinating capacity can be
   explained by structural and cultural features. In particular, it focuses
   on the significance of wicked policy areas. Overall the coordination
   capacity is weaker in wicked policy areas than in other policy areas.
   Controlling for other features the coordination capacity is primarily
   related to cultural factors, such as mutual trust, level of conflict,
   and identification with the central government. Some structural
   features, such as administrative level, also have an effect.},

Abstract = {This article proposes a framework to understand and explain the
   occurrence of policy reversals. We argue that the occurrence and absence
   of policy reversals is shaped by the constraints of responsiveness (to
   voters) and responsibility (vis-a-vis creditors, international
   institutions and financial markets). We review the literature on
   reversals and their implications for Southern Europe. We finally
   summarise the main findings of the contributions in the volume, that
   address when and why governments prioritise responsiveness or
   responsibility, as well as the economic consequences of these choices.},

Abstract = {The concept of wicked problems has become widely used in policy
   analysis. The popularity of the concept has led to its overuse, and has
   produced significant conceptual stretching. This paper investigates the
   extent to which this stretching has led to the application of the
   concept to issues which are not wicked' in any meaningful sense. Based
   on a survey of policy experts, we find that few, if any, policy problems
   are perceived to have all the attributes of wicked problems. Although
   the concept does not appear useful in categorizing problems in a strict
   manner, the presence or absence of certain attributes can still be used
   in understanding the problems and in designing solutions for them.},

Abstract = {The evaluation of policy strategies to tackle wicked policy problems
   inevitably involves a paradox of trying to judge solutions for problems
   that have no solutions and for which additional efforts might increase
   the chances of finding better responses. This paper analyzes how the
   concept of small wins can contribute to evaluating progress in wicked
   problem areas in a way that energizes a variety of stakeholders instead
   of paralyzing them and embraces complexity instead of reverting to
   taming and overestimation. It presents a small wins evaluation framework
   that is rooted in the underlying policy perspective of making progress
   through accumulating small wins. It comprises three steps: 1)
   identifying and valuing small wins; 2) analyzing whether the right
   propelling mechanisms are activated so as to accumulate into
   transformative change; 3) organizing that results feed back into the
   policy process to activate new small wins. This framework will
   inevitably clash with unrealistic expectations of addressing wicked
   problems rapidly, radically and comprehensively.},

Abstract = {On the mergers and acquisitions (M\&A) market, buyers and sellers resort
   to experts in order to secure deals. But as these experts might be prone
   to opportunism, firms need to find a way to build trust. We identify two
   trust devices: social ties and public rankings. We explore whether these
   personal and impersonal devices are substitutes, independent or
   complementary. We study the French M\&A market through a mixed-method
   approach. We show that both previous contacts and league table rankings
   of firms contribute to trust and to making deals. These trust devices
   are all the more likely to be used if the deal is risky, especially
   within the sell side (more at risk). We also find that firms tend to
   make deals only with other firms at the same level in the rankings.
   Finally, we find some evidence of substitution between rankings and
   personal ties, especially for low-value deals.},

   Explaining Maoist Violence in India},

Volume = {71},

Abstract = {This article asks why some Indian districts experience chronic Maoist
   violence while others do not. The answer helps to explain India's Maoist
   civil war, which is the product of the accumulation of violence in a few
   districts, as well as to generate a new hypothesis about the causes of
   civil war more generally. The authors argue that, other things equal,
   the emergence of subaltern-led parties at the critical juncture before
   armed organizations enter crowds them out: the stronger the presence of
   subaltern-led political parties in a district at this juncture, the
   lower the likelihood of experiencing chronic armed violence
   subsequently. They develop their argument through field research and
   test its main prediction using an original, district-level data set on
   subaltern incorporation and Maoist violence in India between 1967 and
   2008. The article contributes a new, party-based explanation to the
   literatures on both civil war and Maoist violence in India. It also
   introduces new district-level data on the Maoist movement and on the
   incorporation of subaltern ethnic groups by political parties in India.},

Abstract = {Olson's logic of collective action predicts that business interest
   associations face fewer collective action problems than citizen action
   groups. This article challenges this assumption by arguing that forming
   an organization comes with different collective action problems than
   voicing a joint policy position. This leads us to examine an important
   paradox: Citizen groups face challenges in establishing themselves as
   organizations but find it relatively easy to position themselves on
   policy issues, whereas the reverse is true for business associations. We
   study this paradox empirically based on interviews with spokespersons of
   interest organizations active in the European Union and find support for
   our hypotheses. Our findings demonstrate that citizen groups position
   themselves on policy issues more easily than business interests and that
   this competitive advantage is amplified when policy issues attract the
   attention of the media.},

Abstract = {There is little methodological guidance regarding how to best integrate
   qualitative observational case study data and quantitative large-N
   observational data in the study of public agencies in a mutually
   supportive way. There are a broad range of potential applications of
   mutually supportive mixed methods, which can be of help whenever one
   tool of inquiry (e.g., econometric analysis) suffers from weaknesses
   (e.g., omitted variables, measurement techniques which may not be
   unbiased, the inability to estimate important quantities of interest) to
   which another tool of inquiry (e.g., process tracing of case studies)
   does not. To demonstrate the broad relevance of mutually supportive
   mixed methods in public management scholarship, this article focuses on
   qualitative case studies as a way of addressing an econometric challenge
   of particular relevance to the field: accounting for the fixed features
   of units (e.g., agencies, or departments) in multiunit studies. The
   article's central points are illustrated using mixed method data on
   foreign aid agency management practice and agency performance outcomes.},

Abstract = {What does international hierarchy look like? The emerging literatures on
   hierarchy and international orders remain overwhelmingly focused on the
   contemporary era and on the great powers that comprise the top of the
   hierarchy. This article addresses that gap by examining diplomacy, war,
   and domestic politics in the premodern Vietnam-China relationship under
   the hierarchic tributary system. Specifically, we construct a unique
   data set of over 1,200 entries, which measures wars and other violence
   in the region from 1365 to 1789. The data revealed the stable and
   legitimate nature of tributary relations between formally unequal
   political units. The Vietnamese court explicitly recognized its unequal
   status in its relations with China through a number of institutions and
   norms. Vietnamese rulers also displayed very little military attention
   to their relations with China. Rather, Vietnamese leaders were clearly
   more concerned with quelling chronic domestic instability and managing
   relations with kingdoms to their south and west.},

Abstract = {This article explores the relationship between political memory, state
   ontological security, and populist movements after state death. When a
   state dies, ideological space opens up for new state agents to narrate a
   different version of the past, one that delegitimizes the ideological
   underpinning of the old state order and creates ontological insecurity
   in the new polity. Populism becomes an especially attractive ideology,
   as it feeds on a sense of insecurity at home and abroad. The argument is
   illustrated with the case study of transformed Holocaust remembrance
   after the death of Yugoslavia. Tracing the history of the Yugoslav
   memorial exhibition at Auschwitz, the article demonstrates ways in which
   post-Yugoslav Holocaust remembrance has focused on delegitimizing
   Yugoslavia's communist past, especially its antifascism. Once
   antifascism is removed from state political memory, political space
   opens up for a revival and ideological normalization of populist-and at
   its most extreme-fascist ideological movements in the present.},

Title = {When Is Science Used in Science Policy? Examining the Importance of
   Scientific and Technical Information in National Research Council
   Reports},
Journal = {REVIEW OF POLICY RESEARCH},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {36},
Number = {2},

Abstract = {A frequent lament among researchers is that public policy makers should
   pay more attention to scientific and technical information (STI). If
   there is any single area where one might expect STI to be used in public
   policy making and agenda setting it is in science and technology policy.
   Many of the policy makers in science and technology policy are
   themselves scientists or researchers and presumably would prove
   especially receptive to STI. However, STI is only one of many types of
   information used in policy making and policy actors often differ in the
   extent to which they view STI as credible, particularly compared to
   other types of potentially policy-relevant information. Research on
   credibility (the believability of information, information types, and
   media) has shown variance and policy makers' ``credibility maps.{''}
   Thus, some policy makers have preference for formal information
   generally and STI specifically, but others privilege raw data, personal
   experience, authority, history and anecdote, analogical reasoning, or
   conformance to ideology, to name just a few of the information choices.
   Here, we build on the current researchers' previous bibliometrics-based
   work and use data from 41 semi-structured elite interviews with National
   Research Council (NRC) executives and staff and NRC committee members
   concerning the use of STI in reports issued by the NRC. Findings show
   that the use of STI in NRC reports varies according to the nature of the
   inquiry and the sponsor. Information used in the reports is based on not
   only the assessed credibility of information but also its perceived
   direct relevance and the availability of STI as compared to other types
   of information. In general, the amount of STI in the NRC reports tends
   to have modest effects on the likelihood that reports will be used in
   policy making or by the mass media. More important factors include the
   timing of the report with respect to political agendas, the party
   requesting the report, and the enacted roles of NRC staff members and
   committee chairs.},

Abstract = {This article makes the case for taking fantasy seriously in IR. It
   argues for a Lacanian conception of fantasy as a type of desire-infused
   narrative through which subjects construct their social realities. The
   fantasy approach brings added value to the burgeoning IR literature on
   narratives and ontological security and develops it in multiple
   respects. First, it spells out the crucial, yet thus far rather implicit
   and unspecified role of desire in the functioning of narratives and in
   ontological security. Second, by introducing the notions of the `object'
   of desire and transgression, the fantasy framework allows us to trace
   the channelling of desire into discourse. This leads us to basic
   methodological tools that can capture the ways how exactly ontological
   security is sought through narratives, which have thus far been
   developed only sporadically. Third, by viewing the subject as always
   incomplete and ontological security as ultimately unattainable, the
   fantasy approach provides a critical, explicitly politicised corrective
   to the existing scholarship. Rather than promoting ontological security
   as an ideal, it calls for challenging the closure it imposes on our
   social reality. These arguments are developed theoretically and
   illustrated with the case of Germany's opposition to the Iraq war.},

Abstract = {In Peru, development dreams have not infrequently been hitched to the
   expansion of mining and other extractive activities. While the Peruvian
   state pursued strategies to stimulate mining expansion during the late
   nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, the geography of capitalist
   mining that emerged mapped poorly onto the national development
   imaginaries of the country's elites. State-led efforts to mobilize
   subsurface resources in the service of national-level development
   conflicted with the tendency for extractive economies to exhibit uneven
   and discontinuous spatialities. Attention to the long-run unevenness of
   extractive investment in global resource frontiers such as Peru promises
   to deepen understandings of both world environmental history and the
   contemporary politics of resource extractivism.},

Title = {Uncertainty, Shifting Power and Credible Signals in US-China Relations:
   Why the ``Thucydides Trap{''} Is Real, but Limited},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CHINESE POLITICAL SCIENCE},

Abstract = {Is conflict between a rising China and a declining United States
   inevitable? One of the main purported drivers of the Thucydides Trap is
   that declining states face intractable uncertainty about rising states'
   future intentions. Since a declining state cannot be sure how a rising
   state will use its power in the future, the decliner faces strong
   incentives to initiate preventive action, possibly war, to forestall the
   power shift, even if the rising state has behaved cooperatively to date.
   A common conclusion is therefore that preventive war is often
   unavoidable under large power shifts, even between states with truly
   compatible goals. Drawing on recently-published formal work, this paper
   argues that the uncertainty underpinning the Thucydides Trap is not as
   pervasive as conventional wisdom holds. Indeed, even under large power
   shifts, rising states' cooperative signals should be sufficiently
   credible that preventive war should not occur when the declining state
   is initially uncertain of the riser's intentions. Rather, preventive war
   should occur only if the declining state has high confidence that the
   riser's intentions are truly hostile. The analysis yields two main
   conclusions. First, China's cooperation has been sufficiently credible
   to avert preventive war, but not to avoid a substantial degree of
   competition with the US, which has rationally hedged against China's
   rising power. However, American observers have often misinterpreted the
   credibility of both cooperative and non-cooperative Chinese signals, and
   the current US government is far too confident that China harbors
   hostile intentions. This leaves open the possibility of a US-China war
   due to psychological misperceptions.},

Abstract = {Higher education is increasingly expected not only to provide students
   with disciplinary knowledge and skills but also to prepare them for a
   future career. As political science is a diverse discipline and does not
   train students for a certain profession, its students often feel
   uncertain of the career paths available to them and how their expertise
   can be used in a future career. In this article, we present and discuss
   the course `The Professional Political Scientist', given at the
   bachelor's level at the Department of Political Science at University of
   Gothenburg, Sweden, which is an attempt to fill this gap. We present the
   preparatory work, the design, the pedagogy behind the themes and
   exercises included in the curriculum, as well as the experiences and
   evaluations of the first three rounds of the course. Finally, we provide
   suggestions for teachers interested in developing similar courses.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this article is to explain the place of human rights in
   the foreign policy thinking of David Cameron's Conservatives
   (2005-2016). The article asks three interrelated questions: First, what
   role has human rights come to acquire in international political
   discourse? Second, did the Conservative Party's view on the place of
   human rights result in a change to their approach to foreign policy on
   humanitarian intervention? Third, to what extent was there a tension
   between increasing scepticism towards the Human Rights Act and the
   jurisdiction of the European Court of Human Rights and the Conservative
   Party's approach to foreign policy? The authors employ a mixed
   methodological approach which combines hermeneutic textual analysis of
   speeches from leading Conservatives with semi-structured, elite
   interview material from four former Conservative Foreign Secretaries.},

Abstract = {Scholarly efforts to understand conspiracy theories have grown
   significantly in recent years, and there is now a broad and
   interdisciplinary literature. In reviewing this body of work, we ask
   three specific questions. First, what factors are associated with
   conspiracy beliefs? Our review of the literature shows that conspiracy
   beliefs result from a range of psychological, political, and social
   factors. Next, how are conspiracy theories communicated? Here, we
   explain how conspiracy theories are shared among individuals and spread
   through traditional and social media platforms. Next, what are the
   societal risks and rewards associated with conspiracy theories? By
   focusing on politics and science, we argue that conspiracy theories do
   more harm than good. We conclude by suggesting several promising avenues
   for future research.},

Abstract = {This article is part of the special cluster titled Bukovina and
   Bukovinians after the Second World War: (Re)shaping and (re)thinking a
   region after genocide and `ethnic unmixing', guest edited by Gaelle
   Fisher and Maren Roger. This introductory essay provides an overview of
   the historiography of the borderland region of Bukovina after 1945 and
   1989-1991. Presenting the approaches adopted in different national
   contexts after the end of the Second World War, it points to the
   methodological nationalism which characterized research on the region
   during the Cold War. We show that while the historiography of Bukovina
   on the ground, in Romania and the Soviet Union, refracted wider national
   ideologies, abroad, particularly in West Germany and Israel, it remained
   for a long time the prerogative of small groups of ``Bukovinians,{''}
   who saw it as their ``lost home.{''} We explore both the similarities
   and differences between these narratives and stakeholders as well as the
   changes that took place after 1989-1991, especially in Romania and
   Ukraine. We show that while divided, the actors behind the narratives
   and thereby the narratives themselves have been connected in complex
   ways over the decades and particularly since the collapse of communism.
   Indeed, while for a long time the study of Bukovina resisted
   transnationalism, it nevertheless constituted and constitutes an
   ultimately transnational research object. Today, Bukovina remains a
   space of contest but it is also a space of opportunity, not least for
   researchers interested in the contested histories of borderland regions.
   This essay therefore contextualizes the themes and issues addressed in
   the following cluster of articles and identifies avenues for future
   research in this field.},

Abstract = {Arend Lijphart uses an average of five standardized variables - the
   executive-parties dimension (EPD) - to describe patterns of democracy
   and explain differences in democracies' performance. The article
   suggests ways to improve the descriptive part of the project. It argues
   that the EPD maps different approaches to achieving accountability and
   representation, rather than differences in consensus. This
   re-conceptualization leads to a more coherent and valid measurement. It
   is also argued that more systematic adjustments are needed for
   differences in constitutional structures (presidentialism and
   bicameralism). The article presents data on a revised EPD and its
   components for 36 democracies in the period from 1981 to 2010. As to the
   explanatory part of the project, we contend that the EPD often hinders
   adequate causal analysis rather than facilitating it. We show this by
   re-analysing democracies' performance with respect to turnout and
   capital punishment.},

Abstract = {This short essay aims at shedding some light on the use of lawfare as an
   emerging domain of full spectrum warfare which can either be used in its
   own right to achieve its own strategic objectives or as an enabler
   within the context of influencing the adversary in connection with
   well-planned Info-Ops and Stratcom operations. The authors conclude that
   considering the law as a domain, the use of lawfare is an ``Offset
   Strategy,{''} which will provide a considerable competitive advantage in
   the proper offensive and defensive applicability of law which will
   prevent potential adversaries to abuse the rule of law to achieve their
   own strategic objectives.},

Abstract = {The notion of `stability' and the practice of `stability operations'
   experienced a revival in the last decade. The paper shows how different
   actors (UN, NATO, US and European countries) have been using the concept
   `stability' in their recent doctrines. It then shows how as a
   multi-faceted notion stability can benefit from methodological
   pluralism, how actors adopt different and even conflicting meanings
   across a range of different cases and stability operations seem to carry
   troubling political and normative implications. In sum, this
   introductory essay specifies how the present collection contributes to
   the literature and the ongoing policy debate by dissecting the notions
   of stability and stability operations.},

Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL POLITICS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {28},
Number = {5},
Pages = {866-885},
Abstract = {The normative debate surrounding consumption-based emissions accounting,
   conceived of as a method for constructing national emissions
   inventories, is investigated. The focus is to examine whether such
   accounting would be more just than the current method of
   production-based accounting. It is argued that there is no good reason
   to think that consumption-based accounting would be less just, and some
   reason to think that it would be more just. The consequences of this for
   the overall question of whether to adopt consumption-based accounting
   are also investigated.},

Journal = {AFRICAN AFFAIRS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {118},
Number = {470},
Pages = {49-74},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {From inauspicious beginnings in a post-socialist, highly dysfunctional
   financial system, Angolan banking grew in less than a decade after the
   end of the country's long civil war into one of Africa's largest.
   Fuelled by the country's oil boom, banks became crucial in articulating
   Angola's interactions with the international system as well as a
   domestic agenda of oligarchic consolidation by the ruling MPLA's elite.
   This article describes and analyses this growth trajectory in its
   historical and institutional context and seeks to understand the reasons
   why it did not lead to either a significant expansion of credit outside
   the elite or a contribution towards economic diversification outside the
   oil sector. Important as a study of the political economy of finance in
   Africa's third largest economy, the article also contributes to the
   growing literature on the nexus between banking and politics in
   resource-rich states.},

Abstract = {How do individuals' personal experiences with various aspects of
   political violence affect their attitudes toward hosting conflict
   refugees? More specifically, how do their personal exposure to violence,
   their own personal experience of being displaced, and their recent
   contact with refugees influence these attitudes? To explore answers to
   these questions, we draw upon a recent survey of 2,400 Lebanese
   residents where we identify individuals who experienced violence during
   the Lebanese civil war (1975-90), those forced to flee their homes
   during that conflict, and those who enjoy recent contact with Syrian
   immigrant and/or displaced populations. We examine whether these
   distinct experiences affect respondents' regard for members of the
   Syrian refugee population. Results demonstrate that historical exposure
   to violence and experience of displacement have no discernible impact on
   individual attitudes toward hosting refugees. We find much stronger
   evidence that attitudes are associated with whether individual
   respondents have had contact with Syrians in Lebanon; those with such
   interactions are significantly more likely to support hosting refugees,
   to consider hiring a refugee, or to allow one of their children to marry
   a refugee. Our findings suggest exposure to violence by itself does not
   correlate to positive sentiments toward refugees, especially over time.
   Further, finding ways to create positive contact between refugees and
   native populations may be associated with improving attitudes and
   relations between the two populations.},

Abstract = {Instead of alternative economic ideas or institutional shifts, the
   post-financial crisis conjuncture has witnessed the persistence of
   neoliberal ideas and the strengthening of the institutions implementing
   them. Instructed by ideational institutionalism, this article analyzes
   the interplay between ideas and institutions by examining the public
   debate on economic policy in Finland during the euro crisis. We show how
   ideas formed by the dominant institutions of Finnish economic
   policy-making dominated the debate in the leading Finnish newspaper
   Helsingin Sanomat in the years 2009?2014. The media and the elites
   coalesced around a consensus built by the Ministry of Finance and EU
   institutions, which demanded austerity and structural reforms to the
   Finnish economy. Our findings support claims that established
   institutional forces prevent ideational shifts even during major crisis
   periods. The media takes part in this through its unwillingness to
   provide alternative viewpoints on consensual political issues, thus
   strengthening a post-democratic public sphere.},

Abstract = {This article assesses the effects of common features in the indirect
   election of presidents in parliamentary republics. In particular, it
   examines the influence of majority requirements, selectorate composition
   and uncertainty on party strategies, using Estonia (1996-2016) as a
   crucial case for analysis. The analysis demonstrates that the lack of a
   plurality run-off effectively eliminated incentives for inter-party
   cooperation and strategic voting. It furthermore shows that shifts in
   the partisan composition and control of the selectorate from parliament
   to electoral college provided considerable opportunities for agenda
   manipulation. Subsequently, results only rarely reflected the
   parliamentary balance of power. Last, although overall indicators
   suggest greater congruence between parliament and electoral college over
   time, this proliferated rather than reduced parties' uncertainty over
   the electoral outcome as non-parliamentary electors voted based on local
   interests and acted independently from national party leaders.},

Abstract = {The article presents NATO as a self-aware and confident organisation
   that takes measured steps to enhance the cyber security of the Alliance
   as a whole. I reassert the notion that in spite of cyber defence not
   featuring on the top of the agenda in the early 2000s due to the effects
   of 9/11, the subsequent wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, and the 2004 NATO
   enlargement process, after the 2007 attacks on Estonia and their
   post-mortem analysis the Alliance has been able to define priorities for
   this particular area and to significantly decrease the deficit by taking
   substantial but measured steps to rectify the situation it found itself
   in. The summits of 2014, 2016 and 2018 are identified as the most
   important in terms of NATO's development in this area.},

Title = {Varieties of reconciliation in violent contexts: lessons from Colombia},
Journal = {PEACEBUILDING},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {7},
Number = {3, SI},
Pages = {329-352},
Abstract = {Most countries emerging from armed conflict in the past three decades
   have actively addressed the question of reconciliation. However,
   confusion remains as to what reconciliation means to different people,
   to what extent meaning is contingent on demographic and socioeconomic
   factors, whether and how people's experience with conflict shapes views
   and attitudes relevant for reconciliation, and how reconciliation
   intersects with other ongoing and parallel social processes. In this
   paper, we combine quantitative and qualitative findings on these
   questions based on the case of Colombia. We conclude that the study and
   promotion of reconciliation should not be restricted to societies
   haunted by armed conflict, as violence-related social divisions are
   widespread beyond conflict contexts. Second, when analysed from a
   broader perspective, the path towards reconciliation requires a more
   fine-tuned understanding of how meanings and mechanisms differ,
   reflecting variation in the contexts of violence.},

Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL POLITICS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {28},
Number = {7},
Pages = {1167-1191},
Abstract = {Scholars of environmental market-based policy instruments (MBIs), such
   as cap-and-trade and biodiversity offsetting programs, have extensively
   documented MBI's market-like features, including the ways they
   incentivize producing environmental quality, risk subordinating nature
   protection to capital accumulation, and are supported by state-driven
   projects of market-building ('re-regulation'). A less emphasized
   dimension of MBIs is examined: the ways these institutions are founded
   upon a substantial thickening of state infrastructural power, which
   amounts to expanding state control over economic and environmental life
   in ways that outstrip processes of reregulation. Appreciating the
   linkages between MBIs and expanding state control over environmental
   quality may help explain routine conservative resistance to these policy
   developments. Affinities between MBIs and regulatory thickening also
   call into question the degree to which MBIs should be thought of as
   `liberalizing' policy instruments and suggests that, perhaps
   counterintuitively, the growth of MBIs may present new opportunities for
   expanding public control over environmental quality.},

Journal = {CONTEMPORARY SECURITY POLICY},

Pages = {409-434},
Abstract = {The notion of a ``global nuclear order{''} has entered the lexicon of
   nuclear politics. The 2017 Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons
   has prompted further questions about how we understand it. Yet missing
   from analysis of nuclear order and the ``Ban Treaty{''} is a critical
   analysis of the power relations that constitute that order. This article
   develops a critical account of global nuclear order by applying Robert
   Cox's concept of hegemony and power to the global politics of nuclear
   weapons, drawing on the politics of the Ban Treaty. It theorizes a
   ``nuclear control order{''} as a hegemonic structure of power, one that
   has been made much more explicit through the negotiation of the Ban
   Treaty. This fills a void by taking hegemony and power seriously in
   theorizing nuclear order, as well as explaining both the meaning of the
   Ban Treaty and its limits.},

Pages = {207-225},
Abstract = {Multiple ways of legitimating policy in a multi-level system of states
   are now creating cross-level challenges to European Union (EU) policies.
   At the national level referendums are challenging EU policies by
   claiming that demands arising from a direct democratic ballot have the
   highest legitimacy. By contrast, the EU legitimates its policies by
   means of the legal rationality of the policymaking process established
   by international treaties and confirmed by the representative
   credentials of the European Parliament and member state governments
   endorsing its actions in the European Council. Referendums are no longer
   held to confirm a national government's decision to become an EU member
   state. There has been a paradigm shift since 2005; most votes in
   countries are holding EU referendums have rejected policies approved by
   their elected representatives. The EU has successfully responded using
   strategies that involve legal coercion; instrumental calculations;
   secondary concessions; and avoidance of the risk of a referendum veto
   through differential integration. However, the legal legitimation of an
   EU policy without frustration by national referendums does not ensure
   policy effectiveness.},

Abstract = {The article aims to explore the main trends in German participation in
   United Nations (UN) peacekeeping operations. Special attention is
   devoted to the period since 2014 when top German political
   representatives announced an increased willingness to step up German
   engagement in international affairs. Soon after, Germany shifted from a
   rather hesitant UN peacekeeper to the most significant European troop
   provider to UN peacekeeping operation in Mali (MINUSMA). The increased
   involvement of Germany in MINUSMA as a new trend is discussed.},

Abstract = {This article draws on critical feminist theorising and post-colonial
   theories of the body, relatedness, vulnerability and the everyday to
   offer an alternative framing of peace and suggest a new research agenda.
   Although there are multiple ontologies in feminist peace theory, the
   concern for marginalisation and the understanding of the relational and
   vulnerable nature of human existence are the key contributions that
   enable a new take on mundane practices of peace. The article argues that
   traditional ways of thinking about peace ignore the notion that peace is
   best studied as an event that arises within mundane and corporeal
   encounters. Furthermore, the article provides a novel take on eventness
   that centers peace in the lives of ordinary people, and develops the
   concept of choreography as a means to grasp the richness and fluidity of
   the everyday techniques of interaction that are relevant for peace.},

   {[}Anonymous], Notice that the problem just described arises even if the exercise of power imposes no further costs on the subject. Using me to pursue an- others projects (absent some of the special conditions discussed earlier) disrespects my status as an independent moral agent, quite apart from any more concrete harm I suffer as a result..

   {[}Anonymous], On Authority, Legitimacy, and Service.
   {[}Anonymous], In answering this question I am, as I said earlier, setting aside cases where C has consented to A's acting for C.
   {[}Anonymous], Whether it also extends to cases where the applicable law fails to properly reflect the parties' moral entitlements depends on whether that law is morally authoritative for the subjects.
   {[}Anonymous], The Morality of Freedom.
   {[}Anonymous], There is an ambiguity here worth flagging: I mean to say both that the legislators qua individuals do not owe such compensation, and that the legislators qua legislators or, better, the legislature as a body does not owe compensation, though it does (as the next paragraph explains) have an obligation to seek a fair distribution of benefits and burdens over time, and so must seek to include, among the considerations on which it makes future decisions, facts about past decisions and their distributive effects..
   {[}Anonymous], This is not to say that working out the details of its application to institutions does not pose a number of challenges. To mention just one: Institutions serve many people simultaneously, and so one needs an ac- count of what an agent ought to do when acting for several beneficiaries at once, especially when their interests arent neatly aligned..
   {[}Anonymous], Someone might in fact suggest that C does not owe such compen- sation precisely because A had a duty to rescue C: The duty reflects the fact that A could be asked to bear a certain burden for the sake of rescu- ing C; and so A is not entitled to have the burden relieved by subsequent compensation. But, as discussed earlier, that A must bear the burden of rescue if the alternative is to impose a much greater burden on C (letting C drown) does not show that A must bear it if the alternative is to impose that very same burden on C (by requiring C to compensate A for his loss). Whether A has a duty to rescue, and whether A is entitled to compensa- tion for the loss borne when fulfilling the duty, are separate questions.
   {[}Anonymous], Let me flag that I do not take these approaches to be competitors so much as alternative, and in principle compatible, attempts to articulate normative claims central to familiar legal and political institutions and practices. So, in offering this third account of legitimacy, my aim is not to supplant but rather to supplement existing discussions of the normative features that are central to, and important for understanding the struc- ture of, such institutions and practices.
   {[}Anonymous], And, ordinarily, only on some of these: Legitimate power tends to be circumscribed by subject matter, for reasons that I cannot discuss here.
   {[}Anonymous], Authority and ReasonGiving.
   {[}Anonymous], I leave it open here whether Defendant has a moral claim against Plaintiff. On the one hand, I think it is clear that Defendant has a duty to pay up, and also a duty not to enforce whatever claim she may have.

Title = {How to improve parenting in Hong Kong by training: the 6As Positive
   Parenting Program},
Journal = {PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION AND POLICY-AN ASIA-PACIFIC JOURNAL},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {22},
Number = {1},
Pages = {55-70},
Abstract = {Purpose - Research suggests that children in Hong Kong are at an
   elevated risk of emotional problems. Authoritarian parenting, a common
   parenting style in Hong Kong, is a critical factor associated with
   childhood mental health problems. The purpose of this paper is to
   evaluate the effectiveness of the 6As Positive Parenting Program (6As)
   in modifying parenting attitudes, reduction of parenting stress and
   increasing self-efficacy in positive parenting, among a sample of 82
   Hong Kong parents. 6As focuses on prevention by instilling positive
   parenting beliefs and principles, thereby reducing reliance on
   authoritarian and related parenting styles.
   Design/methodology/approach - The program was evaluated using a
   controlled pre-post-treatment design. Outcome measures were the Chinese
   Child-rearing Beliefs Questionnaire, Parental Stress Scale, Parenting
   Self-efficacy Scale and participant feedback. ANOVA and correlation were
   utilized to detect treatment effects and relationships between the
   degree of change among measures and subscales.
   Findings - Relative to the control group, the 6As Positive Parenting
   Program significantly changed parents' parenting attitudes, reduced
   parenting stress and increased self-efficacy in positive parenting. In
   sum, 97.6 percent of the participants agreed that the program is a good
   fit for the Hong Kong culture.
   Research limitations/implications - A larger sample would have been
   desirable for this study. One factor that limited analyzable data was
   that some of the participating organizations enrolled participants into
   the program who did not meet research inclusion criteria. Furthermore,
   the size of groups varied from 5 to 16 participants, which may have
   produced different group dynamics that added variability to outcomes.
   Future 6As parenting program research should attempt to standardize
   group size or to directly compare the effectiveness of smaller vs larger
   groups. Furthermore, as noted earlier, the research was conducted during
   the primary school application period, which may have heightened the
   parenting stress for parents of younger children.
   Practical implications - The results suggest that an enhanced belief in
   authoritative, autonomy and training strategies could reduce parental
   stress and shift parents' attitude toward a more positive approach in
   child-rearing.
   Social implications - There is considerable need for a holistically
   designed parenting training that is culturally credible and sensitive.
   Originality/value - Findings suggest that positive parenting can enhance
   the parent-child relationship and reduce parental stress. The results
   support governmental, non-governmental organizational and community
   focus on positive practices for parenting training in Hong Kong.},

   psychological studies, we aim to contribute to emerging research on
   attitudes toward international courts. We expect that group attachments
   will drive attitudes toward international institutions. Yet, we also
   theorize that exposure to violence makes individuals more likely to
   support international justice and reject narratives that would have the
   effect of insulating those who have committed crimes from being held
   accountable. Using new survey data from 507 Kenyans in the fall of 2015,
   we find support for our hypotheses.},

Abstract = {Focusing on the 2013 general elections in the electoral fief of the
   Sharif dynasty, this article seeks to account for the localised absence
   of violence and fraud that year. Here the clientelistic networks of
   Sharif's party facilitated the re-election of a family member, and
   enabled the party to dispense with thuggish tactics. But this
   pacification is not solely reducible to the logic of patronage. Force
   now had to be projected within the idiom of modern political rituals.
   Through performances and the saturation of public space, the party was
   able to extract political potency and to reproduce its position of
   dominance.},
